         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

gives notice of in his
Advertisement, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know to be true.
For it is about two years ago,
that the perusal of this <hi>Answer</hi>
of his, in M. S. was offered me;
but I was then wholly taken up
in writing my <hi>Enchiridium Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicum,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34037:3"/>
but yet promised that if
he thought he had said any
thing that he in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
judged to be material
against my <hi>Antidote</hi> and would
publish it, I would lay all aside
and Answer it forthwith so
soon as it should come out.
And whereas I was Informed
that his language in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
was not so civil to me, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this also, that my Reply to
him should be without the least
ill word, but be made onely to
matter of Argument. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since this Answer is come
out, besides other Obligations,
I am by vertue of my Promise
obliged to Reply to it; as also
with the least offensive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that may be. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb facs="tcp:34037:3"/>
I hope I have abundantly
performed.</p>
            <p>But there is a passage or two
more in his Advertisement that
I cannot but take notice of, as
where he saith, <hi>But now whereas,
besides Dr.</hi> More, <hi>Dr.</hi> Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet
<hi>hath thought it not below his name
and abilities to descend to the like foul
and injurious Calumnies, in his late book
Concerning the Idolatry practised in the
Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I grant if
they were Calumnies it would
be a very vile condescension in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in either of us to debase
our selves so low, as to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of so great a wickedness.
But when you speak of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
below my Learned friends
abilities to descend to such a
charge, methinks it seems to
<pb facs="tcp:34037:4"/>
imply, that any man of meaner
Parts might easily make that
charge good, you being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
guilty thereof. Or as
if you would complement us
out of the strongest hold that
we have, <hi>viz.</hi> this just and true
charge of Idolatry; that quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Castle you might the
easilyer, as you think, take hold
of us for Schismaticks and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us back captive again into
that Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi>
But this charge being true, as
most certainly it is, it can be
neither below the dignity of
my worthy friend Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi>
nor any one else, to insist
thereon, unless it be below any
ones person to indeavour the
saving of multitudes of Souls
<pb facs="tcp:34037:4"/>
from eternal death, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of many innocent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
men from those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Cruelties your Religion
exercises upon them, when you
get power to do it with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
See the Preface of my
Idea of Antichristianism, <hi>Sect.</hi>
4. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And whereas he says, He
thinks the <hi>publishing of this his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
seasonable for the undeceiving of
the many unfortunately misguided Souls,
whose leaders (to speak favourably)
seem not to understand what themselves
Object;</hi> it is a <hi>Dilemma</hi> of two hard
Imputations, that pretends to
gore us one way or other; as
if we were either such disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
persons as to speak against
our own Consciences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb facs="tcp:34037:5"/>
we have reason when we
know we have none, (which
were it not the fault of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Controversies betwixt us
would soon cease, &amp; you would
be no longer able to deceive the
people) or else were at least very
silly fellows, and understood
not what we say. Which my
Reply, I hope, will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confute, and undeceive those
unfortunately misguided Souls,
which your arts and slights
have really imposed upon. But
for us, how can we mislead any,
who send them to the ancient,
Primitive and Apostolick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and such as your selves
cannot deny to be true? We
lead them onely from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb facs="tcp:34037:5"/>
and corruptions that since
have crept into the Church.
But thus you bemoan and weep
over poor deludible Souls,
whom you would make Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,
till you have devoured
them.</p>
            <p>What you threaten of abler
pens against Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> and
boast of your own performance
against Dr. <hi>More,</hi> as if there
were nothing in Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi>
on this Subject, but what might
be Answered out of this of
yours against my self; when it
shall so manifestly appear that
your Answer is so insufficient
to weaken any of the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of my Charge of Idolatry
against your Church, certainly
then it will be easily concluded,
<pb facs="tcp:34037:6"/>
that it can do no execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his. And then for your
threatening of abler pens, I do
not fear their being overpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
to the Ability of the
Person they shall grapple with;
Whose vigour of Youth, Wit,
Parts, and copious Reading and
Learning, might make him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
heartily wish for such an
Encounter.</p>
            <q>Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte
leonem.</q>
            <p>I pass now to my Antagonists
<hi>Preface</hi> or <hi>Introduction,</hi> I know not
whether to call it. But I had
almost forgotten his Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
<hi>A brief Answer to the many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
of Dr.</hi> Henry More, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Which language is too too
<pb facs="tcp:34037:6"/>
harsh and false. I might indeed
truly have intitled <hi>my</hi> Book, <hi>A
Brief Reply to the many Cavils,</hi> &amp;c.
but I thought it not so advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
because the firmness and
solidity of my <hi>Replies</hi> to his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers</hi>
do perpetually demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
them to be but <hi>Cavils</hi> no
true <hi>Answers</hi> to my charge. But
it was the great prudence of my
Adversary to call my charges
of Idolatry upon their Church,
<hi>Calumnies,</hi> because he might be
conscious to himself that his
<hi>Answers</hi> to my Charges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he would transform them
into <hi>Calumnies,</hi> were so weak and
dilute, and my Replies to them
might be so strong, that unless
himself called them Calumnies
the slow witted people might
<pb facs="tcp:34037:7"/>
not easily take them to be so, no
more than they can tell what
to make of a bad picture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the name be writ under it, a
Cock or a Cow, or the like.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more
that I shall take notice of in the
Title-page, which is the omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to set his Name to his
Book; so that I am as it were to
combate with a Spectre in the
dark. I could never learn any
more concerning my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than that he was a Doctor of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For what
reasons he conceals his name I
know not, I suppose he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of the Cause he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
and I speak ingenuously
and as I think the Cause need
not be ashamed of such an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
<pb facs="tcp:34037:7"/>
so far as I can judge of
him by his performance. For it
is the Fate and nature of this
Cause, that no man can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it by Truth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to bring a true Argument
against us in defense of it, would
be to bring an impertinent one.
For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, Truth
always agrees with, never
clashes with Truth, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
has noted. And therefore it is
not to be imputed to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Antagonist, but of
his Cause, that with undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
evidence I have perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
confuted his Answers;
though I believe he has brought
as good as the Cause is capable
of, and managed them and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled
them with such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial
<pb facs="tcp:34037:8"/>
Rhetorical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
slights and tricks, to
make something of nothing,
and to make a show of Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and confuting me, that I
must freely confess he is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Artist in that <hi>Roman</hi> Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
whereby they become
cunning Anglers for poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
Souls. And thus much
in short upon his <hi>Title-page</hi> and
<hi>Advertisement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
which I shall cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so many Paragraphs, and
so Answer them in order.</p>
            <div type="extract">
               <head>Paragraph the first.</head>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> is a Person whose
Learning and Parts have brought him
into a name, among the Professors of
<pb facs="tcp:34037:8"/>
the refined Arts and Sciences. Fame
speaks him a great Philosopher, And
his Publick works are said to avouch
no less. Nay some have passed so far
in favour of his Character as to term
him, The great Restorer of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick
Cabbala.</hi> And truly,
if this be so, I conceive the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had done himself a great deal of
right, if he had still kept to his own
Element; for as much as his late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
ingaging in Controversial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
cannot but prove a blot to his
former undertakings: For the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Dr. <hi>More</hi> the <hi>Controvertist,</hi> is

                  <p>Here<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> observe the art and
<pb facs="tcp:34037:9"/>
smooth cunning of my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
who drives at these two

notwithstanding the

am not altogether nothing in
matters of Philosophy, but
have writ with some success and

that he thus seeming so impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and indifferent a man, and
so readily acknowledging any
thing well done by me, he may
the more easily be believed
where he gives judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, and says, That
though I be something succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
indeed in Philosophy, yet
I am very unlucky and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:34037:9"/>
in Theological Disputes,
a tolerable <hi>Philosopher,</hi> but a very
mean <hi>Controvertist</hi> in points of
Divinity. The other drift is,
to make me, if it were possible,
to melt and relent, that I have
thus lessened my credit in the
world by my unfortunately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageing
in Controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as if he bemoaned my
misfortune therein; who if I
had kept to my own Element
of Philosophy, might have been
gratious and acceptable with
all the world, with the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
party as well as vvith the
reformed, and kept up my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
in force with all, when as
now I have hugely impaired my
repute, at least with those of his
Party.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:34037:10"/>
But to the first I Answer,
That though this Intimation of
his own Impartiality be crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough managed, yet that
general acknowledged Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my suffering in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
is a witness against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
For if I have been so usefull
and succesfull in my <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
demonstrations of the <hi>existence</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Immaterial Beings,</hi> in
the vindication of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
in the proving of the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul,</hi> and in finding the
ancient <hi>Iudaical Cabbala,</hi> (which
the <hi>Platonick Philosophy</hi> is so near
akin to,) so artificially couched
in the Text of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the
like, all which tend to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and safety of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, the same clearness
<pb facs="tcp:34037:10"/>
of sight which helps me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and judge of these things,
cannot but inable me to judge
also in those concerning points
that are betwixt you and us; As
that eye that can see one colour
right, is not confined to that
colour, but by the same faculty
and soundness of sight can see
another. And it is more my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialness
and unprejudiced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than any thing else that
makes me see so clearly and so
truely in any thing.</p>
                  <p>As to the second, my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
has suggested no more, nor
so much as I have diverse times
reflected upon my self, and
was well aware of before I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
with these kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies:
namely that it
<pb facs="tcp:34037:11"/>
would lessen my repute and
favour with many. But <hi>if I seek
to please men, how shall I be the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Iesus Christ,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. And as
for the business of Repute and
Esteem in the world, I thank
God I am convinced even from
my very Heart and Soul, that
I ought to be utterly dead to
all <hi>Self-joy</hi> and <hi>Self-gloriation,</hi> and
therefore if any thing happen
cross to that life, that ought to
be mortified in me, if it moves
me not, I am at peace; if it
does, it is yet the gift of God
to me, and I am admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby to advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>r
into that death, by the
power and Spirit of Christ, that
will at length lay asleep all such
<pb facs="tcp:34037:11"/>
disturbances in my Soul for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
And there are greater
matters than the esteem of men,
which I am not insensible, but
have always been well aware
that I run the hazard of, and
such as that wisdom, which is
according to the Spirit of this
world, sets the greatest esteem
of all upon. But this I thank
God could never affright me
into the neglect of so undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
a duty, as the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so important truth, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
clear to my self, and
of so unspeakable consequence
for the Church of God, and
for the settling of a true
grounded peace in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, That there might
be truely one flock and one
<pb facs="tcp:34037:12"/>
Sheepfold, and Jesus Christ the
true Shepherd over all; which
cannot be till such Barbarous
and Idolatrous Laws and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be reversed as obtain still
in the Papacy. But for my part,
my great Fort and Shelter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Inconveniences
I expose my self to, by my just
liberty of speech, is to keep as
near as I can in that frame of
spirit which our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to us in that Precept of
his, <hi>Matth. 5. 44. Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
bless them that curse you, do good
to them that hate you, and pray for them
that despightfully use you and persecute
you. Father forgive them for they know
not what they do,</hi> Luk. 23. 34. This
is the Sanctuary I desire to take
shelter in, even in that ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:34037:12"/>
profound and humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of unself-interessed Love,
which I infinitely prefer before
all the keenness of wit and

of this world, that so subtily
shifts for it self, which I envy
no mans use or injoyment of,
may but my Soul sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
with this lovely Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our Lord Jesus Christ, may
that be the lot of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanec,
both in this life and for

of the seven Epistles to the seven

is of a pure Romantick strain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Authours fancy being broken
loose from the command of Reason,
and leaping over all boundaries of
Church-Authority, and the faith of
his Ancestors, runs on at eleven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score,

                  <p>This is indeed a pretty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Rhetorical career, but
what it would affirm in plain
English is this, That my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb facs="tcp:34037:13"/>
of the Epistles to the
seven Churches is but a mere
phancy. And the Arguments
he offers at to prove his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are these, That it is against
Church-Authority, against the
Faith of our Ancestors, and that
I have brought no Reasons to
prove it. As to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Church, there was
never any general Council, nor
any other that I know, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
declared that such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
sense as I have given of
these seven Epistles is false,
nor for any doctrine that
clashes with any thing supposed
in my Exposition, while the
Church continued Symmetral,
I mean before her Apostasy.
But in that the ancient Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:34037:14"/>
declared, upon the removal <hi>of
that which hindereth, 2 Thes.</hi> 2. 6. that
the Apostasy of the Church
would insue, and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Antichrist, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
also the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> of the
intireness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
that is consonant to my Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those seven Epistles and
to the assigned Interval of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now in that he insinuates
I have brought no Reason for
my Exposition, I think I have
brought no less then demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
for it. And I think any
one that has a Genius to read
and judge of such things will
easily acknowledge it upon
the considerate perusal of my
Exposition, and serious pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb facs="tcp:34037:14"/>
the tenth Chapter,
wherein the strength thereof
is more briefly represented.
If we can in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Anatomy in the body of
an Animal, observing how all
the parts conspire to one end,
(the convenient functions of
life for such an Animal,) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Providence therein;
certainly upon taking notice,
that the whole frame of all
these Epistles and the order of
them, the notations of the
proper names not excepted, do
all intirely tend (as all the flesh
of an Animal is made into mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
for fit and due motions
for that Animal) to set out
the state of the Church in seven
intire Intervals from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:34037:15"/>
to the end, this is as certain
a sign that these Epistles are
such a Divine Prediction or
Prophecy, as such an Anatomy
is of such a piece of Divine
Providence in that Creature.</p>

Rhetorick called Railing. His

much dirt, which he throws too boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
upon persons which never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it at his hands. His Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of Speech or Scripture
phrase, applied to things that
are true, that is that which
makes it both harsh and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to those that are friends
to falshood. And this it is
which they call Railing: Such
as when I call Idolatry, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Pagan-like Idolatry,
Pagan-like Idolatry, and the
unjust and cruel killing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

But that it should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly

one of the main characters of a

so to do amongst Christians.
And why is my phrase said to be
rough and clogged with much
dirt, but that it expresses such
things as are scabrous and dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A Poet or Painter describing
a Leper or a man newly taken
up out of a pit of mire, if their
pens or pencils describe true, by
you they must be called rough
or clogged with much dirt or
mire. In the mean time it is a
sad case that the constitution of
<pb facs="tcp:34037:16"/>
your Religion is such that we
cannot set it down in proper
and significant language but
we must seem to rail at you in
your own judgements, though
we speak onely the Truth. And
for his talking of my throwing
dirt upon persons, For my part
I have no personal controversie
with any, but onely declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the corruptness of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Religion, with which
they indeavour to infect the
people, and against their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
in particular. Which I
do out of a spirit of common
charity both to them and our
selves, wishing not the least
hurt to them in any regard,
but being ready to serve them
in what is fit and in my power
<pb facs="tcp:34037:17"/>
to serve them, in any thing.</p>
                  <p>My Objections indeed are
bold because I have clear truth
on my side, but they can seem
uncivil and irreligious onely
to your selves, because it is a
ruffling as it were, by rude
reason, of your trim Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in your superstitious<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and
Idolatrous Worship which you
call Religion. But as for the
deep Tincture of <hi>Geneva,</hi> I am as
much a stranger to it as to <hi>Rome,</hi>
but ready to receive of either
any usefull truth I am as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted

has prefixed his Name to the Book

                  <p>The brief account of this
long Paragraph is this: That
he would make his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there is nothing but
my Name, my degree in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb facs="tcp:34037:18"/>
and the confidence of
my affirming those things
whereof in my Antidote I do
pronounce, that makes my
Book taken notice of, but that
it would be of it self the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most worthless thing
that ever was penned. Which
if it be so, my Antagonist has
had a fair opportunity with
ease to raise his Trophies on
so great a Name, as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to call it, and so mean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
And my Arguments
being so plain, and such as are
not above the meanest Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if his Answers are as plain
and bear covincing truth with
them, he need not fear but he
will take away all the credit

he says my Antidote has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
amongst my vulgar Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
to the irreparable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of their Souls. But in the
mean time that is either pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or unskilfully insinuated; As
if there could be no zeal against
Idolatry but it must be a sign of
a vulgar Spirit, (so gentile a
thing is it in contempt of God
and his holy Commandments
to complement Idols or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages)
or as if their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
from or fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Idolatry could be any

not onely those that have a

                  <p>This is fine Rhetorick again,
and an high boast, as if he could

firmness of my demonstrations
to a mere Nullity. Some men

others think they can batter

though built on Rocks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have nothing

But it is a pious design he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes,
as if it were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of Souls not to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
heedfull how they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Idolatry; or as if I could
<pb facs="tcp:34037:21"/>
seek by pernicious wiles to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them into the ancient
pure Apostolick way, unto that
faith and practise which was
in use and the known way to
Heaven before that grand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasy
into these gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
seized the Church. And
why should any Soul be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of being deceived by me,
when I show them no other
way then what upon a free and
impartial search I find to be
true and go in my self, driving
on no worldly Interest at all

all men should be saved and

Idolatry, being true, prove
odious to you, but that you
hate the light that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you, because your deeds
are evil. But for drawing any
such Charge against my own
Church, I am so far from it,
that I have clearly Vindicated

her from all suspition of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,

know I what common Mother
you and I can have, unless you
would become a Convert to
the Truth, and forsake all the
gross corruptions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

For so we may be both mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

shall bring the bare edge of his
Objections against my Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote

which I suppose will be less
tedious to the Reader. For if I
should bring in such things as
are not essential to the Cause,
I must also be so impertinent
as to Answer them, and so we
shall make so long a story of
it betwixt us that the Reader
<pb facs="tcp:34037:23"/>
may fall asleep before he gets

or Paragraphs of them,

little tedious, and it may be
more pleasant than if I had
done all along as some do in
their own Treatises, raise Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
at the end of each
Chapter, or upon each Point,
and so Answer them.</p>
                  <p>And I will assure thee, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that with all possible

faithfulness and to my best skill
I have represented the utmost
strength of his Answers where
I have not brought his Text

any doubt, his Book is not
great so that thou maist satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy scrupulosity at a very
reasonable rate.</p>
                  <p>As for his harsh language to
me, I very seldom take notice
of it in my <hi>Replies,</hi> nor will I
here concern my self to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
any specimens of it. For
I have no mind to quarrel but
onely to defend the Truth, let
people reproach my Person as
they please, and am at perfect
peace with my Adversary, even
while I am inforced to enter

this Combate with him. Of
which I desire thee, Reader,
to be a diligent and impartial
Spectator. For there is not a
more material point can be
controverted, nor of greater

than this charge of
Idolatry upon the Church of

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">what is Idolatry according to Divine Declaration.</head>
               <p>1. THere are two ways in general of discovering
what is or ought to be held to be Idolatry
amongst Christians; the one, Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>laration,
the other, clear and perspicuous
Reasons: Which though they may haply reach the one no
farther than the other, that is to say, that whatsoever may
be concluded to be Idolatry by Divine Declaration, the
same may also by unprejudiced Reason, and <hi>vice versÃ¢</hi>
yet their joint concurrence of Testimony is a greater as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to us of the Truth; and two cords twisted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
are stronger than either single. Wherefore we
will make use of both, and begin with Divine Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
first.</p>
               <p>2. The first Conclusion therefore shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e, That as in
civil Governments it is the Right of the Supreme Power
to define and declare what shall be or be held to be
Treason, and punishable as such: so it is most manifestly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34037:26"/>
the Right of God <hi>Almighty,</hi> who is also infinitely <hi>good</hi>
and <hi>wise,</hi> to define and declare to his people what shall
be or be held to be Idolatry, which is a kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against God, or <hi>crimen laesaa majesta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>is Divinae.</hi> And
what is thus declared Idolatry by God is to be held by us
to be such, though the Ludicrousness and Fugitiveness of
our wanton Reason might otherwise find out many start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-holes
and fine pretences to excuse this thing or that
action from so foul an Imputation.</p>
               <p>But as in civil affairs the declaring such and such things
to be Treason, does in a Political sense make them so
<hi>ipso facto;</hi> so God's declaring such and such things to be
Idolatry, they do to us <hi>ipso facto</hi> become Idolatry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y:
though to an ordinary apprehension, perhaps, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this would have seemed Treason, nor that Idolatry,
without these antecedent Declarations. But where the
Law-giver is <hi>infallible,</hi> there is all the reason in the world
we should submit not onely to his Power, but to his
Judgement in the Definitions of things, and rest sure that
that is Idolatry which he has thought fit to declare
so to be.</p>
               <p>3. The second Conclusion; That what is declared
Idolatry by God to the <hi>Iews</hi> ought to be acknowledged
Idolatry by us <hi>Christians.</hi> The ground of this Conclusion
is fixed in the nature of the Christian Religion. For <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
being a far more spiritual Religion than that of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism,</hi>
and therefore abhorring from all Superstition, there
cannot be the least Relaxation to the most rancid of all
Superstitions, Idolatry it self. Wherefore whatsoever
was accounted Idolatry amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a Divine Law, must be reckoned much more such
under <hi>Christianity,</hi> there being not the least pretence for
any Relaxation.</p>
               <p>Besides, there was nothing under the <hi>Iews</hi> (or can
by any people be) rightly deemed Idolatry, but it is
carefully enough cautioned against and plainly forbid in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34037:26"/>
the first and second Commandments of the Decalogue.
But the whole Decalogue is Moral, and so declared by
God, in that it is said to be writ by his own finger on
the Tables of stone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. (which are Symbols
of the permanent substance of our Souls, on which all
the general Precepts of Morality are ingraven as innate
Notions of our Duty.) And therefore it is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
that the Precepts of the Decalogue are just and
fitting, not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, not onely by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Law, but engraffed in our very Nature and Reason;
and that the root and ground of them will easily be fetch'd
from thence.</p>
               <p>To which you may add, That it were a very immetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
and heterogeneous Botch, unworthy of the Wisdom
of God and of his servant <hi>Moses,</hi> when as all the rest of
the Decalogue is Moral, to phansie one or two of the
Commandments of another nature. This is so rash and
gross a Reproach to the Divine Wisdom as truly, in my
judgement, seems unexcusable.</p>
               <p>But besides this, The Morality of the Decalogue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
acknowledged by the Church, it making part of their
Liturgy every-where, and we begging an ability of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Second Commandment as well as the rest: and
<hi>Christ</hi> also refers to the Decalogue for eternal life, <hi>Mark</hi>
10. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>And lastly, It seems as it were singled from all the
rest of <hi>Moses</hi> Laws, as a lasting and permanent Law to
the Church of God, (whence it is entred into our
very Catechisms,) never to be abolished, or rather vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
to be kept in force, for the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
sake particularly, that it might strongly bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those Invitations to Idolatry, that may seem to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves in the nature of our Religion, or reclaim
the Church from it when they were fallen into it, as well
as it was to keep back the <hi>Iews</hi> from joyning in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with their Idolatrous neighbors round about them.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34037:27"/>
Wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>fore all manner of Idolatry being cautioned against
by the Moral Decalogue given to the <hi>Iews,</hi> there are no
kinds thereof that ought to be entertained or allow'd of by
any Christians.</p>
               <p>4. The third Conclusion; That what-ever was Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the Heathen, the same is Idolatry in us, if we commit
it. The reason of which Assertion is this, Because the
Heathen had not so express a Declaration from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all manner of Idolatry as the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>
have: and therefore where-ever they are guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
the <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> if they do the like things, are
much more.</p>
               <p>The fourth Conclusion; The Idolatry of the Pagans
consisted in this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that they either took something
to be the supreme God that was not, and worshipped it
for such; or else worshipped the supreme God in an
Image; or gave religious Worship, that is to say, erected

Powers of Nature.</p>
               <p>The fifth; That both Divine Declaration and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Consent of Christendom do avouch to us, that all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the third Conclusion, they must be much more so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
either the <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The sixth; That giving religious Worship, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>

                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
the precedent Conclusion; and may be farther confirme
from this Consideration, That Idolatry was very ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
amongst the Nations, especially the <hi>Romans,</hi> if thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34037:27"/>
Mode of Idolatry be not truly Idolatry. And scarce any
thing will be found Idolatry amongst them, but taking
that to be the supreme God which is not, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
it for such. But if any Being on this side the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God may be worshipped with religious Worship
void of Idolatry, all things may, though some more non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensically
and ridiculously than others. Wherefore to
use any of the abovesaid Modes of Worship to what is
inferiour to the supreme Being, though not as to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Being, must be Idolatry; or else the <hi>Roman</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism
it self is very rarely, if at all, chargeable therewith,
they having a Notion accurate enough of the supreme
God, and distinct enough from their other Deities; so
that unless they chance to worship him in an Image,
they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eldom be found Idolaters, or rather never, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of some, who say, none that have
the knowledge of the one true God can be capable of
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>6. The seventh; That to sacrifice, burn Incense, or
make any religious Obeisance or Incurvation to an Image
in any wise, as to an Object of this Worship, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>dolatry
by Divine Declaration. This is manifest out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Conclusion and the first, as may appear at first sight.
For it is plainly declared in the second Precept of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue
touching Images, <hi>Thou shalt not bow to them, nor
worship them:</hi> Of which undoubtedly the sense is, They
shall not be in any wise the Object of that Worship which
thou performest in a religious way, whether by Bowing
down to them, or by what other way soever. For the
second Commandment certainly is a Declaration of the
mind of God touching religious Worship, let the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
be what they will.</p>
               <p>The eighth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That to erect Temples, Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ars, Images,
or to burn Incense, to Saints or Angels, to invoke them,
or make Vows to them, and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ke, is plain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>dolatry,
This is apparent chiefly out of the third, fourth, fifth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34037:28"/>
and sixth Conclusions of this Chapter. For the Pagans
<hi>Daemons</hi> exquisit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ly answer to the Christians Saints and
Angels in this point; saying that this spiritual Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is a Rape upon our Saints and Angels, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fornication in the Heathen with their impure <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth; Religious Incurvation towards a Crucifix,
or the Host, or any Image, as to an Object, and not a
meer unconsidered accidental Circumstance, is Idolatry.
This is manifest out of the seventh and eighth Conclusions.
But the Worship of <hi>Latria</hi> exhibited to the Host upon the
opinion of Transubstantiation is Idolatry by the third and
fourth.</p>
               <p>7. Conclusion the tenth; To use on set purpose in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship any Figure or Image onely <hi>circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
not <hi>objectively,</hi> but so as to bow towards it, or to
be upon a man's knees before it with Eyes and Hands
devoutly lifted up towards it, but with an intention of
making it in no sense any Object of this religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
yet if this were in a Country where men usually and
prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ssedly do, it were notwithstanding for all this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>But if the whole Country should conspire to make this
more plausible sense of those Incurvations and Postures;
admit we might hope it were not Idolatry, yet it would
be certainly a most impious and wicked Mocking of
God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>luding his mind in the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(that naturally implies the forbidding any Worship
or Incurvation toward Images in a way of Religion,) and
a crime as scandalous and near to Idolatry as the going into
bed to another man's Wife, with chast pretensions, would
be to gross Adultery.</p>
               <p>Nay, indeed, it is very questionable, if he knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deliberately put himself into these postures before
an Image, whether the Image will not be the Object of
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Or rather it seems plain, beyond all questioning, that it
will be so. For there is a corporeal Action significative
of Honour and Respect corporeally (though not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally)
directed towards and received by the Image, and
this at the choice of the Religionist, which intitles him to
the fact.</p>
               <p>But we need not labour much touching this last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
the two former abundantly convincing the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> of multifarious Idolatries, if they will stand to
Divine Definitions, or the Declarations of Holy Scripture
touching this point.</p>

this Remark; That the learned Simile, wherein the

been dispenced with, without any offence to Logick
or impeachment to the Authors judgement. For the
Simile seems to aim at the clearing and setting the

of my Antagonist, which is to make a show
of saying something to every Conclusion, though
he knows in his own Conscience, being of that
wit and parts that he is, that it is really nothing to
the purpose, as most certainly this is not. For I
do not go about to establish the Prerogative of an
uncreated Power upon the right of humane Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but the Argument is <hi>Ã  Comparatis,</hi> That if
the supreme Power amongst men, have the right
to define and declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then much more or
most abundantly clear it is, that it is the right of
God Almighty, who is infinitely good and wise,
to define and declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Saviour (<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

argues thus, <hi>If men being evil give good gifts to
their children, how much more will our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give good gifts to them that ask him.</hi> Does he
there establish the bounty of God on the bounty
of evil men; but argues <hi>Ã  Minori,</hi> if they that are
less willing and able to do good, notwithstanding
do it, much more will God who is goodness it
self, and infinitely able and willing to do good,
be sure to do good to those that call upon him.
And so say I, If it be the right of finite Mortals,
that have the supreme Power, to define and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
it is much more, or most of all true in God
Almighty, who is also infinitely good and wise,
that he hath the right to define and declare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
So that my Antagonist, without any Offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

might have saved himself the labour of this

                  <p>His assault also on my second Conclusion is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and elusory. Now, says he, that the whole
Decalogue is moral he makes some needless attempts
to prove, chiefly for the second Commandments
sake. All which proofs it is easy to take off by
this single Answer: I say then, as to the second
Commandment, if he expound it so as onely to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
the making or worshipping of Idols or Images
of false Gods, I shall readily grant it to be moral
and strictly binding both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians:</hi>

Answer in brief is this, That though he acknowledge
the whole Decalogue moral, (Else why does he say I
make needless attempts to prove it?) yet if I
expound the Morality of the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so as that I would thereby show it unlawfull to
worship any Images saving of false Gods, which he
calls Idols, that it will not go down with him,
unless I more fully prove the Morality of this
Commandment to extend also to the Prohibition of
worshipping any Image suppose of the true God, or
of Saints and good Angels: This is the full sense
and scope of this first Answer. But he comes in
also with a secondly, That some both Catholick and
Protestant Divines own no more then a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Precept in the second Commandment, if
extended to any Vniversal Prohibition of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34037:30"/>
Images, and under that notion given onely to
the Jews.</p>
                  <div type="reply">
                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>In Reply to the First; I first take notice, That
he is fain to pass over my first ground of this
second Conclusion as too hard for him to deal
with, namely the Spirituality of our Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Which ground being unshaken, the second
Conclusion remains firm, from Instances of <hi>Jewish</hi>
Idolatry in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But now for the extent of the Moral sense of
the second Commandment of the Decalogue,
that it should forbid the bowing to any Images
whatsoever in the way of Religion or Devotion,
the words aptly spreading to that latitude; In
the first place I say, My Adversary should bring
reason to the contrary: For we are with fear and
reverence to receive the Laws of God in such an
extent or latitude of sense, as, it being natural, will
be most effectual to keep us from sinning against
them. Otherwise, if my Adversary would be still
more humoursom, and would say, That stealing
from a man of another Religion, killing of him,
or covering his goods were Lawfull; and I should
produce those Commandments against him, <hi>Thou
shalt not steal, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not covet,</hi>
&amp;c. He might roundly reply after his Fashion, that
if I understand them of stealing from, killing or
coveting any ones goods but theirs of our own
Religion, I beg the Question. Which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone, methinks, should make any one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34037:31"/>
of the great absurdity of his Answer to the
present case of worshipping of Images.</p>
                     <p>But yet again in the second place, I say it is
necessary and inevitable to understand the second
Commandment in that extent of sense that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to have: For it is manifest, that the second
Commandment as well as the first, treats of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and our Worship of God. The first is,
<hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> that is to say,
We shall exhibit Religious Worship to no other
Beings besides himself, and so make as if they were
Gods. For the all-wise God knows there is really
no other Gods besides himself, nor any can real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make them so. But men may make as if there
were, by giving Religious Worship to them,
though they be no Gods. So that here all false
Deities, whether Angels, <hi>Daemons,</hi> or separate
souls of men, or what ever Powers of nature, are
plainly forbid to be worshipped or made Gods
of, or acknowledged to be Gods by any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship. Which therefore <hi>Ã  fortiori</hi> takes
away all erecting Images to be bowed to or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in reference to them. In so much that
the second Commandment seems Tautological, or
at least superfluous, if it be meerly to forbid the
making of Images of Worship for those Gods,
whose at all having, or any way worshipping is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
so plainly forbid.</p>
                     <p>Whence it necessarily follows, that at least
chiefly, though not onely, the making and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Images, in reference to the true God,
is forbid by the second Commandment: Whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34037:31"/>
the Commandment strictly forbids to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in any Image whatsoever, that represents any
thing in the whole Universe, Heaven, Earth, or
Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I say, is plainly the principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
sense, according to free and unprejudiced
Reason. But yet the Precept is so penned, that
in a secondary scope it forbids the Religious bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to or worshipping all Images whatsoever. Thus
plain is it, that the worshipping any Images of the
true God is here strictly forbidden, contrary to
what our Adversary pretends.</p>
                     <p>Which Interpretation the Law-giver himself,
who best knows the meaning of his own Laws,
do's plainly ratify, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. where <hi>Israel</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God himself in a visible Image the Golden
Calf, provoked Gods wrath so as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ere fell thirty
Thousand of them by the Sword, for so hainous
a crime of Idolatry. So that the true <hi>Exposition</hi> of
this Law, as <hi>Draco's</hi> Law was said of old to have
been, was written in blood. So solid and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
is this sense thereof, namely, That as he will
have nothing else besides himself worshipped with
Religious Worship, so himself will not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in an Image or Similitude of any thing in
Heaven, Earth, or Sea, that is, in the whole
Universe.</p>
                     <p>But then thirdly out of my Adversaries own
Concession; As it is already manifest, that the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an Image to the true God is forbidden
by this Commandment, so is the worshipping of
Images in reference to Saints and Angels here
also forbidden. For my Adversary do's readily
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34037:32"/>
grant, that the Precept is Moral and strictly bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as to the Prohibition of the Worship of the
Images of false Gods. Now I say, There is no
more than one God; and the rest no otherwise
made Gods than by giving Religious Worship to
them, of which erecting consecrated Images to
them and bowing to them is one mode. And
therefore these Saints and Angels, to whom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship is given by a Law, do <hi>ipso facto</hi>
become Gods, but not true Gods but false Gods;
and therefore the worshipping of their Images is
forbidden, yea strictly forbidden even in the
Moral sense of this Commandment, according to
the very concession of my Adversary, whom no
man will question in that point to have Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
right.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, That there may be no Creep-hole
left, whereas my Adversary would weaken my
Argumentations taken from the Morality of the
Decalogue in general, and of this Precept in
particular, by supposing that I will not stick to
grant, that one and the same Precept of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue
(considered under a double respect) may
be both Moral and Ceremonial, I do absolutely
deny that any Commandment in the substance
thereof (and I think I have sufficiently proved it
in the third Section of this Chapter) is Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
or Temporal, but of Eternal obligation
to the Church of God. As for Example in the
fourth Commandment, the substance is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of every seventh day, as an holy Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Worlds Creation by God, declared
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34037:32"/>
by himself, finished in six days space, himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sanctifying the Seventh day and Hallowing it.
So that it seems to me, that every seventh day for
a memorial of the Creation, and in such a way as
may further our Contemplation in Divine things in
reference to God our Creator and Redeemer, is
perpetually to be observed. But to keep the self
same day with the <hi>Jews</hi> is but Circumstantial, or
to keep it in that strict resting, <hi>ab omnimodo opere
seculari,</hi> in such a Superstitious way as they do.
But now for the second Commandment, if the
forbidding of the use of Images by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship, that is by way of bowing to
them and worshipping them any how, be not the
substance of it, it has no substance at all, but is
wholly Ceremonial. Which is very gross and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
as I have already proved in this Section. So
sufficiently firm is our proof from the Morality of
the Decalogue, for any thing my Adversary has
alledged or can alledge.</p>
                     <p>For as for his Secondly, That some both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
and Protestant Divines own no more than
a Ceremonial Precept in this second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I answer, that I think the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not really concerned in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to the meer making of Images, nor is
the Commandment against that, but the making
them in reference to Religion and the worshipping
of them. This is plainly the scope of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
as any one that does not wilfully wink
cannot but see. And I am confident no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Divine will ever acknowledge, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34037:33"/>
of making Images in reference to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the Worship of them, to be meerly
Ceremonial in this Precept. He must be a Papist
under a Protestants hood that can ever assert this.

this sort, feigning the sense of it to be either this,
That we are guilty of Heathenish Idolatry, if we
commit Heathenish Idolatry, which he wittily calls an
Identick Proposition surfeiting of too much Truth:
or else, what ever external Act of VVorship was
Idolatry in the Heathen, is also Idolatry in us, if

                     <p>To the first I say, That my Conclusion is not
an Identick Proposition, because that though
the Acts of Idolatry be of the same Nature, yet
they are not from the same Party. A <hi>Pagan</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
a Consecrated Image; A <hi>Christian</hi> worships
a Consecrated Image; are these two but one
Identick Proposition surfeiting of too much Truth?
If you espy any overplus, I pray you take it to
your self to line your Propositions with, which I
usually find too lank and devoid thereof. But it is
no vain assertion, nor so plain to every one at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34037:33"/>
the first sight: That acts of the same nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by several parties, are still of the same
nature. For there are some high-flown <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado's,</hi>
that hold that lying with another mans

others: And I wish it were not so in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Adultery, I mean the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dolatry of too many
Christians; They do not think they commit it,
when the same things done by Heathen they will
readily acknowledge to be Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>But now to the second part, I answer, That I
do not restrain Idolatry in this place to External
acts of Worship onely; but it comprehends any
External, Internal, or mixt act consisting of both,
which are held Idolatrous in the Heathen. Which
quite breaks in pieces the insnaring case my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
offers to me; of a converted Christian
begging St. <hi>Pauls</hi> blessing on the knee as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that begat him in Christ; and of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> on his knees adoring the Apostle
at the same time for the God <hi>Mercury, Act.</hi> 14.
For every External act of Worship is not Idolatry.
Nor was it Idolatry in the <hi>Lycaonian</hi> to be on his
knee to <hi>Paul,</hi> but the intended adoration of him
for the God <hi>Mercury.</hi> This mixt action of genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
and Internal Religious adoration together
was Idolatry, but the External alone had not been
Idolatry. And if the new Convert had given inward
Religious Worship adjoyned to the External ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuflection

which is not restrained to External act of

                     <p>To the first thing Objected I answer; That
he must understand by his Assertion either, That
the <hi>Pagans</hi> had not the knowledge of the supreme
God, and so could not Worship him at all, and
consequently not in an Image; or else that having
the knowledge of the supreme God yet they did
not Worship him in an Image. If he means
the first it is a notorious untruth, as may easily
appear out of <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Aristotle, Homer,
Tully, Plotinus, Jamblichus,</hi> and many other of
the Heathen Writers, who were clear asserters of
the supreme Godhead, and many of them notable
skilfull describers of the same, This is a thing so
well known among the learned, that it is enough
to mention it onely. But if he mean the second,
that is also a mistake. For the Inhabitants of
<hi>Thebais</hi> worshipped the maker of the World, in
the Image of a man with an egg coming out of
his mouth. <hi>Dion Chrysostomus</hi> also, and <hi>Maximus
Tyrius</hi> do profess, that in their Images of Gold and
Silver and Ivory, they worshipped the supreme God
the maker and Governour of all things. And what
was more frequent than the Images of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who
is the supreme Deity, whom <hi>Aratus</hi> invokes in

worshipping of the true God by an Image is not

he acknowledges to be among the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
                     <p>To the second thing Objected, I answer, That
I might very well omit that branch of Idolatry,
the worshipping of their very Images for Gods,
because I did not intend any such charge upon
you, as if you worshipped Images taking them for
the very Saints or Angels themselves, because I
hope that seldom happens even amongst the most
ignorant of your <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seldom happened amongst the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And the force of my arguing from this
fourth Conclusion will never Iye upon the plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enumeration of all the sorts of <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry,
but on my true application to those that are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34037:35"/>
mentioned there. So be they be there I refer
to in my Arguments, it is enough; others not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, or there being more than I refer to,
neither strengthen nor weaken my Applications
and Arguings, so framed as I have intimated.</p>
                     <p>So that it is a superfluous thing for me to go
about to disprove your Assertion, That they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their Images Gods, that they took them for
Gods, that they sacrificed to them as Gods;
Onely I shall return thus much, That <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 4.
do's not prove that they themselves called their
Images Gods, but that the Holy Penman styleth
them so. As the Spirit of Truth also stiles them,
or rather stiles their Gods Images, which is all
one. <hi>Isa. 46. Psal. 115. Habac. 2. Act.</hi> 19. 26. the
very places you quote to prove they took their
Images for Gods. Which places yet do not at
all prove it, but onely prove what the sentence
of the true God is, touching the Gods of the
Heathen, in reference to their Images they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
complexly with them, upon a supposal
that upon their Consecration, some invisible Power
was conveyed into them, and was ready there
to hear and help all supplicants to them. But now
God who is the Prince and Commander of all
Spirits knows, that this their Religious Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
has no such Power to convey any such
assisting Spirits unto those Images, so that they
may be assured of their presence and ayd, and
therefore he must justly and truly, contrary to

that it is not credible, that it ever fell into the
mind of any number of the lowest dregs of the
Heathen Common People, or that they intended
their sacrifices to them. But that they phancyed
the presence of some <hi>Daemons</hi> that received the
Nidour and Odour of their Sacrifices, is a thing
so Vulgar and Trite, that I hold it needless any
more than to mention it.</p>

took them, and worshipped them for Gods,
and calls my Conclusion a mincing Conclusion,
because it do's not mention that? This omission
was no intended cunning of mine to ruine the
matter at all. For I thought I spoke sufficiently
home in saying they gave Religious Worship to
these, which is at least equal to the calling of
them Gods, especially in Greek and Latine. For

which we usually translate Gods, the
words of themselves imply no more than Angels
or souls separate. But if Religious Worship be
given to them, then they become Gods: Nor can
any thing beside the supreme God be properly
called God, unless Religious Worship be institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for it; and then be it what it will, the Notion
and name of a false God properly belongs unto
it: so that in reality in saying, They give Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship to the souls of men, or <hi>Daemons;</hi> I
say also, That they were their Gods, and that they
worshipped them for such; So that my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

remains as strong as ever. But in the mean

boast where there is least of all at the bottom;
he speaking such a perfect nothing with so great
a grace. If he has shewed any <hi>Hypothesis</hi> to be
false, it must be an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his own making.
For I did not, nor do suppose my fourth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
to be an adequate enumeration of all the
Idolatries of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but onely as many as I
have enumerated to be real Paganical Idolatries;
which my Adversary himself cannot deny. And
I intended no more than thus, nor is any more

than thus serviceable to my design: For I shall
not refer to that Conclusion for any more modes
of Idolatry than are mentioned there. Nor does
this fifth Conclusion pronounce of any more than
are there mentioned. So that this Conclusion is

saying something, when the matter do's not afford
any thing to be said. But such sleights serve to keep
the people in their bondage of Errour. And yet
he wipes his mouth, who ever should wipe their
pen; and presumes he has done nothing amiss,
it being in so Pious a Cause, and for the interest
of his Church. For I must confess, I think it
impossible but himself should here clearly discern,
that he says nothing at all to the purpose.</p>

This to the sixth Conclusion as demonstrated from

I shall give a tast in my Reply.</p>

                     <p>I appeal to the Reader, If the fifth doth not
stand very fast and unmoveable for any thing my
Adversary hath brought against it, or indeed can
be brought against it. To make a show of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
it, he seigned a false <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of his
own, which he would have fastened upon me, as
if I had need of it, when as I have most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
proved to the contrary: So that this sixth
Conclusion also is as firme as need be desired.
But he assaults the further Confirmation of it,
(which I added <hi>ex abundanti</hi>) with a pleasant
freak fetched out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> his mentioning of
thirty Thousand Deities of the Heathens reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Hesiod,</hi> which he brings in a Maurice dance

nay many more Gods of wood and stone noted

the mean time, this numerous rabble of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

                  <head>Answer to the seventh Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>In Answer to this seventh Conclusion, he first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
some things as Preparatory thereto. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
he brings in the Answer it self. The
<hi>Preparatories</hi> are these</p>
                  <p>I. That Catholicks usually distinguish two parts
of Worship. The first <hi>Latria</hi> which is the highest
Religious Worship possible, due to God alone the
Creatour of all Things, and that Examples of this
kind of worship are, Sacrifices, and the erecting of
Temples and Altars.</p>
                  <p>II. That neither Sacrifice it self, nor dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Temples and Altars excludes a secondary
Remembrance, or Titular honour of Saints.</p>
                  <p>III. That there are other Acts of an inferiour
respect which without any offence to the Catholick
Divinity, we may chuse whether we will call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34037:39"/>
worship or no, as burning Incense, lighting
up Candles, and bowing our bodies to the Saints
and their Images. These Acts he calls indifferent
and variously determinable according to our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to either a Divine or Civil VVorship. As
was <hi>Abrahams</hi> incurvation of his body to God,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. to Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. to Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.
This is the sum of the force and strength of his
<hi>Preparatories.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The main strength of his Answer it self, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in these few things; namely, That all my
Instances of Idolatry in this seventh Conclusion are
not true Instances of Idolatry, but that I do as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully,
as if a Lawyer should define murther to be
the wilfull taking away a mans life without cause, or
cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ting a limb or drawing of blood. So saith he,
sacrificing to an Image and bowing to an Image
sutes not well together, as if they were both Acts
of Idolatry, any more than all those are of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
His great exception therefore against this
seventh Conclusion is, that I make bowing to an
Image Idolatry, which he indeavours to disprove.</p>
                  <p>First from the <hi>Jews</hi> bowing towards the Ark of
the Covenant, over which were the Cherubims of
Image work; which, says he, could not be done
without bowing before Images. Secondly, from <hi>Christians</hi> bowing at the name of Iesus. Tuirdly
and lastly he adds, That the VVorship done to
their Saints and Images, is not by the Catholick
Church commanded to be called Religious VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which he applies to the proof of my seventh
Conclusion. This is the main of what he brings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34037:39"/>
against this seventh Conclusion: For it were tedious
to take notice of what things are so little pertinent
to the purpose, but onely brought in for a blind to
the people. And I have neither leasure nor any
list to meddle with such things. In which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I acknowledge my Adversary an
Egregious Artist for the imposing on poor Souls to
use his own Phrase.</p>
                  <div type="reply">
                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>As to the first of his Preparatories, that tells
us Catholicks usually distinguish two sorts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
I wonder then that he has so soon forgot
to be a Catholick himself, as to assert there are
three; from that Instance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> bowing
to God, to Angels, and to Men, by a different
Application of the heart, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in respect of God, an inferiour kind of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in respect of Angels, and a Civil Worship as
referred to men. <q>Wherefore, <hi>says he,</hi> he that
would speak distinctly to the Catholick Tenet,
must distinguish these several modes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
one from another, or else shew cause why
he ranks them all under one and the same species
of Religious Worship, else he will not Cope
with his Adversary like a Scholar.</q> Namely,
Unless contrary to the current of Catholicks he
make three kind of Worships instead of two, or
take not heed of making all three one kind of
Worship, that is, Religious; which is impossible
for any one to do that is not a meer dotard.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34037:40"/>
So perplextly and confoundedly does he speak of
his sorts of Worship by reason of the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and unsoundness of the cause he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.</p>
                     <p>But if he would make any sense of the two
sorts of Worship usually distinguished by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
he must either understand that general
bipartition of Worship into Religious and Civil.
Or else that bipartition of Religious Worship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Latria</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> which later may again be
subdivided into <hi>Dulia major</hi> or <hi>minor; Major</hi> that
which is given to the blessed Virgin, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
called <hi>Hyperdulia; Minor,</hi> that to the rest
of the Saints and their Images. But this he
durst not speak out explicitly, that he might not
be found to allow Religious Incurvation to Images,
which is so manifestly forbidden in the second
Commandment, as is intimated in this seventh
Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>Now to his second Preparatory, That neither
Sacrifice it self, nor Dedication of Temples and
Altars, which he says are Acts of <hi>Latria,</hi> excludes
a secundary Remembrance or titular Honour of
the Saints; I say, as it is little to the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
so it is in it self plainly false; For it is
expresly said, <hi>Thou jhalt have no other Gods besides
me.</hi> And God himself knows, and God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we all know, that it impossible there should
be any Gods besides Him, and that therefore we
can have none but Him in any other sense than
in doing some actions in honour to that which
is not God, which is proper to be done to God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34037:40"/>
alone. And therefore to make any Thing or
Person to Communicate with God in these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of honour, is to have other Gods besides
Him, as much as it is possible to have any
other.</p>
                     <p>Nor will it excuse the fact, that this honour
is but secundarily intended to the Saints, or what
ever else is thus worshipped besides God. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that the direction of our intention will not
change the nature of the proper Notes of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<hi>Latria,</hi> these can be no other than seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Deities which are forbidden; for as much as
there can be no other but these besides him to be
forbid, and therefore no other than a secundary
Honour or inferiour kind of Religious Worship
can be possibly intended to them, by those that
institute it or do it to them; they retaining as
the <hi>Iews</hi> did, the supreme God still for their
God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and therefore even that honour is also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
in that it is forbidden that we should
have any Gods besides Jehovah himself. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
can be that is a jealous God endure that
any other should any ways partake of that honour
that is proper to Him even of <hi>Latria,</hi> which
these Acts are acknowledged to be by my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
whose insensibility therefore I stand amazed
at in this point. For he flatly affirms this to be
warrantable Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Temple
and this Altar be erected and dedicated to God
and St. <hi>Francis;</hi> That this or that Sacrifice be
offered to God and St. <hi>Francis;</hi> To God prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
as the supreme God, to St. <hi>Francis</hi> secunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34037:41"/>
or as to a Saint, not as to the supreme God.
But does not Temples, Altars and Sacrifices, make
a secundary or inferiour Deity, as much as any
Thing or Person can be made a Deity, by them
that hold one supreme God; which was the case
of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore thus having or making
a secundary Deity is palpable Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>To the third Preparatory, I Answer, first, That
it is hard to conceive, that we may choose whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we will call these acts of inferiour respect
Religious or no, without any offence to his
Catholick Divinity; when as the Catholicks, as
he calls them, distinguishing two sorts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it is necessary to make such bipartitions of
them as I have hinted; if they will have them
run by twos, which will empty these acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
respect, as he Termes them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and himself plainly intimates they are so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end of his Answer to this seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
For he says, <q>But if nothing will serve
my turn, but Religious and Divine Worship
must be all one, then we utterly deny that we
are in any wise concerned in his Objection, for
we give no such Religious Worship to the Saints
themselves much less to their Images;</q> that is,
no such Religious Worship as is Divine and is
properly <hi>Latria;</hi> but it implies, that an inferiour
Religious VVorship you do give; nor do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for a <hi>Latria,</hi> but Religious VVorship in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I deny that burning Incense, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up Candles, bowing our bodies to Saints
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34037:41"/>
and their Images are acts indifferent, determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as our intention shall be to either a Divine or
Civil VVorship, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> incurvation of his
body to God, to Angels, to Men; For bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body is a vulgar Ceremony of Civility,
known up and down in the VVorld to be so; and
does not become a Religious Ceremony, till it be
applied to an Object of Religious VVorship, or
in such circumstances that it is understood to be
so: but the bowing the body to the consecrated
Image of some invisible Power or Spirit, is as
notoriously all over the VVorld known to be a
Religious Ceremony, and to signity Religious
Honour and VVorship. And we may as well,
or rather better, call the Saints Gods, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
onely a Civil sense by it, as bow to the
Image of a Saint set up and Consecrated for the
purpose, and pretend we intend onely a Civil
VVorship by it. For this was the Universal
Mode of acknowledging any person a God, by
erecting an Image, and Honouring him in it by
the above said Ceremony; as it was the Universal
Phrase of calling that a God which was so honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And what is said of bowing the body to
the consecrate Image of an Invisible Power or
Spirit, the same is also to be said of lighting Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
before the said Image; it is an Universally
well known Ceremony of Religion amongst the
Nations, not a Civil Ceremony, whereby they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that to be a God whom they so Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
And lastly for burning of Incense, the
Learned are agreed, that it is a Sacrifice, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34037:42"/>
therefore an act of <hi>Latria</hi> according to my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
own Concession. And the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were so sensible thereof, that they would
rather die than fling a few grains of Incenfe into
the fire in honour of the Emperour, they looking
upon it as a Sacrificing to him. And truly it is a very
noble kind of Sacrifice, as may be seen by the
Altar of Incense next the Holy of Holies, and
highly significant of Honour; that is, of sending
up prayers, and Devotionally spending all the
Powers of our Souls and bodies as an acceptable
service, and of a sweet smelling savour to him
we thus Worship: Which is the highest Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
imaginable, so far is it from being determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a Civil Worship, I mean the Type thereof,
from either custom or the nature of the thing it
self.</p>
                     <p>Its Preparatories being thus swept away, let us
consider the Answer it self: In which he lays to my
charge, what himself was just now so manifestly
guilty of, namely of mingling things of an Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous
nature, he making the burning of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
to a Saint, which is a Sacrifice, a Civil
Worship, as well as the bowing of the body. And
he blames me for making, Sacrificeing to an
Image, and bowing to an Image, both of them
acts of Idolatry. Whenas notwithstanding, I do
not say, that simply bowing towards an Image, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to take up a pin, or a glove, from off the
the flour betwixt the Image and us, is Idolatry,
but a Religious Incurvation to the Image is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
So that my Adversary is disingenuous in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34037:42"/>
not representing my A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>sertion such as it is, which
addes Religious to that bowing or Incurvation
to an Image which I pronounce to be Idolatry.
And all Incurvation is such, that is made to a
consecrated Image, as to an Object of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                     <p>I but he has two proofs to evince, that even
Religious Incurvation to an Image is no Idolatry.
For the name of Jesus is Religiously bowed to,
and the Jews were commanded to bow toward
the Ark of the Covenant over which were the
Cherubims of Image-work. And therefore they
were commanded to bow to Images by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which therefore can be no Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>To the first I answer, That a name or voice is
no Image or Similitude, accordingly as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 12. ye saw no Similitude, onely ye
heard a voice. And besides it is ridiculous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that we bow to the name of Jesus when we
hear it named, because we bow at the naming
of it, as to infer that those of your Church say
their <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> to the <hi>Ave-Mary-bell,</hi> because
they say them at the tinkling of it; neither the
<hi>Ave-Mary-bell,</hi> nor the Name or word Jesus are
the Objects of our Devotion, but onely the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of it. Besides, they whose backs are
turned off the Priests or Reader when he names
the name of Jesus, what a ridiculous bowing were
that in them, if they bowed to the name sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
behind them. Therefore these are poor and
weak shifts to make a show for the worshipping
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> Images; from an Example where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34037:43"/>
any Image<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor any bowing to that which
they would fain fancy to be one.</p>
                     <p>To the second I Answer, That be it so that
there is a command to bow toward the Ark of
the Covenant where Images are, and consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
towards Images; and that this Incurvation is
Religious, yet the command to bow toward these
Images is onely <hi>ex accidenti:</hi> And mark the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my Adversary here again, (my words are,
<hi>or make any Religious Obeisance, or Incurvation to an
Image in any wise, as to an Object of this Worship</hi>)
which last words he craftily leaves out; Which
are of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ssential importance to this act of Idolatry.
But God was so far from commanding the Jews
to bow towards the Cherubims, as to an Object
of their Worship, that he barred them from the
very sight of them, and suffered them not so much
as to be an object of their eyes. Which was a
plain inhibition from bowing to them, as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Devotion, or any way of worshipping
them. It would be a very unjust imputation of any
rash tongue, touching suppose some chast <hi>Amazon,</hi>
that she was familiarly saluted by such a Knight at
such a time, when she did not so much as lift up
the Beaver of her Helmet all the time they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
together, which therefore was a certain
bar against any such audacious attempt. And the
Case is the same in this foul charge, that God
commanded the Jews to Worship the Cherubims
over the Mercy sear, and bow to them as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
when as he carefully hid them with a vail
from their eyes, that they might not be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34037:43"/>
Besides how infinitely inconsistent is it with
the Truth and Sanctity of the Divine Majesty,
to give so strict a Law against worshipping of
Images, and then at the same time to command
the two Cherubims to be worshipped, and yet to
take away the lives of thirty Thousand men for
worshipping that golden Cherub, or golden Calf
which <hi>Aaron</hi> had set up: Which being in their
view and they bowing before, became the object
of their Worship. But the Cherubims on the
Ark of the Covenant were onely a Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>cumstance
of their Worship as so much, but were industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
hid from being any Object thereof. And
God alone who spake from betwixt the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,
was the onely object of their Worship:
And the Cherubims and other Holy things there
were onely Holy figures and Hierogly phicks of
mysterious and profound Truths, which here it is
not at all necessary to explain.</p>
                     <p>And now lastly touching his last shift, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of this Worship of Images and
Saints; which insinuates, that though there be a
middle Worship betwixt Divine and Civil, the
Catholick Church (he means the <hi>Roman</hi>) does
not require that it should be called Religious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that it is contrary to the common stream
of Catholicks as I noted before, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
does imply that middle Worship to be Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
I add further, what are we the better for
not calling it Religious, when it is so in its own
nature, and we thereby Idolaters? Now is it in
our Power to make this middle Worship of Saints
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34037:44"/>
expressed by consecrated Images, and bowing to
them to be a Civil Worship. For the Almighty
Law-giver is afore hand with us in this, who has
forbidden us to have any other Gods besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And in the second Commandment as he has
forbidden that himself should be worshipped by
any graven Image, <hi>Deut. 4. v.</hi> 12. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
so by vertue of the first Commandment he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
forbid us to erect, or consecrate, or any ways
to make any Image to any one else, and to bow
to it in honour of the Person it is made to, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the known and usual way of making a false
Deity; a false or in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>eriour Deity being nothing
else but some Creature, (for there cannot be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
any more than one real God) that by erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Image <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>o it, and by bowing to this Image,
or any otherwise worshipping it, or honouring it, in
reference to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>at Creature, as by burning Incense
before it, and making Invocations looking up to
it, is made a God. VVhich therefore is forbid
by this first and second Commandment as a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
that is to say, as a wickedly Religious or
Idolatrous VVorship, whether to God or to any
thing else; but is not in any wise a Civil VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it being thus branded by God for an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
one, and declared to be a Mode of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
VVorship, though a bad one, as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this Conclusion. Nor is there any legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Religious VVorship, but what is truly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and is done to God himself. VVhat ever
comes after this, it is but several degrees of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
VVorship, whether to Men or to Angels,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34037:44"/>
namely when they are visible to us. But to VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
an Angel no way sensible, nor visible to us
is an act of Idolatry, as is else where proved. In
the mean time we sufficiently see how weak all
the attempts of my Adversary are against this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34037:45"/>
answer to his exceptions there preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
made against a special Clause annexed to
this eighth, <hi>viz. That the Pagans</hi> Daemons, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely
answer to the Christians Saints and Angels in

Touching this particular Clause says my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>pag.</hi> 12, Of all the Doctors Conclusions, there
is none more intrinsick and Fundamental to the
Subject now under debate, nor any that ought
to speak more, or doth speak less to the point
than this; For it is most fondly Erroneous, and
most disingenuously ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ruded upon the easy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
of the Vulgar; that the Pagans <hi>Daemons</hi>
exquisitely answer to the Christians Saints and

<hi>ad populum.</hi> For what I affirm is most apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pagans <hi>Daemons</hi> exquisitely

                        </gap>us
Worship done to them. For my Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
says [in this Point] which he craftily and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his custom leaves out; but the Point
is easily proved. For had the <hi>Daemons</hi> of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
Temples Consecrated to them? So have the
Saints; Had they Altars built to them? So have
the Saints; Had they Images erected to them?
So have the Saints; Did they burn Incense to the
<hi>Daemons?</hi> So they do to the Saints; Were the
<hi>Daemons</hi> invoked before their Images? So are the
Saints; Did they make Vows to the <hi>Daemons?</hi> So
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34037:45"/>
they do to the Saints. And is not this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
exact enough for my purpose, who intimate
onely, that those things are done to Saints that
were done to the Pagans <hi>Daemons;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those four Conclusions are rightly alledged
to prove the eighth. But whereas my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
makes a noise, as if this Clause were the most
Intrinsick and Fundamental to the whole business,
it is so little essential to the matter, that if I had
not mentioned it, my Cause had been alike strong
without it; and my Reader by casting his eye on
this Conclusion, and the Conclusions here cited,
might have observed as much as I have said, of
himself, so obvious is the Truth thereof. But
taking this Clause absolutely as my Antagonist
has quoted it, there might abundance more simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
betwixt the Pagans <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fician
Saints be enumerated out of the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi>
of the first book of my <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> which
for brevity sake I omit.</p>
                     <p>The greatest Objection my Adversary brings
against this Assertion is, That the Saints are not
called Gods, as the <hi>Daemons</hi> of the Pagans were;
<hi>Can any sober Divinity,</hi> says he, <hi>brook it,</hi> (pag. 15.)
<hi>that the Pagans</hi> Daemons <hi>should be said exquisitely to
answer to our Saints and Angels. Do we Worship
Saints and Angels for Gods? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>Do we call them Gods?
Do we take them for Gods? Do we Sacrifice to them
as Gods?</hi> Far be it as from our heart to intend it
so from an ingenuous Adversary to Object it. But
I say, though you do not Sacrifice Oxen to the
Saints, yet you burn Incense to them, which was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34037:46"/>
a very high and Holy Sacrifice under <hi>Moses.</hi> But
the great stress lyes in this, that you do not call
them Gods. But what's that to the purpose while
you make them so; doing in a manner all the
Religious Ceremonies that the Pagans did to their
Gods: And for the very Name in your Latine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
how much does <hi>Divus Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Divus
Thomas,</hi> differ from <hi>Deus Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Deus Thomas;</hi>
which yet is usuall enough.
<q>Nec tam praesentes alibi cognoscere Divos.</q>
But we will not insist on Grammatical Niceties:
Admit they are not called Gods, (not to note
that <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> signifies at least as high) does it follow
you do not make them so. Let us frame this
short Parable fitted for the meanest Capacity.</p>
                     <p>A City suppose, for a certain time was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
that Whores and Whoredom, under that
very Name and Appellation was admitted as
Lawfull; but there being some ill consequences
of it, and inconvenient for the Common Weal
of the City, this Licentiousness was abolished,
and the City reduced to a more sober pass. But
after some time the same custom got up again,
and was ratified by Law, but under another Title;
calling those that were termed Whores before,
Nymphs of Pleasure, and Whoredom, the doing
duty and service to the Nymphs of Pleasure. Thus
having continued for a season, a certain plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
and plain-spoken Citizen, observing the
same inconveniences return that were before,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34037:46"/>
stood up in the Senate, and spake out his mind
concerning this custom; openly declaring, that
the old Whoredom was returned again, which
they had upon good grounds abolished out of
the City: Whereupon a Zealous Oratour of the
other Party stands up and cries out: Can any
sober Politicks brook such a reproach as this to
so well governed a City, as to condemn it of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
Whoredom, for allowing men to do duty
and service to the Nymphs of Pleasure? Where
are the Whores that this licensed Whoredom is
committed with? Do we caress or accost these
Nymphs of Pleasure as Whores? Do we call them
Whores? Do we take them for Whores? Do we
lye with them as Whores? Far be it, as from our
hearts to intend it, so from any ingenuous and
well-bred Citizen to Object it. Was not this a
very smooth and convincing speech to wipe the
City clean off the Imputation of VVhoredom?
But this honest blunt Citizen briefly replied: That
in lying with these Nymphs of Pleasure, they <hi>ips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made them VVhores; which was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
never to be refuted. And to say I to my
right fluent and eloquent Adversary, and to his
vehement Rhetorick so like that of this Oratour
in the Parable. That by erecting Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
and Images, by invoking and making vows
to Saints and Angels, they make them Gods
whether they will or no, as much as any thing
can be made a God by men.</p>

one to use such similitudes as the Spirit of God
has used before us, who frequently sets out Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
by Fornication. Whence it will follow by

to argue, That because I sav, in a Country where
men professedly VVorship an Image as an Object,
if another bow to the same Image, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
onely of making it a circumstance of his
Worship commits Idolatry; that therefore I say,
that al bowings before an Image, though onely
circumstantially, is Idolatry. For this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a general from a particular, which is enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
bad <hi>Logick:</hi> As ill as if he should conclude,
that because one says, that putting the Hat off in

the Hat off any where is a reproach. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do not make God an approver or reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Idolatry, since I do not affirm circumstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to bow towards an Image to be Idolatry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in a Country where the people do objectively
bow to it; which was not the case of the Jews,

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">What is Idolatry according to the Determination of clear and free Reason.</head>
               <p>1. WE will now try how obnoxious the <hi>Romanists</hi> are
out of the plain Definitions and Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of free and clear Reason. In which Method let us
set down for</p>
               <p>The first Conclusion, That Idolatry is a kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
against God. That this is true, may appear from
that Definition of Religion in <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>lly,</hi> who defines it
<hi>Iusti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>am adversus Deum.</hi> Which is not the sense of
<hi>Tully</hi> onely, but the very voice of Reason and Nature.
And therefore Idolatry being one kind of Irreligion or
Impiety, it must needs in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lude in it a kind of Injustice
against God.</p>
               <p>2. The second Conclusion; That Idolatry is a very
fore and grievous Disease of the Soul, vilely debasing
her and sinking her into <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Materiali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>y,</hi>
keeping her at a distance from the true sense and right
knowledge of God, and leaving her more liable to bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lusts: That the natural tendency of Idolatry is this,
and yet the Souls of men, in this Lapsed state, are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
prone to so mischievous a Disease, as both Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and daily Experience do abundantly witness. See the
Mischiefs of Idolatry in my <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> Part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
Lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>. Ch. 16.</p>
               <p>Nor can it infringe the truth of this Conclusion, that
a man, retaining still the true Notion of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Divine Attributes, may, according to a sense
of his own, bow down toward a corporeal Object of
worship. For he must retain it by force against such
a Practice, as would and does naturally debauch the users
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34037:50"/>
of it. And besides, if he had really the Life of God in
him as well as the Notion of him, he would feel such
Actions grate against his heart, and perceive how they
would invade and attempt the abating and extinguishing
the more true and pure sense of God and of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and seduce the Soul to external Vanity.</p>
               <p>But suppose a man or two could keep their minds
from sinking down from a right Notion of the Deity;
yet they are as guilty of Idolatry, if they give religious
Worship to corporeal Objects, as he is of Adultery and
Fornication that yet uses them so cautiously as neither
to impair his bodily Health, nor besott his natural Parts
thereby. And therefore, though there may be some few
such, yet the Laws against Fornication and Adultery
ought notwithstanding to be very sacred to every one,
even to those discreeter Transgressours of them, and
ever to be obeyed by them, because the Observation
of them is of such infinite importance to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>And what we have said of the Worship of God is
analogically true of honouring of the Saints, who are
best honoured by the remembrance and imitation of their
Vertues, not by scraping Legs to or clinging about their
Image, which are no more like them than an Apple is to
an Oister.</p>
               <p>3. The third Conclusion; That those high expressions
of the Jealousie of God and his severe Displeasure
against Idolatry are very becoming the nature of the
thing, and his Paternal care of the Souls of men. This
appears from the foregoing Conclusions. For both the
Prerogatives and Rights of the Divine Majesty himself are
concerned, and also the Perfection, Nobilitation and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Souls of men. This we discover by Reason,
and our Reason is again more strongly ratify'd by Divine
Suffrage.</p>
               <p>The fourth; That Idolatry, though it be so hainous a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34037:51"/>
Sin, yet where it is committed most in good earnest does
necessarily involve in it Ignorance or Mistake, in the
Act of Worship or in the Object; they either taking
the Object to be God when it is not, or to have some
Attribute of God when it has not, or to enjoy some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of God which yet it does not, or else the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
not to be Divine when it is; or, lastly, they mistake
in the Application of the Worship, thinking they do
not appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Divine Worship to an Object when they do.</p>
               <p>The fifth; That to be mistaken in the Object of
Worship, or in the Kind of Worship, or in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cannot excuse any-thing from being downright Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
forasmuch as none are in good earnest Idolaters
without some of these Mistakes.</p>
               <p>The sixth; That the peculiar Honour or Worship
which is given to God is given to him not so much as
his Honour and Worship, as his Due and Right: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he that does not give it to God, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
it to another, does an injury to the Divine Majesty.
This is plain, and consonant to what was said on the
first Conclusion, That Religion is a kind of Justice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. And indeed if Divine Honour was not
given to God as his Due and Right, it were no Honour
at all, but rather a Benevolence.</p>
               <p>4. The seventh; The Right of that peculiar Honour
or Worship we do to God is grounded either in the
nature of his incommunicable Excellencies, or in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
so far as we know incommunicated to any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or, lastly, in Divine Declaration or Prescription of
the ways or Modes of thus or thus worshipping him,
which himself has some-time set down.</p>
               <p>The eighth; That any Actions, Gestures or Words
directed to any Creature as to an Object, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
imply or signifie either the incommunicable or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
Eminencies of God, is the giving that
Worship that is the Right and Due of God alone to that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34037:51"/>
Creature, and that Injury against the Divine Majesty
which is termed Idolatry. The evidence of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
may appear from hence, because there is no
other way of Application of external Worship than by
directing such significant Actions, Gestures, or Words,
toward such a Being as to an Object.</p>
               <p>The ninth; That the using any of those Actions or
Gestures, or doing any of those things that the true and
supreme God did chuse and challenge in the setting out
the Mode of his own Worship, towards or in reference
to any Creature as to an Object, this also is that Injury
against God which we term Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Reason is this, Because such a mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
does thus manifestly appear to be the peculiar Right
of God, which none can transfer to another but God
himself. Wherefore this Right having not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by him to any other, when-ever such a kind of
Worship is used, it must be used to him, and to none else.</p>
               <p>Nor can his dereliction of any such Mode of being
worshipped warrant the use of it to any Creature after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
because no Creature can be God in those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as he thought fit to institute such a Worship
for himself in: For no Creature can be God at all, and
therefore never capable of any of those Modes of Divine
Worship which God ever at any time instituted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Besides, if this dereliction and disuse of any Mode of
Worship might make it competible to a Creature, then
might we sacrifice Beeves and Sheep (besides other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the Temple) to any Saint or <hi>Daemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The tenth; An omnipercipient Omnipresence,
which does hear and see what-ever is said or transacted
in the World, whether considered in the whole, or as
distributed into <hi>terrestrial, celestial,</hi> and <hi>supercelestial,</hi> not
onely all these Omnipercipiencies but any one of them
is a certain Excellency in God, and, for ought we know,
incommunicated to any Creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34037:52"/>
The eleventh; That this Omnipresence or Omniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipience
<hi>terrestrial</hi> is one main ground of that Religious
Worship due to God which we call Invocation. This
is plain, that upon this very ground that God hears and
sees (though himself be invisible) what-ever is said or
done upon earth, he has the honour of being invoked
any-where or every-where, and of having Temples built
to him; because he that is Omnipresent cannot be
absent from his Temple, but is alway there to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</p>
               <p>The twelfth; That if Omnipresence or Omniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipience,
at least <hi>terrestrial,</hi> (if not <hi>celestial,</hi>) be not
communicated to Saints and Angels by God, the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of either is palpable Idolatry. This is manifest
from the eighth Conclusion. For Invocation implies an
incommunicated Excellency in the Saints or Angels, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o communicates that Right to them that appertains one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God, and is that Injury against God that is called
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>So that it is a vain Evasion that pretends that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God the more in making him so good to the Saints
and Angels, as to bestow this Excellency on them; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
yet his Wisdom has not thought fit so to do. For we
are so far from honouring him hereby, that we injure him
in giving his Right to another; and we dishonour him in
presuming he had done wiselier or better in doing what
he has not done. Whenas indeed, if he were so lavish in
imparting his proper Excellencies to Creatures as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ome
would make us believe he is, to palliate their own Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,
it were the next way to make men forget all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
to God, and to cast him out of their memory,
and take up with the more particular Patronages of Saints
and Angels.</p>
               <p>6. The thirteenth; That our thinking such a Saint or
Angel can hear us where-ever we invoke him, is no
excuse for our Invocation of him, nor saves us from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34037:52"/>
since all Idolatry committed in good earnest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
some Mistake, as has been noted in the fourth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
               <p>The fourteenth; That all the Modes or ways of the
Communication of this Omnipercipiency to Saints or
Angels are either very incredible, if not impossible, or
extremely ridiculous as to any excuse for their Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For the usual Residence of Saints and Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in sede Beatorum,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds, and that
place on the <hi>Coelum Empyreum</hi> above all the Stars, That
the Angels and Saints should upon the account of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altedness
of their natures see and hear from thence, what
is done or said from one side of the Earth to the other,
is extremely incredible, if not impossible; yea, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incredible, or rather impossible, though they had their
abode on this side of the Moon.</p>
               <p>And that they should see all things and transactions,
hear all Prayers and Orations, <hi>in Speculo Divinitatis,</hi> is
alike incredible; a thing which the Humanity of <hi>Christ</hi>
himself, though hypostatically united to the Divinity, did
not pretend to. But that God should either in this <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
or any otherwise advertise them that such a one
prays to them that they would pray to him for that
party, is it not at first sight above all measure ridiculous?</p>
               <p>And alike ridiculous it is to pray to Saint or Angel,
as if they were present and heard our Prayers, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are absent, and cannot tell that we did pray,
unless by some Intelligencers. This Devotion is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and unnatural act, and shews that we do that to an
invisible Creature which is onely proper to be done to
the invisible God; and that therefore it is Idolatry, as
giving that right of Worship to others which is onely
congruous to him.</p>
               <p>7. The fifteenth; That though there were communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by God to Saints and Angels at least a <hi>terrestrial</hi>
Omnipercipiency, yet if he have not communicated the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34037:53"/>
knowledge thereof to us, as most certainly he has not, the
Invocation of them is notwithstanding a very presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
invasion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>indubitable Rights of God,
and the intrenching upon his Prerogatives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as to the internal Act no less than the Sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of this Conclusion are, First, That God
concealing from us the knowledge of the communication
of this Excellency, does naturally thereby intimate that he
would not have them invoked, but reserves the Honour
of our Invocation of an invisible Power unto himself onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That whatsoever is not of faith is sin: and
therefore the ground of Invocation of Saints or Angels
being at least dubitable, their Invocation is sin; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Rights of God in his Worship, what can
it be better esteemed than Idolatry?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Principle of feigning or groundlesly
conceiting, without any Revelation from God, that any
Creatures are capable of such Honours as are God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable
Right and Prerogative, is the Forge and Shop,
the Palliation and Pretense, for infinite sorts and odly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excogitated
varieties of Idolatrous Objects: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so presumptuous and so abominable a Principle,
which is the Mother and Nurse of such infinite ways of
Idolatry and Injustice against God, even according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason ought to be declared against as Idolat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ous;
and consequently, all the practices thereupon are also to
be declared Idolatry, because they spring from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
taken up which is such a fundamental piece of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and Injustice against God, and exposes him to all
manner of Idolatrous Injuries.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To date to do an act we know not whether
it may be Idolatry or no, and this needlesly, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
not all compelling us thereto, this is to dare to
commit Idolatry; and the daring to commit Idolatry,
and so to do defiance to the Majesty of God, what is it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34037:53"/>
less than to be an Idolater? For according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man and the main Morality of the action he is so:
As he is morally a Murtherer that, doubting or not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that it is his own Friend, by luck killed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Enemy: For the sense is, that rather than not be
revenged of his Enemy, he will not stick to kill his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Friend.</p>
               <p>And finally, This Idolatry is the more discernable and
aggravable in the Invocation of Saints or Angels, their
Omnipercipiency being so extremely incredible, if not
impossible or ridiculous, upon any ground, as appears by
the foregoing Conclusion.</p>
               <p>8. The sixteenth; That the erecting of symbolical
Presence with Incurvations thitherward, the consecrating
of Temples and Altars, the making of Oblations, the
burning of Incense, and the like, were declared by the
supreme God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> the manner of Worship
due to him, and therefore, without his Concession, this
Mode of Worship is not to be given to any else; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by Conclusion the ninth.</p>
               <p>The seventeenth; That the Pagans worshipping their
<hi>Daemons,</hi> though not as the supreme God, by symbolical
Presences, Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, and the like,
become <hi>ipso facto</hi> Idolaters. This is manifest from
the ninth, the fifteenth, and the foregoing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth; Though it were admitted that there is
communicated to Saints and Angels at least a <hi>terrestrial</hi>
Omnipercipiency, and that we had the knowledge of this
Communication, and so might speak to them in a civil
way, though unseen; yet to invoke them in such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
as at an Altar, and in a Temple dedicated to
them, or at their symbolical presence, this were palpable
Idolatry. The truth is manifest again from the ninth and
sixteenth Conclusions.</p>
               <p>9. The nineteenth; Incurvation in way of Religion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34037:54"/>
towards any open or bare symbolical Presence, be it
what-ever Figure or Image, as to an Object, is flat Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
in the Worship of Saints, Angels and <hi>Daemons</hi>
double Idolatry; in the Worship of the true God, single.
The reason hereof is resolved partly into the ninth and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Conclusions, and partly into the nature of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Worship. For external Worship is not any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be conceived to be apply'd to asymbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but by being directed towards it as towards an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
Wherefore if Religious Incurvation be directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any Figure or Image as to an Object, this Figure or
Image necessarily Receives this Religious Incurvation, and
partakes with God (if the Image be to him,) in it; which
is manifest Idolatry. For the direction of our Intention
here is but a Jesuitical Juggle. And therefore I will set
down for Conclusion</p>
               <p>The twentieh, That Religious Incurvation toward a
bare symbolical Presence, wittingly and conscienciously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
thither, though with a mental reserve, that they
intend to use it merely as a Circumstance of Worship, is
notwithstanding real Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Reason is, because an external Action toward such
a thing as is look'd upon as receptive of such an Action,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> and has frequently received it) if it be thus or thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
will naturally conciliate the notions or respects of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ction and Object betwixt these two, whether we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
it or no. And it is as ridiculous to pretend that their
motions or actions toward or about such a symbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
are not directed to it or conversant about it as an
Object, as it were for an Archer to contend that the Butt
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oots at is not the Scope or Object, but a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
of his Shooting; and he that embraces his Friend,
that his Friend is not an Object, but a Circumstance, of
his Embracing. Which are Conceits quite out of the
rode of all Logick. See the last Conclusion of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34037:54"/>
10. The twenty-first; That the Adoration of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
which we, out of mistake, conceive to be the true
God made visible by Hypostatical union therewith, is
manifest Idolatry. The Reason is, because Mistake does
not excuse from Idolatry, by Conclusion the fourth and
the fifth. And in this Supposition we miss of one part of
the Object, and the onely part that single is capable of
Divine Honour. For God to be disunited from this ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Object is in this case all one as to be absent: For
God is not considered not intended in this act of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
but as united with this visible Object. Which
respect of Union if it fail, that consideration or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
also fails, and the Worship falls upon a mere
Creature.</p>
               <p>In brief, If out of mistake I salute some lively Statue
or dead body for such or such a living man, though this
Man or his Soul were present, and saw and heard the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
yet I play the fool, and make my self ridiculous,
and an conceived not to have saluted him I would: So if I
do Adoration to any Object, suppose the Sun or some
Magical Statue, for the true Deity visible, when as neither
of them are so, I play the Idolater, and make my self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
and have missed of the due Object of my Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>11. The twenty second; That the Adoration of the
Host upon the presumption that it is Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the living Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is rank Idolatry. This
appears from the precedent Conclusion. To which you
may add, that the <hi>Romanists,</hi> making Transubstantiation
the true ground of their Adoration of the Host, do
themselves imply, that without it were so their Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof would be Idolatry. But that it is not so, and
that their Ground is false, any body may be as well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of as he can of any thing in the world: and no
less assured that they are Idolaters according to their
own Supposition and Implication, as <hi>Costerus</hi> indeed does
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34037:55"/>
most emphatically and expresly acknowledge it, if they be
mistaken in their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> as we
shall hear anon.</p>
               <p>The twenty-third Conclusion; That Adoration given
to the Host by Protestants or any else that hold not Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
is manifest Idolatry. The Reason is to be
fetch'd from the nineteenth and twentieth Conclusions.
For it is Religious Veneration towards a bare corporeal
Symbol of the Divine Presence, and, to make the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more aggravable, towards a Symbol that has Imagery
upon it, and that of the person that is pretended to be
worshipped thereby. What can be Idolatry if this be
not?</p>
               <p>The twenty-fourth; That the Invocation of Saints and
Angels, though attended with these considerations, that
both that Excellency we suppose in them, and which
makes them capable of that Honour, is deemed finite, and
also (be it as great as it will) wholly derived to them
from God, yet it cannot for all this be excused from gross
Idolatry. This is clear from the seventh, eighth, tenth, and
so on till the sixteenth Conclusion. For though this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
be supposed finite, yet if it be so great as that it is
no-where to be found but in God, it is his Right onely to
have such Honours as suppose it. And though it be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or conceived to be derived from God, yet if it be not,
we give an uncommunicate Excellency to the Creature,
and rob God of his Right and Honour. And, lastly,
though this Excellency were communicated, but yet the
Communication of it unreveal'd to us, it were a treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Presumption against the Majesty of God, thus of our
own head to divulge such things as may violate the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Rights of his Godhead, and (for ought we know)
fill the world with infinite bold examples of the grossest
Idolatry: and therefore all our practices upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
must be Idolatrous, and Treasonable against the
Divine Majesty. Consider well the fifteenth Conclusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34037:55"/>
12. The last Conclusion; That this pretended Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that where <hi>Christ</hi> is corporeally present, Divine
Worship is not done to his Humanity, but to his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that therefore, though the Bread should not prove
transubstantiated, the Divine Worship will still be done
to the same Object as before, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Divinity,
which is every-where, and therefore in the Bread; this
will not excuse the Adoration of the Host from palpable
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>For first, That part of the Pretense that supposes Divine
Worship in no sense due or to be done to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
is false. For it is no greater presumption to say,
that in some sense Divine Worship is communicable to
the Humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> then, that the Divinity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
thereto. In such sense then as the Divinity is
communicated to the Humanity, which are one by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical
Union, may Divine Worship also be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it; namely, as an acknowledgment that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
with all its adorable Attributes is hypostatically,
vitally and transplendently residing in this Humanity of
<hi>Christ.</hi> Which is a kind of Divine Worship of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Humanity, and peculiar to him alone, and due to him, I
mean, to his Humanity, though it be not God essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
but onely hypostatically united with him that is;
and does as naturally partake of Religious or Divine
Worship in our Addresses to the Divinity, as the body
of an eminently-vertuous, holy and wise man does of
that great Reverence and civil Honour done to him for
those Excellencies that are more immediately lodged in
his Soul.</p>
               <p>Which Honour indistinctly passes upon the whole man:
And as the very bodily Presence of this vertuous person
receives the civil Honour, so in an easie Analogy doth
the Humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> receive the Divine; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> both as
partial Objects of what they do receive, and with signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the state of the whole case, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34037:56"/>
united, the one with the Divinity, the other with so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
a Soul. Hence they both become due Objects of
that entire external Worship done towards them, to the
one civil, to the other Divine.</p>
               <p>And therefore, in the second place, it is plain, that
there is not one and the same due Object capable of
Religious Worship in either Supposition, as well in that
which supposes the Bread transubstantiated, as in that
which supposes it not transubstantiated. For in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
it is the true and living corporeal Presence of <hi>Christ,</hi>
whose whole <hi>Suppositum</hi> is, as has been declared, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Divine Honour; but in the latter there is onely,
at the most, but his symbolical Presence, whose Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Idolatry, by the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>first
Conclusions.</p>
               <p>And lastly, The pretending that though the Bread be
not transubstantiated, yet the Divinity of <hi>Christ</hi> is there,
and so we do not miss of the due Object of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
this is so laxe an Excuse, that it will plead for the
warrantableness of the <hi>Laplanders</hi> worshipping their Red
cloth, or the <hi>Americans</hi> the Devil, let them but pretend
they worship God in them. For God is also in that Red
cloth and in the Devil in that Notion that he is said to
be every-where. Nay, there is not any Object in
which the ancient Pagans were mistaken, in taking the
Divine Attributes to be lodged there, whether Sun<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Heaven, or any other Creature, but by this Sophistry
the worshipping thereof may be excused from Idolatry.
For the Divine Attributes, as God himself, are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>To direct our Adoration toward a supernatural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
Transplendency of the Divine Presence, or to
any visible corporeal nature that is hypostatically united
with the Divinity, most assuredly is not that sunk and
sottish, that dull and dotardly sin of Idolatry. For, as
touching this latter, to what-ever the Divinity is hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34037:56"/>
united, or (to avoid all cavil about terms) so
specially and mysteriously communicated as it is to <hi>Christ,</hi>
the Right of Divine Worship is proportionably commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
therewith, as I have already intimated. And as for
the former, That through which the Divine Transplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
appears is no more the Object of our Adoration,
than the diaphanous Air is through which the visible
Humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> appears when he is worshipped.</p>
               <p>But the Eucharistick Bread being neither hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
united with the Divinity, nor being the <hi>Medium</hi>
through which any such supernatural Transplendency of
the Divine Presence appears to us, Adoration directed
toward it cannot fail of being palpable Idolatry. For the
Eucharistick Bread will receive this Adoration as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thereof, by Conclusion the nineteenth and twentieth.
But the Adoration or any Divine Worship of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in which the Divine Attributes do not personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
(in such a sense as is intimated in those words of
St. <hi>Iohn, (Ioh. 1. 14.) And the word was made flesh,</hi>) but
onely locally, as I may so speak, this, according to sound
Reason and the sense of the Christian Church, must be
downright Idolatry.</p>

                  <head>Answer to the one and twentieth, and two
and twentieth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>From the fourth and fifth, the Doctor, saith he,
makes a long stride to his one and twentieth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
where he peremptorily concludes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
mistake does not excuse one from Idolatry,
by Conclusion the fourth and fifth: Therefore the
Adoration of any Object, which we out of mistake
conceive to be the true God made visible by Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical
union therewith is mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>est Idolatry. But
let us put the case, saith he, that some Christian
contemporary to Christ our Lord, whilest he sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon Earth, had through mere mistake adored
some other person for Christ. Here the Query a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises,
whether this mans errour would have pleaded
his excuse or no? The reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi>
in their Apology by <hi>Dally</hi> declare for the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
And if this Errour be not Idolatry, he says,
I shall never be able to prove what I aim at in
my twenty-second Conclusion, That any Idolatry is
committed though it should so fall out, that the
Host untransubstantiated were exposed to the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the people. For as no Adoration is here
due, so none is intended, but onely to Iesus Christ
adorable where ever he is. This is the main strength
of his Answer to my twenty first and twenty second
Conclusions.</p>
                  <div type="reply">

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>The long stride that is made, is made by this
Doctor of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not by my self.
I had rather he would have taken my Conclusions
as they lye in order, which he does hugely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to do in this Chapter: But however I am his
servant to attend his motions whither he pleases
within the compass of this little Treatise. And to
his Query upon the propounded case, I Answer,
with the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> if they
speak no further then to the case of this man,
(for I never saw that Apology by <hi>Daille</hi>) that
this mans Errour would have pleaded his excuse:
But not so as to argue him guiltless of Idolatry,
but that his sin of Idolatry is more pardonable in
these Circumstances; pardonable I say, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a fault or sin. And so my fifth Conclusion
holds good; That to be mistaken in the Object of
Worship, or in the kind of Worship, or in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
cannot excuse any thing from being down
right Idolatry, because mistake is necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in any Idolatry that is committed in good
earnest. But the invincibleness of the mistake, the
sudden surprisedness, or inevitable changeableness
of the mistake may be a ground, though not of
making that to be no Idolatry which is, yet of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
the person as to the severity of punishment.
Whence you may see, that it was not for nothing
that my Adversary moulded my fifth Conclusion
into words of his own, that he might the easilyer
have something to Cavil at.</p>

But to let this pass, I say, the Mistake does not
excuse, but the invincibleness, or inevitableness of
the mistake, which it does in all other sins what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
And in all Idolatries whatsoever, besides
these committed in the Christian world, where
ever they are committed upon invincible mistake.
But as amongst the Heathen, those that worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the Sun suppose, taking it to be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God, endued with understanding and
Power, of making and Governing the Universe
(and Millions worshipped him under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as it seems to me were in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably,
by reason of their education and want
of opportunity of knowing better, detained in this
Errour) as these by all men are rightly judged to
have been Idolaters, though more excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>able then
they that have opportunity of knowing better, so
it is in the case of this man my Adversary instances
in, who surprised by an inevitable errour has his
excuse to crave pardon; but it is manifest that he
has committed the fault or rather crime of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
in giving Divine Adoration to him that is
not God. And if this were repeated and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
act in him, he were as errand an Idolater as
the <hi>Persians</hi> other Nations that worshipped the
Sun.</p>
                     <p>For mistake even where it is not essential to a
fault, does not destroy the nature of the fault: as
suppose one having his hat flung off his head to day
by some body he meet with in the streets, and
next day meeting one like the party that did him the
injury, should presently fling his hat off, the mistake
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34037:59"/>
does not take away the nature of this fault so as to
make it no injury to this Party, but onely makes it
more pardonable, it being not intended to an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
person: How then can mistake even in faults
to which mistake is essential change their nature
from being what they are? So that though the
Idolaters of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Ignorance, they would not for all that
cease to be Idolaters, or though they were made
such onely by sudden and inevitable surprise.</p>
                     <p>But this is not their Case, and therefore with the
good leave of my Adversary, I must tell him, the
Case he has put is not at all to the present purpose;
nor that of a Loyal Subject taking <hi>Hephestion</hi> for
<hi>Alexander:</hi> All these Learned fetches will not
serve his turn. The worshipping of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Host with them is neither upon inevitable
surprise, nor invincible Ignorance, nor want of
opportunity of knowing better: For that which is
accustomary, and continual, is not surprise, nor is
that Invincible Ignorance, which common sense,
Scripture and Reason will so easily dissipate in a very
ordinary Capacity. For who, unless he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Power of Diabolical delusion, but can
easily undeceive himself by common sense, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Scripture, that a Wafer which Mice and
Rats will eat, cannot be that adorable <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
God-man, the Creator and Redeemer of us all.
And then for opportunities of knowing better
from others, what irrefragable evidences have the
reformed Churches offered to the contrary, and
how many Thousands have sealed their Testimony
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34037:60"/>
with their very blood? Which is a sufficient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I think, in so easie a Case to undeceive them,
that are not given up, as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to believe a lye, for their want of the love of the
Truth. So that the Adoration given to the Host
upon the presumption of its being Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is most palpable and unexcusable Idolatry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as my twenty second Conclusion infers
from my twenty first, and that from the fourth and
fifth. But to say, as no adoration is here due, so
none is intended, but onely to Jesus Christ, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
where ever he is; is such a laxe Answer and
unsound, that it will excuse the <hi>Persians</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Sun, and indeed all the Idolatries in the
world as well as the Romanists <hi>Artolatria,</hi> or Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship;
which is a manifest Demonstration of
the falsness thereof. For no serious Idolaters give
nor intend any Worship, but such and to such
Objects as they think it due to.</p>

                        </gap> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
in such fair and smooth language, there lyes
some cunning slight, or trick of <hi>Legerdemain</hi> to
impose upon his Reader, and keep the simple still
in Ignorance. And therefore it is seasonable here
to advertize them, That unless he bring evident
proof out of the Holy Oracles of God, out of
some Universal Council, that is really Universal,
and held before the lapsed Ages of the Church, or
from clear and convictive Reason, that an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percipient
Omnipresence, at least <hi>Terrestrial,</hi> is an
excellency communicated to the Saints; that all
what he says will be nothing to the purpose; the
ground of my Argument in those Conclusions
touching the Invocation of Saints, being laid chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34037:61"/>
in this, <hi>That there is no convincing proof of any
such omnipercipiency in the Saints,</hi> but that men do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no violence to their faculties naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Contrary, and condemn the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
as a mere extravagancy. And then secondly,
I advertise this, that though we should prove
there is this omnipercipiency of the Saints, (which
yet he has not proved, and I am well assured can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove) all the rest of my Conclusions will not
Prove insignificant Nothings. For the fifteenth
and eighteenth will have their use still. But I am
well assured his handsom and fair return is so
gentle and civil, that it has not ruffled the least
hair of any of these Conclusions, in that he has
done no execution upon the eighth, tenth, twelfth,
and fifteenth on which the rest depend; which

                  <head>His Answer more particularly to the eighth,
tenth, and twelfth Conclusions.</head>
                  <p>In order to this he casts the Centuries of the Church
into two sorts, into those that were more ancient, not
yet resolved whether the Saints entred into Heaven
before the Day of Iudgement, or were confined to
some other place of rest excluded from the beatifick
vision, and those that are more Modern and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
of that point. The former was the state of
the Church till the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> who cleared
the Point, defining that the Souls of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ead, as
soon as cleansed from all sin, are received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34037:61"/>
and see God clearly as he is in himself. Now
his Argument proceeds in reference to these elder
times thus, As for those elder Centuries, says he,
before the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> they held Invocation
of Saints for an undoubted truth, though some of
them doubted whether they heard our prayers or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>o;
because no Church-definition had as then ascertained
them of their full beatitude; let venerable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
speak for it self by the mouth of a Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
who in his book <hi>De Cura pro mortuis,</hi> cap.
16. speaks thus. This question exceeds the reach of
my judgement, how the Martyrs relieve those who
are certainly assisted by them? Whether they are
present by themselves at the same time in so many
several places where the benefit of their succour is
received? Or being retired from the Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men in some place proportioned to their
Merits, and there interceding for the relief of those
that call upon them, as we pray for the dead
who are not really present with them, and know not
how they are or what they do; God Omnipotent and
ever present, hearing the prayers of the Martyrs,
grants to Men by the Ministry of Angels these helps,
where he will, when he will, and how he will. Thus
B. S. <hi>Austin,</hi> Here we have it, says he, from an
undoubted work of this great Saint and Doctor
(owned by himself in his Retractations:)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That Invocation of Saints was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
avowed practise of those elder and purer
days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> (Contrary to the Doctors fifteenth
Conclusion and all his Pharisaical scruples) here
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34037:62"/>
is a sure and certain ground of this Invocation,
<hi>viz.</hi> Unquestionable, ancient, and immemorial
possession, and the often experienced benefit of
it, by those who addressing themselves to the
holy Martyrs mediation, were (says St. <hi>Austin</hi>)
certainly assisted by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Saints presence at the same
time in so many several places, (which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the Doctors <hi>Terrestrial omnipercipient
Omnipresence</hi>) does not at all in St. <hi>Austins</hi>
opinion, either imply an Impossibility, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
upon any of the Divine excellencies:
for then he would certainly have rejected it;
which yet he does not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Waving this <hi>omnipercipient Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,</hi>
St. <hi>Austin</hi> renders it easily intelligible,
how the Saints might, (even without that, and
without the hearing our prayers) relieve those
that called upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> God omnipotent
and ever present hearing the Prayers of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and granting to Men by the Ministry of
Angels these helps when he will, where he will
and how he will.</p>
                  <p>Out of all which I deduce, <hi>says he,</hi> this Inference
which is home to the point, That if St. <hi>Austin</hi> be
to be credited before Dr. <hi>More,</hi> It is good and
profitable to invocate the Saints, though we know
not whether they heard us or no. And till the
Doctor can prove the contrary, his main Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
upon which he builds (<hi>viz.</hi> That an omniperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient
Omnipresence, is the onely ground of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34037:62"/>
of Saints) is fundamentally subverted, and
all his vapouring pretenses of Idolatry end in smoke
and phancy.</p>

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>It would make even a serious man smile to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
what a fair and handsom return he has made
to the ground of my Argument, comprised in
those four Conclusions. I thought there was
some circumvention and winding about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
in such smooth words. And lo! a marveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fetch of wit, To prove from those Ages (and
this he must prove, or else he proves nothing to the
purpose, that is, to excuse them from Idolatry)
wherein the Church knew not whether the Saints
had any knowledge of our affairs or no, (as vet
not assured whether they enjoyed the beatifick
vision before the day of Judgement) that an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipercipient
Omnipresence was an excellency then
communicated to them; which seems to be the
prospect of his first way of Arguing in general, or
else that we may pray to them though they do
not hear us at all: Which yet is as delirant an
Action, as if one of us here in <hi>England</hi> should
speak to an absent friend in the East Indies.
And yet to invoke the Saints, uncapable of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, is not onely equally absurd, but grosly
Idolatrous; by Conclusion eighth.</p>
                     <p>But let us see if he be more succesfull in his
particular Applications, which I confess to me are
so wondrous subtil, and his Collections from that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34037:63"/>
Quotation of St. <hi>Austin</hi> so marvailous fine, that
the dulness of my sight cannot discern the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
For first that he should collect, that the
Invocation of Saints was the constant and avowed
Practise of those elder days, from that Paragraph of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> is without all ground, and implies that
St. <hi>Austin</hi> understood not his own meaning, and
writ things contrary to his own Judgement. For
himself was an Opposer and disallower of that fond
and Idolatrous Superstition that began to creep up
in his time, and a rejecter of it as a practise Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catholick
and against Scripture. So far was it from
being a constant and avowed Practise in those days.
A position that is both false in it self, nor any way
deducible from any thing here in this Paragraph of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> as it is in the Latine Text. Which
is, <hi>Et tamen generaliter orantibus pro indigentia sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicantium,</hi>
that is, <hi>Praying in general for the relief
or necessities of Suppliants:</hi> Which is not Suppliants
to them, but to God, though at their Memorials.
So that my Adversary in rendring <hi>supplicantium, of
those that call upon them,</hi> has foisted in <hi>them,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the meaning of St. <hi>Austin.</hi> For it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>supplicantium</hi> in him, not <hi>supplicantium ipsis.</hi> Nor
could St. <hi>Austin</hi> disallowing Invocation of Saints
as an Impious Worship, conceive God so ready
to hear their Prayers if they prayed to the Saints.
For God heareth not sinners, nor could be the
Author of so foul a sin, by fullfilling such petitions
by the Ministry of his holy Angels, as is here
said. Wherefore those that Invocated God onely
and Jesus Christ, at the Monuments of the Martyrs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34037:63"/>
might be helped by the Prayers of the Martyrs,
though they themselves were not prayed to. I say,
men making their addresses to God through Jesus
Christ, that they might be delivered from this or
that evil, at the Memorials of the Martyrs might
be healed and relieved, and this imputed some
way to these Martyrs, their Prayers in general for
them, (God having a mind to improve their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for a further propagation of his Church) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to the effect. But that Invocation of
Saints was no allowed nor avowed practise of the
Church in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time is most certain, as
any one may see at large in the Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi>
and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and others, who have bestowed
their pains on this point.</p>
                     <p>And therefore his second Inference is a meer
Vaunt, That here is a sure and certain ground of
Invocation, to wit, unquestionable, ancient, and
immemorial possession, and the often benefit of
it by those, who addressing themselves to the holy
Martyrs mediation were certainly assisted by them,
and that in those times when they knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they heard their Prayers or no, whereby he
would subvert the Truth of my fifteenth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But it is apparent, if you Read those who are
impartial searchers of Antiquity; that this ground
my Adversary alledges is a very rotten and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
ground, which as it is not asserted by St. <hi>Austin</hi>
here, so is it disapproved by him else where, and
condemned as a wicked superstitious Innovation,
begun amongst weak and ignorant Souls, against
the sense and tenour of Scripture, and practise of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34037:64"/>
the Catholick Church. And that therefore those
helps that were afforded at the Monuments of
the Martyrs, were to them that made their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to God through Jesus Christ. But if any
happened to any that prayed to the Martyrs, it
might well be either an Accident in Nature, or
some officious delusion of the Devil, to plunge
the Church into further Apostasie. So little force
is there in this second Inference from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
of either avowed practise or effect, in the
Age of St. <hi>Austin</hi> before the beatifick vision of the
Saints was ratified, to enervate my fifteenth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
But on the contrary, if the Church had
ratified the Invocation of Saints upon no assurance
they had of their hearing our Prayers, they had
notoriously lapsed the Christian World into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
And as many as took up that custom in
those days, were assuredly Idolaters, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
defines of his <hi>Collyridians.</hi> So that the Sallies of
my Adversary hitherto are in vain.</p>
                     <p>And now for the third Inference, Does St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
doubting of the Martyrs, after what manner
they yield their help to those that are helped
by them, <hi>Vtrum ipsiper seipsos adsint, uno tempore

another, and a semicircle, or at least a quadrant,
distant in the surface of the Earth, if we reckon
more places then two. For the motion must be
either unconceivably <hi>swift,</hi> or the Saint intirely
divided into two whole Saints in two distinct places
at once. This I believe would have seemed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
less then impossible to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and plainly to
entrench upon the Omnipresence of God; sure I

St. <hi>Austin</hi> does but onely doubt, it is sufficient
for me. For if we be not certain of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percipient
Omnipresence of the Saints, we have
no warrant nor right to invoke them, as doing
that honour to them, which is the undoubted
Privilege of God, and thereby incurring the crime
of Idolatry, by Conclusion fifteenth. For if there
be no such omnipercipient Omnipresence commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to the Saints; it is plain from Conclusion, 12.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34037:65"/>
That it is Idolatry. But if we know not whether
this omnipercipient Omnipresence be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
or no to them, then when we adventure to
invocate them, we know not whether we commit
Idolatry or no, that is, we do a doubtfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
action, and act not out of faith. But he
that acts not out of faith does sin, and sins specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
that sin, which he doubts whether he so doing
commits or no. As if he doubt whether such a
thing be Extortion, and yet do it, he commits the
sin of Extortion. So he that does an act which he
knows not whether it is Idolatry or no, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the sin of Idolatry in adventuring to do it,
as to the inward man; but the Saints having no
such Omnipercipiency, (as any one that is free
from Superstition cannot but be easily assured
of) it is Idolatry both as to the inward and the
outward.</p>
                     <p>And now for his fourth Inference; That wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this omnipercipient Omnipresence, St. <hi>Austin</hi>
renders it easily intelligible, how the Saints might
relieve them that call upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> God om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
and ever present hearing the Prayers of
the Martyrs, and granting to men by the Ministry
of Angels those helps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have above plainly
shown that St. <hi>Austin</hi> asserts no such thing as the
Invocation of Saints in this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> or that the
Saints are called upon; But God being called upon
at the Memorials of the Saints by suppliants, and
the Saints praying in general for us, God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to send relief to his suppliants by the Ministry
of Angels. This is all that is affirmed by St. <hi>Austin;</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34037:65"/>
which makes nothing to the proving, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to St. <hi>Austin,</hi> though the Saints do not
hear our Prayers, yet we may Pray unto them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore his general Conclusion of all
which he so exults in, and says is so home to the
Point, (<hi>viz.</hi> That if St. <hi>Austin</hi> be to be credited
before Dr. <hi>More;</hi> It is good and profitable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
the Saints though we know not whether
they hear us or no) is a Castle in the Air, and
stands upon no Foundation, since all the four Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that should sustain it are fallen into dust. For
neither does St. <hi>Austin</hi> say, That it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and avowed practise of those elder and purer
days to invoke the Saints, not that any received
help from the Martyrs by invoking them, nor does
he assert, but doubt of the omnipresence Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of the Saints; nor is it credible, but upon better
consideration he as well as <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
would have concluded it impossible; nor last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does he affirm, that God by the Ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
did relieve them that prayed to the Saints, but
onely such as at the Memorials of the Saints prayed
to himself.</p>
                     <p>But I will not content my self with this, but I
will further add; That if St. <hi>Austin</hi> and Dr. <hi>More</hi>
be to be believed before this Doctor of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is very ill and pernicious to
invocate the Saints whether they hear us or no.
And concerning my own Judgment, I think this
Doctor of <hi>Rome</hi> will confess there is no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
Now for the Judgment of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> I think
he sufficiently declares himself, in his <hi>De Civitate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34037:66"/>
Dei,</hi> Book 22. chap. 10. <hi>We build no Temples,</hi>
says he, <hi>to our Martyrs as to Gods, but Memorials,
as to dead Men, whose Spirits are alive with God;
nor do we there erect Altars on which we Sacrifice to
the Martyrs, but to that one and Common God of
the Martyrs and us. At which Sacrifice the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
as Men of God, who by the confession of him
have overcome the World, are recited in their place
and order, but not invoked by the Priest that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth.</hi>
And in his 42. Epistle, <hi>You see,</hi> saith he,
<hi>the most eminent head of the most Renouned Empire,
stooping with his Diadem, and Praying at the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>hre
of</hi> Peter <hi>the Fisherman, namely, to God himself
it is that he prayes, though at the Monument of</hi> Peter.
And lib. 1. Confes. chap. 42. <hi>whom may I find that
should reconcile me to thee? was I to go to the Angels?
with what Supplication? with what Sacraments? many
indeavouring to return unto thee? and of themselves
being not able, have, as I hear, attempted such things,
and have been thought worthy to be ill-used,</hi> &amp;c.
And is there not the same Reason of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and nvocation of Saints. And against <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi>
lib. 2. cap. 8. he says, <hi>That if St.</hi> John
<hi>should say, You have me a Mediatour with the Father,
I pray for your sins (as</hi> Parmenian <hi>would have the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                           </gap> to be a Mediatour betwixt God and the people)
who would look upon him as an Apostle of Christ, but
as Antichrist.</hi> And in the same place, <hi>For if</hi> Paul
<hi>were a Mediatour, the rest of the Apostles would be
so too; and if there were many Mediatours, how
would that of</hi> Paul <hi>agree, who says their is one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
&amp;c.</hi> And we know that Invocation in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34037:66"/>
most modest sense, is for the Mediation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Saints, that they may intercede for
us. In a word if you consult St. <hi>Austin,</hi> he is so
far from approving Invocation of Saints, that he is
a diligent Opposer of it, as you may see more at
large in <hi>Chemnitius.</hi> And still, which will make
my Adversaries Argument weaker and weaker, if
St. <hi>Austin</hi> had been an approver of it, yet that
would not have proved, that it had been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and an avowed practise of those purer times,
from the Apostles to St. <hi>Austins</hi> Age; there being
for 360 Years after Christ no Testimony for any
such thing, none of the Fathers appearing for
it, but determining point blank against it. But
the Apostasie being to come in according to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
about 400 Years after Christ; if any
Father, and St. <hi>Austin</hi> amongst the rest, should
write any thing in favour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

would avail nothing with the prudent and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced.

prove, that it is not good nor profitable to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the Saints, than what I have subnected to my
fifteenth Conclusion. which sufficiently proves it
is a sin: And I think sin will be held by no good
Christian either good or profitable.</p>
                     <p>And thus you see my Antagonist full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> routed
in his first method of attempting my four chief
Conclusions, <hi>viz.</hi> the eighth, tenth, twelfth, and
fifteenth, he pretending that invocation of Saints
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34037:67"/>
may be without Idolatry, though we know not
whether they hear us or no; which was a more
oblique and incongruous Method, and less likely
to bring about what he would have.</p>

                     </gap>e have a certain or sufficient knowledge, that the
Saints have at least a Terrestrial Omnipercipiency,
and hear all those that pray to them; which they,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, most certainly do. 1. From their blissfull
vision of God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> not gainsaid by Protestants, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> 2ly. It is
to be proved by the appearance of Devils upon the
Invocation of Witches and Sorcerers. 3ly. From
the Aequality of the Saints with the Angels, <hi>Mat.
22. 30. 4ly.</hi> And lastly, From the weakness of the
Objections taken from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ncredibility of the
Modes of this Omnipercipiency of the Saints. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>potest constare de re quando non constat
de Modo rei,</hi> which I allow to be a sound Maxime.
This is the sum of all the force he has to make out
a certain or sufficient assurance, that the Saints
hear our prayers: Which by the way is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of every particular Saint that is called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by chance, or else its little to the purpose. And then
again it is worth the nothing, That if it were possible
to bring certain or sufficient proof, that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34037:67"/>
Invocation is competible to them, which the
Circumstances of the Romish VVorship argue to be
given to them, but onely a civil calling to, or ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to do this or that. For no honour bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

civil is due to them, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself up and
down asserts. And it is further to be noted, that if
they do not hear us, the Invocation then is not civil,
but non-sensical, and which is worse, Idolatrous, by
Conclusion twelfth. And therefore let us examine
particularly the Arguments he produces to make
good the contrary, namely that they do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ear, and
we should add, by the intrinsick vertue of that

them a pleasant rest, and enjoyment of the Divine
favour before then?</p>
                     <p>But the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> a general or Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Council, has determined the point, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may be certain that the Saints do already
enjoy the beatifick Vision. The words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
sentence, as is supposed, of the Council, are,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>.
<hi>To see clearly the Triune God himself as he is.</hi> And the
<hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> the clear Looking-glass of the
Trinity is answerable to this stile of the Council.
So that I must contess, if there be sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in this Council, my Adversary has so fast
hold of me, that I must acknowledge that they
have determined, That purified Souls do enjoy the
beatifick Vision before the day of Judgment. But
there are many things that make me think that this
Council has not authority enough to assure any
prudent man that this Position is true.</p>
                     <p>For first it determines also for Transubstantiation
and the universal Supremacy of the Pope, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to have the Power and right of ruling and
governing the whole Church. The former of which
is manifestly impossible, the latter grosly injust a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ the only universal head of the Church,
and against the particular supreme Heads of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Nations and Kingdoms, over whom this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
declares the Pope set over to govern as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.
Which by how much more it seems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Popes immoderate ambition, by so much
it seems more certainly to deviate <hi>de via Spiritus
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> and show the Council not to be infallible but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34037:68"/>
rather actually Erroneous. And if they were so in
these things that are more obvious and discernible,
<hi>viz.</hi> That a wafer or a piece of bread is not Jesus
Christ the Son of God, Nor the Pope the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Soveraign of all Christendom; may not any one
justly wonder how they became Infallible in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
what is the state of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
themselves having never looked into that
Looking-glass of the Trinity, nor experienced what
it is to see God as he is. <hi>Mat. 5. 8. Blessed are the
pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> And again, <hi>psal. 17.
15. When I awaken into thy likeness, I shall be satisfied
therewith,</hi> viz. with the Eternal Righteousness of
God, whereby we become like him, and so see him
as he is.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If this opinion of the beatifick Vision
had been true, and usefull for the excusing of the
Church from Idolatry in the Invocation of Saints,
as my Adversary seems to insinuate, surely the Holy
Ghost would have revealed it more timely. For this
Council of <hi>Florence</hi> was not held till about 1440 or
50 years after Christ; wherefore it coming so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
late, it is a sign, it is onely a device found
out by men to stop the mouths of them that object
against the Invocation of Saints, from their Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of hearing our Prayers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Besides these flaws, the certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>y and
infallibility of this Council is blasted from the clear
prediction of the Apostasy of the Church after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
400 or 500 years after Christ. And therefore
we Protestants do well to have no great regard to
any more then the four first general Councils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:34037:69"/>Fourthly and lastly, Though this Council had
the face and appearance of a free Oecumenical
Council, it was not at all so in reality and Truth.
The Greek Bishops and others of that Clergy,
being many ways necessitated against their own
Judgments and Consciences to subscribe that form,
which the Emperour <hi>Iohannes Paleologus</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
the Patriarch had upon politick Ends, with
some few others, contrived. So that <hi>Sylvester Sgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropalus</hi>
a person of singular integrity and Judgment,
and a perpetual witness of the transactions of that
Council, as in particular he has noted, how the
the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was denied his <hi>Florens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was so inflexible to the purposes of the
Pope. How the Latines produced a false and
adulterate Creed of the seventh general Council,
affirming that it was so read <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> with
the addittament of <hi>Filio<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan>
                        </hi> in that Council. How
the Emperor observing that his Clergy was for the
greatest part of them against the Latine Church in
their votes, found a device to deprive all of votes
but the Bishops and <hi>Coenobiarchae.</hi> How falsely and
fraudulently they read the places of the Fathers,
mutilating them, and mangling them as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and was most for their purpose. How that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

made vote-less. And lastly, when by these arts
they had got a plurality to declare for <gap reason="foreign">

and the Emperour made a long speech extolling
the present Synod, and delivering his own suffrage
to close all: How his Greyhound that constantly
followed him to the Council, and lay on a silk
cushion wrought with Gold, at the Emperors feet
every Session, and in so many Sessions had lain still,
both when the Emperour spake, and also others,
did now so soon as the Emperour began to speak
set up a shril howling note, modulated to the very
cadences of the Emperours Oration, nor could
they by any sneaping of him, or threatning him,
keep him from so doing: Which, <hi>says he,</hi> many

was so much as disputed in the Synod: But
the Emperour with some few of his own, the

is sufficiently evident already how little ground
there is in this <hi>Florentine</hi> Council, to found any mans

and to venture on so hainous a sin as Idolatry,
as certainly Invocation of Saints is, be it called civil

Worship or Religious; if they hear us not, when the
Authority of this Council is so uncertain or rather
null, which my Adversary would make use of to
prove that they do hear us, because purified Souls
injoy the beatifick Vision before the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to that Councils determination.</p>
                     <p>And if my Adversary would teach his Party here
to evade, by saying what ever this Council may
prove, it is well known that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
has concluded the same opinion; I Answer, that
the three first things alledged against the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Florence,</hi> are also alledgeable against the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and besides they have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for the Communion in one kind, and for the
worshipping of Images, expresly against the word of
God, whereby we cannot but be well assured of
their Fallibility. Besides that it is evident at it is
neither a free nor general Council, but a company
of men contrived together for the Interest of the
Pope, thirteen new Cardinals, all <hi>Italians,</hi> being
made by him at a clap toward the end of the Synod,
besides much garbling of the Council before. And
the Holy Ghost is also said at the time of their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

to adventure to commit so hainous a crime as
Idolatry, upon so weak a pretence as the Authority
of such a Council, what can be more horrid?</p>
                     <p>Butadmit the Saints do enjoy the beatifick Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how is it proved that the beatifick Vision is
such as implies the sight and hearing of all visible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34037:71"/>
and audible Objects here on Earth, or that to a
meer Creature it would be any happiness at all,
but rather an unhappiness and a burdensom and
unseasonable distraction.
<q>Din quis vivendo multa quae non volt videt.</q>
Wherefore it is most reasonable to conceive,
that onely such things are exhibited to them by
God, as they are particularly concerned in. And
that all things and Persons of this caliginous
Globe, are not obtruded on them in the beatifick
Vision, where there is infinitely more then will
fill them of better Objects. And therefore the
beatifick Vision as to this Point, will amount to
no more then to one of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>odes of the Saints
knowing when we pray unto them; which I
think I have not without cause declared to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
and absurd as to the solving of this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in my fourteenth Conclusion. And we may
further here take notice, that they make God an
abettour of a very incongruous Act, the putting up
Prayers to a finite invisible Power, which of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
knows not whether he be prayed to or no, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God be so officious as to give him notice of it.
The thing therefore is so incredible in it self, and
supported by so weak Authority of the <hi>Florentine</hi>
and <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councils, that no certain or suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
assurance can from hence be had thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now for the next Argument, fetch'd from the
Devils appearing upon the Invocation of Witches
or Sorcerers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> I conceive it has little force to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34037:71"/>
prove that any particular Saint invocated by name,
does presently of himself hear the lnvocations of
his Clients, though some be in <hi>America,</hi> others
in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> others in <hi>Italy</hi> at the same time.
Which I deny that any particular Devil can do:
And therefore the Inference will be infirm, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that Saints hear the Prayers of their Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
when they are particularly called upon, and
at whatsoever distant parts of the Earth at the same
time; because some particular Devils hear Sorcerers
so, when there is no proof they do. Any particular
Devil may step in if Magically invoked, to delude
a sinner, and when Covenant is once made, that
very Familiar by name may be ready to assist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
invoked; but this falls very short of proving,
that a Devil let him be at what distance he will
from a Suppliant, that he hears, or that he can hear
and assist many Thousands of Suppliants in many
Thousand far distanced places at once. Which
Incapacity not onely of a Devil but a Saint
makes their Invocation Idolatry by Conclusion
twelfth.</p>
                     <p>But at last my Adversary knocks at the door of
the most important Topick of all, for the proof of
the Saints knowing the Prayers of their Suppliants;
I mean the holy Scripture, and if he produces any
place there to prove they hear when we speak
to them: I will so far forth yield up the cudgels
to him, as to acknowledge a civil calling to them,
or desiring them to do this or that for us, that is
really in their power to effect, may not be absurd.
The place he cites is <hi>Matth,</hi> 22. 30. The Saints are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34037:72"/>
as the Angles of God in Heaven, says he, and of
the Angels it is written, <hi>See ye despise not one of
these little ones, for I say unto you, their Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                           </gap> see the face of my Father which is in
Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18. 10. And again, <hi>There shall
be joy in Heaven upon one sinner that repenteth,</hi>
Luke 15. 7.</p>
                     <p>To the latter I Answer first, if it were the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Angels, through the excellency of their
own nature, to know at what distances soever they
are at when men prayed to them, why was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Angels laid asleep all the time of the
Mosaical Law? and why spoken against by the
very Gospel? or what warrant has the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to invoke Saints, more then the <hi>Iews</hi> to
invoke Angels? But moreover I Answer to that of
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. The sense, of <hi>the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
always seeing the face of Christs Father which is
in Heaven,</hi> is not, that by enjoying the sight of
God they obtain thereby a terrestrial Omniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiency,
and see and hear all things transacted
here on Earth; but the phrase of seeing the face
of Christs Father in Heaven, signifies, that they
are those Angels that also Minister and wait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and are Assistents at the Divine <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china</hi>
or that inimitable glory whereby God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
himself to the Angels and blessed Spirits, and
gives Oracles for the ministration of his Kingdom.
The Angels I say, that assist holy men on Earth,
are of so great excellency, that they are in Heaven
part of the <hi>Satellitium</hi> that always wait on God
who is in Heaven; which also implies that they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34037:72"/>
are one while on Earth, another while in Heaven,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>cending and descending to negotiate the affairs
of the Church, receiving Oracles and commands
from the Divine <hi>Schechina.</hi> But instead of these
Oracles of importance, if the Divine <hi>Schechina</hi>
should tell St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Apollonia,</hi>
and the rest of the Saints ever when any pray to
them in such infinite distinct places, and some great
numbers put together, praying to some or other of
the Saints, let any indifferent man judge how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
it is. It is sufficient in the mean time,
that no such terrestrial Omnipercipiency is to be
proved in the Angels from this Text. Nor do's <hi>Luk.</hi>
15. 7. imply any such thing. For the Angels ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and descending as <hi>Iacob</hi> saw them in his Divine
Vision, on the ladder that reached from Earth to
Heaven, those that ascend from Earth tell them in
Heaven of the good news of converted sinners, and
so this Text implies no such terrestrial Omniperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piency
as my Adversary would insinuate. But then
in the last place, suppose this terrestrial Omniperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pency
were competible to the Angels, it does not
follow from <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30. that the Saints already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it. For the entire Text runs thus, <hi>For in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> But I hope my
Adversary will not, with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Resurrection is past; and if not so, he must
acknowledge even from this Text himself produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that this Angelical priviledge of the Saints, in
seeing all things in the face of God, is yet to come,
if there were at all any such Angelical priviledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34037:73"/>The last thing he alledges for this Point, is the
weakness of our Objections from the Modes of
this Omnipercipiency of the Saints; because, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
constare de re quando non constat de modo rei.</hi>
But I answer, Ã  <hi>posse ad esse non valet consequentia.</hi>
If we had indeed the like assurance of the thing
it self, That one particular Saint invocated by
never so many, and at never so far distant places
at once, did hear the Prayers of all those Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
as we have of the Divinity of Christ and
the Triunity of the God-head, then though I could
not reach the particular Mode how it was, yet I
would believe it. But when all manner of Modes
producible of a thing seem absurd and incredible,
and in the mean time there is no assurance of the
Reality of the thing it self, it argues great levity of
mind to give belief to such a thing that it at all is.
And it is not meer levity in things of such great
Importance, as the Rights of God, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Idolatry, but an irreligious and giddy
Temerity; Which I pray God keep all men
from.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is very apparent, that his
attempts against my eighth, tenth, twelfth, and
fifteenth Conclusions are frustraneous, and that
they stand as firm as ever, he haying neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that we may invocate the Saints, we being
uncertain whether they hear us or no, nor yet
proved it certain that they do hear us; which
were the two Methods whereby he could have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined
these four Conclusions. And therefore
they standing firm, still it is manifest from his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34037:73"/>
own supposal, that the other seven, <hi>viz.</hi> the sixth,
seventh, eleventh, thirteenth, fourteenth, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,

also. We proceed now to his Answers to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

which God did chuse to set out the Mode of his
own Worship by, (for Incurvation of the body
in general is neither Religious nor Civil, but

a symbol of the external Object. But let that go;
Though it be a symbol, yet it is very unnatural
to conceive it a symbolical Presence, not is any
where called so, nor accounted so by any one.
Besides, a symbolical Presence must be a standing
permanent representation of that which it is the
symbolical Presence of, consecrated and intended
for that purpose. How unna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Name of Jesus were a symbolical Presence of one
kind, as my Adversary phrases it; so long as it is not
of that kind my nineteenth Conclusion speaks of,

it to the purpose? Or if it were included, unless that

                  <head>His Answer to the twentieth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>To me, this Conclusion, saith he, seems big with a
spirit of contradiction, as being manifestly against
Scripture, against the practise of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and lastly against Dr. <hi>More</hi> himself.
First, Against Scripture, As is manifest, (besides what
we have said, says he, in Answer to the last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of the first Chapter) from the Incurvation
the Scripture commands to the Name of Jesus, which
is as much a Religious Incurvation as any we give
to t'ose symbolical Presences called Images.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who
bow the knee at the Eucharist to the bare Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or symbolical Presence of Christs natural flesh
and blood; and therefore they useing this Religious
Incurvation towards a symbolical Presence, are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;
Nor can excuse themselves by a mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
they intending it onely as a circumstance of
their Worship, because that is declared Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in this very Conclusion and the foregoing one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, This Conclusion is against my
self, Because my sixteenth Conclusion openly avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That the erecting of a symbolical Presence with
Incurvation thitherward, was declared by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34037:76"/>
God the God of <hi>Israel</hi> one of the manners of
worship due to him; but my twentieth runs coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and stifly presseth, That Religious Incurvation
towards a symbolical Presence (without exception of
any) wittingly and conscientiously directed thither, is
real Idolatry. These two Conclusions, saith he, are
as perfect a contradiction, as to say, All Religious
Incurvation toward a symbolical Presence is Idolatry,
Not all Religious Incurvation toward a symbolical
Presence is Idolatry.</p>

                     <p>To all which three I Reply, and First to the first,
That what he has said in Answer to the last Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of my first Chapter, I have replied to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
and plainly proved there is nothing therein
that clashes with the Scripture. And as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
so I again repeat, that we are not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bow to the name of Jesus, but, if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of any external Ceremony, onely at the
name of Jesus; and with all, though the Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
be Religious, that his name is no symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Presence, as I declared before. Never any one
phancied a name any such thing, so that it is a meer
shift to amuze the ignorant.</p>
                     <p>To the Second, that the Bread and Wine are
no symbolical Presence or Figure of the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ, nor do I know that any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
hold that any Blood or Flesh of Christ not
actuated by his humane Spirit, nor joyned with the
Divinity is capable of Divine or Religious Worship,
sith nothing is capable thereof but God. But a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34037:76"/>
symbolical Presence is the representation of some
Person or thing, erected to represent the thing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Person conceived by them that erect it, adorable'
But we do not conceive the Body of Christ killed
and Sacrificed, and his Blood shed out of his Body
adorable; unless it could be proved, what yet is
impossible, that it was even then Hypostatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with God, when it was disunited from the Soul.
So that the broken Bread and the Wine are but
commemoration tokens of the Body of Christ kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Crucified, and his Blood shed for us, this
commemoration being as it were a feast upon a
Sacrifice, as the Apostle intimates, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lamb is perfectly slain. Nor is any man on
his knees at the Communion in order to direct
their kneeling to the Bread or Wine in any sense,
but they are on their knees afore hand in their
Prayers and Devotions to God and Christ, and it
is <hi>ex accidenti,</hi> as I may so speak, that they are on
their knees when they receive the holy symbols;
So far are they from wittingly and conscientiously
directing any Religious Worship toward them:
but the symbols are brought to them in such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
as the Communicant is found in at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
whose face happily was not so much as
derected to the Communion Table while he was
at his Devotion, and his heart, as it is said, <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
corda,</hi> wholly carryed to Heaven. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
is a pretty gird of my Adversary, and a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
justling me as it were against my own Church
as much as he can; But it is manifest that what
I have here delivered in this Conclusion is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34037:77"/>
agreeable enough with the Rites of our own
Church, as well as with Truth it self.</p>
                     <p>To the third I Answer, That my twentieth
Conclusion is not truly recited. For my words run
thus, <hi>That Religious Incurvation toward a</hi> bare <hi>sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Presence, wittingly and conscientiously directed
thither, &amp;c.</hi> He has left out the most emphatical
word in the sentence, <hi>viz. [bare</hi>]. And hence
you see how unseasonable his Parenthesis is, [with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception of any] For when I restrain my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
to <hi>bare</hi> symbolical Presences, it is evident
that I except those that are covered and concealed
from the eyes of the people; As the Cherubins
were on the Ark of the Covenant. So that it was
a great oversight, to say no worse, in my Adversary
to leave out that Monosyllabon which was of such
principal signification in the sentence. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, as it was manifestly in and before his eyes,
in the Conclusion he pretends to consute, this
twentieth Conclusion is no contradiction at all to
the sixteenth. All Religious Incurvation towards
a bare symbolical Presence is Idolatry, says this
twentieth Conclusion: But does the sixteenth say,
Not all Religious Incurvation toward a bare sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Presence is Idolatry? It says no such thing.
But does onely imply that some symbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
may be bowed towards without Idolatry,
as that over the Ark of the Covenant, it being not
bare or open, but hid from the eyes of the people;
nor yet that bowed to as to an Object neither,
but onely as a circumstance of Worship. Let the
Reader judge how heedlesly at least, if not disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34037:77"/>
my Adversary has dealt with me in this
assault, and withall how firmly and clearly I have

                     <p>His Answer is marvellous lofty and full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciency
towards his Antagonist, and all of his
mind. But I do not impute this so much to the
pride of my Adversary as to his cunning and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that he may by this Scheme of confidence
keep his Parties devotions warm to the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the most blessed and ever adorable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as he phrases it: And we indeed will also
acknowledge the consecrated bread, an holy and
blessed symbol of the body of Christ, but we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
onely our Celestial Lord and King, who sits
at the right hand of his Father in glory; and
take it as a great reproach done to him, that
those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion should pretend that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34037:78"/>
a morsel of Bread or a Waser, after a few words
of the Priest should become this Lord of glory. And
meaner and more petty Nibblers than we, even
those small and contemptible Animals, ordinarily
called Mice, offer such an Argument against so
grand an Absurdity as may well puzzle the subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
of your School-Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> How this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Host, if it be Christ himself in his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Person, should suffer himself to be eaten up
by a Mouse: You will say, that the Mouse onely
eats up the species or external shew of a Body not
any real Body at all, and that though Christ be
contented to go along with the species when Men
eat the Sacrament, yet if a Mouse light on it, as
soon as she nibbles at it he slips out of the way. I
must confess I know no other subter-fuge but
this</p>
                     <p>But this seems to me a meer shift, Nor do I think
that any will deny, but that if the Mouses stomach
were searched presently after she has eaten this
consecrated Bread, that the Bread, or call it the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
will be found there, and certainly endewed
with such Attributes as are the specifick Attributes
of Body, that is with <hi>Divisibility</hi> and <hi>Impenetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
which being the essential and specifick Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
whereby Body is Body, it is plain, that what
they call species is really a Body or substance; but
the Body or substance of the Bread is transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated
into the Body of Christ, therefore it is
evident that the Body of Christ is in the belly of
the Mouse, if Transubstantion be true. Which
plain consideration methinks, might be sufficient
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34037:78"/>
to awaken any one that is not in a very dead sleep
or incurable Lethargy out of all conceit that a
consecrated Water does become Personally and
Corporeally Christ himself. For if it be He, though
he humbled himself indeed so very extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the behalf of us Men, yet it is not at all
credible, that he would make himself so vile and
cheap as to suffer himself to be devoured by a
Mouse.</p>
                     <p>And if this Argument chance to be less pleasing,
yet the recalling it to my memory is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the scornfull expressions of my Adversary,
who makes us such petty Niblers in our argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
Whenas if he had not overlooked, in this
lofty mood of his, my twenty first Conclusion, this
twenty second could not but have appeared to him
perfect demonstration, upon the suposal that
Transubstantiation is but a conceit, and no solid
Truth; which is the main Argument of the next

For Protestants indeed to adore the Sacrament who
believe no Corporeal presence of Christ there,
would be a like Crime, as for an unconverted
Iew to adore Iesus Christ in whom he believes
not. But what is this to the Doctors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                     <p>My Antagonist here acknowledges it a great sin,
even a Crime in a Protestant to adore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as for the Jew to adore Jesus Christ,
when he does not believe on him. Let me then
here note by the by, how great a Crime it is in
them, who as much as in them lyes, force men
to commit so great a sin by their unchristian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions.
But I would ask further what Crime it
is that the Jew and Protestant here commit. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Jew's can be no less then Idolatry in the
internal, being that he has assented to the practise
of what he thinks in his own Conscience is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
the giving of Divine Worship to a meer

that adores the Sacrament, But the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being not Christ, he is also guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

of some Particulars wherein, according to these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be manifestly
found guilty of Idolatry, and that according to the very
Definitions of their own Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> As first, in
the Point of the Adoration of the Host, touching which
the very words of the Council are, <hi>Latriae cultum, qui

                  <note place="margin">Concil. Trident.</note>

               </p>
               <p>2. This confident Injunction of gross Idolatry, as it
is certainly such, is built upon their confidence of the
truth of their Doctrine of Transubstantiation. For the
Chapter of the Adoration of the Host succeeds that of
Transubstantiation, as a natural, or rather necessary, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
therefrom. <hi>Null<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

&amp;c. That is to say, The Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
being established, there is no Scruple left
touching the Adoration of the Host, or giving Divine
Worship to the Sacrament (or <hi>Christ,</hi> as it is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34037:80"/>
when it is carried about, and exposed publickly in
Processions to the view of the people.</p>
               <p>But the Doctrine of Transubstantiation being false, it
must needs follow, that the giving of Divine Worship to
the Host is as gross a piece of Idolatry as ever was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the common sense and apprehension of all men, even of
the meanest Idiots.</p>
               <p>5. But now let us examine it according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the learned, and of all their Arts and Sciences,
<hi>Physicks, Metaphysicks, Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Logick.</hi> It
is a Principle in <hi>Physicks,</hi> That that internal space that
a Body occupies at one time is equal to the Body that
occupies it. Now let us suppose one and the same body
occupy two such internal places or spaces at once;
This Body is therefore equal o those two spaces, which
are double to one si gle space; wherefore the body is
double to that body in one single space, and therefore
one and the same body double to it self. Which is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
Contradiction.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> The body of <hi>Christ</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
one, and that as much as any one body else in
the world. Now the Metaphysical Notion of <hi>one</hi> is, to
be <hi>indivisum Ã <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as well as <hi>divisum Ã  quolibet alio.</hi> But the Body of Christ
being both in Heaven, and without any continuance of
that body, here upon Earth al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>o, the whole body is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the whole body, and therefore is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>6, Thirdly, in <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ematicks;</hi> The Council saying
that in the separation of the parts of the <hi>Species,</hi> (that
which bears the outward show of Bread or Wine,)
that from this Division there is a parting of the whole,
divided into so many entire Bodies of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Body
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34037:81"/>
of <hi>Christ</hi> being always at the same time equal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> to it self, it
follows, that a part of the Division is equal to the whole,
against that common Notion in <hi>Euclide,</hi> That the Whole
is bigger then the Part.</p>
               <p>And, lastly, in <hi>Logick</hi> it is a Maxime, That the Parts
agree indeed with the Whole, but disagree one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
But in the abovesaid Division of the Host or
Sacrament the Parts do so well agree, that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
the very same individual thing. And whereas any
Division, whether <hi>Logical</hi> or <hi>Physical,</hi> is the Division of
some one into many; this is but the Division of one into
one and it self, like him that for brevity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Text into one Part.</p>
               <p>To all which you may add, that, unless we will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of two <hi>Sosia's</hi> and two <hi>Amphitruo's</hi> in that sense that
the mirth is made with it in <hi>Plautus</hi> his Comedy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Bread nor the Wine can be transubstantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

not. Now the individual Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is to be made of
the Wafer consecrated, for it is turned into his individual
Body. But his individual Body was before this Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Which is against that fundamenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Principle in <hi>Logick</hi> and
<hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> That both parts of a Contradiction cannot

be, at once.</p>
               <p>Thus fully and intirely contradictious and repugnant
to all Sense and Reason, to all indubitable Principles of
all Art and Science, is this Figment of Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

All is, <hi>Hoc est, corpus meum,</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> held the Bread

in doing whereof he swallow'd his
whole Body down his throat at once,
according to the Doctrine of this Council,
or at least might have done so, if he would. And
so all the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> Flesh, Bones, Mouth,

Belly, Back, and all, went through his Mouth
into his Stomach; and thus all were in his Stomach,
though all his Body intirely, his Stomach excepted, was
still without it. Which let any one judge whether it be
more likely, then that this saying of <hi>Christ, This is my

substantive in this sense being not unusual in Scripture;
as in,<note place="margin">John 15<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 5. Gen. 41. 27.</note>

Transubstantiation prove an Errour? Then which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
there is nothing in the world more certain
to all the Faculties of a man; as is manifest out of what

gross Idolaters, from the second, third, fourth, seventh

the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, twenty fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and twenty fifth of the second Chapter. All these
Conclusions will give evidence against them, that they are
very notorious Idolaters.</p>
               <p>9. And therefore this being so high and so palpable a
strain of Idolatry in them touching the Eucharist, or the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34037:83"/>
eating the Body and drinking the Bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein
<hi>Christ</hi> is offered by the Priest as an Oblation, and the
People feed upon him as in a Feast upon a Sacrifice,
which is not done without Divine Adoration done to
the Host, according to the precept of their Church;
This does hugely confirm our sense of the eating of things
offered unto Idols in the Epistles to the Churches in
<hi>Pergamus</hi> and in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> this worshipping of the Host
being so expresly acknowledged by the Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and in that high sense of <hi>Cultus Latriae,</hi> which is due
to God alone. And therefore it is very choicely and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously
perstringed by the Spirit of Prophecy above any
other Modes of their Idolatry, it being such a gross and
confessed <hi>Specimen</hi> thereof, and such as there is no Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

                  <head>His Answer to the Argument from Physicks
in the fifth Paragraph.</head>
                  <p>To this he Answers, First, by asserting it possible,
That a Body occupying a space equal to it self in
one place, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et be elsewhere without occupying
any place at all; and he would prove this more then
possible, from the opinion of the Learned, who
maintain that actually the supreme Heaven occupies
no place. Secondly, by denying the Inferences I
make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> of one Body being in two
places at once, as first, That the Body will be equal
to those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>aces, What needs that, Mr. Doctor,
sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s he, It is enough that in each of those two spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it be onely equal or commensurate to that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in neither of them equal or commensurate to a

space of twelve Cubits. And then for my Inference,
That granting this Body equal to the spaces it occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
at once, it will be double to it self, he denies
the consequence. Because a Body of one Cubit rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ied
into a double dimension, and therefore occupying
a double space, will not be double to it self. And
a rational Soul informing a Body of a span length,
when the Body is grown to another span still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the same Soul, it does not follow that
the Soul is double to it self. Is not this rare Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
says he. Let the Doctor show a material di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparity
in these two Cases, or else acknowledge the

that it is equal to twelve Cubits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

has it self the magnitude of twelve Cubits:

meaning, in those words, (a body of a span length
and then grown up to another span) which grown
up to another span naturally implies the Body
not double but octuple to what it was before,
passing by these and medling onely with his own
meaning, (as it may be hoped) and Hypotheses,
the examples do not at all reach the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For speaking in his sense, a body of one
Cubit rarified into a double dimension is double
to it self unrarified; that is, It is as big again as
it was when it was unrarified. But it is not as
big again or double to it self at the same time,
but double it is to what it was before. And the
same is to be said of the soul, (in such a sense as
extension is applicable to her, and increase or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of it, namely by dilatation and contraction
Spiritual) that it is double when the Body is grown
as big again as it was when it was but a span long,
to what it was when the Body was but a span
long. But here in the present Case a Body is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
double to it self, compared with it
self and its present condition at the same time:
Which is impossible, <hi>viz.</hi> That the same Body
should be double now to what it is now. That it
now should be as big again as it self is now. For
neither can the Soul her self be said to be now
as wise again as she is now, but onely as wise
again as she was some time ago. And so my
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34037:87"/>
Adversaries Answer does not at all reach the
point in hand. And therefore my Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stands firm and unshaken, of the Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Transubstantiation from this Argument taken
from <hi>Physicks,</hi> as any unprejudiced eye may easily
discern. Nor had we any need here to consider
the continuity or discontinuity of places. But all is

                     <p>To the First part of his first Answer I Reply,
That it is plain that it is <hi>divisum Ã  se secundum sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiam,</hi>
both <hi>quoad totum,</hi> and <hi>quoad partes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is separate or distant so many yards or so

being between. As distant and separate as two
several Individual Bodies at the same distance, that
is to say, A is as many yards or miles distant from
A <hi>quoad integram suam substantiam,</hi> as to its intire
substance, as B is from C. But B is really distant
or separate from C suppose twenty yards or
miles, as to their intire substances. <hi>Ergo,</hi> A is
distant or separate from A twenty yards or miles
as to its intire substance, nothing of its substance
being between. So that it is both present with

twenty miles, and may be many thousands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34037:88"/>
to this impossible Hypothesis. In so
much that it is plain this part of his Answer is
weak and insufficient. To the other part I say,
That it manifestly follows from my former Reply,
(that shows plainly that A is distant and separate
from A which is a plain and palpable Division of A
wholly and intirely from it self) That A is not
<hi>Ens unum,</hi> but <hi>Entia multa</hi> or <hi>plura,</hi> because the

                     <p>And now to his Second Answer, I deny that I
go upon any such supposition, That Essential Unity
is derived from the unity of local Presence. But
what I contend for is this, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>at unity of local

though the <hi>ubi</hi> of a Being be not essential to it,

how weak my Adversaries Inference is, That
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34037:89"/>
unless essential Unity be derived from the Unity of
local Presence, it will not follow that the same
Body being in divers places at once is divided
from it self, any more than it is divided from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Principles, which it can never be by Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of local Presence, they being wholly extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
to the subject. Which is the same as if he
should contend that a Man may be and yet be no
where, because <hi>Vbi</hi> or Place is extrinsecal to him.
Or that his Soul may be neither wiser, nor less
wise, nor equally wise with others; or his Body

add, That the very intrinsick Principles of any

so many Yards or Miles, as is plain from my

of <hi>Plato,</hi> to wit, his Soul and Body would be both

it is a wonder to me that they can be hid from
any Mans eyes, that does not wilfully wink against
them; or rather that any Man can wink against
them, though in humour or for ends best known to
himself he may talk against them.</p>
                     <p>Now to his third and last I Answer; Who does
the greater disservice to the Catholick Church he
or I? I dealing <hi>bonÃ¢ fide</hi> and plainly demonstrating

that to be an errour that cannot be hid from

the nature of a Body<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the impossibility of

an Opinion unknown or disown'd by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Church, I mean this Opinion of
Transubstantiation, not avowed by any Council
till about four or five hundred Years ago, when as
the Doctrine of the Trinity was repeatedly ratified
in the Primitive times by general Councils above
1200 Years ago, with what reason is it that my

                     <p>In the First part therefore, I say, his suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very gross and incompetible to the <hi>Divine
Nature.</hi> As if it were in the three Persons as one
hand phancyed in three distinct distanced gloves at

the Divine Nature and the Persons are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
said to be in one another, (<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 21.)
<hi>I in thee, and thou in me;</hi> And Trinity in Unity
and Unity in Trinity. <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> not unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resembles the Trinity and Divine Nature, to
the Mind and the three Powers in the Mind,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34037:90"/>
Memory, and Understanding, and Love, or Will.
These three, saith he, out of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> are not
three Lives but one Life, not three Minds but one
Mind, one Essence. He descants further on this
Similitude, but it is enough to hint thus much,
that from hence also it is manifest, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature is not in the three Persons, as one
finger that fits three distinct distanced finger-stalls,
but as the Memory, Understanding, and Will, are
adequately every-where where the Mind is by a
<hi>Metaphysical</hi> Coincidency and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ongruity, so also
is the Presence of the three Persons and Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
every where coincident and adequate: Nor is
the Divine Nature any more repeated according to
the number of Persons, then the Essence of the
Soul is according to the number of those <hi>three
Powers, Memory, Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> So
that nothing more can be concluded then thus,
That the number of the Persons are triple to the
Divine Nature which is but One, as the Powers
of the Soul or Mind are triple to the Soul or
Mind that is but One. And what inconvenience
is there in this? Do not all Men say, that there are
three Persons though but One Divine Nature?

than acknowledge any similitude with that of the

(That a part of the Division is equal to the whole)
either refer to the species (and then it is false

                     <p>I will not say, That my Adversary looks through
too thick a Cob-web to discern the force and scope
of my Argument. But this I will say, that he has
plainly missed it. For the very absurdity that I drive
at is, that in dividing suppose an entire consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Host into two parts, (in which one entire
consecrated Host there is but one continued Body
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34037:91"/>
of Christ, veiled as he says, but co-extended with
the species) that in the dividing this Host or
species of the Host if you will, that one continued
Body of Christ there before, is discontinued and
separated into two as sure as it is in two places
at once. And what, I pray you, is this but to be
divided into two? And being Division here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two intirely the same with the divided, what is
it but to be divided into parts of a Division which
singly are equal to the whole, contrary to that
common Notion in <hi>Euclid?</hi> Or if you think this
less absurd, to be divided into two wholes? For

that I understand the individual thing I speak

That thing that once made is never to be destroyed,
when ever it may be truely said of it, That it can

not. But the Body of Christ is a thing that once
made to exist, is never to be destroyed. Therefore
when ever it is truely to be said of it, That it can be
made or is to be made of any thing, it then is not.

And first upon his Hyperbolical wonderment
on the particle (for). Crystal is made of Water,
for Water is turned into Crystal, Vineger made
of Wine, for Wine is turned into Vineger, Gold
sometime made of Lead, for Lead sometimes is

turned into Gold. Is the use of (for) in such cases as
these so wonderfull? Or were it not a wonder if
(for) were not used upon such occasions. And
yet my Antagonist cannot abstain from calling it a
piece of learned Non-sense; though not half so
Learned as the making of a Child of two spans
long, but double to the same Child when but
one span long, which yet I had the candour gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to connive at. Nor do I understand any sense

                  <p>I come now to his Argument, saith he; Transubstantiation
implies that the same thing is and is not at the same
time. This, says he, I deny. First, because Physicks
have rendred it probable that a thing which actually
is may be reproduced without losing its actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.
And if we should say that Christs Body is thus
reproduced in the Sacrament, it will not follow that the

and is not by a second production till after
the Consecration.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That when the Host is converted into
the Body of Christ, there is no necessity of the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the production of a new Body which was not
before, but onely that the Body begins to be where it
was not before. As in the augmÃ©ntation of our

Soul occupies those parts of matter that have accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>To the first Answer I Reply, That it has no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
For <hi>Physicks</hi> exhibit no such probability, nor
has he nor can he produce the least Instance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
But in the mean time it is worth the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of in this Answer, how well assured in his
own mind, for all his external cavilling before, my
Adversary is, That the meaning of that Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mine, That that individual thing that can
be and is to be made of any thing, is not, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by me of such things as which once made
are not to be destroyed: or in such a sense as this,
That that individual thing that can be made or is
to be made of any thing, in that point of time
that it is to be made, is not. Which is an Axiome
<hi>noematically</hi> true. And therefore to say that a Body
is by a first production, but yet still remaining
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34037:95"/>
produced is to be again produced entirely, even
while it remains produced, that is to say, that it
remains produced already in that very point of time
that it is to be produced, is plainly to confess that
the very same individual thing is produced and not
produced, or unproduced at the same time. For
the <hi>terminus productionis</hi> is one and the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
body A. Now according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> and
the common sense of all men, all production whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accidental or Essential has its contrary termes
and proceeds Ã  <hi>Privatione ad Actum,</hi> from Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Act. So that let A be Accident or Essence,
A must be supposed not to be that it may become
A, or be made A; supposing A such an Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Body, when it is to be produced the <hi>Termini
Productionis</hi> are non-A and A. That which is to
be made A, from not being A it becomes A. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it being the same Individual Body and being
before, it could not of not being this Individual
Body become this Individual Body A, but onely A
would be in a new place. Which is no Essential
production as is here supposed, but onely local mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and consequently the Individual Body A is
not produced, when it is thus supposed reproduced.
And therefore if it be really reproduced, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it is a demonstration that it then was not.
Wherefore it being certain that our Saviours Body
does not cease to be; if Transubstantiation be true
that pretends it reproduced, it necessarily implies
that it then is not. And therefore it plainly is and is
not, according to that doctrine, at the same time.
Besides, if it were possible that A, suppose <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:34037:96"/>
could be produced while <hi>Socrates</hi> is in being, it can
be no otherwise then thus, that is to say, That ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man exquisitely <hi>Socrates,</hi> to whom <hi>Socrateity</hi>
is fully and essentially communicated in all points,
is also produced. But then this will also follow,
that <hi>Socrates</hi> is now become a <hi>Genus,</hi> and this and
that <hi>Socrates</hi> are the <hi>species infimae</hi> of it, which we
usually call <hi>Individuals,</hi> and so they will not be <hi>idem
numero</hi> but <hi>diversa numero</hi> and consequently not

or the same Individual A will be produced
and not produced at the same breath. For
things that differ <hi>numerically</hi> cannot be the same
Individuals. So impossible every way is this first
Fiction, and implies still the same Repugnancy.

again true, That the Body of Christ is and is not at
the same time.</p>
                     <p>To the second Answer I Reply, First, That it is
apparently repugnant to the very Definition of
Transubstantiation by the Council of Trent. Which
saith, 'That there is a conversion of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Bread into the substance of the Body
of Christ. Which, say they, is fitly and properly
called Transubstantiation. But if there were no
production of the Body of Christ, but onely the
causing of it to be where it was not before,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34037:96"/>
this would not be properly Transubstantiation,
but <hi>mutatio Localis.</hi> But in the action of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
the <hi>terminus</hi> is <hi>substantia</hi> not <hi>Locus,</hi> it
being the transubstantiating one substance into
another.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Body of Christ be not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but there be onely <hi>mutatio Localis;</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Bread either remains or is annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
That the Bread remains is expresly against the
doctrine of the Roman Church. That it is annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
is to give the power of Annihilation to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is onely proper to God, and to supose that
every consecration of the Host annihilates so much
of the matter of the Universe; which mustneeds
seem very harsh and absurd to any unprejudiced
Judgement. Besides that there is this palpable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy
in it, That whereas Transubstantiation is
said to be the conversion of all the substance of the
Bread into Christs Body, this plainly implies that
there is the conversion of none at all into it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all annihilated and exterminated out of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
To say nothing of the <hi>Accidents</hi> of the Bread
remaining after this Annihilation, it being uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
where they should be subjected, or that any
modes of substance should be separated from their
substance, and exist without it. And then to what
end it should be that the species of the Bread should
appear by the Divine Omnipotency, the substance
of Bread being annihilated. When it would conduce
far more to our belief of the corporeal Presence of
Christ, in lieu of the annihilated Bread, if those
species did not appear, or were so changed that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34037:97"/>
they seemed much above the nature of ordinary
Bread. Which things being not, it is a plain Judicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the unprejudiced, that the Bread is still Bread
after the Consecration. Else God would be found
exercising his Omnipotency, in exhibiting such
perfest species of Bread and Wine in such a way as is
most effectual to drive all Christians to the misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the pretended Mystery of Transubstantiation:
Which were a grand absurdity and incompe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ible
to the Divine Wisdom and Goodness, if that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
were true.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly and lastly, for his quaint allusion
to the Soul, which being the same yet extends it
self into new parts of matter accrewing to the
Body in its augmentation; it is a pretty offer of
wit, but in my apprehension it extremely falls
short of the present Case. For the Soul being still
one and the same Spirit undistanced from it self
and uninterrupted can contract and extend it self
within moderate bounds. But to imagine Christs
Body in Heaven by extending it self from thence
to the Earth upon every consecration of the Host,
continuedly, so to become present where it was
not, is to make him even perpetuall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> in a manner
to have a monstrously big and mishapen Body,
stretched out into parts God knows how many
Thousand miles long, which any judicious minde
and of a quick sense cannot but hugely abhor from
thinking on. But this being not, He must either
come down from Heaven upon the Consecration
and Annihilation of the Bread, leaving Heaven
quite for the time, and ever and anon travail on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34037:97"/>
Earth, and so swiftly as to be in many places at
once, and some many Thousand miles distant one
from another, which how absurd it is has been
often intimated; which also seems to clash with,
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. Or else as it were taking leave of
himself in Heaven and parting from himself and
yet leaving himself behind he comes down to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the room of the annihilated Bread. Orlastly,
he is present in the room of the said Bread, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
at all passing from Heaven to Earth. Both
which seem altogether impossible and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
For how can one and the same Body go
from a place and yet leave it self entirely behind
in the said place, and so as it were divide it self
entirely from it self? Or how is it possible it should
be found in two distant places, without passing at
least as great a space as that which lyes directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt?
These things are clearly and perfectly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
And if they were not, yet are they quite
beside the cushion, this Answer balking the
doctrine of Transubstantiation established by the
Council of Trent.</p>
                     <p>So plain is it every way, That neither this nor
his former Answer enervates any thing the force
of my Argument which proves that Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
implies that the same thing is and is not at
once. And therefore this Argument together with
all the former against Transubstantiation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Assaults of my Adversary, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so manifestly strong and invincible, let the
impartial Reader judge whether I have cryed <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

in so weighty a Cause, like a sincere Christian,
speaking the Truth from my very heart, as I find
it in the innate and indeleble characters writ by
Gods own finger in the understandings of all Men
that will open their eyes to Read them, even
those indubitable first principles of <hi>Physicks, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks,

of wit; My Adversary indeed swaggers much here
in bearing us in hand that the difficulties of the
Trinity are equal or greater then these of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,

                  <p>My Antagonist does altogether decline saying any

so doing. But to that about <hi>Costerus</hi> in this eighth
Paragraph he Answers thus. Here is, saith he, the

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34037:98"/>
Eucharist, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that point is in
such errour and Idolatry as never was seen or heard
of. Namely, because Christ then had dealt unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with his Church, in leaving them to fall into
such Idolatry by occasion of his own words, and by
consequence would not be the true Christ; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the adoration of the Eucharist would be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a mistake as to the Circumstance but also as to the
Object, there being no such adorable Object in the
world as a true Christ according to this supposition,
and so the <hi>Cultus Latriae</hi> would be exhibited to a

grant as much as <hi>Costerus</hi> to the full. This
is the main of his Answer and the full strength
thereof.</p>

                     <p>This is an adventurous Answer indeed which

Transubstantiation be true. Which most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34037:99"/>
is the sense of <hi>Costerus</hi> in that place, Chap. 12.
N. 10. nor did he dream of any such consequence
as my Adversary pins upon him; as if he meant
that then Christ would not be the true Christ if
Transubstantiation were not true, and that thence
the Idolatry would proceed. But I will set the
whole argumentation of <hi>Costerus</hi> before my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
eyes, and let him judge, whether his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be such as my Adversary pretends. <hi>If in the
Sacrament of the Eucharist the true Body of Christ be
not contained, Christ dealt unworthily with his Church,
whom throughout the world for 1500 years together,
he has by occasion of his own words left in such errour
and Idolatry as was never in the whole world seen or
heard of.</hi> And then follows that which I have cited
in this eighth Paragraph. <hi>For the errours of those,
&amp;c.</hi> which makes up the whole Argument.</p>
                     <p>Where I Observe, First, that there is not the
least men ion or intimation, That Christ would
not be Christ if his words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> did not
signifie properly but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>iguratively, but rather firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supposing him to be Christ, he would not do any
thing so unworthy of his own Office and Dignity<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
as to use words in such a way as should occasion
the Church to plunge into so foul Idolatry for so
long a time; acknowledging that it would be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
though he were the true Christ, but that he
being so would not use such words but in their
proper sense, that he might not occasion that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
I say in the first place, there is no such thing
in this place of <hi>Costerus</hi> as my Antagonist puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. And then secondly I affirm, That no
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34037:99"/>
man in his wits could be so devoid of either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Piety, as to say, in good earnest, That if
these words of Christ, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> be to be
understood figuratively, and not literally or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
Christ is an Impostor, that is, is not the
true Christ, which is expresly the sense which my
Antagonist would pin upon this passage of <hi>Costerus.</hi>
For first it is well known that it is usual in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<hi>idiome,</hi> in which Christ spake, as it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent
also in other tongues, to use the verb sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive
[<hi>est</hi>] when the <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>predicate</hi> in a

                              <desc>â€¢</desc>

26.</hi>) that it is Bread For he affirms of that Bread
which he had used no consecration to, that even
that was his Body.</p>
                     <p>Indeed if he had first done something to it for
the transmutation of it, and then taken it up and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34037:100"/>
said, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> here had been more colour of
pretence, that it was not ordinary Bread. But he
says of this Bread as yet unconsecrated, <hi>That it is
his Body,</hi> and therefore he plainly affirms, that
Bread remaining still really Bread is his Body,
which can be in no sense so but in a figurative one,
that is to say, That it is the sign or symbol of his
Body; Wherefore when our Saviour does so
plainly affirm, that the Bread is but the symbol of
his Body, is it any fault in him, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> or any lapsed Church else will so perversly
and absurdly understand it, as if it were the very
Body of Christ it self upon Consecration? as if our
Saviour Christ had declared it so to be?</p>
                     <p>And besides this affirmation of our Saviour we
may add the Attestation of his Evangelists, whom
he lead into all Truth. Does not St. <hi>Luke</hi> expresly
say, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>

Body which was given for you, do this in remembrance
of me.</hi> What can possibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> be more plain then
this? He gave what he brake, he brake what
he took, and what he took was Bread, and of
this Bread which he gave, brake and took, he says,
<hi>This is my Body;</hi> Wherefore it is evident that of the
Bread he pronounced, according to the Testimony
of St. <hi>Luke, That it was his Body.</hi> But Bread can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be his Body otherwise then symbolically, or by
way of token or remembrance, and therefore he
adds, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Now memory
is not of things present but of things absent. All
which circumstances do so emphatically import,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34037:100"/>
that the Bread is but still a sign not the Body of
Christ himself, that the most cautious Lawyer
could scarce express any ones mind in a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
more certainly and expresly. And yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
must be an Impostor if he did not mean by
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> This is my real Body, the same
that hung upon the Cross, and was born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Can there be any thing more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Christ and Christian Religion then this?</p>
                     <p>Add unto all this, That besides that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the Evangelists declare that it is Bread and
not the natural Body of Christ, it is demonstrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impossible to be so, and openly repugnant to all
our senses, which alone would assoile our Saviour
from being an Impostor, the words being easily to
be understood in a figurative sense.</p>
                     <p>But I hope by this, my Adversary blushes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>
has pinned so uncouth and incredible a sense on
this Argument of <hi>Costerus,</hi> and will acknowledge
that <hi>Costerus</hi> used this Argument onely as a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
namely, That Christ being so certainly the
true Christ, it is not probable that he would deal
so unworthily with his Church as by these words,
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> occasion so great Idolatry in this
<hi>Artolatria,</hi> or Bread worship continued so long in it,
and that therefore it is not Bread, but the real Body
of Christ; which yet is as well argued or rather far
worse, then if the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> of old should
have argued thus: That certainly God would not
have dealt so unworthily with his Church, as to
occasion so hideous an errour and blasphemy, that
the eternal God has limbes and shape like a Man,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34037:101"/>
from those words, <hi>Let us make man after our own
Image,</hi> if so be he have not so. And that therefore
he has the lineaments and shape of a Man.</p>
                     <p>But besides this, where there is <hi>no pretense from
Scripture</hi> to any such thing, it is plain that the
Church for as long a time have defiled themselves
with the Invocation of Saints and worshipping of
Images, which are gross Idolatries as well as this;
nay indeed when the <hi>Scripture is expresly against it.</hi>
Which yet, if you will believe the Romanists
themselves, have possessed the Church as many
hundred years as this worshipping of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
though they be all really Innovations upon
the lapse of the Church, as the skilfull in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
do abundantly prove. And for this gross
errour of Transubstantiation, it was not confirmed
by any Council till about 1200 after Christ.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore what an intolerable injury and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
is it against the sacred Person of Christ, to
cast this Bread-worship upon him, as if by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

is not Christ, that is, That Christ is an Impostor,
if these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> be not literally
to be understood, as if it were his very true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

                        </gap>fer towards a plausibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the Truth of Transubstantiation, (for
the Mystery of the holy Trinity wants no such
small apologies) that the seeming Impossibility
thereof, is an Argument of its being a doctrine
Divinely inspired, and that that saying rightly
here takes place, <hi>The more incredible the more
credible:</hi> These are fine Lullaby-songs to be
sung to babies half asleep; But we have most
evidently demonstrated, even as clear as Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
that Transubstantiation is not a <hi>seeming</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
but a <hi>palpable</hi> and <hi>real</hi> one. And as
for that saying, <hi>The more incredible the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,</hi>
it is a foundation so <hi>large,</hi> that all the
Figments, even the most extravagant of all the
Religions of the World may equally be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it, and by how much more incredible
and impossible any Figment, is by so much the
more stronger faith it ought to obtain, and may
the more firmly be supported by this Foundation.
For the more impossible the more incredible, the
more incredible the more credible. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the more incredible it is that <hi>Mahomet</hi> put the
Moon into his bosome, and that it came out at
each sleeve divided into two, and that he strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
sodered it together, and sent it back whole
to Heaven again, the more incredible this story
is, the more credible it is. That is, saith my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist,
(for he explains this venerable Aphorism)
By how much the more incredible the Mystery
is; if we onely consult our senses and the bare
sentiments of the natural Man, by so much the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34037:103"/>
more credible it is that there lyes a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
at the bottom. Cannot the <hi>Mahumetan</hi>
defend his Religion as wisely as thus from this
ground?</p>
                     <p>It is not a sign of our meer natural or unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
estate when we will not nor can believe things
that are apparently repugnant to the indeleble
Principles of natural Understanding. But it is a
sign of their being the slaves of the Man of sin
in a doub <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>esense, who can swallow such gudgeons.
For for this cause God sends them strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
saith the Apostle, (2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.) that they may
believe alye, because they love not the Truth but
have pleasure in unrighteousness. But (<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 36.)
<hi>if the Son makes us free</hi> by his spirit of real Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>then are we free indeed,</hi> even from all such
Impostures as these, while the world (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 8.)
<hi>wonders after the Boast,</hi> and the strange stories that
he utters. But we know who those are that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
out of the holy City, even every one that
(<hi>Apoc.</hi> 22. 15.) <hi>loves and makes a lye,</hi> and those cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
are none of the Regenerate. And who
should those be that love and embrace l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es, but
those that take up such Principles that they cannot
discern a lye or withhold their assent from it? For
the more Impossible, which should turn any Mans
stomach from believing, makes it but the more
Incredible, and the more Incredible the more
Credible.</p>
                     <p>But we have harped too long on a string which
will sound over harsh to such ears as are less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to Truth. My main purpose I had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34037:103"/>
before, But I could not but say something
to the fine popular fetches of my Adversarie, who
cunningly insinuates into the minds of the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and simple, that it is a sign of a more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Religious and regenerate estate, far remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
above the meer natural Man, to believe things
that are plainly and apertly repugnant to the light
of Nature and right Reason. For this is such a gap
as may let in the grossest falsities and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that can be invented, and that upon the shew
of Religion and Supernaturality. For giving up
their faith to their Priest and his Church, the
more incredible the Act to be good or Doctrine
true, the more credible. What therefore may not
Men be brought to believe and act upon so unsound
a Principle? I pass now to his fourth Section,

quite to have overspread her like a noisom Leprosy. But,

of Saints.</hi> Touching which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
declares this Doctrine expresly:<note place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Saints is plainly allow'd and recommended: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their praying for us, or offering up our Prayers to
God, it is plainly imply'd that there are other Aids and
Succours they can afford, if they be supplicated, that is,
invoked with most humble and prostrate Devotion. And
the pretending that this is all but the way of procuring
those good things we want from God, the first Fountain,
and that through his Son <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>hrist;</hi> that makes the Saints
the more exactly like the Pagans <hi>Dii medioxumi,</hi> and the
<hi>Daemons</hi> that negotiated the affairs of men with the highest
Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:34037:104"/>2. I say then that, though they went no farther then
thus, even this is down-right Idolatry which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> thus openly owns, (and consequently the
whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>) as appears from the third,
fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth Conclusions of the first
Chapter; as also by the fifth, seventh, eighth, tenth,
eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and
twenty-fourth of the second. But if we examine those
Prayers that are put up to the Saints, their Invocation is
still the more unexcusable.</p>
               <p>3. Wherefore looking to the publick Practise of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> authorised by the Popes themselves,
the Invocation of a Saint does not consist in a meer
<hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> as people are too forward to phansy
that the state of the Question, (though the meer invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them to pray for us would be Idolatry, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved:) but, which is insinuated in the Council it
self, there are other more particular Aids and Succours
that they implore of them, and some such as it is proper
for none but God or <hi>christ</hi> to give: Such as Protection
from the Devil, Divine Graces, and the Joys of Paradise.
But as the things they ask of the Saints are too big
for them to be the Disposers of; so the Compellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> especially, are above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of any Creature. Whence this Invocation of Saints
will appear a most gross and palpable Mode of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in that Church. As I shall make manifest out of the
following Examples, taken out of such pieces of DÃ¨vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as are not mutter'd in the corners of their Closets,
but are publickly read or sung with <hi>Stentorian</hi> Voices in
their very Churches. I will onely give the Reader a
taste of this kind of their Idolatry; for it were infinite to
produce all we might.</p>
               <p>4. And first, to begin with the smaller Saints, (as
indeed they are all to be reckoned in comparison of the
blessed Virgin, to whom therefore they give that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34037:105"/>
Worship which they call <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> as they give <hi>Dulia</hi>
to the rest of the Saints, and <hi>Latria</hi> to God alone, and to
<hi>Christ</hi> as being God:) That Prayer to S. <hi>Cosmas</hi> and S.
<hi>Damian</hi> is plainly a Petition to them to keep us from all
Diseases, as well of Soul as of Body, that we may attain
to the life of the Spirit, and live in Grace here, and be
made partakers of Heaven hereafter.</p>

he would deliver us from the bondage and drudgery of
Sin, which is onely in the power of our great Saviour
and Redeemer <hi>Christ</hi> for to do.</p>
               <p>That Invocation of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> is also for that spiritual

               <p>8. Now it is observable in this devotional Rhyme to S.
<hi>Catharine,</hi> that whereas the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> advises men,
<hi>ad sanctorum orationes, opem auxiliumque confugere,</hi> that
in these many Verses there are not passing two or three that
are an entreating of the Saint to pray for us, but to aid
and succour us in such a way as the Story of the Saint and
the Allusion to her Name most naturally leads the phancy
of the Devotionist to think sutable for her: As if she were
the giver of Courage, of Patience, and of Purity of mind,
and was to comfort and support us in the very Agony of
death by her presence. Which Petition is very frequent
to other Saints also. So plain a thing is it, that this Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Saints is not a mere desiring of them to
pray for us.</p>
               <p>But here the Devotionist commits the whole <hi>Regimen</hi>
of both his Soul and Body unto this Saint, to rule all his
Faculties and senses, and begs so high Vertues and Graces,
as that none but God can supply us with them; as I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
at first. Whence the Invocation upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
also must appear most grosly Idolatrous, as <hi>Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Conclusions I refer to in my second Paragraph, so
many figures cast to conjure up a Legion of Devils.
But he must remember that there are Legions of
good Angels also, and that such were those that
<hi>Michael</hi> was General over when he fought against
the red Dragon. And these Conclusions of mine
do fight against the red Dragon revived, that
Idolatry too too Paganical (though gilded over
with the fair pretense of Christianity) that is so
visible in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that if these
Conclusions be a Legion, they are a Legion under
<hi>Michael</hi> and therefore good Angels, and victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Adversary. For I have most clearly proved above,
that he has produced nothing to enervate them.

is firm also, <hi>viz.</hi> That what the Council of Trent
doth openly own in my first Paragraph is down

Conclusion I aim at, which is to prove from
either the manner of compellation, or from the
nature of the Objects of the Prayers made to
the Saints, that the Invocation is Idolatry, and
a crass kind of one too. How then is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <head>His fifth general Answer.</head>
                  <p>That since the new charge of Idolatry from all these
forms of Invocation of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other
Saints is this, That their Suppliants ask of them
such things as are onely in the Power of our great
Saviour and Redeemer Iesus Christ to grant, let us
single out, saith he, one of the most harsh sounding
forms of Invocation that is to be found in all the
three Chapters, suppose <hi>Domina salvum me fac,
Blessed Lady save me,</hi> and if this may admit of
an Orthodox sense, and that by clear warrant from
Scripture, then I hope the rest that are not so seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
unjustifiable as this, may in all reason be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from that odious Epithet of Idolatrous. Now,
says he, it is very possible, that he that makes
this form of Invocation a piece of his Litany, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina
salvum me fac, Blessed Lady save me,</hi> may
be in no more danger of Idolatry thereby than St.
<hi>Paul</hi> was when writing to the <hi>Romans (Rom. 11. 14.)</hi>
he uttered these words, <hi>If by any means I may
provoke to emulation those which are of my
flesh and might save some of them.</hi> Or when
he speaks to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 Cor. 9. 22.) <hi>I am
made all things to all men that by any means I
may save some.</hi> And therefore if any well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suppliant had prayed to the Apostle in this
very form of Prayer, Holy Apostle save me; What
Idolatry had it been to petition St. <hi>Paul</hi> for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34037:110"/>
which he professed himself both ready and
able to grant. For here the Apostle clearly supposeth
in himself not onely the Will but the Power of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Souls. My Adversary uses larger circuits and
ambages of wit and Rhetorick, but this is the very
substance of his Argument, and such as wherewith
he would elude the force of all my cited formes of
their Invocation of Saints. But how well he can effect
it we shall see in the process of the matter.</p>
                  <div type="reply">
                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>I Reply therefore, that though my Antagonist
have used a great deal of plausible wit and smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthed
Eloquence, yet what he has said is far
from solid Truth. For to omit for the present
that this form of Praying, <hi>Domina salvum me fac,</hi>
is not the harshest passage in all my Quotations,
yet it is so harsh that those sayings of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to
the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> will not justifie it. For
we must remember that St. <hi>Paul</hi> elsewhere says,
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 6. that</hi> Paul <hi>may plant and</hi> Apollos <hi>may wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but God gives the increase;</hi> whereby he plainly
declares it not to be in his power nor in any ones
power else to save a man from eternal death.
But that it is in the Power of God alone. And
therefore it is evident that in those places he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
onely that he used all the means he could or
the most seasonable he could to save them But
no <hi>Logick</hi> will ever evince, that therefore he
thought it to be or that it was in his power to
save them he speaks of, but onely to use his best
indeavour in his subordinate way of action and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34037:110"/>
leave the success to God. And therefore it is rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and falsly imputed to the Apostle both against
his own profession and against the truth of the
thing, namely, <hi>That he clearly supposes in himself
not onely the will but the power of saving Souls;</hi> Which
are the very words of my Antagonist.</p>
                     <p>And I do not question, but if any one had in
his time been so silly or wicked as to have kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to St. <hi>Paul</hi> with eyes and hands lifted up to him
and said, <hi>Holy Apostle save me,</hi> he would have
rent his garments and protested against it as an
enormous and Idolatrous petition, and have been
carryed with a great deal of zeal and indignation
against so sinfull an Action; As <hi>Iacob</hi> was moved
against <hi>Rachel,</hi> when she said to him, <hi>Gen. 30. give
me children or else I dye.</hi> To whom the Patriarch
replied with much anger, What am I in Gods
sted? intimating what an impious and idolatrous
act it was, so bluntly and absolutely to ask that
of him which was onely in the Power of God to
give. <hi>Lo, children and the fruit of the womb are an
heritage and gift that cometh of the Lord,</hi> saith the
<hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 127. 4. How much more then is it,
to be made a child of God and an Inheriter of
eternal Salvation. This is in no Mortals power to
give and therefore cannot be asked of any Creature
without Impiety and Idolatry by Conclusion the
8th. Chapter 2. And therefore, <hi>Holy</hi> Paul <hi>save me,</hi>
could not but have seemed to the Apostle a
Petition blasphemous and Idolatrous, nor could
he have well born that compellation of <hi>Holy Apostle</hi>
without some reproof like that of our Saviour
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34037:111"/>
to him that called him <hi>good Master,</hi> Mat. 19. 17. <hi>why
callest thou me good, there is none good but onely God.</hi>
But we out of the rash Idea's of our own corrupt
minds phancy such things gratefull or tolerable to
the Apostle, which would really have proved horrid
and intolerable to him.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>His sixth general Answer.</head>
                  <p>But yet as if the Apostle had in himself the power of
saving Souls, (they are his own words) and as if
this Petition, <hi>Holy Apostle save me,</hi> were a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and blameless Petition, he further would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the supposition thus, That forasmuch notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
as the Apostle has not in himself the power
of saving Souls, in the quality of a God, but as
instrumental to their Salvation by his Prayers and
Preaching, it is manifest that <hi>Holy Apostle save
me,</hi> can signify no more than Holy Apostle teach
me the way of Salvation, or Holy Apostle pray
for my Salvation: And yet this form of, <hi>Holy
Apostle save me,</hi> being legitimate, it will follow
that, (taking our measures from the Apostles o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

words and meaning) <hi>Blessed Lady save me,</hi> will
also be a lawfull form of Prayer, it signifying no
more, than <hi>Blessed Lady pray for my Salvation.</hi>
And so all the forms of Prayer, saith he, assigned by
the Doctor taken in the sense of the Apostle will
amount to no more than a meer <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi>
And thus with her in the Proverbs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20. he
has neatly wiped, as he makes show, his own mouth, and

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>There are two things asserted in this Answer,
First, that all the forms of Invocation that I have
recited in these three Chapters amount to no more
than a meer <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi> And then, that this is
deducible from such grounds. Now as to the first,
as I shall more particularly confute that Assertion,
when I shall afterwards run through the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
of these Chapters, so I shall here in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
intimate that the Assertion is plainly repugnant
to the very words of the Council of Trent: Which
says, That it is good and profitable <hi>ad Sanctorum
orationes, opem, auxiliumque confugere,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their Prayers and Intercessions, there are
other helps and assistences intimated. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these Forms of Invocation I have recited in
these Chapters, mentioning other help and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
besides their praying and interceding for
their Suppliants, how is it possible but according
to the indication of the Council they understand
these Helps and Assistences, as things distinct
from their meer Interceding or Praying for
us.</p>
                     <p>But now I further say, That the grounds here
offered of this Assertion, will not hold. For first I
have already proved, that the Apostle does not
affirm any Power in himself of saving Souls, there
being no such Power in him; nor his words to the
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> implying any such thing, and
himself elsewhere professing against it. So that he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34037:112"/>
has not the power of saving of Souls in himself,
neither in the quality of a God, nor in any sense.
For to have the power of saving of Souls in himself
as an <hi>Instrument,</hi> is a repugnancy, and plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that he has not the power of saving of Souls in
himself, no more then a chissel has of carving in it
self, or a pencil of limming, or an Harp or Lute of
playing a lesson. And therefore, <hi>Holy Apostle save
me,</hi> would be as good sense as, Lute or Harp play
me a lesson. Indeed <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Psalm. 57. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
Lute and Harp.</hi> But then by a seasonable <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northosis</hi>
he straitway adds, <hi>I my self will awake right
early:</hi> For if he get not up before them and finger
them, they will certainly lye dumb and silent. And
so is the very word whether writ or spoken by the
Apostle or others; so are all Prayers put up by
any one, if the Spirit does not assist and God say
Amen to their Prayers, all is ineffectual, all is as
perfect dumbness and silence as in an Instrument
hung up against the wall. Besides that the mere
Praying to another that a thing may be granted is
a plain Argument, that the thing is not in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
power that so devoutly askes it. So that though
there be a great deal of fineness and subtilty in these
Arguments of my Adversary, yet we see they are
plainly intangled and contradict one another. And
therefore it is not sense, bluntly and absolutely to
ask that of one that is not in his power to give,
but onely to try and intreat it, if he can so procure
it of another.</p>
                     <p>It is manifest therefore, that <hi>Holy Apostle save me,</hi>
and <hi>Blessed Lady save me,</hi> are groundless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34037:112"/>
forms of speech, and plainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ignifie
that to be asked of a Creature which is not in the
power of any to give but God alone. (<hi>Iohn 6. 44.
No man comes to me unless my Father draw him,</hi>)
and consequently the implying that to be in the
Creature which onely is in the Creatour, are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
forms of speech by the eighth Conclusion
of the second Chapter. And thus we see my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
is far from proving by this fetch, That all
the forms of Invocation which I have recited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to no more than an <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi> Which
though it were true, as it is most manifestly false,
yet the Reader is to remember, they are down
right Idolatry by the second Paragraph of this
Chapter. And most Paganically so while these
Petitions are put up before the Image, at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and in the Temple dedicated to this or that
Saint. And thus I have fully Replied in the general
to the general Answers of my Antagonist to these
three Chapters, which are all the Answers he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I shall take occasion to make some more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Replies to some of them as I run through the
Paragraphs of these Chapters, especially in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his last general Answer and his second, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
plainly, that the sense of these Invocations
are more than an <hi>Ora pro nobis.</hi> And that greater
things are asked and greater Compellations used
then are competible to mere Creatures to give, or
be invocated by. In the mean time it is plain, that
the rest of his fourth Section falls of it self by vertue
of what has already been spoken.</p>

                  <p>In this Prayer to St. <hi>Cosmas</hi> and St. <hi>Damian</hi> it
is observable how the Devotion is framed with a
sutableness to the condition of the Saints when
they dwelt on Earth. And therefore <hi>Cosmas</hi> and
<hi>Damian</hi> having been of the faculty of Physick here,
they are made to retain it still, but in an higher
degree and to have the power of curing both
Body and Soul, as if by their merits they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
such a Privilege from God. And that Souls
departed are exercised about such things as they
were taken up with in this life, was also the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ancient Heathen, as you may see in
<hi>Virgil, Plutarch, Maximus Tyrius,</hi> and others. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may find evasions for any thing, but considering
the Council of Trent mentions Ayds and Assisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
distinct from their Intercessions, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to which the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> attributes so much to, produces Instances
hereof, any one that has but half an eye will easily
discern this meaning I have given to be true. And
that the Invocation of these Saints is not a meer
<hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> but the craving of them such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
ayds and helps as are supposed proper for them
to give; contrary to my Antagonists last general

such an eminent example of Mortification here
on Earth, and therefore being now endewed with
a peculiar Power of helping men to mortifie sin and
to deliver them from that bondage, accordingly
as was observed in the former Petition. Which is
a boon too great for any but Christ himself to
give. So that it is gross Idolatry on that account
also. St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s being crucified on the Cross is
supposed likewise to have intitled him to the right
and Power of inabling men to bear the Cross. But
whether St <hi>Nicolas</hi> was famous also for incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

has been said already on this Paragraph is sufficient

then observe with himself not onely touching this

that of the Council of Trent <hi>ad Sanctorum orationes,

forms of Invocation to Saints, which is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pray for them, but to give them further ayds
and assistences according to the proper privileges
that they are supposed by their merits to have
obtained, and some so great, that they belong
onely to God, whence the grosness of the Idolatry
is further argued, and a further Reply made to his
second and last general Answers.</p>
                  <p>But for the intitling of the Saints to a power
of assisting correspondent to some Action, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of life of theirs here, I have observed in
several other forms of Invocation in their <hi>Hortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Animae</hi> printed at <hi>Dilinga, cum facultate Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi>
As to St. <hi>Thomas, O glorious toucher of the

And to St. <hi>Ambrose, O most blessed Bishop and

<hi>Austin, O glorious light of the Church help us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

Where it is again observable, they make their direct
addresses to these Saints, and upon account of
what it is peculiar for them to help them in, and
that it is not a mere <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> but in the mean
time abundantly conformable to the words of the

A very excellent Prayer, if it had been directed to a due
Object. But such things are asked as are in the power
of none but of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself, as he is God, to
give.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:34037:115"/>2. For the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is here made no less then a

               <p>3. Like that at the end of the <hi>Rosary; Cor meum illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,

of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But the thing which is very observable, and which I
mainly drive at, is this, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church toward
the latter end, before the Reformation broke out, had
run so mad after the Patronage of the Virgin, that they
had almost forgot the Son of God, and spent all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
on her, whom they do at least equalize to <hi>Christ,</hi>
and so really make her, as well as some love to call her,
the <hi>Daughter of God,</hi> in as high a sense as <hi>Christ</hi> is his Son:
as will farther appear in the process of our Quotations. As
in that Prayer to the blessed Virgin that follows in <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius:

Virgin is here made our Saviour and Mediatour in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine

               <p>5. As she is again most expresly in that Prayer to her in
her Feast of Visitation:</p>

mentes illumina Per sacrae vitae munera.</p>

               <p>In which Invocation the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is plainly called
the Saviour of the World, and pray'd unto for spiritual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
of the Soul, and for the purgation thereof
from the filth both of Sin and Guilt: whereby she is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in this second Paragraph out of the same
Rosary of the Virgin, which though my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
seems desirous to signifie his slighting of, yet
he dare not deny but that it passes current with
them. And why may I not produce what forms

But if some few flowers out of the <hi>Hortulus

what will amount to as much as is in the above said
Rosary. For in a Recommendation to the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

of my Body, all my actions and my death, who art with
thy Son Christ blessed for ever and ever.</hi> What can
be said more to Christ or God himself? This is
surely more than an <hi>Ora pro nobis, Pray for us.</hi>
For in a Recommendation immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the form is: <hi>Precor te, I pray thee, that thou
wouldst keep me from sins, from scandals, from all
the Confusion of humane life, from unclean thoughts,

leaves before in the <hi>Canticum ad Virginem,</hi> it is
said, <hi>Dignare dulcis</hi> Maria <hi>nunc &amp; semper nos sine

has a sufficient stamp of Authority upon it. Which
I speak in reference to his third general Answer.
Nor have I gathered any examples of Invocation
but such as the Author I have them out of does
expresly profess to have been confirmed by publick
Authority, and to have been in publick use. See
<hi>Chemnitius</hi> his third part of the Examination of the
Council of <hi>Trent, pag.</hi> 135. I do not profess to have
all their Rituals, and Pontificals and Rosaries by
me, but what I have by me and under my eye are
so like what <hi>Chemnitius</hi> has produced, that I think
it the greatest folly and stupidity in the World to
misbelieve his Quotations.</p>

But in the mean time they implying so plainly that

               <p>1. WE will now onely note some passages in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Psalter,</hi>
as it is called, wherein how much at
that time the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had thrust themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection and Patronage of the Virgin, and made
her the Daughter of God, instead of approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
faithfull touching the Rights and Prerogatives of
the Son and his Worship, will be most notoriously evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
I will begin with the thirtieth Psalm: <hi>In te, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,
speravi; non confundar in aeternum. Ingratiam tuam
suscipe me; inclina ad me aurem tuam, &amp; in moerore meo
laetifica me. Tu es fortitudo mea &amp; refugium meum, consolatio

diem ultimum.</hi> This is that whole Psalm to the Virgin:
just in such a form and with such a repose of spirit as
<hi>David</hi> prays in to God himself.</p>
               <p>2. But we will content our selves with transcribing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some select pieces. As Psalm 71. <hi>Resperge, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,

Psalm 104. <hi>Salus sempiterna in manu tua est, Domina,
qui te dignÃ¨ honoraverint suscipient illam. Clementia tua
non deficiet Ã  seculis aeternis, &amp; misericordia tua Ã  genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione

ab initio. Tuus totus ego sum, Domina; salvum me fac,
quoniam desiderabiles sunt laudes tuae in tempore peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis
meae.</hi> No man can say more to, or expect more
from, the eternal God himself.</p>
               <p>Whence they make the eternal Godhead as hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
united with the Virgin as with <hi>Christ</hi> himself, and
carry themselves to her as if she were as properly the
<hi>Daughter of God</hi> as he <hi>the Son.</hi> For else how could she
be said to have everlasting salvation inher power, and to
have laid the Foundations of the world from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the eternal Deity?</p>
               <p>3. There are also other passages in this Psalter whereby
they make the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a <hi>She-Christ,</hi> the <hi>Daughter
of God,</hi> as he is the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and that is by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the very Phrases spoken of him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unto her. As in Psalm 2. <hi>Venite ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>am omnes qui
laboratis &amp; tribulati estis, &amp; refrigerium &amp; solatium dabit

Domina, quaesemper rutilas puritate. Fons vitae, influe in os
meum, ex quo viventes aquae profluunt &amp; emanant. Omnes
sitientes venite adillam, &amp; de fonte suo gratanter vos potabit.</hi>
This is the gift of the Spirit, belonging onely to <hi>Christ</hi> to
give to them that believe on him. And he is also said
(<hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37, 38.) to be the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>rest</hi> of all them that
are <hi>weary and heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>And again, Psalm 46. <hi>Omnes gentes, plaudite manibus,
psallite in jubilo Virgini gloriosae. Quoniam ipsa est portae

This is attributed to the Virgin, when as it is <hi>Christ</hi>
alone that is the way of Salvation and Reconciliation
with God.</p>
               <p>4. This is a foul and tedious Subject, and therefore
to make an end at length, let us consider the Blasphemy
of the 41. Psalm. <hi>Quem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Virgin which is said of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he is the
Author and Finisher of our Faith and Salvation. Nay,
the Creation or Generation of our life and flesh, as well
as our Salvation, is here ascribed to the Virgin. Which
can have no sense or truth, unless she were <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>5. As she is expresly called in her Litany, <hi>Filia Dei,</hi>
the <hi>Daughter of God.</hi> Which, considering what high
Titles they give her both in that Litany and elsewhere, as
<hi>Illuminatrix cordium, Fons misericordiae, Flumen sapientiae,
Mater D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

terrae,</hi> would be but a dwindling Title, (it belonging
to all women that are believers,) if there was not
some such raised and sublime sense of it as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</p>
               <p>And therefore their Addresses to her being as if she
were, as I said, a <hi>She-Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter of God</hi>
in as high a sense at least as <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and
she being called the Daughter of God in the <hi>Litaniae
Mariae,</hi> in her Litany or publick Supplication to her, it
is plain, that in that Interval of the Church wherein
this most conspicuously and notoriously happened, the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reason also of the abundance of
their Devotions then to the Virgin, might be said to
be rather the Worshippers of the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> then
of <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And that therefore the Spirit of
Prophecy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oreseeing these times, whenas for such a
space he called <hi>Rome Pergamus,</hi> this succeeding Scene
coming on, he might very well change the Title of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi>
into that of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> with a derisorious Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the occasion of the name of that City, from the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34037:120"/>
news of a Daughter being born to <hi>Nicanor.</hi> As if God
Almighty had the like occasion of changing the name of
<hi>Pergamus</hi> into <hi>Thyatira,</hi> from the <hi>Romanisls</hi> turning the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> into the <hi>Daughter of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. For a stop to which Insolency <hi>Christ</hi> seems on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> to resume to
himself the Title of the <hi>Son of God, Apoc.</hi> 2. 18. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he is called the <hi>Son of man</hi> in the Vision in
the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 13. out of which he
ever draws a description of himself for an Entrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
each Epistle to the Churches. Which, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a thing specially well worth the marking; and
that this making the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Daughter of God</hi>
in this Interval, might alone be a sufficient occasion of
changing the name of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
to <hi>Thyatira.</hi> But other things that are apposite are
also comprehended by a Prophetical <hi>Henopoeia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But this is an Overplus to our Present purpose,
which was mainly to discover the gross Idolatry of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Invocation of their Saints, and
especially of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and how both the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is Idolatrous in this Point,
and much more the Practice of the Church countenanced
by publick Authority.</p>
               <p>8. For this <hi>Mary-Psalter</hi> it self, that has the most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous
and blasphemous Forms of Idolatrous Invocation
of any, is not the private Contrivance of some single,
obscure, superstitious Monk, but bears the Title of
that Seraphick Doctor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Rome:</hi> Which is no small publick countenance

grace and furtherance of so devotional a piece of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
there was instituted a peculiar Society, entitled the

                     </gap> mortis,</hi> to as many as entred into that
Fraternity.</p>
               <p>9. And in such case stands the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at
this very day, that is to say, she is still <hi>Thyatira,</hi> noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
for her Idolatrous Worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
But the Interval of the true Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> ceased

nor to debauch them with Idolatrous Modes of Worship.
But this is onely by the bye.</p>
               <p>In the mean time it is abundantly manifest, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not onely the
praying to them that they would pray to God for us, but
the asking Aids of them, and such frequently as are in
the power of none but of God, and of <hi>Christ</hi> as he is God,
for to give; and therefore is still the grosser Idolatry.</p>

the deepest dye. To give such an Attribute to the
Creature, as implies the highest perfections that
are in the Creator himself. Thus unadvisedly
have they done, by making such humoursom Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in words of such Devotions as are proper
alone to God. For to excuse it by saying, they
can put another sense upon, it will not serve: For
I dare say one may put such a meaning on the
whole Lords Prayer as that the words may be
used to the Pope, with a continued coherence of
sense, partly proper, partly figurative, if such shifts
would serve the turn. And yet I hope none of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will stick to say, that, if one
should kneel to the Pope, and say the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

would be apert blasphemy and Idolatry. But we

The second, In that this Injunction is but what the second

                  </gap> answer, That thus much as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> has declared touching Images is plain and
open Idolatry by the seventh Conclusion of the first
Chapter, and expresly against the Commandment of
God, who forbids us to make any graven Image to
bow down to or Worship. But the Council of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

says, Yes, ye may make graven Images of the Saints, and
set them up in their Temples, and give them their due
Honour and Worship; nay, ye ought to do so; and
instances in the very act of Bowing or Kneeling and
prostrating our selves before them. This Definition of
the Council is so palpably against the Commandment of
God, that they are fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n to leave the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
out of the Decalogue, that the people may not
discern how grosly they go against the express Precepts
of God in their so frequent practices of Idolatry. See the
first, ninth and tenth Conclusions of the first Chapter; as
also the third, fourth, fifth, eighteenth, nineteenth and
twentieth of the second.</p>
               <p>3. Nor can all their Tricks and Tergiversations and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Elusions serve their turn. For undoubtedly the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
was writ to the easie capacity of the people, and
therefore their hearts and consciences are the best Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.
Not the foolish Evasions and Subterfuges of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
Sophisters, who, to the betraying of weak Souls
to Idolatry and Damnation, and for the opening their
Purses, would make them believe that the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi>'s enjoyning of Images in Churches, and the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them or worshipping them and bowing down before
them, can consist with God's forbidding to make any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Image, and to bow down to it and worship it. So
that I say, the Council <hi>it self</hi> does appoint flat Idolatry to
the Christian world to be practised. And it being so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
a thing, I pray you now let us consider the Reasons
why they do so.</p>
               <p>4. The first is, Because the Honour done to the Image
is referr'd to the Prototype. But I answer, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is either in virtue of that Similitude the Images
have with those persons they represent, which the words
of the Council seem to imply, at least touching the Saints,
<hi>quorum illae similitudinem gerunt:</hi> as when we praise a
Picture of such or such a person, that it is a very comely
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34037:125"/>
and lovely Picture, this praise naturally has a reference to
the Person whose Picture it is, in virtue of the similitude
betwixt the Picture and the Party.</p>
               <p>Or else this Reference, without any regard to personal
Similitude, is from the Direction of the Intention of the
Devotionist, that he intends upon the seeing and bowing,
suppose, to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed Virgin, or
any Saint, to take this occasion to worship <hi>Christ,</hi> the
blessed Virgin or the Saint thereby, the Image being but
at large a symbolical Presence of them, it being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
whether the Symbol or Image have any personal
Similitude with the party it represents or no.</p>
               <p>5. But now as for the former it is evident, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
uncertain whether any Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed
Virgin, or of this or that Saint, be like the carnal figure of
these persons while they were alive upon earth, or no.
Nay, it is in a manner certain to the contrary, none of
these holy Souls being given to such follies as to have their
Pictures drawn while they were alive. See my <hi>Mystery of
Iniquity,</hi> Part 1. Book 1. chap. 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </p>
               <p>But being it is extremely improbable but an Image
should be like some or other, that are either now alive, or
have lived on the earth since the beginning of the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this first supposition, this Honour or religious
Worship intended to <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed Virgin, or any
other Saint, will not onely miss them, but certainly fall
on some other who, in stead of being Saints, haply are or
have been very vile and wicked persons.</p>
               <p>6. But besides, no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>aints are worshipped before they
be in Heaven, nor indeed are properly Saints till then;
and the Glories in their Pictures that are about their Heads
shew plainly that they intend to represent the Saints in
their present condition of Glory in Heaven. Whence it is
plain that the Images are nothing like them they are made
for. For how can these Images of brass or stone or wood,
or any other materials, bear the Image of a seearate Soul,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34037:126"/>
which all the Saints are for the present? And what likeness
can there be betwixt the glorious body of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>hrist</hi> Heavenly
and spiritual, and an Image of any terrestrial matter? No
more than betwixt a piece of Dirt or Soot and the Sun or
bright Morning-star.</p>
               <p>And, which is most of all to be considered, what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Image can possibly represent him that is truly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>God-man,</hi> and is not the Object of our Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but as he is this Divine <hi>Complexum</hi> as well of the
<hi>Divinity</hi> as the <hi>Humanity?</hi> But what Statuary can carve
out the Effigies of the Deity? So that the pretense of this
Reference of the Honour to the Prototype in this first sense
thereof is very weak and vain. Nor, though there were
this natural Reference, would it follow that we are to
honour them this way, it being so plainly forbid, and
there being better ways then this, <hi>viz.</hi> the commemorating
and imitating their Vertues.</p>
               <p>7. And for that second sense, it is indeed disinvolved of
those former Difficulties; but greater here occurr. For as
touching our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> forasmuch as his pretended
Image is but his symbolical Presence, the doing of Divine
Worship towards it is again plain Idolatry, as appears by
that Example of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who worshipped the golden
Calf in reference to <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as appears plainly in the
Story, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 5. And for the blessed Virgin and the
rest of the Saints, that Incurvation toward their symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Presences is flat Idolatry, is manifest from the eighth,
ninth and tenth Conclusions of the first Chapter, and
the fifth, nineteenth and twentieth of the second of this
Treatise.</p>
               <p>And indeed thus to make the Images of the Saints so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
onely their symbolical Presences, and so to Worship
them before these Images, is an attributing Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to them. For this naturally does declare that they
have at least a terrestrial Omnipresency, which no invisible
Power which we know has but onely God. But to make a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34037:126"/>
low Obeisance to an absent person God knows how many
<hi>millions</hi> of miles off, is still a more forced and ridiculous
thing. And therefore the saluting of the Saints thus at their
symbolical Presences or Images, and in the mean time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
them to be <hi>in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>de Beatorum,</hi> (which they
do, and must do, unless they exclude them Heaven,) is
to acknowledge one Soul to fill Heaven and Earth with its
presence, which is that vast Privilege of God Almighty
onely; and therefore this Worship to them is gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as supposing such a Perfection in them as is no-where
but in God.</p>
               <p>Besides what was intimated before, that let this Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be what it will, there being an Incurvation or Prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before Images, whether they be mere Symbols or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Representations, it must be <hi>ipso facto</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>dolatry by the
seventh Conclusion of the first Chapter. From whence it
follows, that the Saints are not honoured by this worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of their Images, but hideously reproached, it suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them to be pleased and gratify'd with that which is an
abomination to the Lord, and a gross transgression of his
express Commands. It implies, I say, that they are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
vain glorious and rebellious against God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that the most vehemently oppose this way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of them by Images and Invocations are the most
true and faithfull Honourers of them, they so zealously
vindicating them from the great Reproaches these others
cast upon them. So far are they from being guilty herein
of any Rudeness or Clownishness against the Saints of
God.</p>

it being merely the setting down what the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defines about the worshipping of

his Answer is this; Here the Doctor, says
he, gives us a learned Antithesis betwixt the
Commandment of God and Decree of this Council.
But how weak, frivilous and Pharisaical this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
is, I have sufficiently declared in my Answer

That it is a plain, conspicuous and obvious

                  <p>He uses long ambages and circuits in his Answer to
this second part, but the main matter occurs in the
the end of his Answer, which is this, That I ought to
have proved that which I call the <hi>second</hi> to be a
Commandment really distinct from the <hi>first;</hi> And
that the understanding is not the same whether we
divide the Precepts of the first Table into three or
into four Commandments. This he absolutely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to do, saith he, his charge proves a mere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and bearing false witness against his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
And so while he pleads for his <hi>second,</hi> he
very uncharitably breaks his <hi>ninth</hi> Commandment.</p>

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>The whole frame of his Answer, if I had taken it
from the beginning to the end, is so weak and slight,
that I half suspect he was invited to it merely for
that last conceits sake; to break ajest betwixt the
second and ninth precept upon his Adversary. For
first, though I should admit the understanding
would be the same though the first Table were
divided but into three Commandments, so no
words of the first Table were left out; nay though
the first Table were called one Commandment or
Decree touching our duty towards God, yet my
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34037:128"/>
charge against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for leaving
out so great and so material a part of this Decree,
or of the first Commandment if you will, would
not be a jot mitigated thereby, the understanding
being the same, as my Antagonist himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whether it be held one Commandment, or
two. For if it be held one Commandment yet it
is plainly divisible into these two parts which we
call the first and second Commandments. And
this that we call the second Commandment, and
you the second part of the first Commandment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
really one and the same, and you acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you leave out that part of the Commandment,
where then is the Calumny? any more then if
one should accuse another that he took away two
shillings six pence, and he should Reply, it is an
unworthy slander, it was onely half a crown that
he took away: would not this to any indifferent
judge seem a very pleasant Apology to clear one of
the Theft?</p>
                     <p>But now in the second place, Though St. <hi>Austin</hi>
and St. <hi>Hierome (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>eter Lombard</hi> says it is <hi>Origen</hi>
and <hi>Austin</hi>) may differ in their Opinion about
the first and second Commandment, whether they
be one or two Commandments, yet I presume the
more ancient, and the more general sense of the
Church is that they are two. And it is well known
that <hi>Origen</hi> flourished long before <hi>Austin:</hi> But it
is acknowledged of all hands out of the word of
God, that there are just ten Commandments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more nor less. Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
that would have the first Table consist but of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34037:128"/>
three Commandments, is constrained to divide the
last Commandment into two; which is against the
Antiquity of the distinction of the Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Text into verses. For it is observable that
both in the Greek and Hebrew Text, though the
length of some of the Commandments has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
them to be divided into more verses than
one, yet they no where have crouded two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
into one verse; in so much that they
make, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Thou shalt not steal,</hi> three distinct verses: Whence
it is plain that that which we call the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is really but one Commandment, as
being contained in one verse; and that, <hi>Thou shalt
not covet thy neighbours wife,</hi> is not a whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
distinct from the rest contained in that
verse.</p>
                     <p>Besides, which is hugely remarkable; if, <hi>Thou
shalt not covet thy neighbours wife,</hi> be one intire
Commandment, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ninth;</hi> part of the tenth
Commandment, <hi>viz. Thou shalt not covet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
house,</hi> is set before it, which is not a thing
credible. But there is no absurdity nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
supposing it but one Commandment,
that, <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house,</hi> is set
first in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and, <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
wife,</hi> is placed first in <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> This
methinks should be enough to the impartial to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate,
that that which we usually call the tenth
Commandment, is not to be divided into two but
is all one entire Commandment; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first and second Commandments ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34037:129"/>
so called cannot be one Commandment but
two, that there may be ten.</p>
                     <p>To all which you may add, that but even a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
smattering in Logick may easily discover
the tenth Commandment usually so called to
be but one, and the first and second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so called to be really two; namely, from
the consideration of their Objects. Now the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in the tenth Commandment is but one in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<hi>viz.</hi> the keeping our desires from other
mens goods of what nature soever, <hi>Thou shalt
not covet any thing that is his;</hi> That is the general
of the whole Commandment plainly: And House,
Wife, Servant, Oxe, Asse, are but particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to this general, and by the same reason
that you make an intire Commandment of any one
of these Particulars, you may of every one of
them, and so divide the last Commandment at
least into five, which is very absurd. But as the
Object of the tenth Commandment shows it can
be but one, so the Objects of the first and second
plainly show they must be two Commandments,
because their Objects are distinctly two. The first
having for its Object the onely one true God whom
alone to retain we are plainly taught or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by that Precept; the second having for its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Graven Images or whatsoever similitudes of
things, which we are strictly forbid any way to
wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>hip. So plain every way is it, That that which
we call the second Commandment is the second
Commandment, and that there is not the least
show of calumny, in saying, They have left
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34037:129"/>
out the second Commandment in their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms.</p>
                     <p>But yet it is further observable, that if the first
and second Commandments were to be held but
one Commandment, there can be no so rational
ground as this, That the second has a close subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency
to the first, and that it is added that we may
keep the first more intirely and have no more
Gods in any sense, than one: Which implies
therefore that worshipping of Images Gods does
interpret as the making more Gods to our selves
then one, or that it is a necessary Concomitant of
making to our selves more Gods then one, as is
too too apparent in the Religion of the Gentiles,
nor can be enough lamented in degenerated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.
Which eagerness after Idol-Gods the
true God most severely prohibits, and show's him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so much the more solicitous and zealous here
against worshipping of Images, by reason of the
great Proclivity of mankind to that more than to
Polytheisme, or the not believing that there is
onely one <hi>supreme</hi> God the Creatour and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of all things. But the great danger is, that
acknowledging this, yet they may either defile his
Worship with Images, and make those Images
Gods by worshipping them, or Worship <hi>Doemon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Commandment or the second part of the
first, as my Adversary would have it. <hi>For I am a

                     <p>Which second Commandment therefore with
this direfull Commination added to it, being so
effectual a bar and so point blank against the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
practised in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, my Adversary
must give me leave to suspect, that it is not, as he
says, left out to ease the memory of the Vulgar
of so long a lesson, but to obliterate it out of their
mind and memory, or rather to never let them
have the sight of that which would certainly make
their Consciences tremble when they saw the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the Church which they are obliged to,
so plainly contrary to the word of God. But that
they have also left out the tenth and eleventh verses
about the Sabbath, that may be for a better blind
for this, and also that people may not be imbrued
with an over religious regard to the Lords day,
least they should find offence at the licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that day too, and note that many Saints
days are more solemnly kept, then that wherein
the Creation of the world and Redemption by
God our great Saviour and Redeemer is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at once. But I have insisted on this Argument
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34037:130"/>
longer than I intended. I hope long before this
the discerning Reader perceives, That the crime
lyes where it did, and that my charge in this point
is no Calumny.</p>

                     <p>I say therefore, That there is a great defect and
mistake of my Adversary in his not apprehending
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34037:131"/>
the full scope of my Argument. For it is not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prove that the Honour done to the Image
cannot be any of these two ways referred to the
Prototype, but that it cannot be referred so as to
quit the Act of Idolatry, as I have intimated at the
end of the sixth Paragraph, and at the beginning of
the last part of the seventh. Now there being but
two ways of referring this honour to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,
and the Council seeming to insinuate a fitness
from the similitude of the Images to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypes,
I mainly impugne that in my fifth and sixth
Paragraph, his Answer to which we shall here
omit. But for the sense of his present Answer in
general to the <hi>Dilemma,</hi> if I understand him it is
this, That there being a similitude of <hi>signification</hi>
as well as of <hi>figure</hi> (as he tells us anon) which
is implied in the direction of the Intention of the
Devotionist, and that therefore represents the
Prototype to his mind, whether there be simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of figure or no, that this makes my <hi>Dilemma</hi>
vain and defective, as disjoyning or dividing those
things one from another, that are found together
in every reference of the Devotionist. This is
the best sense I can make of his perplext and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Answer; To which I Reply, That although
there be that similitude of signification (though
in the mean time it be very improperly so called)
included in the intention or mind of the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onist
in the referring of the Image to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,
and so is a kind of note of remembrance to
him, yet being sometimes, this thing may be like the
thing which it is a note of, and have the similitude

of <hi>Figure</hi> as well as of <hi>Signification,</hi> and sometimes
merely the similitude of <hi>Signification,</hi> it is plain
there is ground enough to raise this bipartition
of Reference of the Image to the Prototype, it
being sometimes of Images that have merely <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem
Significationis,</hi> sometimes of those that
have <hi>similitudinem Figurae</hi> also, which the Council

honour done to the Image unto the Prototype by
vertue of similitude<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1. Because it is uncertain
whether the Figure of Christ the blessed Virgin and
the rest have any likeness to them. 2. And that it is
hugely probable they may be like some body else and

That the honour done to the Image may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Prototype, though there be no personal
similitude of <hi>Figure</hi> betwixt the Image and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

the Image signifying the Dignity, Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

similitude of Signification he would prove to be
where there is no personal similitude of Figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                  <p>To the second he Answers, that the Case the Doctor

any such honour or Worship can be done to the

mind to infuse Idolatry by what follows in his

of his Assertion, That there may be a similitude of

him. But we do civil honour onely to men, and
in bowing to them onely signifie our inclination

service and in the mean time acknowledge there is
that in them that is worthy of civil honour and

                  <p>To the first part of this Paragraph he Answers; That
the Images of the Saints represent them such as they
were upon Earth, onely with an additional mark of a
<hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Lawrel</hi> to signifie their triumphant state
in Glory; And then, That an Image may be like to
a separate Soul as well as to an Angel or Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,

who make separate Souls invested with aere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

                  <p>To the second he Answers, that if a terrestrial

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>To the first I Reply, That unless my Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
here suppose what he can never make good,
that they have the true effigies of the Saints such
as they were upon Earth, he is never the near (as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34037:133"/>
to this first curiosity) whether he phancy them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
such as they were on Earth, or such as
they are now in Heaven. But being Religious
Worship is not due to them till they be <hi>canonized,</hi>
to represent them such as they were on Earth, is
to represent them in Order to Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
such as they were before they were capable
of Religious Worship. And the <hi>Lawrel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi>
he talks of, those are not on their Images or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but onely a Glory over their Heads in their
Pictures, so far as I remember, of which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
signification is, That that picture stands for
them such as they are now in glory, and there is
the same sense of their Statues and of their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Moreover, his supposal is false and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his own Assertion before, when he asserts
that the Images of Cherubims or Angels are like
in Figure to the Angels themselves, as if there
were Ox-headed and Lyon-headed Angels. And
lastly, suppose we should be so courteous as to
grant him the doctrine of the <hi>Platonists</hi> that Souls
separate have aereal or aethereal Vehicles, what
would this advantage him they allowing no settled
Figure to them? And if there were an <hi>humane</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
allowed, when we have no knowledge what
was their <hi>individual</hi> terrestrial Figure, how shall
we know what is their aereal or aethereal? And
though the Figure was known, what terrestrial
matter can express that lively enravishing spiritual
beauty that is in those lucid Vehicles? So that
though the Figure were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> the form which is
the life of the Figure would be quite lost, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34037:134"/>
be nothing near so like the separate Soul as the dead
carcass of the greatest beauty on Earth, after four
days lying in the grave, would be to the said party
when alive. So that my Adversary in his Answer
to this first part seems to indulge to humours and
fetches of wit, rather than to reason soberly, and
so as to prove a personal likeness betwixt the Saints
and their Images.</p>
                     <p>And this in like sort may be said of his Answer
to the second part, which is indeed an odd unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
fetch of wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>, but hugely rude and harsh,
that would pretend to fix on my Argument the
horrid crime of blasphemy, when it is in truth the
asserting the transcendent excellency of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>
of Christ, not the denying of it, which were
an hainous piece of blasphemy against the Son of
God indeed. I say therefore that when I ask,
<hi>what terrestrial Image can possibly represent him that
is truely <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                           </gap> God-man?</hi> that no mans
mind that is not very extravagant could ever phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that I meant any other Image, then what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
to our sight, which that in our eye is not.
Again, it is manifest that I mean it of some
Image that represents the absent, and <hi>invisible</hi>
Humanity of Christ by reason of its absence;
and not such an Image as a <hi>Parelion</hi> or a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selene</hi>
are, that do not represent the Sun or Moon
but by vertue of the presence of those <hi>Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
Nor did t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>e Image of Christ in the eyes of
the Apostles or other men represent Christ any
otherwise then by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> of his Presence. But
it is plain to any that will not cavil, that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34037:134"/>
my own words of such Images as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the absent, as the Statue of <hi>Caesar,</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
and the like. And then lastly I flatly deny that the
Image of an external Object in the eye, is <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial.</hi>
For the Image is not in the nervous
bottom of the eye but butts onely upon it, as
the Images let in upon white paper through a
Hole in a dark room. That Image is not fixed
nor subjected in the paper, but in the ethereal
matter that touches the paper And so the Image
is in the ethereal matter that touches the bottom
of the eye, not in the bottom of the eye it self. But
ethereal matter is not terrestrial, and therefore
this no terrestrial Image.</p>
                     <p>Unto all which I add, That it does not follow
but that, though the Image in the eye, call it <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial</hi>
or <hi>ethereal,</hi> had not the adequate or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
power of representing Christ <hi>God-man</hi> to
the Apostles when he was on Earth, yet, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our Saviour and the Divine graces of his
Person shooting through that Image into the Souls
and hearts of the beholders (faith being wrought in
them by the spirit of God according to his eternal
purpose; as it is written, <hi>No man cometh to me,
unless my Father draw him</hi>) they might behold him
and give that Testimony that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> does of
him, <hi>Iohn 1. The word was made flesh and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and we beheld the glory of him as the glory
of the onely begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth.</hi>
But for others that saw the humane Presence of
him who is truly <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, though they could
not discern him to be such or to be the Messias,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34037:135"/>
so far as they saw it chiefly to be imputed to his
humanity being present, and not to the Image in the
eye, which but for his Presence could not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him to the Soul. But I hope the wicked and
unbeliever no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> discovering his <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> does not
at all argue him not to be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>God-man.</hi>
And now if the Image impressed by the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ had not not the natural Power of
representing that <hi>Divine Complexum</hi> God-man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to both the natures, how far short shall
Images of wood or stone, or what ever materials be
from representing him being absent?</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is apparent how rash and
inhumane my Antagonist is, to charge me with
blasphemy upon such slight and toyish pretenses as
he is pleased to take up, and every way so weak
and insignificant. I have insisted on this longer than
was needfull: But I was invited so to do, because
my Adversary here seems to have intended to make
a show of induing his confutations of this seventh

one nothing at all, he having not taken notice of

is if he would make good the similitude of <hi>Figure</hi>

believe neither any truth nor necessity of it: but
onely to make a show of confuting this seventh
Chapter, when he has left the latter end of the
sixth Paragraph, and this whole seventh untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is the main drift of all; namely to shew,
that whether the Images have any similitude with
their Prototypes or no, yet it is Idolatry to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them, and that therefore the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
has no subterfuge in this regard to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

the honour they appoint to them.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Doctrine of the second Council of Nice touching the
Worship of Images, (to which the Council of Trent refers,)
that it is grosly Idolatrous also.</head>
               <p>1. BUT now as for the other Reason of these <hi>Tridentine</hi>
Fathers, whereby they would support their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
in this point, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Authority of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> held about the year 780, (to omit,
that long before this time the Church had become asym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral,
which yet is a very substantial Consideration) I
shall only return this brief answer. The God of <hi>Israel,</hi>
which is the Father of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> has given
this express command to his Church for ever, <hi>Thou shalt
not make to thy self any graven Image, thou shalt not bow
down to it, nor worship it.</hi> But the second Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> says, Thou mayst and shalt bow down to to the Image
of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the blessed Virgin, and of the rest of the
Saints. Now whether it be fit to believe and obey God,
or men, judg ye: I might add farther, men so silly and
frivolous in the defense of their Opinions, so false and
fabulous in the Allegations of their Authorities and the
recitall of miraculous Stories, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> has proved
at large in his <hi>Examen</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I will give an Instance or two. Mat. 5. 15. <hi>No man
lighteth a candle and putteth it under a bushell;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Images of the Saints are to be placed on the Altars,
and Wax-candles lighted up before them, in due honour
to them. Again, <hi>Psalm 16. But to the Saints that are
on the Earth:</hi> But the Saints are in Heaven, say they,
therefore their Images ought to be on the Earth, &amp;c.
As for the Miracles done by Images, as their Speaking,
the Healing of the sick, the Revenging of the wrong
done to them, the distilling of ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34037:136"/>
heal the wounded, sick or lame, their Recovering water
into a dry Well, and the like, it were too tedious to
recite these Figments.</p>
               <p>But that of the Image of the Virgin, to whom her <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votionist</hi>
spake when he took leave of her, and was to
take a long Journey, intreating her to look to her Candle,
which he had lighted up for her, till his return, I cannot
conceal. For the Story says, the same Candle was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
six months after, at the return of her <hi>Devoto.</hi> An
example of the most miraculous Prolonger that ever I met
withall before in all my days. Such an Image of the Virgin
would save poor Students a great deal in the expense of
Candles, if the thing were but lawfull and feasible.</p>
               <p>3. From these small hints a man may easily discover of
what Authority this second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ought to be,
though they had not concluded so point-blank against the
Word of God. But because that Clause in this Paragraph
of the Council I have recited, <hi>Id quod Conciliorum, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertim
verÃ² secundae Nicaenae Synodi,</hi> &amp;c. may as well aim
at the determination of what these Fathers <hi>mean</hi> by that
<hi>debitus honor &amp; reverentia</hi> which they declare to be due
to the Images of <hi>Christ</hi> and the Saints, as <hi>confirm</hi> their
<hi>own Conclusion</hi> by the Authority of that <hi>Nicene</hi> Council,
we will take notice also what a kinde of Honour and
Reverence to Images the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council did declare for,
and in short it is this;</p>
               <p>That they are to be worshipped and adored and to be
honoured with Wax-candles, and by the smoaking of
Incense or Perfumes, and the like. Which smells rankly
enough in all conscience of Idolatry, as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself
upon the Decalogue cannot but acknowledge. But this
is not all. The Invocation of Saints, their Mediation
and propitiating God for us for adoring their Images,

               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:34037:137"/>4. And truly, according to the Collections of <hi>Photius</hi> in
<hi>Iustellus,</hi> one would think that they meant the <hi>Cultus Latriae</hi>
to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> they using the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as if
that Worship which was done to the Image passed through
to <hi>Christ</hi> himself, which would not be sutable to him, if
itwere not Divine Worship. And where that word is not
used, yet the sense makes hugely for it. As in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph

                  <hi>This seventh Synod, saith he, (that is to say, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of</hi> Nice) with joint suffrages hath established and
ratifj'd the worshipping of the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the
honour and reverence of him that is expressed by it; this
Worship and Honour being done in such manner as when we
approach the holy Symbols or Types of our most holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship: (<hi>for the word is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.) For we do not
stop at them, nor restrain our Worship and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them, nor are we divided toward heterogeneous and
different Scopes or Objects; but by that Service and worship
of them that appears divided are we carried up devoutly
and undividedly unto the one and indivisible Deity. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is plainly declared, that that very Worship which
passes to the Deity is done towards the Image of</hi> Christ
<hi>first or jointly, as being one and the same undivided Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in truth and reality; as also that this Worship is that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34037:137"/>
Worship which is called</hi> Latria, <hi>and is due to the highest
God onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. But that Religious Worship is done to the Images of
all the Saints seems imply'd in what comes afterwards,
where it is said, that this second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (which
<hi>Photius</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>.
That this Council <hi>has not onely establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and appointed that the Image of</hi> Christ <hi>should be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and worshipped, but the holy Images of the Virgin</hi> Mary
<hi>and of all the Saints, according to the excellency and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Prototypes. For even by these are we carried
up into a certain unitive and conjunctive vision, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
are vouchsafed that divine and supernatural con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>nction
or contact with the highest of all desirables,</hi> that is, God
himself.</p>
               <p>6. Can any thing more inflame the Souls of men with that
mystical lust after Idols then the Doctrines of this <hi>Nicene</hi>
Synod? For as for the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the same Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Worship is done to that which is done to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And for the Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the rest
of the Saints, though that Worship is allotted them onely
that is proportionable to their Prototypes, yet they are
worshipped such a way as that thereby<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> while we adhere
to their Images or Statues, we are declared to be made fit
for and to be vouchsafed a tactual Union with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
What <hi>Philtrum</hi> more effectual to raise up that <hi>Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi>
that being mad and lovesick after Images and Idols,
then this? What can inrage their Affections more towards
Idolatry, then to phansie that while they worship Idols,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34037:138"/>
and cling about dead Statues, that very individual act (and
therefore it cannot be too intense) is that wherewith they
are united to, and lie in the very Embraces of, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living
and true God?</p>
               <p>7. The sense of the Synod is, according to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of <hi>Photius,</hi> that we worship and unite our selves
with God as well in the worshipping the Images of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and of other Saints, as in the worshipping of the Image
of <hi>Christ.</hi> So that all is <hi>Religious</hi> Worship, and consequently
gross Idolatry, it being done to Stocks and Stones and
such like sensless Objects. For the drift of all Idolatry is,
when it is questioned, and craftily defended, that through
the Worship of <hi>Daemons</hi> and Images they reach at the
Worship of, and the joyning their Devotion to, the first
and highest God-head. Wherefore the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
declaring with the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that is to
say, the blind leading the blind, they have both fallen into
this dreadfull Pit of Idolatry.</p>

                  <p>To that about the weak reasonings of the Council,
which he says I would gladly father upon them, he
pretends to think it a child of my own brain till I

saith he, the Council recites some Miracles in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

Christ and his Saints, these he most profoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
by an unanswerable laughter. This is the main

                     <p>To the first I Reply, It is <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> not I, that
fathers those subtil reasonings upon the Fathers of
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. And though I have not had the
time nor curiosity to examin the History of the
Council my self so throughly and exactly as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
of my own notice that this is the very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, yet this I will say for
<hi>Chemnitius,</hi> that I find him, so far as I can see, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the main of his account of <hi>things,</hi> not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that of the seventh <hi>Action</hi> which my Adversary
alledges so triumphantly against <hi>Photius;</hi> Which
we shall consider anon. As for that of <hi>

am sure they bring it in impertinently enough. But
can any thing be more impertinent than that of
Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who influenced the Council, in his
letter to <hi>Irene</hi> and her son <hi>Constantine,</hi> where plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
zealously for Image-Worship he urges these
places of Scripture, <hi>Vultum tuum Domine requiram,</hi>
Psalm 26. <hi>Ad vultum tuum depre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will I seek, Lord lift thou up the light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

and lights set up before them, as if the light of Gods
Countenance were to be reflected from these pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Statues, or his face to be sought in looking up
to graven Images which his Soul abhors. But such
seems to be the arguing of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to these
two Princes. And as for the middle Quotation, it
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34037:139"/>
is very modestly or very cunningly done of the
Pope, that he did not take a greater share of that
verse, and say, <hi>In muneribus vultum tuum depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur
omnes divites plebis.</hi> But then the plot had
been more easily smelt out, that the Zeal for
Images was in reference to the Oblations and gifts
brought to them. This tast may suffice to let the
Reader understand what shre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were in that Council, when the Pope himself, who

as he does.</p>
                     <p>Now to the second part I have nothing to Reply,
but that I think it not so commendable carriage for
a mans self to laugh when he tells a story that is
ridiculous; and therefore it is a breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
at least of Civility, to affirm that I laughed,
where it was not good manners so to do; he not
possibly hearing me laugh at such a distance as he
was removed from me when I writ this Paragraph;
which makes me believe that he himself could not
but laugh at the recital of such incredible stuff,
and so measured my Corn by his own Bushel.</p>

                  <p>Instead of Answering to that Quotation of <hi>Photius</hi>

                  <p>His next pretense is to prove positively by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Photius</hi> that this Council gives the worship
of Latria to the Image of Christ. But the Doctor,
says he, had plaid his Master-prize, if he had given
all this rabble (he means both the Quotations) in
the Councils own words, but instead of that he feeds
upon Reversions, at the second hand takes his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
from <hi>Photius</hi> (a Person of as much credit
as himself) and makes <hi>Photius</hi> the Paraphrast and
Interpreter of the Councils meaning. But what if
the Council say no such thing? Nay what if the
Council deliver the quite contrary doctrine? How
blank then will the Doctors charge look, upon the
discovery of such Disingenuity? And truly had
the Doctor but taken so much as a cursory survey
of Catholick Authors on this Subject, he might
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34037:141"/>
have found them frequently and truly quoting this
very Council, Act. 7. to prove that the Image of
Christ is not to be honoured with the Worship of
Latria: but that such honour and reverence is due
to Images in general, as to the Books of the Gospel
and the holy utensils of the Altar. This is all,

                     <p>That these Quotations out of <hi>Photius</hi> prove that
which I produce them for, my Adversary cannot
deny, supposing the Authority of <hi>Photius</hi> were
Authentick; Which he vilifies upon no grounds,
nor has any that I know so to do. He was the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Chief or Head of
the Greek Church where this Council was held,
And was <hi>Patriarch</hi> not long after this Council. And
his place and dignity in the Church, and very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
you may be sure would make him very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to understand a Council of so great importance
as this: And for his Parts and Learning, he was
extraordinarily famous. Concerning which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
here abstain from interserting that high <hi>Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
which that Learned Prelate of our Church Dr.
<hi>Creighton</hi> gives him in his Preface to the History
of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Council. <hi>Illustri</hi> Photio <hi>Doctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

in the same Preface, <hi>Aequalem</hi> Photio <hi>nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
aetas dedit, nulla dabit.</hi> And this <hi>Photius</hi> it is
that describes the seven general Councils in his
Epistle to <hi>Michael</hi> Prince of <hi>Bulgary,</hi> in none of
which, for his own Credit, can a man think he
would willingly be taken Tripping, or that he
would say any thing contrary to the sense of this
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had
assuredly a Copy of as well as himself, and would
have been ready to discover him if he falsified in
any thing; especially these two Sees being in
Competition for that Principality of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> to
whether Church it should be adjoined, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but lately Converted to Christianity. And
therefore in all likelyhood <hi>Photius</hi> would take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
heed how he spake any thing contrary to
the sense of this Council. Nay, what will you
say, if I prove that <hi>Photius</hi> has spoke exquisite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to the sense of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
himself, (I mean of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> who influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced

who ought to blush for his Temerity and Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity?</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore take notice what Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>

perused uncorrupted copies thereof; And truely

                     <p>And therefore the first reading was in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
thus; <hi>That holy and adorable Images be set up,
and that they be honoured with salutations and adorations
in such sort as we salute and Worship the figure of the

of the unskilfull blunder and gross confusion in the

[And that there be added also Lights and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But one thing more especially is to be
observed here, That the Council does look at the
burning of Incense and setting up Lights as an Act
of <hi>Latria</hi> if before the Image of Christ, and as a
Religious Worship be they before what Image they
will, for immediately after [<hi>And that there be added
also Lights and Incense,</hi> &amp;c.] there follows, <hi>For the
Honour done to the Image passeth to the Prototype.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I will add unto all this, that suppose the foist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words which we have excluded should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and allowed of, yet if we improve that
Epither of <hi>Latria</hi> to what it seems to aim at, it will
not at all justle with <hi>Photius</hi> his sense nor other
parts of the Council. For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

Latria, here naturally signifies that Latria which
is <hi>Terminative</hi> on the Object, which can belong
to no other but God. And therefore is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
to that <hi>Latria</hi> which does <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> and is
<hi>Transitive,</hi> which cannot belong to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is none greater nor higher than He
to whom it should pass: whence it is plain that
the <hi>Transitive Latria</hi> is not the <hi>true Latria</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incompetible to God the highest Object. So
that <hi>Cultus Latriae transitivus</hi> or <hi>respectivus,</hi> that
is, which hits so on one Object, that it tends to
an higher and better, is allowed by the Council to
the Image of Christ, though not <hi>Cultus Latriae ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minativus.</hi>

in his Notes on this seventh Act of the
Council. Which is the very sense of <hi>Photius;</hi> And
which this foisted sentence at least does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.
but doth rather imply, That this to the
Image of Christ is <hi>Latria</hi> too, but not <hi>vera La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi>
viz. <hi>Terminative</hi> but <hi>Transitive</hi> onely; which
is the Thing, as I said, which <hi>Photius</hi> asserts.</p>
                     <p>And now for that passage in the second Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>,
the genuine sense of it will be hence easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
For <hi>Latria</hi> belonging to the Image of
Christ according to the sense of the Council and
of <hi>Photius,</hi> and to Christ himself according to the
sense of all Orthodox Christians, the Analogy
will be thus. Let Christ himself be 24. and the
Worship due to him, <hi>viz.</hi> Latria, 18. Let the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> be 8. every Saint else 4. Now
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> we necessarily conclude,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34037:145"/>
as 24 to 8, so 18 to 6. As 24 to 4, so 18 to 3, that
is to say, As Christ is to <hi>Mary,</hi> so is <hi>Latria</hi> to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdulia,</hi>
and as Christ is to any other Saint, so is
<hi>Latria</hi> to <hi>Dulia.</hi> But according to the Council
and <hi>Photius</hi> who give <hi>Latria</hi> also to the Image of
Christ; Then as Christ is to <hi>Mary,</hi> so is the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Image of Christ which is <hi>Latria,</hi> to
the Worship of the Image of <hi>Mary,</hi> which must
therefore be <hi>Hyperdulia.</hi> And as Christ or <hi>Mary</hi> to
another Saint, so the Worship of the Image of
Christ or <hi>Mary</hi> to the Worship of the Image of
another Saint. The former therefore being <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
and <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> this last must be <hi>Dulia:</hi> The
Worship of the Image of the Saint must be <hi>Dulia,</hi>
as well as of its Prototype: Which is the very
same that <hi>Alexander Halts, Thomas Aquinas</hi> and
<hi>Bonaventure</hi> those ancient School-men, who writ
above 400 years ago, do affirm, That the same
honour is done to the Image that is done to the
Prototype. That the Images have <hi>according to the
excellency and venerability of their Prototypes,</hi> some
<hi>Latria,</hi> some <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> and some <hi>Dulia.</hi> And
thus I think I have proved my Translation of that
passage, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>

concludes the sameness of honour to <hi>Image</hi> and
<hi>Prototype.</hi> And which is my main drift of all, I
have sufficiently evinced that <hi>Photius</hi> has given the
most natural and genuine sense of this <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council. According to which my Adversary
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34037:146"/>
even in his own conceit and opinion cannot but
conclude the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which refers her
self to this Council, to be gross Idolaters. And

for their Invocation, which is competible to no invisible

that their Images are worshipped with <hi>religious</hi> Worship
also.</p>
               <p>3. But we shall make still the clearer judgement thereof,

perfectly as the Idol-Gods of the Heathen, as <hi>Octavius</hi>
jearingly speaks of the Heathen Gods, that is, their Idols,
in. <hi>Minucius Felix: Ecce funditur, fabricatur, scalpitur;

it is consecrated and prayed unto; then at length it becomes
a God. And if this will doe it, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s
Images will prove as good Idol-Gods as any of them all.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Chemnitius</hi> recites some forms of Consecration: I
will cull out onely those of the Images of the blessed Virgin
and of S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> That of the Virgin is this: <hi>anctify, O
God, this Image of the blessed Virgin, that it may aid and
keep safe thy faithfull people; that Thundrings and Lightnings,
if they grow too terrible and dangerous, may be quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
thereby: and that the Inundations of Rain, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
of civil War, and Devastations by Pagans, may be
suppressed by the presence thereof.</hi> Which is most effectual
to make all men come and hurcle under the protection
of the Virgin's Image in such dangers, as under the Wings
of the great <hi>Iehovah.</hi> This is hugely like the consecrated
Telesms of the Pagans.</p>
               <p>But let us hear the form of the Consecration of the
Image of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> also: <hi>Grant, O God, that all those that
behold this Image with Reverence, and pray before it, may
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34037:148"/>
be he ard in whatsoever Streights they are. Let this Image
be the holy Expulsion of Devils, the conciliating the presence
and assistence of Angels, the protection of the faithfull; and
that the Intercession of this Saint may be very powerfull and
effectuall in this place.</hi> What a mighty Charm is this to
make the Souls of the feeble to hang about these Images
as if their Presence were the Divine Protection it self?</p>
               <p>5. These <hi>Chemnitius</hi> recites out of the <hi>Pontificall</hi> he
perused. But the <hi>Rituale Romanum,</hi> published first by
the command of <hi>Paulus Quintus,</hi> and again authorized by
Pope <hi>vrban</hi> the eighth, will do our business sufficiently,
they being both since the Council of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rent;</hi> and therefore
by the Exposition of these Popes we may know what that
<hi>debitus Honor</hi> is which the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers mention as
that which ought to be done to the Images of <hi>Christ,</hi> the
blessed Virgin or any other Saint. For the Consecration
of their Images runs thus:</p>
               <p>Grant, O God, that whosoever before this Image shall
diligently and humbly upon his knees worship and honour thy
only begotten Son, or the blessed Virgin, (<hi>according as the
Image is that is a-consecrating</hi>) or this glorious Apostle, or
Martyr, or Confessor, or Virgin, that he may obtain by

the <hi>Daemon</hi> pray'd unto. There is no more in Paganism
it self. And yet by the Pope's own Exposition this is the
<hi>debitus Honor</hi> that is owing to the Images of the Saints.
Consider the latter end of the last Conclusion of the first
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34037:148"/>
Chapter, and the forms of Invocation in the fourth and
fifth, as also the eighteenth Conclusion of the second
Chapter.</p>
               <p>6. This is all plain and express according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>utho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Church. And that, besides their Adoration
and Praying before these Images, (which, considering
the postures of the Supplicant and the Image, is as much
praying to them as the Heathens will acknowledge done
to theirs,) there are also Wax-candles burning before
them, and the Oblation of Incense or perfuming them,
Feasts likewise, Temples and Altars to the same Saints,
and the carrying them in Procession, (which was the guize
of ancient Paganism,) is so well known, that I need not
quote any Authours. And that this is the practice of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church jointly and coherently with their Worship
of Images, is manifest to all the world; and that therefore
it is as arrant Idolatry as Paganism it self, and consequently
real Idolatry by the third Conclusion of the first Chapter.
And lastly, it is to be noted that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
naming the <hi>debitus Honor</hi> of Images, and not excepting
these in known practice then among them, must of all
reason be conceived to mean these very Circumstances, as
Paganicall as they are, of the Worshipping of them.</p>
               <p>7. And the rather, because they do pretend to rectify
some Miscarriages in the business of Images, as any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
or dishonest Gain by them, all lascivious Dresses
of the Images, all Drunkenness and disorderly Riot at
their Feasts, and the like. Which methinks is done with
as grave caution against Idolatry, as if they had decreed
that all the Whores in <hi>Rome</hi> should forbear to go in
so garish apparell, that they should be sure to wear clean
linen, to be favourable to poor younger Brothers in the
price of a night's Lodging, that they keep themselves
wholsome and clean from the Pox, and the like; which
were not the putting down, but the establishing, of
whores and Whoredome in the Papacy. And so are
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34037:149"/>
these Cautions touching Images. <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam
in non exceptis.</hi> Wherefore these Circumstances of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
being not named by the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers in their
Exception, they are thereby ratify'd. Which yet are
so like the old Pagan Idolatry, that <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> one
of their own Church, could not abstain from professing,
<hi>non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; titulos mutaverint;</hi> That onely the Names and Objects
were changed, not the Modes, of the ancient Idolatry
of the Heathen.</p>
               <p>8. If the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> would have really and in
good earnest rectify'd their Church in the point of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
they should have followed the Example of that
skilfull and famous Physician Dr. <hi>Butler,</hi> they should have
imi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>viz.</hi> That we should first pare it very carefully, and
then be sure to cut out or scoup out all the Coar of it,
and after that fill the hollow with Salt, and when this
is done, cast it forthwith into the Kennell. This is the
safest way of dealing with those things that have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
Poison or Danger in them. See those most
wholesome and judicious Homilies of our Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
against the Perill of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>9. And thus much shall serve for the setting out the
Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so far as it seems to be
allow'd by the Church it self. But for those more gross
Extravagancies, which, though they have connived
at, yet they would be loath to own upon publick
Authority, I will neither weary my self nor my Reader
by meddling with them. Such as the making the Images
to sweat, their Eyes to move, the making them to smile,
or lowre and look sad, to feel heavy or light, or the
like. Which does necessarily tend to the engaging of
the people to believe and have assiance in the very Images
themselves, as those Consecrations also imply which I
cited out of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34037:149"/>
acknowledge which they say to that Face of <hi>Christ</hi> which
they call the <hi>Veronica.</hi> Which Rhyme runs thus:

                  </q>
And with such like blinde Devotion do they likewise
speak to the Cross:

This must sound very wildly and extravagantly to any

Image for Aid and Succour, (the Image bearing the

                     <p>AS to the being contrary to the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> I Reply, That I have already shown
that it is most consonant thereto, both from <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and the Council it self. And therefore <hi>Thomas</hi>
and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> being such very ancient School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
about 400 years ago, and therefore much
nearer to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, it is most likely they
followed the air of that Council and of Pope <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
letter to <hi>Irene</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> approved by that
Council. And it is incredible that Pope <hi>Adrians</hi>
letter and the sense of the Council concerning so
great a point, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>f so high importance, should be
unknown to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34037:150"/>
more learned of them, for above four hundered
years together. Touching [<hi>May be</hi> worshipped]
and [<hi>Is to</hi> be worshipped] I demand whether any
undue VVorship may be given to the Image
of Christ. If therefore that VVorship which
may be given is due and fit, it is plain it is
to be given or ought to be given; which questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless
was the Opinion of both <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure.</hi>
And lastly, As to the winding into
nice distinctions, what distinctions are here but
onely of <hi>TerminativÃ¨,</hi> and <hi>RelativÃ¨,</hi> or <hi>Transitive?</hi>
which are intelligible enough, <hi>viz</hi> That <hi>Latria</hi>
cannot be given to the Image of Christ <hi>TerminativÃ¨</hi>
but onely <hi>RelativÃ¨,</hi> or <hi>TransitivÃ¨,</hi> It must

                        </gap>, pass to the Prototype as the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> speaks. That is to say, We must
do Divine honour to the Image of Christ that
Christ ultimately may be honoured thereby,
which is plainly to commit gross Idolatry to the
glory and honour of Christ. And therefore my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
durst name none of these nice distinctions,
not because they are above the capacity of the
Vulgar, but because even a Vulgar capacity can
easily observe the folly and futility of them.</p>

                  <p>First, he says, That my alledging of <hi>Azorius</hi> is a proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

                     </gap>rius witnesses of, he says
it is so far from being the constant Opinion of their

which he says I have forgot or purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
omitted in my long Translation out of <hi>Photius,</hi>
though the onely material word in the whole citation.
For he contends that the Worship due to the Image

the steers-man of that Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> whom
yet they now make a Fallible Mortal, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his Opinion and the Councils, as I think I

says, Unless limited by that qualifying distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which I purposely omitted in
Translating of <hi>Photius.</hi> First, I say, I did not omit
the Translating of it; For I render
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, thus, <hi>According to

this passage, but from this very passage have
I demonstrated, according to the mind of <hi>Photius</hi>
and the Council, that one and the same Worship,
even univocally the same, is to be given to the
Image and the Prototype. Of such confessed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
has their. Church been found guilty of till
of late, even according to my Adversaries Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
                     <p>But now, Secondly, with my Adversary to say,
They are onely Analogically the same, is a phrase
of uncertain signification, whether it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<hi>Logically</hi> or <hi>Geometrically.</hi> If <hi>Logically,</hi> it
is as much as to say, That the Worship to the
Image and the Prototype agree in one immediate
<hi>Genus Analogum.</hi> As in those words that I suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
foisted into the Council, there is mention of
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, by which suppose were meant the
highest and most principal <hi>Latria,</hi> which is except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there as undue, suppose to the Image of Christ;
but that there may be some other <hi>Latria</hi> that is.
Wherefore the <hi>Genus Analogum</hi> that is immediate to
these two <hi>Latria's,</hi> is a <hi>Latria</hi> common to them
both, and the two <hi>Latriae</hi> under it, the one to
Christ, the other to his Image, are the <hi>species</hi> of this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34037:152"/>
                        <hi>Genus.</hi> And so in like manner of <hi>Hyperdulia</hi> to the
blessed Virgin and of <hi>Dulia</hi> to the rest of the Saints,
these words used in respect of their Images and of
themselves must be the <hi>species</hi> of those common
<hi>genera, Hyperdulia</hi> and <hi>Dulia.</hi> But according to
the Rudiments of <hi>Logick</hi> the <hi>species</hi> of a <hi>Genus Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum</hi>
do really, though one dependently of the
other and less principally, partake of the common
nature of the <hi>Genus;</hi> which being either <hi>Latria,
Hyperdulia,</hi> or <hi>Dulia,</hi> and all these Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it is manifest Religious Worship is given to
all the Images.</p>
                     <p>But now if we understand that the Worship
done to the Image and the Prototype is. Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the same in a <hi>Geometrical</hi> sense, we are first to
take notice, that Analogy in Geometry requires
four termes; as, in A, B:: B, C. or A, B:: C, D.
And therefore the four Termes in this Case,
will be, Christ, the Worship of Christ, Christs
Image, the Worship of Christs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>mage: As Christ
to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>e Worship of Christ, so Christs Image
to the Worship of Christs Image. Now if you
will say, The Worship of Christ and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christs Image is one and the same Term
in this Analogy, you <hi>ipso facto</hi> declare, that,
seeing the Worship of Christ is <hi>Latria</hi> prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ly
so called, the Worship of Christs Image is so also.
You see therefore how gross a thing it is to say
the Termes are Analogically the same in this
Geometrical way, it implying also a Parity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Image of Christ and Christ himself. And
the same inconvenience will recu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> though you
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:34037:152"/>
take them alternately: As Christ to Christs
Image, so the Worship of Christ to the Worship
of Christs Image. Here again if the VVorship of
Christs Image and the VVorship of Christ be the
same, it will follow that there is a Parity betwixt
Christ and his Image, which is Impossible. But
you will say, the Worship of Christ, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christs Image is Analogically the same,
That's the thing you mean. But you seem not to
know what you mean your selves: If you mean
in that Logical sense above, you have your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
already; If you mean in a Geometrical or
Arithmetical sense, if I should use your freedom
of speech elsewhere, I might say more than that
it is not sense. For the Termes including a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
are not called Analogically the same,
but the proportions included betwixt each two
Termes, which make up the four Termes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional,
are rightly said to be the same; As in
6 to 3, and 4 to 2, the proportion betwixt 6
and 3 is the same proportion that betwixt 4 and
2; but neither 6 and 3 nor 4 and 2 are Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
the same. Therefore nothing with any
sense can be said this Geometrical way unless this,
That there is the same proportion betwixt the
VVorship of Christ and the VVorship of his Image,
that there is betwixt Christ and Christs Image.
But this is far from saying the VVorship of Christ
and the VVorship of his Image is Analogically
the same; there being no sameness of Termes
including proportions in these Cases, unless the
Termes be equal, as in 10, 10:: 5, 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or 10, 5:: 10, 5.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34037:153"/>
But thus will the Image of Christ have <hi>Latria</hi> due
to it as well as Christ himself. But such muddy
and confounded Doctrines must needs be the
mothers of confounded Notions and distinctions.
But supposing, As Christ to his Image (which must
be the ground of proportion betwixt the two Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of Christ and Christs Image) so the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christ is to the Worship of Christs Image;
the Image of Christ beingin a most absolute sense
infinitely inferiour to Christ himself, what kind
or share of Worship that is to terminate on his
Image, can be imagined so mean, but it will be
really too much? and therefore the fittest propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be none at all. And how will lighting
up Candles and burning Incense before Christs
Image, which is plainly Religious Worship, yea
Sacrifice and therefore <hi>Latria,</hi> as I have proved
above, and yet enjoyned by this Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
bear so little proportion to the Worship of Christ
himself, as his Image does to him, which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
inferiour?</p>
                     <p>Things therefore succeed so ill this <hi>Arithmetical</hi>
way that I half phancy my Antagonist to affect the
<hi>Logical,</hi> though I must confess I know not which
he would be at, he is so off and on; which made
me show the unsuccesfulness of both. But let
the Reader judge of his words, <hi>pag. 87. As the
Man and the painted Man are Analogically the same,

By saying not Univocally but Analogically the

same, (though a few lines before he expresses
himself in a Geometrical way) he seems to make
a Man and a painted Man two <hi>species</hi> under one
<hi>Genus Analogum,</hi> whenas a Man and a painted
Man are termes equivocal; As if <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi>
when they declared the Worship gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Image and the Prototype to be
the same, meant equivocally the same! What

No question there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Council, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council as Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian.</hi>
And that Religious Worship is meant to
Images in their worshipping them, is plain from
that Clause; <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>That besides Salutation
and Adoration, they were to add the setting up Lights

honour done to the Image passes to the Prototype.</hi>
Now as I above noted, burning of Incense is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and setting up Lights was a piece of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
service in the Pagan Religion to their <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
and a kind of Oblation, and it is here plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed to be done in honour to the Images,
out of all which it is apparent that it is Religious
Worship. And then, in that it is said <gap reason="foreign">

Images and their Prototypes are lookt upon but

                        </gap> as one;
not one to the Image the other to the Prototype,
(accordingly as <hi>Photius</hi> hath faithfully declared
the sense of the Council) but one Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
passing through the Image to the Prototype:
As those that should VVorship the Moon through
a glass window with the picture of the Moon in

and true sense and air of that second Council
of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore my Antagonist must give me
leave to give credit to <hi>Azorius,</hi> (who, by the by,
does also declare, that it is the sense also of the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> and of <hi>Trent</hi>) when he tells us
this is the constant Opinion of their Theologers,
especially the more ancient Schoolmen, as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Hales, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure,</hi> &amp;c.
as keeping to the right sense of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> and
this seventh general Council called on purpose
to decide this matter of Images. And if you have
changed of late from this Rule, it is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
how grosly you were lapsed into Idolatry
before. Nor are you yet a jot mended, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is Analogically the same VVorship, it still
remaining Religious VVorship terminated in the
Images t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>emselves; which is a gross blot, and
makes the matter worse than before. But to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34037:154"/>
make the Worship equivocally the same, is such
an equivocating quibble to put on these two Saints
of <hi>Rome,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> that
all the honour done to their Images will not
recompense this injury done to their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                     <p>And thus I have used my Christian liberty,
which my Adversary so courteously allowes me,
in impugning <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> and whosoever else do
corrupt the genuine sense of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and
<hi>Bonaventure,</hi> with such pittifull glosses. And
whereas he says the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
any such Worship of <hi>Latria</hi> due to the Image
of Christ; I Answer, it mentions the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> and refers to the sentence of that Council,
which assuredly was the same that <hi>Azorius</hi> says
is the constant Tenet of Theologers. And thus
consequentially at least does the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
declare for <hi>Latria</hi> to the Image of Christ. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
as I have noted; <hi>Azorius</hi> is of Opinion
that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> of it self is of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>Truly I think there were very few among the
Pagans that were so silly and unwise, as to take the
very wood and stone they prayed to for a God, but
for the Image of that God they prayed to, towards
which they doing their devotions hoped to be
heard. There might be some so sottish amongst
them, as I have heard a story long since of an old
woman amongst you, who having done her devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Image of the Virgin, and being asked by
one that stood by, what Lady she prayed to, to her in
the Church, or to her in Heaven; what talk you
to me, says she, of our Lady in Heaven? I pray to
this Lady before my eyes. I will not deny but

neither you nor they profess to pray to the very

consecrated to. And now say, whether this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnv

Image, in either the Pagan, or Pagano-Christian

their absolute dependence of the Merits of Christ.

                        </hi>
because this is a form of consecration of the Images
of Christ, the Virgin or any other Saint; to wit,
Prayer to God (not to the Virgin or any other
Saint, not made before any of their Images al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
consecrated, as he would make his simple
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34037:158"/>
folk believe whom he indeavours to keep in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
but is, I say, a Prayer to God, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall invoke Christ, the Virgin, or such a
Saint, whose Image is a consecrating, may be heard,
and obtain by the Merits and Intercession of the
party they pray to, grace here, and glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
This is the plain sense of the Consecration.
And it is plain it is through their own Merits,
though they may be supposed inabled so to merit
be vertue of Christ. And if an Invocation of the
Virgin, or any other Saint, before their Images,
by their Merits and Intercession (which is the
usual form of Invocation as you may see above)
procure Grace here and Glory hereafter, are not
they fellow-distributers of Grace and Glory with
Christ? And does not the very form of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
imply that they are Distributers, that is to
say, that the Saints by their Merits and Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do procure Grace here and Glory hereafter for

                     <head>The Reply.</head>
                     <p>To the first, I Reply, That it is very plain that
burning of Incense was a Sacrifice to God in the
Mosaical Law, which Incense was burnt before
His symbolical Presence in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi>
And I add also that the lighting the Lamps before
him in the same place was another part of this
Mosaical service to him, which is some-how imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the Pagans in lighting Candles before the
Images of their <hi>Daemons.</hi> In both which respects it
is plain, that to do thus to the Images of the Saints
is Idolatrous. And by thus doing the Saints are
intended to be honoured according to the very
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council, that presently upon the mention
thereof, says, <hi>The honour done to the Image passes to
the Prototype:</hi> wherefore that these actions are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
is plain already, and is more clearly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the third Conclusion of the first Chapter<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:34037:159"/>To the Second, I Reply, That the very Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of the <hi>Ritual</hi> I have so often named (in the
form of consecrating and laying the first stone of
the Church) says thus, <hi>Nominando Sanctum vel
Sanctam in cujus honorem ac nomen fundatur Ecclesia.</hi>
Is not this plainly a consecration to the honour and
name of the Saint? And again in the Form of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
the Church and the Altar, <hi>Te rogamus ut
hanc Ecclesiam &amp; Altare ad honorem tuum &amp; women
Sancti tui</hi> N. <hi>pargare &amp; benedicere digneris,</hi> where
questionless [<hi>ad nomen Sancti</hi>] includes <hi>honorem</hi>
in it, which was expresly signified before in the
consecrating the Foundation-stone, and is also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the signification of <hi>nomen.</hi> We do not
pretend that you equalize the Saints, in these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with God himself, but that you make them
partake of true Religious Worship, though in a
less share or in a more secundary way, with God in
these dedications of Temples and Altars to them

                     <p>To the first I Reply, That it is a witty fetch to
require of me an Instance of connivence at a fault
which, as soon as it is known, is no interest of

effect they are intended for, which is to bring
more plenteous Oblations to the Church. But
for as much as these tricks of the Images cannot

which he being deficient in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, I will help him with
one Instance here in our own Nation in the time
of Popery.</p>
                     <p>In the Abbey Church at <hi>Boxley</hi> there were two
famous Images, one of St. <hi>Rumwald,</hi> a stone sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the bigness of a little boy, the other was
called the <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>d of Grace.</hi> There was no admission
here but upon a treble Oblation, one to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
the other to St. <hi>Rumwald</hi> the <hi>touch-stone of
clean life,</hi> and the last to the <hi>Rood of Grace.</hi> Now
to those that offered frankly to St. <hi>Rumwald</hi> it was
most easie to lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> him; but on the contrary (by
reason of a pin which the keepers could put in and
take out at their pleasure) to those that offered
faintly, it was immovable. So that it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
spectacle to the by-standers, to see a great
lubber not able to lift that which a boy or a girle
had taken up before. But he was made heavy to
those whose Offerings were <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>light</hi> to
those whose Offerings were more weighty. But
they having passed this tryal of clean life, they then
were admitted to the <hi>Rood of Grace.</hi> In which
Image stood a man inclosed, and with many wyres
made the Image goggle with the eyes, and nod
the head, move and shake the jaws, according to
the value of the gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>t that was offered. If it was a
small piece of silver he would hang the lip. If it
were a piece of gold then would his jaws go right
merrily. Thus were the people abused and begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a certain time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:34037:161"/>I but you will say, certainly some of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
so soon as it was discovered, severely
punished the Imposture. Nay I will tell you more,
One of the Prelates discovered it, namely Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the Image with all its engins
was openly shewed at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, and torn in
pieces by the people. Did not I tell you so? will
my Adversary reply; But in the mean time let me
tell him again, that it is well known how incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
then Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was to Protestant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
if not a Protestant in his judgement. But we
speak of the Connivence of the Popish Clergy in
this point, and desire one Instance of any such
discovery of Imposture by them, that could any
longer have been concealed. And if not, where
is the Calumny of Connivence?</p>
                     <p>And for the Prayer to the <hi>Veronica,</hi> be it no
part of any Ecclesiastick Office, yet it is in your
approved Devotion-books, such as <hi>Hortulus Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae;</hi>
and this <hi>Veronica</hi> is showd solemnly once a
year to the people to spend their devotion on;
and lastly Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22d. is said to have
granted a thousand years indulgence to them that
repeat the whole Prayer, of which I have set
down but a third part.</p>
                     <p>And in the last place, For that he says, The
praying before the Ark to God Almighty (which
Ark and the things in it and about it are wood)
may as well be said to be talking with stocks and
stones as the praying before the Image of a
Saint and the Cross in such formes as are used
to them, is a most sensless and absurd speech, to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34037:161"/>
say no worse. For the disparity is manifest. For
did the Jews ever say, <hi>O Ark hear me,</hi> or, <hi>O</hi>
Cherubims <hi>hear me.</hi> But here is plainly speaking
to the Cross, which is but a piece of wood, (in
this form) <hi>Hail O Cross our onely Hope, increase
righteousness to the righteous, and pardon our sins.</hi>
Besides, neither Ark nor Cherubim was in their
sight to speak to, But the Image of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or
the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> is before their eyes, and they
bear the names of these Saints, (as the Image of
Christ does his; of which one <hi>Johannes</hi> in the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Council declares, if any one call it or inscribe upon
it, <hi>This is Christ,</hi> he does nothing amiss therein)
and are as it were these very Saints represented to
us in Figure and Person; and therefore when we
speak to these wooden Personages, saying, <hi>O blessed
Virgin, O holy St.</hi> Peter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not this infinitely
more like talking to stocks and stones, then when
the Jews having their faces toward the Ark,
which yet was vailed from them, mentioned
God alone? nor was there any wood-work, nor
stone-work there, that was called God or Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.
But what will not they say, that are in a
bad Cause, to make a show to desend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
                     <p>But for <hi>O Crux ave spes Vnica,</hi> he would excuse
the gross absurdity of it, (For none can excuse the
Idolatry, when they yield <hi>Latria</hi> to the true Cross
and contend what kind of Religious Worship is
due to the Type of it) by saying that by <hi>Crux</hi>
here is not meant the Cross but Christ crucified on
the Cross. So that it is but a figurative speech,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34037:162"/>
The Cross for Christ upon the Cross, <hi>Metonymis
subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness,</hi> that
is, says he, <hi>Christ crucified on the Cross.</hi> But it is
immediately in the former verse,

                        </gap>, <hi>left the Cross of Christ be made of

                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, which is plainly an <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> and

                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> is to be understood <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, And so the
whole is, <hi>For the preaching of the Cross of Christ,
&amp;c.</hi> As it is taken, <hi>Gal. 6. 24. God forbid that I should
glory in any thing saving in the Cross of our Lord
Iesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified to me,
and I unto the world.</hi> This is that which is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to them that perish, but the Power of God
to them that are saved. So that there is no
ground for a <hi>Metony<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>nia Subjecti,</hi> when an <hi>Ellipsis</hi>
is so naturally understood, which will not at all
serve his purpose. And the Metonymy indeed
very poorly.</p>
                     <p>For it does not follow, because by a figurative
speech the Subject may be put for the Adjunct;
or the Symbol for the Person it is compared to
in speech, that therefore we may (and yet seem
to be in our wits) make Prayers or speeches to
these Subjects or Symbols. The Cherubims are
the seat of the Divine Presence; should the Jews
therefore have said by a Metonymy, O golden
Cherubims come and help us? And because men
talk of the infallible chair at <hi>Rome,</hi> meaning the
Popes, would any but a mad man propound questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the chair, and not to the Pope himself,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34037:162"/>
to be resolved? And our Saviour Christ says,
<hi>Apoc. 22. I am the bright morning Star,</hi> which is
a figurative speech; Can therefore any one with
eyes and hands lift up to the morning Star, say
unto it, O bright morning Star illuminate my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
increase righteousness to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and pardon our sins, but he will be lookt
upon as an Idolater and Star-worshipper? and to
say he means Christ the morning Star will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him from mere madness and delirancy, if it
could from Idolatry. And how much better, I
pray, is it to speak to a piece of wood? nay, to the
figure of another piece of wood? For Christ was
not crucified on the wood they speak to. But by
speaking to this piece of wood, they would be
understood to speak to another piece of wood on
which Christ was crucified at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> nor yet
to that piece of wood neither, but to Christ
hanging on the wood, and that now at such a
time as he is off of the wood, and is in Heaven
to be spoke to himself as a gracious Intercessor,
that we may not call on this stock or that stone,
but make our immediate addresses to him in
word and heart, that he would be graciously
pleased to intercede with his Father for us.</p>
                     <p>To all which you may add, That comparing
this passage of the Prayer with that which goes
before, <hi>Arbor decora &amp; fulgida, Electa digno stipite
Tam sancta membra tangere; Beata cujus brachiis
secli pependit pretium,</hi> and how within a line or
two after follows, <hi>O Crux ave spes Vnica,</hi> &amp;c. it
is demonstratively plain, that it is the Cross it
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34037:163"/>
it self, not Christ meant in this passage; unless
you will make Christ his own Cross to hang
upon, and make him distinct from his own Body
and members. Whence the Absurdity and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
of this devotion is most clearly manifest,
and that it is no Calumny to charge them with
it. The rest of this Section is <gap reason="foreign">

               <head type="sub">Severall important Consectaries from this clear Diseovery of
the gross Idolatry of the Church of Rome; with an hearty
and vehement Exhortation to all men, that have any
serious regard to their Salvation, to beware how they be
drawn into the Communion of that Church.</head>
               <p>1. THus have we abundantly demonstrated that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> stands guilty of gross Idolatry
according to the conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ssions and Definitions of their
own Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> that is to say, though we charge
them with no more then with what the Council it self
doth own, touching the Adoration of the Host, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints, and the Worshipping of Images.
But we must not forget, in the mean time, that the Crime
grows still more course and palpable looking upon the
particular forms of their Invocation of the Saints, and
the Circumstances of their worshipping their Images,
and yet ratify'd by the Popes, and corroborated by the
uncontrolled practice of their whole Church: Which
therefore must in all reason be the Interpreter of the minde
of the Council. So that there is no evasion left for them,
but that they are guilty of as gross and palpable Idolatry
as ever was committed by the sons of men, no less gross
then <hi>Roman</hi> Paganism it self.</p>
               <p>2. From whence, in the next place, it necessarily
follows, that they are the most barbarous Murtherers of
the Servants of God that ever appeared on the face of the
Earth. For indeed if they had had Truth on their side
so far, as that the things they required at the hands of the
Dissenters had been lawfull, (though not at all necessary;)
yet considering the express voice of Scripture, which must
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34037:164"/>
be so exceeding effectual to raise consciencious Scruples,
and indeed to fix a man in the contrary Opinions, besides
the irrefragable Votes of common Sense and Reason, and
the Principles of all Arts and Sciences that can pretend
any usefulness to Religion in any of its Theoreticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions;
I say, when it is so easie from hence, if not
necessary, for some men to be born into a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious
Persuasion, it had undoubtedly even in this
case been notorious Murther in the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Party, to
have killed men for dissenting from the Doctrine and
Practice of their Church.</p>
               <p>But now the Murtherers themselves being in so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an Error, and requiring of the Dissenters to profess
Blasphemies and commit gross Idolatries with them, which
is openly to rebell against <hi>God</hi> under pretense of obeying
<hi>Holy Church,</hi> as they love to be called, they murthering
so many hundred thousands of them for this Fidelity to
their Maker, and their indispensable Obedience to the
Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> this is Murther of a double dye, and
not to be parallel'd by all the barbarous Persecutions under
the red Dragon, the Pagan Emperours themselves.</p>
               <p>3. From which two main Considerations it follows
in the third place, that, considering the fit and easie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of the names of the Seven Churches and of the
Events of the seven Intervalls (denoted by them) to
the Prefigurations in the Visions, there can be no doubt
but that by <hi>Balaam</hi> mentioned in the Epistle to the
Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> wherein <hi>Antipas,</hi> that is, the
Opposers of the Pope, are murthered, the Papal Hierarchy
is understood; as it is also by the Prophetess <hi>Iezebel</hi> in
the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who was also a
Murtheress of the Prophets of God, and both of them
expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ly Patrons of Idolatry, as is manifest in the very
Text.</p>
               <p>Nor is it at all wonderfull that <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi>
the one a man, the other a woman, should signifie the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34037:164"/>
same thing. For the false Prophet and the Whore of
<hi>Babylon</hi> in the following Visions of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> signifie
both one and the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hierarchy of
<hi>Rome,</hi> from the Pope to the rest of their Ecclesiastick
Body.</p>
               <p>4. And what I have said of the Vision of those Seven
Churches, the same I say of all those Expositions of the
thirteenth and seventeenth Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
and that of the little Horn in <hi>Daniel;</hi> namely, The words
of the Prophecies being so naturally applicable to the
Affairs of that Church, besides the demonstration of
Synchronism, that the weight of those two foregoing
Conclusions being added thereto, there cannot be the
least doubt or scruple left, but that those Interpretations
are true; and that the Church of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> is that Body of
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> that <hi>Mother of Fornications and Abominations
of the Earth,</hi> that is, of multifarious Modes of gross Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tries,
or that scarlet Whore on the seven Hills, that is
also <hi>drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud
of the Martyrs of Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. And that therefore, in the fourth place, in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Poison exceeding the Antidote<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> there
can be no reason that Salvation should be hoped for there.
It is a sad and lamentable Truth, but being a Truth, and
of such huge moment, it is by no means to be concealed.
What God may do in his more hidden ways of Providence,
he alone knows. And therefore we cannot say that
every Idolatrous Heathen must perish eternally: But to
speak no farther then we have commission, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the easy tenour of the Holy Scriptures, we must
pronounce, though with great sadness of heart, that we
have no warrant therefrom to think or declare any of
the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, so long as they continue so, to be in
the state of Salvation; and especially, since that voice of
the Angel which sounded in the Intervall of <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
saying expresly, <hi>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34037:165"/>
partakers of her sins, and receive not of her plagues; and</hi>
the Apostle in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 6. 9.
<hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor
Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And
those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are bound to continue Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
as long as they live, or else to renounce their
Church; and therefore they are bound to be damned by
adhering to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, unless they could live
in it for ever. For he that dies in such a capital si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as
Idolatry without Repentnce, nay, in a blind, obstinate
perseverance in it, how can he escape eternal Damnation?</p>
               <p>6. But though we had kept our selves to the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi>
the thing is clear in that Book alone, ch. 22. ver. 14, 15.
where all Idolaters are expresly excluded from the Tree
of Life: <hi>Blessed are they that do his Commandments,</hi> (and
one of them, though expunged by <hi>Rome,</hi> is, <hi>Thou shalt
not worship any graven Image,) that they may have right
to the tree of life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For without are dogs, and Sorcerers
and Whoremongers, and Mortherers, and Idolaters, and
whoso loveth and maketh a Lie.</hi> All these are excluded
the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and from eating the Tree of
Life. Of which who eateth not is most assuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in eternall death. As it is written in the foregoing
Chapter, Apoc. 21. 8. that <hi>Murtherers, and Whoremongers,
and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liers, shall have their
part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone;
which is the second Death.</hi> What sentence can be more
express then this?</p>
               <p>7. But besides this Divine sentence against them, they
are also <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, they are self condemned, or at least
give sentence against themselves, while they so freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that no Idolaters are to be saved; which they
frequently do, to save their own Church from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of Idolatry. For, because some Protestants have
declared for the Possibility of Salvation in the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church, they farther improve the favour to the quitting
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34037:165"/>
themselves of the <hi>guilt,</hi> from others hopefull presages
that by an hearty implicit Repentance of all their sins
(even of those that are the proper Crimes of that
Church,) they may, through God's mercy in <hi>Christ,</hi> be
delivered from the <hi>punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This piece of Charity in some of our Party they turn
to the fencing off all imputation of Idolatry from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
arguing thus; That no Idolaters can be saved:
But those in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church may be saved, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to those Protestants opinion: Therefore those in the
<hi>Romish</hi> Church are no Idolaters.</p>
               <p>But most assuredly while they thus abuse the Charity
of <hi>some,</hi> even by their own Proposition they must
bring the sentence of condemnation <hi>from all the rest</hi> upon
their own heads, as they have herein <hi>given it against
themselves,</hi> in saying that all Idolaters are damned, or
that no idolater can be saved. For it is demonstrated as
clear as the Noon-light, in this present Discourse, that
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are Idolaters.</p>
               <p>8. And in that of those of our Church that say they
may be saved upon a sincere and hearty implicit Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of all their sins, (wherein they include the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
and all other Miscarriages which they know not
themselves guilty of, by reason of the blinde Mis-instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Church,) no more is given them by this
then thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are saved by disowning of
and dismembring themselves from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
as much as it is in their power so to do, and by bitterly
repenting them that they were ever of that Church as
such, and by being so minded, that if they did know what
a corrupt Church it is, they would forthwith separate
from it. So that in effect those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
that some of ours conceit may be saved, are no otherwise
saved, if at all, then by an implicit renouncing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it, which <hi>in Foro Divino</hi> must go for an
actual and formal Separation from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:34037:166"/>In which Position if there were any Truth, it will reach
the honest-minded Pagans as well; but it can shelter
neither, unless in such Circumstances, that they had
not the opportunity to learn the Truth, which since the
Reformation, and especially this last Age, by the mercy
of God, is abundantly revealed to the world. So that
all men, especially those that live in Protestant Nations
or Kingdoms, are without all excuse; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
obnoxious to God's eternall wrath and Damnation,
if they relinquish not that false Prophetess <hi>Iezebel,</hi>
as she is called in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi>
who by her corrupt Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ines deceives the people, and
inveigles them into gross Idolatrous Practices.</p>
               <p>9. Thus little is conceded by those of our Reformed
Churches that speak most favourably of those in the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet this little must be retracted,
unless we can make it out, that any of that Church are
capable of sincere and unfeigned Repentance while they
are of it. For to repent as a Thief, because he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be hanged, is not that saving Repentance. But
to repent as a true Christian none can do, unless he has
the Spirit of God, and be in the state of Regeneration.</p>
               <p>For true Repentance arises out of the detestation of
the ugliness of Sin it self, and out of the love to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude
and amiableness of the Divine Life and of true
Virtue, which none can be touched with but those
that are Regenerate or born of God. Now those holy
and Divine Sentiments of the new Birth are so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Frauds and Impostures, to the gross Idolatries
and bloudy Murthers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
they from time to time have perpetrated upon the dear
Servants of <hi>Christ,</hi> that it is impossible for any one
that has this holy sense, but that he should inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
fly from that Church with as much horrour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment
as any Countrey-man would from some evil
Spectre, or at the approach of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:34037:166"/>10. <hi>He that is born of God sinneth not,</hi> saith S. <hi>John:</hi>
1 John 5. 18. How then can they be so born whose very
Religion is a Trade of sin, and that of the highest nature,
they ever and anon exercising gross acts of Idolatry? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they are consenting (by giving up their belief
and suffrage to the murtherous Conclusions of that Church)
to all the barbarous and bloudy Persecutions of the Saints
that either have happened or may happen in their
own times, or ever shall happen, by that Church;
they become, I say, guilty thereof by adjoyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to this bloud-thirsty Body of men, with whom
the Murther of those that will not commit Idolatry with
them, and so rebell against God, is become an holy
Papal Law and Statute.</p>
               <p>And therefore, I say, how can any man conceive that
those men are born of God who are thus deeply defiled
with Murtherous and Idolatrous Impurities, but rather
that they are in a mere blind carnal condition, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable,
while they are thus, of any true and sincere
Repentance, and consequently of repenting of their daily
Idolatries which they commit, and ordinarily (to make
all sure) <hi>in ipso articul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> mortis,</hi> and therefore are out
of all capacity of Salvation while they are members of that
Church? As plainly appears both by this present Reason
fetch'd from the nature of Regeneration, as also from the
judgement of the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves touching the state
of Idolaters after this life, and chiefly from the express
sentence of the Spirit of God in Scripture, as I intimated
before.</p>
               <p>11. And therefore, in the fifth and last place, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
manifest how stupid and regardless those Souls
are of their own Salvation, that continue in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and how desperately
wild and extravagant they are who, never having been
of it, but having had the advantage of better Principles,
yet can find in their hearts to be reconciled to it. This
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34037:167"/>
must be a sign of some great defect in Judgement, or else
in their Sincerity, that they ever can be allured to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that is so far removed from God and Heaven.</p>
               <p>12. But this Church, as the woman in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> is,
I must confess, both very fair of speech and subtil of heart,
and knows how to tamper with the simple ones right
skilfully. She knows how to overcome all their carnal
senses by her luxurious Enticements. She has <hi>deck'd

               <p>14. But as to the first, it is plain that that <hi>Vnity</hi> that is

by Force is no fruit of the Spirit, and therefore no Sign
of the true Church: nor that which is from free Agreement,

society as to <hi>have</hi> but <hi>one purse,</hi> Prov. 1. 14. And therefore

               <p>And for their boasts of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which are produced
to ratifie their crafty Figments, they are but Fictions
themselves framed by their Priests, or Delusions of the

of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that Man of sin, (which the Pope and his

and boast themselves in the known Character of <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:34037:168"/>
and would prove themselves to be <hi>Holy Church</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Privileges of that <hi>Man of sin,</hi> and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to the palpable signs of the Assistence of the Devil.
For from thence are all Miracles that are produced in
favour of Practices that are plainly repugnant to the

               <p>16. But now, as for their <hi>Sanctity,</hi> what an <hi>holy Church</hi>
they are, any one may judge upon the reading of the
Lives of their Popes and History of their Cardinals, and
other Religious Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rankly all things smell of Fraud and Imposture, of Pride

monstrous examples of Sensuality their <hi>Holinesses</hi> themselves
have ordinarily been, of Fornication and Adultery, of

interwoven into the very Essence of their Religion. Judge

it is to kill men for not committing Idolatry, with the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must needs bear the title of <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>17. And for their pretense of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it is expresly
predicted in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as well as their
laying claim to Miracles. For as the two-horned Beast
is said Apoc. 13. 13 to <hi>do great Wonders,</hi> and to <hi>bring fire
from Heaven,</hi> which two-horned Beast is the Pope and
his Clergy; so <hi>Iezebel,</hi> which is the same Hierarchy, is
called the Woman that gives to her self the title of <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetess,</hi>
Apoc. 2 20. whose Oracles you know must be
<hi>infallible.</hi> For she does not mean that she is a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetess,
though indeed and in truth she is so. And the
Pope with his Clergy is judged to be so by the Spirit of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34037:168"/>
God, in that he is called the <hi>false Prophet,</hi> Apoc. 16. 13. as
well as the two-horned Beast, in those Visions of S.
<hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And while he pretends himself to be a Prophet, even
without Divine Revelation, one may plainly demonstrate
that he is a false one from this one notorious Instance
of Transubstantiation; which is a Doctrine repugnant
to common Sense and Reason, and all the Faculties of the
Mind of man, and bears a contradiction to the most pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n
and indubitable Principles of all Arts and Sciences, as I
have proved above. So that we may be more sure that
this is false, then that we feel our own bodies, or can
tell our toes and fingers on our hands and feet. Judge
then therefore whether is more likely, that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> should be infallible, or Transubstantiation a
mere Figment, especially it being so serviceable for their
worldly Advantages, and they being taken tardy in so
many Impostures and Deceits. So that Infallibility is a
mere Boast.</p>
               <p>18. And now for their <hi>Sacerdotal Absolution,</hi> that they
can so safely dismiss men to Heaven or secure them from
Hell thereby, this power of their Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>st is such another
vain Boast as that of Transubstantiation. <hi>Except a man
be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
John 3. 3. And the form of words upon one's Death-bed
can no more regenerate any one, then their Quinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbiall
Charm can transubstantiate the Bread and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> ine
into the Body and Bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi> Where the form of
Absolution has any effect, it must be on such persons
as are already really regenerate and unfeignedly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
penitent: which I have shewn to be incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
to any one so long and so far forth as he adheres
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. So that in this case one
<hi>Aethiopian</hi> does but wash another, which is labour
spent in vain.</p>
               <p>There must be a change of Nature, or no externall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34037:169"/>
Ceremony nor words can do any thing. For the form of
Absolution is not a Charm, as I said, to change the
nature of things, but onely a Ticket to pass Guards and
Scouts, and to procure safe conduct to the Heavenly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
But if by Regeneration and due Repentance one
has not contracted an alliance and affinity with the Saints
and Angels, but is really still involved in the impure
and Hellish nature, the grim Officers of that dark Kingdome
will most certainly challenge their own, and they will be
sure to carry that Soul captive into a sutable place, let the
flattering Priest have dismissed her hence with the fairest
and most hopefull circumstances he could. This is
the most hideous, the most dangerous and the most
perfidious Cheat of that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that ever she
could light on for the damning of poor credulous Souls,
that thus superstitiously depend on the vain breath of their
Priest for the security of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>19. And yet they are not content with this Device
alone to Iull men secure in wickedness, but besides their
pretense of singing them out of Purgatory by mercenary
Masses, and pecuniary Redemptions, by Pardons and
Indulgences, and I know not what Trumperies, they
allure men to come into their Church as having that great
Store and <hi>Treasury of the Merits</hi> of Holy-men and
women, their works of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have the keeping and disposing of. So that a
poor Soul that is bankrupt of herself, and has no stock
of Good works of her own, may sufficiently be furnished
for love or money by the Merchants of this Storehonse.
Which, besides that it is a blasphemous Derogation to
the Merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> is the grossest Falshood that ever
was uttered.</p>
               <p>For these Holy men, as they are called, and Virgins,
were, God wot, themselves most miserable Sinners, and
died in most horrid Idolatries, as dying in the Practices
of that Church; and he that comes to that Church
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34037:169"/>
does necessarily become a gross Idolater himself; besides
that he sets to his seal and makes himself accessory to all
that innocent bloud, the bloud of those many hundred
thousands of Martyrs for the Protestant Truth, which
that Woman of bloud that sits on the Seven Hills has with
the most execrable Circumstances imaginable so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
murthered. So that a Soul otherwise passable of her
self would be necessarily drown'd in this one foul Deluge
of Guilt: so far is she from having any relief or advantage
by reconciling her self to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>20. Wherefore who-ever thou art that hast any sense
or solicitude for thy future state and Salvation, believe
not this Woman of subtil lips and a deceitfull heart, and
give no credit to her Fictions and high Pretensions; but
the more she goes about to magnifie her self, do thou

the glass of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>If she boast that she is that holy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Psal. 122. 3.

World are so full of Sects and Factions; tell her that she
is that carnal <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> wherein <hi>Christ</hi> in his true
Members hath been so barbarously persecuted and
murthered, and that the Stones of her buildings are no
living stones, but held together by a mere iron violence,
and the Cement of her walls tempered with the large
effusion of innocent bloud; forasmuch as she is that two-horned
Beast that gave life to the Image of the Beast,
Apoc. 13. and caused him to decree that as many as would
not obey his Idolatrous Edicts should be slain. This is
the power of your Unity, which is not from the Spirit of
God, but from the spirit of the Devil, who was a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer

Protestants is both a sign of our sincere search after the
Truth, and a more strong Testimony against you of <hi>Rome,</hi>

unanimously give sentence against you: your Miscarriages

but must needs discern them.</p>

it, and tell her she derives her pedigree from that great
Dragon, the <hi>old</hi> Serpent, Apoc. 12. 9. that is called the
Devil and Satan, that Murtherer of mankind. <hi>Ye are of
your father the Devil,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and the works of
your father will ye do. Iohn</hi> 8. 44. We grant that the Visage
and Lineage of your Church reaches even beyond the times
of the Apostles, the two-horned Beast reviving the Image
of the Pagan Beast, the great red Dragon, by bringing up
again his old bloudy Persecutions and Idolatries. It suffices
us, that our Church began with the Apostles;</p>
               <p>If she glories in her <hi>Vniversality,</hi> and in her large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories;

is called Sodom and Aegypt, where our Lord was crucified:</hi>
Apoc. 11. And that she is <hi>Babylon the GREAT, the mother
of Fornications and the Abominations of the Earth.</hi>

Good works of their pretended Holy men and

is written, <hi>that no man buyeth her merchandise any more;</hi>
and again, <hi>Alas, alas! that great City that was cloathed in

wonderfull <hi>Miracles</hi> done by her; tell her that she is that

and that deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by means of
those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the</hi>

Apoc. 2. 14. that insnared the <hi>Israelites</hi> in Idolatry; and that

alive into the lake of burning brimstone, Apoc. 19. 20.</p>
               <p>23. And lastly, if she would gull thee with that specious

Spirit of Truth in the Divine Oracles, let her commend
her self as much as she pleases, gives no such Character of
her, but quite contrary, declaring the See of <hi>Rome</hi> to

               <p>And that they are not mis-apply'd, any impartial man

Reproaches of men, or from any consideration what they

of Railing, let us put them together, The
<hi>stout unmanly</hi> Rhetorick of Railing. I demand, If it
be either <hi>ferine</hi> or <hi>womanish</hi> with a plain open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
to declare those Truths that are of such
vast Concern and of so perspicuous a clearness to
those that do not wilfully wink against them? Or
if the propriety of language, and to declare accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature and true Notion of things, and
that without all ill will, be any form of Rayling;
Unless <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of Innocency railed when
he gave names according to the natures of the
Creatures? And this great Clamour against me of
Railing, is because I call Idolatry <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
the killing of men because they will not commit
Idolatry with the Church of <hi>Rome, barbarous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
But if he mean because I call the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> by those Titles the Spirit of God calls her in
the Apocalypse, my Apology is already made in
the twenty fourth Paragraph of this 10th. Chapter.
Which I desire my Antagonist, and every one it
may concern, in the fear of God to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to consider the latter part of it touching those eight
last Chapters of the first book of my <hi>Synopsis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica,</hi>
and my <hi>Exposition of the seven Epistles to the
seven Churches of</hi> Asia. In both which <hi>Expositions,</hi>
I challenge any diligent searcher to show any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
flaw that will lessen the certitude of them
for the main, or if they think there is the least
faultering in this proposal, let them show any flaw
at all if they can. For as for my self, though I have
been an anxious searcher after Truth, I was never
yet satisfied concerning any, more palpably than of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34037:175"/>
these I speak of. Which, God knows, I do not
speak in the way of Boasting, but merely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the ingenuous to try the strength and evidence
I find them, that they may thereby, after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
whether they will or no, feel it also them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and find it. Nor do I use those Names of
Infamy wherewith the Spirit of God has branded
the Pontifician Clergy, nakedly and without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
as my Antagonist has framed his frigid,
flaccid and insipid <hi>Dissuasive</hi> which he would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon me; but upon the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> false
boasts of her self, whereby to tempt ours to her
Idolatries, I put in their mouths what the Spirit of
God says touching her in the Apocalypse, and
other places of Scripture: Whereby is understood
plainly how the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> is with them,
and how when they make a specious show and
boast of <hi>being one thing,</hi> the Spirit of God judges
them the <hi>quite Contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But further he adds; <hi>That this Exhortation of
mine is an ill-grounded and Schismatical Discourse,

It is not our telling you plainly and apertly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

your <hi>great</hi> crimes by <hi>extenuating termes,</hi> and <hi>your</hi>
aggravating every <hi>little</hi> Ceremony of ours, such as

amongst many others to make those that are the

the most suspected by them. But Truth

                  <hi>But in the mean time where is the charge made good
of being so</hi> little concerned whether I speak true or
false <hi>in this Exhortation of mine? Why, at last it is
this, That I so peremptorily aver, that no Protestants
allow them a possibility of Salvation, but onely in case
of such a Repentance as implies an absolute renunctati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Religion and its Idolatrous doctrines and
practises by diso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ning of and dismembring themselves
from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church. Which, says he, will scarce
appear pardonable in the eyes of his fellow Doctors.
Repl.</hi> This is a charge founded upon the eighth
Paragraph of this tenth Chapter, I desire the
Reader to peruse the Paragraph and compare it
with his charge: where, after [disowning and
dismembring themselves from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church]
he omits a special <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>lause which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>viz.</hi> [As much as it is in their power so to
do.] Which is quite another t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ing from actually
renouncing of their Church, while they have not
the opportunity of discovering her gross Errors;
but that their general Repentance is so hearty and
unfeigned, that it would descend to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
upon the detection to them of the foul errors
of that Church. And this I hope will not onely be
pardonable but acceptable to those eminent men
of our Church, Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi>
and the rest he names out of Bishop <hi>Laud, Relation</hi>
Sect. 35. who examined to the bottom will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
of the same mind with my self. And for that
of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Discourse of Iustification,</hi> Sect.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34037:177"/>
17. where he sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s, <hi>For my part I dare not deny possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their Salvation, who have been the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Instruments of ours.</hi> Which Quotation, which
my Adversary so much glories in<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> it is evident, is
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>thing at all to the purpose. For as much as he
speaks not here of those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
since the Reformation but be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ore, when the state
of the Church was the <hi>VVoman in the VVilderness,</hi>
as is manifest both from the sentence it self quoted
and the Context. But if Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Authority be
of any weight with you, do but look into the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Section, and he will tell you the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath plaid the Harlot worse then ever did
<hi>Israel.</hi> And now I demand, for a Christian who is
part of the Body of Christ to adjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n himself to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what is it but to make a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ the member of an Harlot? as the
Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. And is that, I pray, the
next way to the Capacity of Salvation? But this
by the by.</p>
               <p>After this he brings in Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
glorying much of the charitable principles
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Objecting want of
charity to them, for maintaining that Protestancy
unrepented destroyes Salvation: Now if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
should retaliate and say, that Popery unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
destroyes Salvation, I would willingly be
instructed, saith he, by Dr. <hi>More, wherein lyes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and moderation they boast of.</hi> Why, I'll tell you;
In this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> hat whereas Protestancy, that is, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion <hi>quatenus</hi> reformed from the errors of
<hi>Rome</hi> wants no repentance, and the Errors and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:34037:177"/>
mispractises of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are so hainous
and enormous, that most Protestants, comparing
the Crimes of that Church with the menaces of
Scripture, do conclude the Adherers thereto in the
state of Damnation without any more to do, so
soon as they adhere unto it, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> are so charitable, that though men dye
in that Church, yet by a general sincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
such as implies that if their Errors and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practises
were discovered to them to be such they
would forthwith leave the Communion of that
Church, declare they may be saved, which is the
same I profess too. But we declare in the mean
time, that it is perfect madness in any one to go
over to such a Church in which there is no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but upon supposition that if we knew the gross
Errors and mispractises of it, we would presently
renounce Communion with it, which if we did not
we should certainly be damned.</p>
               <p>But behold a third fetch also; <hi>Nothing is more
current, saith he, amongst them, when they are pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the Crime of Schism, then to return the
Charge upon us from other grounds, saying, that as
the</hi> Donati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in cutting off from the Body of Christ and hope

that we should make</hi> our selves Donatists <hi>and</hi>

must be current but with a very few. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

prove it. And therefore <hi>you</hi> are Apostates from <hi>us</hi>
and Schismaticks that you do not cast off your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous

you make your selves more holy, and call us
Hereticks when your selves are really the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Schismaticks. In this are you like the
<hi>Donatists</hi> and <hi>Luciferians,</hi> and unjustly take upon
you to cut us short of Salvation. But does it thence
follow, we justly declaring you debar'd of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by reason of your open Idolatries and Murders
of the innocent people of God, that we become

               <p>But the last and strongest prop of so bad a Cause, is

Mr. <hi>Ioseph Mede</hi> of our Colledge, who
was so modest a Soul, that though he had worth
to furnish out I know not how many Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
never commenced Doctor, let us for the
time, to make the Comparison more plausible, call
him Doctor as well as my Adversary does Doctor
<hi>Thorndike,</hi> and then say, Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> denies the
worshipping the Host to be Idolatry, Dr <hi>Mede</hi>
affirms it to be Idolatry; Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> holds the
honouring of Images in Churches to be no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Dr. <hi>Mede</hi> affirms it to be Idolatry, &amp;c. Where
is Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> now? Nay suppose I should put
that eminently Learned Prelate of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> and of singular clearness of Reason and
Judgement, Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> once of Christs Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

of <hi>Armagh,</hi> Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi>
and several other Bishops and Doctors of our
Church, who at least joyntly, if not in several,

of our Church, as subscribers to the Homilies of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34037:180"/>
our Church, affirm in all these points against Dr.
<hi>Thorndike.</hi> Nay I dare with all confidence assert
that no man can make any good sense of the 13th.
and 17th. Chapters of the Apocalypse, but he will
plainly discern that the very Spirit of God himself
has declared against him. What poor and simple
Souls then must they be that can be scared out of
the Truth or kept in Error by such Topicks as
these? Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> is not of the same mind with
Dr. <hi>More,</hi> therefore Dr. <hi>More</hi> uses <hi>blustering argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not much concerned whether true or false.</hi> For
my part I desire no man take my Arguments or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
upon trust, but do appeal to Scripture and
his own Reason whether what I say be not true,
and would have him examine them accordingly.
And therefore Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> must not be offended
though I yield not to his name, though I have a

his Arguments, in each <hi>Antithesis</hi> to my Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                  </gap> to be
Idolatry, Cap. 19. the short and long of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this, <hi>That no Papist worships the Elements of
the Eucharist nor the Accidents of it for God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Papist in this VVorship is an Idolater. He V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
not the Elements of the Eucharist because he does
not believe them to be there, Nor the Accidents, as
they call them, because he believes them to be no part of
the Body of Christ into which the consecrated Bread is
Transubstantiated.</hi> But to this I briefl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> Answer,
That the Bread Transubstantiated into the Body of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:34037:181"/>
Christ and Hypostatically united with the Deity
there where the Accidents shew us (so that they
become that very Person God-man) is the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Object of their Worship and Adoration, being
visible to them merely in vertue of those Accidents
or species that are like Bread. Now therefore it is
plain if there be no such thing as Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that their Adoration passes upon a mere untran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated
piece of Bread instead of the Body or
corporeal presence of Christ, supposed to be veiled
with those Accidents of Bread; which therefore is
plain Idolatry. For in that they are mistaken in
their Object and intended no Worship to a piece
of Bread but to Christ, does not excuse the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
by the 4th. and 5th. Conclusions of the
second Chapter. See also Conclusion 21. and 22.
as also the last Conclusion of the same Chapter. I
have represented Dr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> Argument with
the utmost strength I could possibly, and yet it is
no other than you see.</p>
               <p>To the second Antithesis, Dr. <hi>More,</hi> says he,
<hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ds that the placing and reverencing of Images in
Churches is Idolatry. Repl.</hi> I do not hold that the
mere placing of Images in Churches is Idolatry
(though I must confess I had rather have their
room than their Company) but onely the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of them. And now let us hear what Dr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi> (Chap. 19.) alledges to the contrary;
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>n doing honour, saith he, to the Images of Saints there
can be no Idolatry, so long as men take them for Saints,
that is, Gods Creatures, much less to the Images of our
Lord. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>or it is the Honour of our Lord and not of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:34037:181"/>
the Image.</hi> And a little after to the like sense,
<hi>For indeed and in truth it is not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>mage but the
Principal (the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council calls it</hi> Prototype)
<hi>that is honoured by the honour that is said to be
done to the Image because it is done before the
Image.</hi> This is the sum of his Argument to prove
that Image-worship is no Idolatry. Now in order
to the better understanding my Answer, you are
First to take notice that both my Adversary and
Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> understand such Images as have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
done to them in the Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi>
Images dedicated or consecrated, as you have an
example of the form above, and therefore such as
are the symbolical Presences of their <hi>Principals</hi> or
<hi>Prototypes.</hi> Secondly, That this honour here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in general by Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> is the Honour
done and allowed by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unto
Images, <hi>viz. Invocation before them, Incurvation,
setting up Wax-candles and burning Incense before
them. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> that the doing of this honour to these
Images is not Idolatry, Dr.</hi> Thorndike <hi>would prove
upon the Principel of Pope</hi> Adrian <hi>and the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of</hi> Nice; <hi>Because the Honour does <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, passes
from or through the Image to the Principal, in so much
that the Principal alone seems to be worshipped not the
Image; And this Principal being either the Saints or
Christ, so long as we remember the Saints to be Gods
Creatures it can be no Idolatry, much less in the Image
of Christ, since the Principal or Prototype there is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> To the first of which I Answer, That the
Primitive Christians knew the Emperor to be Gods
Creature, and even <hi>eo nomine</hi> because they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34037:182"/>
him to be Gods Creature would not cast a
few grains of Incense into the fire in honour of
him though it cost them their lives for not doing of
it. And the departed Souls of the great Heroes or
Benefactors among the Heathen, whom they after
death made <hi>Damons</hi> and worshipped them, were
known well enough to be Gods Creatures, that is
to say, the off-spring of the highest <hi>Numen,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
â€”as the Heathen Poet could sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t no Christians doubt but they were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in worshipping them. And therefore by the
third and fourth Conclusions of the first Chapter
the worshipping of the Images of the Saints though
terminating on the Saints themselves is Idolatry.
Besides Incurvation to an Image, such as is here
practised, is Idolatry by the seventh and eighth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of the same Chapter. See also the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Conclusion of the second Chapter.</p>
               <p>And then for the Image of Christ, though Christ
be God, yet to Worship God by an Image is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;
By the nineteenth Conclusion of the second
Chapter, and by the second Commandment, and
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>earfull vengeance on the Israelites for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping

               <p>And for the pretense that the Worship is done

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>mage not the Image; since the
Image is a symbolical Presence dedicated to Christ
or this or that Saint, and that these are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>Honor debitus, viz.</hi> Incurvation toward
it, burning Incense and the like, used by the

                  </gap>urch of <hi>Rome</hi> and specified by the Council of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34037:182"/>
                  <hi>Nice</hi> to which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does refer, it is
manifest that these honours are done <hi>to</hi> these
Images as well as <hi>to</hi> their Protoypes; as appears
further from the tenth Conclusion of the first
Chapter, and the twentieth of the second; which
Conclusions are improvable also to the case of
burning of Incense, and lighting up wax-candles,
and bringing of Oblations to these symbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences,
which please the simple people when they
visibly behold their Masters to whom they pay
their Religious Tribute or Offerings, whether
Money or money-worth. What Idolatry can be
more Pagan-like than this? So little satisfactory is
it what Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> produces for the freeing of
the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Image-worship from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>To the third Antithesis, Dr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> says he,
<hi>excuses Invocation of Saints from Idolatry. Repl.</hi>
Truly upon my perusal of that Chapter in Dr.
<hi>Thorndike,</hi> I think my Adversary has little reason to
brag of the Excuse there made for it. For First, Dr.
<hi>Thorndike</hi> does sreely confess the Saints know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our particular necessities unless God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
them to them. Secondly, he accuses Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints of Novelty, as not being owned
and used by the Church till a good while after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine.</hi>
Thirdly, he says the abuse has increased
so far that the same things are desired of them, (of
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> especially) and in the same terms
in which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ey are desired of God even in the holy
Scriptures. Fourthly, That the appearance of
Devotion to the mother is visibly an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> outwardly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34037:183"/>
no less than to the Son (which is equal to that to
God himself) whence any mean Logician may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that the appearance of Devotion to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is no less than that to God himself. Does not
this hugely excuse the Romish Invocation of Saints
from Idolatry? But you'l say, Certainly I am mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the place. No, no, Iam not. Now comes
the Excuse; <q>So that were there not a profession of
that Church extant, contradicting the proper sense
of such Prayers to the Saints, and forceing them
that address them, unless they will contradict
themselves, to abate their own meaning, and to
expound them to signify no more than the Saints
obtaining that of God which they are desired to
grant of themselves, they could not be excused of
Idolatry.</q> Of which the brief sense is, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the profession of the Church contradicted
their Practise, which is Idolatrous, <hi>viz.</hi> their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of one God the giver of every good and
perfect gift, (for I know no other publick Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
then that he can mean) they cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Idolatry. As if professing things repugnant
to Idolatry, and in the mean time committing it
against their Profession, could save them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Idolaters, more than from being Murtherets
and Adulterers, because they profess the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.
Or as if there being a Society of men that
did in Special manner profess Civility, and yet
would call any one all the ill names imaginable,
might put it off by saying, these names and railings
are indeed utterl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> repugnant to our publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
if they be taken in their proper sense; and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34037:183"/>
therefore you must interpret them in such a sense
as is not repugnant to our known Profession; For
we declare to all the world that we are civil Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and very much every mans humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
Would this seem a solid excuse and not rather
matter of laughter to all that heard it? Such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
might excuse the Heathen who held one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God fountain of all things, in all the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Rites of worshipping their <hi>Daemons.</hi> For they
might say, no other sense is to be given of those
Idolatrous Rites then will consist with the belief of
one supreme Deity the Fountain of all Good. Nay,
they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church might Sacrifice whole
Hecatombs of Oxen to their Saints, and excuse it,
because it is not to be taken in the proper sense of
such Sacrifices, but in such a sense as is consistent
with the knowledge and profession of the onely
one true God. So that that which is an excuse for
any Idolatry, is indeed an Excuse for none.</p>
               <p>And besides this, Dr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> excuse, though
it were solid as to this particular point of Idolatry,
yet it is too scant to reach others. For the mere
Invocation of this or that particular Saint for an
<hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> it implying such an excellency as is in
God alone, (according to Dr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment)
will be Idolatry, by the eighth
Conclusion of the second Chapter of my Antidote.
And then considering their Canonization, the
erection of dedicated Images or symbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
to them, the belief that some are proper to
intercede for one thing others for another, and
that offerings are brought to them upon the good
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34037:184"/>
either expected or obtained by their negotiations
for us, what is this Invocation thus circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ed
different from the Invocation of the <hi>Dii Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioxumi</hi>
of the Heathen which all will say is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
And therefore this must be Idolatry, by the
third and fourth Conclusions of the first Chapter.
See also the eighteenth of the second. So that in an
ill hour has my Adversary brought Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>
to be a compurgator of his Church from the stain
of Idolatry in the business of Invocation of Saints.
But it may be he will make amends in the last <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi>

Rome <hi>as Idolaters are thereby Shismaticks before
God. Repl.</hi> I confess he does say so. And I never
read it but am surprized with amazement at it,
that any one that professes himself a Protestant,
should adventure to pronounce such a speech. For
my own part I can profess truly and unfeignedly
(and I think there is not any one but will believe
me that knows me or has read my writings, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
my Mystery of Godliness and my Dialogue,
where drawing the best and the most benign
representation I can of Providence and the affairs
of the world in all Ages as to Religion, I strain
my little Wit to the utmost to make the Idolatry
of the Pagans look as tolerably and excusably as I
can) I say I profess unfeignedly that I am not
conscious to my self of any superstitious hurry or
fright and over scrupulous fear of committing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
where none is to be committed, that carries
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34037:184"/>
me into this judgment touching the Idolatries of
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> nor can any thing possibly
tempt me to it, it being so contrary to my nature
to find any more faults in the world then needs
must; and I think any one will easily discern it is
not any way for my Interest to declare this fault I
find, if it were not true. But it is pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Reason, and something better and higher
in my esteem than Reason, that does assure me of
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ruth of what I do in this Case thus pronounce
against my own natural Inclination and Interest.
Whence I am well assured, that in all integrity of
Conscience other men having the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes may be also fully persuaded to these
Idolatries I charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with, and
consequently be necessarily ingaged to quit her
Communion, and separate from her. Now what
Protestant, nay what Christian would ever think, or
whisper within himself, much less aver to all the
world, thar such a separation is Schism before
God, or <hi>in Foro Divino?</hi> especially considering that
the Opinions and Practises for which the party
separates are not Catholick but After-Inventions
and Customs of the Church degenerating, as Dr
<hi>Thorndike</hi> himself cannot deny. This instance I
give, at least <hi>in Foro Divino,</hi> certainly would be
no Schism, though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of no Idolatry. And therefore I am sorry so
venerable a Person should be so rash and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant
in his censure against his fellow-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time will my Adversary say, <hi>It
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34037:185"/>
is apparent not withstanding that Dr.</hi> Thorndike <hi>has
quitted the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>of the charge of Idolatry
in this last</hi> Antithesis. <hi>Repl.</hi> I grant he supposes
you no Idolarers, but how does he prove you none?
I have demonstrated over and over again in my
Antidote that you are Idolaters, and you have not
been able to inervate one proof. Now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the demonstrations of Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> upon
which he builds his assertion so prodigiously Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical
to all Protestants, a thing never uttered
by any member of the reformed Churches before.
I have poized his weights, and fathomed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of his Reasonings to the utmost length and
extent of them, but find all too light and scant
to make good so strange a Conclusion. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
he says to prove you no Idolaters is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, saith he,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true
Church, but a true Church presupposeth the profession
of so much of Christianity as is necessary to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of all Christians, and therefore men may be
saved in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But no Idolaters can
be saved. Therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are no
Idolaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being a true Church
must needs profess the true God, and therefore if they
believe that which they profess they cannot honour any
Creature as they honour God, knowing every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be an infinite distance below him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be Idolaters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly and lastly,</hi> A true Church, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
professes the onely true God, does necessarily profess
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34037:185"/>
to detest all Idolatry; Which detestation of Idolatry
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does expresly profess, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
therefore unless they expresly renounce they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expresly be Idolaters.</p>
               <p>This is the utmost (and represented to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most)
of Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> Reasons whereby he
would prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;
All which he makes to depend upon that
grand Assertion, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which before we can say, I or No, we must
understand what is meant by a true Church. For,
<hi>true,</hi> sometimes signifies as much as pure and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
without mixture of any other with this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or formal Essence which is really here. As
that is said to be <hi>true</hi> Wine that has no other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour
mingled with it, and that <hi>true</hi> Gold that
is not adulterated with any base alloy. And in this
sense I flatly deny the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a
true Church. But there is another sense of true
which excludes not impurity or some hurtfull su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddition
to the nature and form of the thing, the
true formal nature of the thing still existing there:
As some subtil poyson conveyed into Wine, the
Wine is true Wine still; And an house infected
with the Plague, or whose walls are over-run with
the Leprosie is a true house still; Or, if it be not
too homely a comparison, a pair of Sheep-clippers
shears fallen into the pitch-pan, and so all over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared
with pitch, is a true pair of shears still; all
these having the true and essential form whereby
they are constituted such. And they have an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34037:186"/>
in themselves for those ends they were
made, though their actual usefulness is for the
present taken away or turned into the contrary
by what incumbers them or is added to them;
but the definition of Wine, an House, and pair of
shears dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> still belong to them and is truly predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
of them.</p>
               <p>Now therefore though I will neither aver nor
deny the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church, you
making so ill use of all our fair and ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
yet I will suppose with Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church; and that
to be a true Church, is to profess all those Articles
of the Christian Faith, to have that form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
suppose Episcopal, which was in the
Primitive Church, to administer the Sacraments
in that form of words the Primitive Church did,
and in a word to profess so much of Christianity
and preach it, as of it self, if there were no other
Impediments added, would be sufficient to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And so supposing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
all those things which the true and unaposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Church professed, (which were then and are
still of themselves effectual for Salvation if men be
not wanting to themselves) in this regard I confess
she may be said to be a true Church. For so much
as such a definition of a true Church would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible
to her. But all this supposed and admitted, I
utterly deny that there is any validity at all in Dr.
<hi>Thorndikes</hi> Arguments to prove she is not an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Church. For a true wife according to defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Law, yet may be a soul adulteress and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:34037:186"/>
infected with the disease of her Uncleanness,
and a true House may be infected with the Plague,
or stand in Pestilential air, or be infested with the
Devil or evil Spirits.</p>
               <p>And now therefore to Answer to his first
Argument, I say it does not follow because
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church men
may be saved in it, because a thing may truly
be, what it is said to be, by reason of its
intrinsick form and nature, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
be in such Circumstances, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be extricated out of them, it is made quite
useless for the end it was ordained, and for which
it has still an aptitude were it extricated and
cleared from the present Incumbrances, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures;
as in the example of the pair of Shears,
of the House, and of the Wine with poyson in
it, and the like; Which for the present, though it
be a true House, a true pair of Shears, true
Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they are not good. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the form but fall short of the end, nay
are quite opposite to it. And so they in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though a true Church, fall
short of their Salvation, nay fall into eternal
damnation by reason of the deadly poyson in
their Church which they wilfully keep infused
in it.</p>
               <p>To his second Argument I Answer, That t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ey
that profess the true God may notwithstanding
commit Idolatry, as I have demonstrated at large in
my Idea of Antichristianism, Chap. 6. and Chap 8.
of the first Book. And no man doubts but the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:34037:187"/>
Israelites committed Idolatry even then when they
professed the Worship of the true God. And the
<hi>Indians</hi> at this day who Worship their Pa-gods
and are universally accounted Idolaters, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
informed have a clear notion of the true God
the Creatour of all things. Besides, this Argument
of Dr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> supposes that which is notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, as if there could be no Idolatry unless the
Creature were so honoured as if it were done to
God himself: Which is abundantly confuted out
of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth Conclusions of
the first Chapter of my Antidote. And lastly, they
do <hi>de facto</hi> give that honour to the Creature that
is due to God alone. And there is no arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
experience.</p>
               <p>His last Argument I conceive is the infirmest of
all, and the Conclusion the faintest o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> all, and is a
kind of tacit insinuation that they are indeed Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
but not express ones, as if their Hypocrisie
could avail any thing with God, or free them
from that condemnation that attends all that are
Idolaters. Is the business then come onely to this,
that the Romanists are not professed Idolaters? I
wonder who ever professed themselves Idolaters
that were serious in their Idolatry! For serious
Idolatry always implies Ignorance and mistake in
the Idolater, though the Crime of Idolatry be so
exceeding hainous, by Conclusion 4th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>But it being probable that Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> had a
greater kindness for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then thus,
and that by this last Argument also he would
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:34037:187"/>
prove them to be really no Idolaters, let us suppose
it, and see how well his Argument will conclude it.
They expresly profess their detestation of Idolatry,
nor make any express renunciation of that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
therefore they are no Idolaters. To which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> Answer, An unjust man or Extortioner, one
that blinded with Covetousness does unjust acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
does expresly profess his detestation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
nor renounces that profession; does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
therefore that he is not an unjust man? Or
to make an Hypothesis something more operose,
though sufficiently pertinent to the Occasion, we
will suppose a considerable number of Jews in some
Kingdom having misbehaved themselves, out of
fear of punishment to posses themselves of some
strong Castle of the Prince of the Countrey, and
there continuing a considerable time to exercise
their Religion, and for better show to write at the
upper end of the Hall where they meet, <hi>Moses</hi>
Decalogue in golden Capital letters, making great
profession of the righteousness of the Laws of that
Decalogue, but in the mean time for the indulging
to themselves the pleasures of the flesh as well as
for the supplying their necessities and securing
themselves, should make particular Laws and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
amongst themselves for the plundring and
spoyling the Country people as they went to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and killing such as resisted, and should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it Lawfull to Ravish the Women they met
with, interpreting the Law against Adultery touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jewish Women onely that are of their own
Religion, and Theft, and Murder, of Plundring
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:34037:188"/>
or killing those of the common wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi>
not Aliens and Strangers, which their Law makes
no provision for as they will pretend, that take
upon them to be the Interpreters thereof. Now
if any one should accuse them of Adultery, The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t
and Murder committed against their Princes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and they should plead or any for them, that
they cannot possibly be Robbers, Murderers or
Adulterers, because they expresly profess their
open detestation thereof, nor have any where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
that Profession, the Decalogue of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
also witnessing for them, writ in great Capital
letters in their very Hall where they dayly meet,
in which it is expresly said, <hi>Thou shalt not commit
Adultery, Thou shalt do no Murder, Thou shalt not
Steal,</hi> they notwithstanding making those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Decrees amongst themselves and acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
would not the Apology seem vain or
impious? How then can the express Profession of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> against Idolatry excuse her
from Idolatry when they make particular Decrees
of worshipping the Host with <hi>Latria,</hi> of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the Saints and bowing to their Images, and
practise it in such Circumstances as I have again
and again declared. Nay when these Decrees are
made by general Councils as they pretend, how
can they be but express Idolaters and renounce
their prosession against Idolatry as much they can
do? For no serious Idolater takes himself to be
so. Wherefore we see how hugely unconcluding
every Argument of Dr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> is whereby he
would prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Idolaters
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:34037:188"/>
But I have over and over agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> demonstrated
them to be Idolaters in this my Antidote, nor
has my Adversary produced any thing that in the
least manner enervates any of my Arguments;
nor can he prop himself by the Authority of Dr.
<hi>Thorndike,</hi> it being so without all ground and
Reason.</p>
               <p>From all which, that Imputation I hope by this
time is washed off, That my Arguments are <hi>mere
blustering words, and I unconcerned how true or false
they are:</hi> whenas if my Adversary be a man of
sense, as truly I presume him to be, he cannot
but feel by this that my words are not a storm
and thunderclap without a bolt, but that they
carry along with them what is solid and strong.
And verily for Dr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> himself being so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
and Learned a Person and of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sincerity, after a Cause is so throughly
canvassed on all sides as it has been betwixt you
and me and him and my self about the Idolatry of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he were now alive, (as it
has pleased God to take him out of this life and
translate him, as I hope, to a better, since the
finishing of this my Reply and before the transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of it) I believe he would not stick to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
her guilty of Idolatry and that he and I
should be fully agreed in these Points.</p>
               <p>Which I am the more easily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
from what he wrote in a letter about a year
before he died; which Clause does plainly seem
to null this fourth and greatest <hi>Antithesis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and me, <hi>viz.</hi> That the separating from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34037:189"/>
the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> upon the account of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is Schism before God. His words, as I had
them faithfully conveyed to me by a worthy friend,
are these; <hi>To pray to the Saints for those things
which onely God can give, as all Papists do, is in the
proper sense of the words down right Idolatry.</hi> I but
here my Adversary will be forward to Reply,
But so long as the words may be figuratively
understood we are excused of Idolatry. But let
him hear how Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> himself obviates this
subterfuge: <hi>If they say their meaning is by a figure
onely to desire them to procure their requests of God,
how dare any Christian trust his Soul with that Church
which teacheth that which must needs be Idolatry in all
that understand not that figure:</hi> Which is spoken
with incomparable judgement and modesty and
tender Civility to that Church, but, I promise you,
in effect charges them as home, as to this point, as
if he had said in a word, <hi>They are all down right
Idolaters.</hi> From whence it will necessarily follow,
That he changed his opinion before he dyed, and
held that to separate from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
upon the account of Idolatry is not Schism before
God.</p>
               <p>Now that he says they are all down right Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is manifest: Because he says all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not that figure, which may excuse them of
Idolatry, are so. Now I am well assured, and he
could not chuse but be so too, that the most
Learned of them understand not that figure, there
being no such figure in all Rhetorick yet, unless
they have made of late a new Figure calling it,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34037:189"/>
                  <hi>Quidlibet pro quolibet,</hi> that is, <hi>the putting any thing for
any thing,</hi> which will be a colour for all the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense
in the world that ever was, is, or can be writ or
spoken. But men can no more make what <hi>figures</hi> they
please in <hi>Rhetorick</hi> then they can make what <hi>Moods</hi>
they please in the three figures in <hi>Logick.</hi> But all
must be measured by the end of each Art, <hi>Bene
disserere</hi> in the one, and <hi>Bene dicere</hi> in the other;
what is not consentaneous to the former can be
no Precept in <hi>Logick,</hi> and what not to the latter
none in <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> And if there be the pretence
of the use of any figure acknowledged in <hi>Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
which is not consentaneous to that end, the
figure thus pretended to be used cannot be used,
but the words will at the peril of the speaker
remain in their proper sense. As if some wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
extravagant fellow should venture to begin his
Prayer thus, <hi>O infinitely weak, unwise, and unholy
Lord God,</hi> and pretend it is an <hi>Irony,</hi> and that he
speaks by contraries, would this excuse him from
horrid blasphemy? Surely no. For the use of the
Figure in this place is not consentaneous to the
general End of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> which is <hi>Ars bene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi,</hi>
which no loathsom, disharmonious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
speech can agree with. Wherefore if a figure
cannot be admitted here where there is one to
which it is so obvious to refer the speech, how
can the pretence of a figure excuse that speech
which it will puzzle any man to find a figure to
refer it to. As for Example, if one should pray
thus to St. <hi>Francis, O holy St.</hi> Francis <hi>give me the
spirit of Grace in this life, and eternal Glory in the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34037:190"/>
life to come.</hi> Upon which one crying out, <hi>Down
right Idolatry,</hi> if he that addressed this absurd
and Idolatrous Prayer, should say he meant <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,</hi>
intending no more then thus, <hi>O holy St.</hi>
Francis <hi>pray to God to give me the spirit of Grace,
&amp;c.</hi> this speech also being so loathsom, harsh
and scandalous can be no <hi>figurative</hi> speech but is
necessarily shut up in the proper sense of the
words, and as the other was <hi>horrid blasphemy,</hi>
so this is <hi>down right Idolatry,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi>
speaks.</p>
               <p>This is clear demonstration to any one that
considers the case impartially; whence it is plain
that this sourth <hi>Antithesis</hi> betwixt Dr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi>
and my self is quite broke a pieces, and that
we are agreed in this, That to separate from the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the account of Idolatry is
not Schism before God. For as much as <hi>to pray
to the Saints for those things which God alone can
give, as all Papists do, is in the proper sense of the
words do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>n right Idolatry.</hi> And I have plainly
demonstrated there is no changing the sense of
the words by a figure, for as much as there is no
figure to refer the speech to, or if there were,
there is no legitimate use of any such figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it would be no ornament or perfection of
speech but a loathsom blemish thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no more a figure than a piece of dung hung
at the Ear in a string is an Ear-Jewel.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as I said, Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> coming
so readily off, of himself, in this fourth and last
<hi>Antithesis,</hi> which indeed is founded in a breach
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34037:190"/>
also upon the third <hi>Antithesis,</hi> he so plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
such an Invocation of Saints to be down
right Idolatry which yet all Papists use; for all
they cannot but remember the Saints to be Gods
Creatures, and therefore commit Idolatry with
them though they remember them to be Gods
Creatures; Which enervates also the second <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
he indeavouring to prove that the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Images of the Saints would be no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
so long as we remember them to be Gods
Creatures; I cannot but hope if he had lived and
perused this carefull and distinct Disceptation, he
would have come off in all. For how could he
stick in the first <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ithesis,</hi> at the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Idolatry in the worshipping the Host?
Whenas, though they think the Bread is not
there, yet they conceiving the individual matter of
the Bread transubstantiated into the Body of
Christ, and so Hypostatically united with the
Divinity, and upon that account pursue it with
their devotion and Divine Adoration, hit upon
the said Individual matter untransubstantiated and
remaining Bread still, and so do plainly give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Adoration to Bread, as much as the <hi>Persians</hi>
to the Sun who take it for the Supreme Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

               <p>But take him agreed no further then he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
was before he dyed, which is so far as to
declare all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> down right Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
he does thereby freely acknowledge the

the declarations of Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> are, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
in my Antidote and what occurs in
my Reply do evidently and irrefragably evince it
in all Points they are charged with. And <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon</hi>
you see what an agreeable Conclusion comes
from us both. It is Gods express Command to
come out of her.</p>
               <p>And if this be not Agreement enough, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considering
Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> has now laid down that

we in Charity hope, among the blessed, I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not but he clearly discerns his mistakes in
all four <hi>Antitheses</hi> betwixt us. So that it is very
credible that the two Doctors are agreed fully in
these Points, though I pronounce it with some
peril of bringing my Antagonist upon me again,
who craves respite for his pen onely so long as
till the two Doctors be fully agreed, but then
Dr. <hi>More, says he, shall hear more from me if he
desire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we being thus fully agreed, yet I confess I
shall desire to hear no more from you, unless you
will imitate your fellow-Combatant, and wear
no Mask, but do as I do, speak verily as you think
and bring no Arguments but such as you in your
own Conscience think true and concluding; and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34037:191"/>
then I dare say the Game will soon be at an end.
But there may be made a show of Confutation
<hi>in infinitum</hi> to amuse or quiet those of your own

if you think to make any Rejoinder, if I find you

have suggested already, I will, God willing, take
the pains to Answer; but if not, I shall neither

leave the world to judge. And so, Fellow-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant,
I bid you heartily farewell. And that

Charity, and that I may appear to you clear of
that Imputation of Uncharitableness which you
labour so in this last Section to cast upon me,
peruse the fifth Paragraph of this tenth Chapter,
as also the Parable in the Preface to my Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote;
which you seem to have been loath to
take notice of, that you might with better show
accuse me so much of uncharitableness as you
here have done. But it being so lively a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the real and sincere Charity of those
Ministers of the Gospel, that plainly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
tell those of your Church the great peril of
continuing in it, I will close all with that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>There was a certain Knight bravely mounted,
as it might seem, and in goodly equipage, in
bright Armour, a rich Scarf about his Shoulders,
and a large plume of Feathers in his Helmet,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34037:192"/>
who was bound for the Castle of Health, seated
on an high Hill not unlike to the <hi>Domicilium Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis</hi>
in <hi>Cebes</hi> his Table, which therefore he easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept in his eye. But the way he was in,
being something stony and rough, and leading
not so directly as he thought, to the desired
Castle, he diverted out of the way, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into a green Plain; but not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was all passable to the Castle, called to
some Loyterers there in the field to inquire of
them; who came right willingly to the Knight,
scraping many legs to him, and desiring him to
tell his demands.</p>
               <p>There was an old Shepherd likewise not
far off, who, by that time this idle people
had got to the Knight, had come down to
him also. Friends, said he, to those men he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Is the way passable and safe through this
green Plain to vouder Castle? pointing to the
<hi>Castle of Health</hi> with his warder; very safe, may
it please your Worship, said they, and shrugging
their Shoulders, and scraping many Legs, asked
a Largess of the Knight, pretending they had
been at common work not far off, whereupon
the Knight put his hand into his pocket and
gave them liberally. But are there no Bogs,
said he, nor Lakes betwixt this and the Castle?
Some small inconsiderable Sloughes it may be,
said they, but you will meet with the <hi>Holy socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Wipers</hi> every where, who will be ready to
wipe you as clean as a Clock before you come
at the Castle. And being so excellently well
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34037:192"/>
mounted as we see you are, namely upon that
famous steed the infallible-footed <hi>Aplanedo,</hi>
so good an Horse as that he never stumbles,
your Worship need fear no disaster at all: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the Beast, God bless him, has a Nose like
any Hound, and by a miraculous Sagacity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Reason or Humane Literature, with
an unerring certainty he can smell out the right
way, and so secure you from all danger. To
say nothing how excellent he is at the swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
any Water, and how he can tread the
very Air he is so high m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tald and light Footed.
<hi>Onely be sure to keep fast in the Saddle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, Sr. Knight, said the Shepherd, if
the wind blow fair, the plumes in your Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
may help to support you both; but if not,
some Angel from Heaven may take you by the
Crest of your Helmet, as he did the Prophet
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>bbakuk</hi> by the hair of his head, when he
carried him through the air from <hi>Iudaea</hi> to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight looking back (for he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the Shepherd at this time) What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
old man is this, said he, that talks thus
phancifully? May it please your Worship, he is
a Shepherd, said they, and has a flock on yonder
little Hill hard by; but he is one of the most self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceated
old Fools that ever your Worship met
with in all your days: He thinks that all skill and
knowledge lyes within the compass of his bald
pate and wrinkled fore-head, though few or none
are of the same Opinions with himself. Sr.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:34037:193"/>
Knight, said the Shepherd, I pretend to no skill
nor knowledge but what is certainly within my
own Ken; but what I know I love to speak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And I tell you, Sr. Knight, unless you be
stark staring mad you will never follow these
mens Counsels, nor venture over this Moor to
that Castle: for you will be swallowed up Horse
and Man into a fathomless Lake of ill-sented
mire, for all the nice Nostrils of <hi>Aplanedo.</hi> You
was in a more hopefull way before, though
something rough; but it is so streight before you
come at the Castle, that you could never have
got through unless you had left <hi>Aplanedo</hi> behind
you. He's an old Cholerick Dotard, said those
other fellows; be but sure to keep the Saddle
and we dare warrant your Worship (our lives
for yours) that <hi>Aplanedo</hi> will carry you safe through
all dangers.</p>
               <p>Wherefore upon the renewal of the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>it
the Knight had before of his Steed, and
those confident Animations of his Mercenary
Counsellers, he set on in a direct line toward
the Castle over this Moor, the Shepherd looking
after him to see the event. But the Knight had
not rid two or three Bow-shots from the place,
but the Shepherd saw them suddenly sink Horse
and Man into the ground, so that they were
both buried alive in the mire.</p>
               <p>Whereupon fetching a deep sigh after so Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
a Spectacle, he returned with a sad heart
and slow pace towards his Sheep on the top of
the Hill, drailing his Sheephook behind him, as
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:34037:193"/>
they do their Spears, at the Funeral of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier:
whom his Dog followed with a like soft
pace, hanging down his head, and letting his tail
flag, as if he had a mind to conform to both the
sorrows and postures of his Master. But those
other false Companions had somewhat before
this got to a lone Ale-house not far off, to spend
the Knights Largess merrily with a bonny young
Hostess, and in plenty of good Ale and Cakes to
celebrate his Funeral.</p>
               <p>Now I dare appeal to the Judgment of any
indifferent Reader which of these Parties, the
old free-spoken Shepherd, or those Mercenary
Flatterers, had the greater share of Charity: and
would have him consider with himself in what a
sad condition those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are,
who having the opportunity of being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
as the Knight had, are yet led away
Captive by such cunning Deceivers, which is
the main state of the Controversie. <hi>Iohn 15. 22.
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had
not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their
sin,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour in the Gospel.</p>
