            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>VVITH hearts full of unſpeakable Joy We preſume to approach your Royal preſence, and with all our Souls bleſs Almighty God for the wonderful diſcovery of the <hi>late helliſh Conſpiracy</hi> begun and carried on by <hi>deſperate perſons</hi> of <hi>Fanatical, Atheiſtical and Republican Principles,</hi> who impudently aſſuming to themſelves the name of <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Patriots,</hi> did at firſt by Popular Inſinuations and other Artifices, project the undermining the beſt Religion and Government in the World; and afterwards being therein prevented <hi>by your Majeſties unwearied Care and admirable Conduct,</hi> proceeded to contrive <hi>the horrid Parricide of your Sacred Perſon,</hi> the barbarous Aſſaſſination of your Royal Brother, the dear partaker of your Sufferings, the involving theſe Nations in Blood and Confuſion, and the utter deſtruction of this Monarchy.</p>
            <p>As this Society has been eminent for its Loyalty and early tokens of Duty and Affection, particularly in their humble thanks for your Gracious Declaration, and their Abhorrence of the late <hi>Accurſed and Traiterous Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> which we look upon to be a part of this <hi>Damnable Conſpiracy,</hi> ſo we ſhall do our utmoſt to bring the <hi>Villains</hi> to Juſtice, eſpecially thoſe of this Society, who to our great Sorrow are in the number of the Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>And We do repeat our ſolemn Proteſtations to ſtand by and defend <hi>Your Sacred Majeſty and lawful Succeſſors</hi> with our Lives and Fortunes, and beſeech Almighty God to cover with confuſion the faces of Your moſt ſecret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that <hi>Divine Vengeance</hi> may overtake ſuch of the <hi>Traitors</hi> as by flight eſcape the Juſtice of <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> whoſe Guilt proclaims it ſelf ſo loud, that they dare not truſt even that <hi>Mercy</hi> of which they have had ſo long experience. And as Providence did never ſo ſignalize it ſelf on behalf of any Prince as of your Majeſty through the whole courſe of Your Reign, ſo may Heaven ſhowr down and continue its Beſt Bleſſings <hi>on the Beſt of Kings,</hi> and be never weary of working new Miracles for Your preſervation.</p>
