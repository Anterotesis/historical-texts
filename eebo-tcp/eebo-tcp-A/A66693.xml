            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Servants that lay in the ſame Room with him, being diſturbed thus with his Fegaries, complained to their Maſter, who thereupon chid his Son, telling him, That <hi>People which laboured hard, muſt not be diſturb'd of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reſt, for by that means they could not perform their work.</hi> And therefore he threatned him, If he plaid any more ſuch Pranks, he would not only put him to Plow, but alſo take all his Books from him; for he imagined it was his Books that wrought that Indiſpoſition in him. Yet notwithſtanding all his Threatnings, <hi>Billy</hi>'s mind did ſo run of his Knightly Atchievements, that he ſtill continued in his old courſe, for one night dreaming he was encountring with a terrible Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, he got up in his ſleep, and taking the Bed-ſtaff in his hand, began to lay about him according to his old manner. Now it ſo chanced, that thorough often redoubling his blows, he at laſt ſtruck the Plow-man ſuch a blow on the Pate, that the Blood trickled down his Ears.

The Plow-man being betwixt ſleeping and waking, feeling the ſmart of the blow, ſtarted out of his Bed, and taking a Plow whip in his hand, which ſtood up there ready in a corner, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame on <hi>Billy</hi>'s body, laying it on ſo ſoundly, that had <hi>Billy</hi> been in ſuch a ſleep as St. <hi>David</hi> the Champion of <hi>Wales</hi> was, in the inchanted Garden of <hi>Ormondine,</hi> yet muſt the ſmart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of needs have waked him; but <hi>Billy</hi> took all patiently, imagining it to be the blows of the Dragon's Tail; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read that Knights Errant are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch Adventures. And now the Plow-man being weary of belabouring him, went to Bed; <hi>Billy</hi> alſo return'd to his Cabbin, but the ſmart of his blows were ſuch, as would not ſuffer him to ſleep one wink all that night; enough to have ſpoil'd a young Knight-Errant, had not his mind been ſo fully fixed on Knightly Adventures.</p>
               <p>Next Morning <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo ſoar that he could not go to School, and being ask'd how he came to be ſo, he told them, <hi>It was with encountring of a mighty Dragon, whilſt he attempted to reſcue a King's Daughter that was bound to a Stake:</hi> And ſo run on i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now weighing with himſelf what immortal Fame thoſe Knights had gained, he reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Knight Errant himſelf, being now (as he thought) of ſtrength and Age ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient enough to cope with any Gyant, yea, though he were as big as Sir <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</hi> is deſcribed in <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi> or <hi>Colbrand</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> whom <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> ſlew.</p>
               <p>But conſidering with himſelf, that a Knight without a Lady is like Ling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Muſtard, or a Bag-pudding without Suet, he therefore began to think on what Female he ſhould place his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at laſt he reſolved on a luſty ſtrapping Wench, a neighbouring Farmer's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one who for her heighth might have been Second to <hi>Long Meg</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and as ſmall in the Waſte as a Mill-poſt in the middle, ſuch a one as the conceited Fellow could by no means be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to marry, alledging, That of Evils the leaſt is ſtill to be choſen; but Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that Loves without ſhewing reaſon why, preſented her to <hi>Billy</hi> as the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix of the Age, and therefore he reſolved that ſhe, and none but ſhe, ſhould be the Loadſtone of his Affections. But her Name being <hi>Joan Grumball,</hi> he thought
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44453:9"/>
was too mean for her, now that ſhe was to act her part on the Theatre of Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; he therefore took the ſame liberty as Cardinals do when they are elected Pope, to change their Name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in his thoughts, that hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhe ſhould be called <hi>The Fair Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi>; and now his thoughts are wholly fixed on Love, wherefore in imitation of thoſe Amouriſts he had read of in his Romances, he frequents Solitary places, wrings his hands, and exclaims bitterly on <hi>Cupid</hi> for bringing him into that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Thraldom. <hi>O impetuous Love</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>with what heavy burdens doſt thou load thy poor Vaſſals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O pierce the Heart of that cruel fair One, that ſhe may at laſt conſider of the Miſeries that I endure for her ſake; but thou art Deaf as well as Blind, and will not, or rather canſt not hear: For how can we imagine thee to be a God, who art ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in all thy Actions, to fire the Breaſt of one, and freeze the other; to make her Heart more obdurate and harder than the Adamant, and mine like Wax, fit to receive any Impreſſion thou art pleaſed to put upon it.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44453:13"/>
Eggs with too long Boyling will prove to be hard, they have but little or nothing for the making of them, for a new Suit on their Backs is as ſtrange as to meet with Froſty weather at Midſummer; So that if you would never ſo fain be revenged on them, their Coats are ſo thin, they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a bruſhing: nor is it to any purpoſe to Sue them at Law, for they are indebted Twenty Shillings more than they are worth at the Ale-Houſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>By my Hallidame</hi> (ſaid <hi>Thomaſio</hi>) <hi>if I thought my Son</hi> Billy <hi>would prove ſuch a Boet, I ſhould heartily wiſh he had never been Born; but now I think on't, I have a trick in my head that I believe will Spoil his Rimeing, I will take him away from keeping of Sheep, and ſet him to Threſhing, and Forceing him to work hard from Morning till Night, I warrant you he will have but little Mind of making of Verſes. Indeed</hi> (ſaid his Neighbour,) <hi>you have hit the Nail on the head, for I tell ye, this Poetry proceeds all from Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for I that was brought up hard to work, did never make a Verſe in all my Life; But I wonder why at firſt you would beſtow ſo much learning on him, for though a little be not amiſs, to read now, and then a Chapter to drive away the

               <p>Accordingly the next morning <hi>Billy</hi> was ſet to Threſhing, and ſo narrowly looked to for plying his Work, that he had no breathing time for his Love-Sick Fancies, and quite took off the edge of his Stomack for Verſefying: his whole care and ſtudy being now how to get himſelf rid of this thraldom, that he might go in perſuit of his Knightly adventures, and Fortune, that ever favours noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, ſoon put a golden opportunity into his hand, for his Father was to go to <hi>London</hi> to pay his <hi>Rent,</hi> which with ſome other buſineſs that he had would detain him there the ſpace of three days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Billy</hi> reſolving to let no more time ſlip, now that Fortune was ſo favourable to him, acquaints his Squire <hi>Ricardo</hi> therewith, bidding him to provide his things ready, for Fame called aloud unto them to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, and injur'd Ladys and wronged Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives cryed for help from his victorious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44453:14"/>
arm; wherefore as ſoon as his Father was ſet out on his Journey they began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for theirs; and going firſt into the ſtable, they ſingled out two of the ableſt Plough-Horſes, whom Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> now that they were preferred to be Horſes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, changed their names from <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Bayard,</hi> by which they were before called, unto the more ſtately names of <hi>Belero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> and <hi>Pugnoto,</hi> chuſing <hi>Belerophon</hi> to ride on himſelf, and beſtowing <hi>Pugnoto</hi> upon his Squire.</p>
               <p>Their next care was for Armor for themſelves, and that had the Queen of <hi>Chance</hi> provided ready for them to their hands, for <hi>Thomaſio</hi> being Conſtable of the Pariſh, the Town Arms for the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands was laid up in his Houſe, with which they armed themſelves <hi>Cap-a-pe</hi>; but their chiefeſt care was in the choice of their Swords, not minding ſo much for the defence of themſelves, as for weapons wherewith to offend their enemies: they therefore choſe two <hi>Bilbo</hi> blades, hand broad, ſuch as would cut off a Gyants head at one Blow; and now a new, thought came into <hi>Billy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> head, by what name to call his Sword, becauſe 't was proper for a Knight Errants Sword to have a name; but after he had Scratched his head a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44453:15"/>
it came into his Pate and ſo the Sword was icleped <hi>Roſero.</hi> Their Launces were two Pikes, cut in two by the middle; and for other weapons or accoutrements they reſted contented, till ſuch time their manhood could purchaſe them better. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo</hi> was very importunate to carry a Wallet of Victuals along with them, but Sir <hi>Billy</hi> told him it was againſt the Law of Arms for Knights Errant to carry with them any Mony or Victuals, they being to be provided for at every Caſtle they came unto.</p>
               <p>It was at that time of the year when theſe Champions ſet forth, that <hi>Ceres</hi> had Cloathed the earth with a rich Suit of all Sorts grain, and that the full ears began to humble their flowry tops as in a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment to thank the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman for his painful Toyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now that they might not be ſeen, they ſet forth in the night time, when by the next morning at ſuch time as <hi>Aurora</hi> had opened her purple Doors, and gave notice of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Titan,</hi> they were gotten from Home the ſpace of Twelve Miles; not minding whether they went, but only ſo that they went forwards.

at the firſt Caſtle I come to, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to be made a Knight by the Lord thereof; which is a thing that ought not to be denyed to thoſe who have ſworn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves true Sons of</hi> Mars, <hi>and ſpend their Blood in relieving diſtreſſed Ladies, and thoſe that are oppreſſed.</hi>

                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> was very hard to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (for it was then about the time when Mortals uſed to break their faſts, and his cuſtom uſed to be rather to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his work than the ſatisfying of his Stomach,) had not the great hopes of his Maſter's being ſuddenly Knighted, and the entertainment he ſhould have at the next Caſtle, diverted him; And to ſee that fortune is ſometimes Favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Knights Errant, they had not rid long before they came to a ſumptuous building, wherein lived an ancient <hi>Eſquire,</hi> who kept a very bountiful Houſe, and courteouſly entertained ſtrangers that came to him. Thither rid Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire, and meeting one of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Yard, asked him if the Lord of the Caſtle was within? The Servant ſtared upon them, ſeeing them ſo Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly habited, and ſeeing Sir <hi>Billy</hi> have on ſome pieces of Armor, which he had never ſeen before, but only ſuch as hung
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44453:18"/>
up in his Maſters Hall. <hi>I tell you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>this is no Caſtle, nor is my Maſter any Lord, ſave only that he is Lord of the Mannor. I perceive</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Billy</hi>) <hi>that thou art ignorant of what belongeth to Knights Errant, and therefore go tell thy Maſter, that the moſt Heroick and invincible Knight, Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay, <hi>would confer with him. Tell me then</hi> (quoth the Fellow) <hi>how long thou and the Springal that tendeth on thee, have been come out of</hi> Bedlam, <hi>and perhaps I may acquaint him with your being here, elſe may my Maſter be angry with me, for of all ſcents, he loveth not that which comes out of</hi> Bedlam. Theſe words put Sir <hi>Billy</hi> in a great rage, drawing out his <hi>Morglay,</hi> and Brandiſhing it about his head, that he looked like the picture of St. <hi>George</hi> fighting with the Dragon. The Fellow ſeeing him draw out his <hi>Killing Iron,</hi> knowing it to be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meddling with edge Tools, told him he would preſently acquaint his Maſter; <hi>But Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my memory is bad, and therefore I muſt intreat you once more to tell me your name.

               <p>Theſe words were very pleaſing to Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> but much more to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who now was in good hopes of recruiting his wambling Belly, which wanted the uſual meſs of Porrege that he uſed to have for his Breakfaſt before he went to plough; therefore alighting off their Horſes, and committing them to the care of one of the Servants, they walked in with the Gentlemen, and were by the Maſter of the Houſe kindly entertained. But it would have made a Horſe break his Bridle with laughter, to ſee how the young <hi>Knight Errant</hi> and his <hi>Squire</hi> were put to their ſhifts in getting off their Armor, which after ſome difficulty they accompliſhed, and were as ſoon Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the Gentlemen there preſent, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> returned them the like Civilities, but with as many abſurdities, as a Citizen at Court, or as a Clown at a Dancing-School.</p>

               <p>After they had ſufficiently refreſhed themſelves, Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Teeth now lying Idle, his Tongue having free liberty to ſpeak, he began his Speech in this wiſe.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſtood gaping with his Mouth wide open, greedily to ſuck in thoſe praiſes which were beſtowed upon him; <hi>Ricardo</hi> as greedy of Fame as his Maſter, asked the Gentleman, if that Poet, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian, or writer, who recorded his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Acts, did not alſo ſet forth the Deeds of Squires Errant? <hi>Billy</hi> laughing at his Squires ſimplicity, told him, that was a needleſs queſtion, ſince the Knights and the Squires actions were as inſeparable as a Fiſh and Water, without the one the other Dyes; Only the Knight was to be praiſed for his valiant Acts, and the Squire for Obedience to his Commands. <hi>But where then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>is the reward of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44453:25"/>
his Service?</hi> For that, ſaid <hi>Billy,</hi> after the Knight hath finiſhed his Conqueſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly makes him the Captain of ſome Caſtle, or Governour of an Iſland, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he finds his abilities anſwerable thereto. Never queſtion my abilities (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) in any ſuch things, for he that knows how to govern himſelf, knows how to govern a Family, and he that can govern a Family, need not fear but he can govern an Iſland.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe betwixt Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and his Squire made the Gentlemen to laugh hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily; who now conſulted together upon what attempt to put this new made Knight, at laſt they agreed to ſet up a <hi>Quinten,</hi> which is a croſs bar turning upon a pole, having a broad board at the one end, and a bag full of Sand hanging at the other; Now he that ran at it with his Launce, if he hit not the board was laughed to Scorn, and if he hit it full and rid not the faſter, would have ſuch a blow with the ſand Bag on his Back, as would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beat them off their Horſes.</p>
               <p>But this Exerciſe diſlik'd Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he ſaid, it was not comprized in the Rules of Knight Errantry, which was to ſuccour diſtreſſed Ladies, to kill Gyants and Monſters, to raze down inchanted

Curvetting and Riſing with his fore Feet; whereupon <hi>Ricardo</hi> threw away his Launce, and held with both his hands on the Pummel of the Saddle; The Horſe being thus freed from his Reins, ran with <hi>Ricardo</hi> on his back all about the Ground, where multitudes of people were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to behold the Sport, which cauſed ſuch a laughter amongſt them, with loud Clamors and Noyſe, as Cannons make when they diſgorge their Fiery Vomits, or that of <hi>Nilus</hi> precipitated Cataracts, which Deafens all the people that dwell thereabout.</p>

                  <hi>RIcardo,</hi> as you heard in the former Chapter, being ſent on an arrand to the Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> bethought himſelf by the way, that if he returned back to <hi>Billerecay,</hi> old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him for ſtealing of his Horſe, and therefore began to doubt whether Squire Errantry would protect him from the Gallows. To prevent which diſgrace, he reſolved upon the firſt opportunity to ſell his Horſe, and with the Mony to maintain himſelf until he could get into a more ſafer Service than that of Knight Errantry. Wandring therefore through by-paths as his moſt ready way, at ſuch time as the days bright burning eye caſt ſcorching Rayes upon the parched Earth, he ſat him down under the Covert of a broad ſpreading Oak, and being full of thoughts not knowing what to do, he ſpyed coming towards him an aged Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

flattering Dream or vain Viſion; yet by one infallible Argument he found himſelf to be awake, which was, that he was thoroughly an hungry. In the mean time the old Palmer was vaniſhed away; wherefore <hi>Ricardo</hi> reſolved, the firſt thing he did to ſeek out for Belly-Timber, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Ring in his pocket, that at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time it might ſerve to diſcharge his Reckoning.</p>

               <p>IT was at ſuch time of the day when the Curl pate Waggoner of Heaven had well near finiſht his Diurnal Courſe, and was driving his panting Steeds down towards the Weſtern Hill, when the Renowned Squire Errant <hi>Ricardo</hi> entred into the Town of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> bending his courſe directly towards the Houſe of <hi>Jone Grumball,</hi> to whom he delivered Sir

But being ſhe could not read her ſelf, ſhe ſent for a Journey-man Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to the further end of the Town to read it, one who bore good will unto her, and was at that preſent inditing a Letter to make her know the affection he bore her; <hi>Criſpin</hi> having read it over, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he had a Knight to his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, was very much troubled, but <hi>Jone Grumball</hi> was ſo well pleaſed with the Sugar-Candy Words he ſent unto her, that ſhe vowed her ſelf unto him both Body and Breeches, asking <hi>Ricardo</hi> many queſtions concerning him; all which he anſwered in ſuch lofty Language, ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his proweſs, the reſpects all people ſhewed unto him, with the faithful Love he bare unto her, that ſhe was more and more entangled in the Lime-Twigs of Love, vowing and proteſting her ſelf his for ever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thomaſio</hi> quick as lightning taking a Conſtable along with him, went to <hi>Jone Grumballs,</hi> and ſeizing upon <hi>Ricardo,</hi> threatned him with all the puniſhments he could reckon up, as Hanging, Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drowning, Killing, Stabbing, and twenty other kinds of Death beſides, if he told him not where his Son and Horſes were. <hi>Ricardo</hi> nothing daunted at his Domineering, but intending to put a trick upon him, told him that his Son was become one of the greateſt Lords in the World, that Kings and Queens craved his Aſſiſtance, and Lords and Ladies implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his help; that he commonly kill'd half a dozen Gyants for his Breakfaſt, and bathed his Sword in the Blood of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Dragons every day; That his Maſter was at that preſent in the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi>'s Caſtle, where the moſt excellent Princeſs <hi>Tantabilus</hi> courted his Love, but that he had vowed himſelf only to the

The other Fellow, who had lain all this while in a ſwound, being now a little revived, began to rail upon him more than the Hoſteſs, ſo that the poor Horſe-Courſer, though more bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd than the other two, could not tell what to do, for notwithſtanding all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes he could make, nothing would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd but that he was the Devil's partner in all this miſchief, and therefore ſhould ſuffer for him if he did not produce him.</p>

as well as Knights; and many weighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> paſſed in his thoughts; but Love ſo over-ſwayed them all, that he became ſolely captivated to her Affections, and therefore was ſhe no ſooner riſen from Milking her Cow, but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted her on this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſt beautyful Miſtreſs, the attracting Harmony of your Angelical Voice hath ſo captivated my Heart, that I am become a Sworn Servant to your Vertues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among all the Days of my Life, I muſt account this the Happieſt wherein I had the Honour firſt to ſee you; Nor think you have met with an ordinary perſon which ſeeks thus to gain an Intereſt in your Graces; for know I am no leſs than a Squire-Errant to that Renowned Knight at Arms, the invincible and Victorious</hi> Sir Billy of Billerecay, <hi>whoſe Fame begins to ſound all the World over, and whoſe Hiſtory is to be Writ with a brazen Pen, and enroled in the Book of Fame; Let me intreat you therefore to accept of me for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, by which you may come to be as Famous as</hi> Dulcina <hi>my Maſters Lady, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time the Wife to a Governour of an Iſland.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:44453:56"/>The poor Maid who had never before been acquainted with any Love-Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick above that of a Ballad, or in the Plow-Mans dialect, <hi>Vaith Jone I Love thee</hi>; ſtared upon him as one ſtricken into a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den amazement; at laſt ſhe ſaid to him, <hi>Pray Sir do not uſe ſuch hard Words, you ſcare my Cows, and ſpoil my milking. Ricardo</hi> finding he was not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, went towards her, thinking to Salute her; but the Wench as nimbly avoided him, threatning to cry out if he approached any nigher to her; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible-Ring,</hi> he thought to gain his purpoſe that way. The Wench ſeeing him ſo vaniſht on a ſudden, and feeling ſuch ſmattering about her lips, without perceiving any thing, threw down her Milk-pail, and ran homewards as faſt as her Legs could carry her, ſo that on a ſudden ſhe was gotten out of <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s ſight, who ſeeing her fled, thought it in vain to purſue her but went on in his intended Journey, until he came to the Farmers.</p>
               <p>Now ſo it was that this Maid whom he had ſo Courted was the Farmers Daughter, who ſeeing <hi>Ricardo</hi> coming, ſqueaked out as if at the ſight of ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Hob-goblin; having before declared
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44453:57"/>
how ſhe was ſerved a Milking, and now crying out, <hi>This, this is the Devil that haunted me.</hi> But the Farmer himſelf knowing <hi>Ricardo,</hi> perſwaded her to the contrary, telling her it was the Man that had left his Horſe with him. And ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Houſe, after ſome diſcourſe, <hi>Ricardo</hi> told the Farmer of the affection he bore to his Daughter, and the better to gain his good will, how he was the Squire to a Knight Errant, who Conquer'd Kingdoms at his Pleaſure, and how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould be a Governour of an Iſland at leaſt: and for that which had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell his Daughter, it was only things done by Inchantment, to which Knights Errant and their Squires are very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>The Old Farmer wondred at his words, taking him now for another manner of Man than at firſt he judged him to be, and therefore freely gave him his Conſent, as over-joy'd to have the Governour of an Iſland for his Son-in-Law; but when this was motion'd to the Daughter, ſhe look'd on it with as much diſdain as <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope</hi> Courted by the Beggarly <hi>Irus. Now by my Ferkens</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>for ought I know, this</hi> Squire Errant <hi>may be no better than the</hi> Knave of Clubs <hi>to the</hi> King and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44453:57"/>
Queen of Hearts, <hi>and therefore let his Maſter Conquer Kingdoms and Iſlands for whoſoever he will, but this skip-jack, this</hi> Hocus Pocus <hi>ſhall never be any Husband of mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer was ſomething a cooling Card to <hi>Ricardo,</hi> but comforting himſelf, upon her Father's words, he thought that time might alter her mind, and for the preſent he knew not what to do with a Wife if he had her. He therefore reſolved ſhe ſhould be his Miſtreſs, and to bear the Name of <hi>Dowzabella,</hi> which Name he promiſed to make as Famous by his Acts as that of <hi>Sabra</hi> the beloved Miſtreſs of St. <hi>George,</hi> or <hi>Philotheta</hi> the Lady of <hi>Montelion, Knight of the Oracle. Away you Fool,</hi> ſaid the Wench, <hi>and ſpare your ſtrength to throw a Cudgel at a Pare-Tree, or your Activity in being the beſt Man at a match at Foot-Ball; and meddle not with a Sword as a Weapon out of your Element, but betake you to a ſtail as moſt fit for your Employment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My deareſt</hi> Dowzabella (ſaid <hi>Ricardo</hi>) <hi>be not ſo cruel to me in thy expreſſions. Hey day</hi> (ſaid the Wench) <hi>what have we here; I was Christened</hi> Mary, <hi>and they call me</hi> Moll, <hi>and muſt I now be named</hi> Dowzabella? <hi>Now I wiſh that for your

Pains (if any one will be ſo mad as to Marry ye) that your Wife from a</hi> Squire-Errant, <hi>will advance ye to be Knight of the</hi> Forked Order; <hi>And ſo Sir the way lies plain for you to be gone, for your Room will be more acceptable to me by far than your Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> hearing theſe Words, thought it in vain to ſtay any longer there, and therefore paying the Farmer for keeping his Horſe, deſiring <hi>Dowzabella</hi> to retain a better Opinion of him, he mounted his Steed and returned towards his Maſter.</p>

And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Joy the more he delivered him the Letter from her, which having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived how often did he read, and read again the Superſcription of it, it being directed <hi>to that Puiſſant and Magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knight at Arms, the moſt redoubted Sir</hi> Billy <hi>of</hi> Billerecay; but when he had read the contents therein contained, he was ſo tranſported with an Extaſy of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44453:59"/>
Joy, as if he had been placed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean or Zenith of all happineſs. And can it be poſſible (ſaid he) that my Lady <hi>Dulcina</hi> takes ſuch Notice of the Actions of her Knight? has Fames Trumpet already blown my praiſe unto her Ears? What then will it be when I ſhall have performed ſuch Acts worthy to be Eterniz'd in Fames eternal Bead-Roll.</p>
               <p>As he was thus applauding his own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed happineſs, his Hoſt the Sage <hi>Freſton</hi> came in, who ſeeing <hi>Ricardo,</hi> welcomed him with great demonſtrations of Love, inquiring after the welfare of his Lady <hi>Dulcina,</hi> and how he ſped in his Meſſage unto her; to all which <hi>Ricardo</hi> gave very plauſible anſwers, according to what he thought would beſt pleaſe his Maſter. When (ſaid he) I firſt came to that Idea of Beauty, ſhe was ſweetly breaking the yielding Air with her Harmonious voice, which ſo ſweetly ſhe breathed forth, as was able to make the Rocks to dance, and ſurly Beaſts ſtand attentive to hear her; the whilſt her white hands (in whoſe compariſon all whites are Ink) was ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Needle, which with ſo pretty a manner made his paſſage too and fro thorough the Cloth, as if it were loth to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44453:59"/>
have gone from ſuch a Miſtreſs, but that it hoped to return thitherward very quickly again. Thus did her Voice and Hands keep pace in an equal proportion, as if her hands were won by the Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Voice to work, or her Voice were taught to Sing by the Harmonious conſort of her hands. But when this Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Beauty did caſt an Eye upon me, and with what a due Reverence I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to deliver my meſſage unto her, ſhe left off Singing, and with ſuch a ſmile as <hi>Venus</hi> the Queen of Beauty gave to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes,</hi> ſhe received the Letter from me, being impatient till ſhe had read the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof, which both by her words and looks I found to be very ſatisfactory unto her. But <hi>Ricardo,</hi> ſaid the Sage <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> you have not as yet told us what Song your Lady or Miſtreſs was then ſinging when you came unto her? O that ſaid he, can I well Remember, for I have ſeen it in a Ballad glewed upon many an Ale houſe wall, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus.</p>

                  <l>When as King <hi>Henry</hi> rul'd this Land,</l>

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:44453:60"/>Indeed ſaid the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> I gueſs'd it was either that or the Ballad of <hi>Chevy-Chaſe,</hi> as conſiſting the one of Love, the other of War, being both Concomitants of Knight Errantry.

               <p>Now in moſt parts of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (where this Wedding was kept) it is a common Cuſtom when Poor People Marry, to make a kind of a <hi>Dog-Hanging,</hi> or Mony-gathering,

whereupon miſtruſting that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed happened to be true, ſhe ſtarted up of a was ſudden, and ran as faſt as ſhe could to her Miſtreſſes Bed, into which ſhe entred, and no ſooner there but ſhe found her ſelf in the Gentleman's Arms who owed the Hoſe her Miſtreſs had on: He thinking her to be his, and the Miſtreſs of the Houſe; But before he could ask her any queſtions what was the cauſe of this hurley burley, ſome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were come running after the Wench, and there found that the Miſtreſs was equally concerned with the Maid. And now the Gentleman was as much abaſhed as the young Man before, not only to ſee himſelf taken in that manner, but alſo with one whom he eſteemed a far greater diſparagement than if it had been her Miſtreſs; nor could he well tell, being acted in the dark, if this ſame were not his former Bedfellow, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Miſtreſs might put a trick upon him.

the Gentleman ſhould come into the Miſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Bed? Now old <hi>Thomaſio</hi> who had alſo riſen with the reſt, alarum'd at the Noiſe of a Fire in the Houſe, would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that all was done by Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, telling them what had happened in his Town, as alſo what they had ſeen in their own, how his Son's Sword without help of Hands marched away of it ſelf; The Miſtreſs of the Houſe ſeconded him therein, affirming it muſt needs be ſo, elſe how could the Gentleman be brought into her Bed; but one of the Gueſts affirmed, that he thought it was rather the Charms of the Petticoat than any other Magical Charms.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus arguing the caſe, <hi>Ricardo</hi> was as buſie in ordering of the Cloaths he had brought out of the Chamber, which he fixed upon two poles, and having ſome glimmering light by the help of the Moon, he writ theſe Verſes on a piece of Paper, and pin'd them to the Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Pedlars who had been damnified by Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s adventure, hearing his terrible
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44453:84"/>
threatning words, and ſeeing the ſpoil he had already done, thought it was beſt to be ſtir themſelves; and ſnatching up ſome poles, the broken remainders of their Stalls, they ſet upon Sir <hi>Billy</hi> on every ſide, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſome behind him, that at length they knockt down the Knight Errant, who lay ſtreaking for Life under his Horſes heels. Then began they to gather up their Wares, which confuſedly lay ſtrewed upon the Ground; Here a parcel of Jews-Trumps quite out of Tune, their Babies, Rattles, Tumblers, Boxes, all Trophies of Sir <hi>Billy</hi>'s Manhood, who lay all this while in a Trance.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were a doing, <hi>Ricardo</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> having gotten his Maſter from under his Horſes Feet, wrapped his own Cloak about him, and ſo carried him away.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44453:84"/>
Inviſible, when returning to fetch his Horſe, he found the Pedlars had ſeized on him, who having ſcrambled up their Goods for fear others as Knaviſh as he Fooliſh might filch ſome from them, not finding the Man any where, ſeized upon the Horſe, reſolving that ſhould make good the damage they had ſuſtained. <hi>Ricardo</hi> ſeeing what was done, and judging by it of their intent, reſolved the Game ſhould not go ſo, and having on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> and a good Battoon in his hand, he ſtruck the party with the ſame who had hold of the Horſe, he feeling it ſmart, and not knowing from whence the blow came, with as much eagerneſs ſtruck at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that other again at a fourth, ſo that in an inſtant, parts taking, ſix or ſeven of them were together by the ears. Whilſt this Game at Handy-Fiſts was thus playing, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo</hi> ſhifted away with the Horſe, and they having ſoundly batter'd each other, and not knowing well why this quarrel was begun, began to have a breathing ſpace, but then looking for the Horſe from whence they all hoped for ſatisfaction, and finding him to be gone as well as his Maſter, they each of them thought the other had conveyed him away, whereby a new quarrel aroſe betwixt them, and from words again to blows more ſharp and eager than before.</p>
               <p>But the caſe was not ſo Tragical on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44453:85"/>
their ſide, as it was on <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with the Horſe to his Maſter, found him without ſenſe or motion, as one inroled in the regiſter of death, and ready to caſt off the robe of Clay, and drop into the Grave. <hi>Ricardo</hi> finding him in this condition, was almoſt at his wits end, not knowing what to do, nor whether to have him, his Maſter by going about to redreſs wrongs, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many, that ſcarce was any place ſafe for them to reſort to.</p>
               <p>In this uncouth condition, as he was rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating what to do, came by an Old Man with Grizly Hairs, one whoſe Fortunes were out at the heels, as his Cloaths were out at the Elbows, in ſum, a Beggar, whoſe hourly wants made him trudge from place to place for relief.

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44453:85"/>
and by direction of the Old Man came to a place where Solitarineſs it ſelf might be ſaid to dwell, being Scituated in the midſt of a Thicket of Trees, Quick-ſet-Hedges, and Buſhes; here did they enter into a Cottage erected on purpoſe for the entertainment of Beggars, Mumpers, and ſuch kind of people, where they freely ſpend the Coin they get in begging, having general randezvouzes there at certain times of the Year. To this ſtately Manſion did they bring that Victorious Knight at Arms, Sir <hi>Billy</hi> of <hi>Billerecay,</hi> where having disburden'd his Horſe of him, they carried him to a Bed, who all this while lay as if his Soul were Eclipſed from his Body. Now <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardo</hi> being ſolicitous for a Surgeon, this old <hi>Mumper</hi> who was skilful in making of <hi>Clymes</hi> and raiſing bliſters on legs to move people to compaſſion, and healing them again at his pleaſure; he voluntarily undertook to be Sir <hi>Billy's</hi> Chyrurgion; and adminiſtring ſome ſmall matter unto him, our Knight, as if new riſen from ſome Trance, began to open his Eyes, and after two or three yauns, ſtretching out his legs, and fetching a deep ſigh, he ſaid, <hi>Think not proud Pagans though you have unhorſed me, for to prevail: It is not all your Magical Charms that can daunt my Valour, or make me to repent my enterprize upon ye.</hi> When looking aſide, ſpying the Old Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, whom for diſtinction ſake we will call

               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> hearing his Maſter talk ſo Idlely, began aſſuredly to think that all his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Knight Errantry, was but a meer feign'd thing, and that though he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd and feaſted at ſome Gentlemens Houſes, under the notion of ſuch a Perſon, it was more to make ſport with him, than any reality that was in it; ſo thus his hopes of being Governour of ſome Fam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was ſo angry with <hi>Ricardo</hi> at theſe words, that could he have come at him, there had been a mortal affray between the Knight and his Squire; but his bruiſes and Sores would not admit him to ſtir.

               <p>Upon that information, the Conſtable made a ſtrict ſearch thorow all the Houſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing every one he found therein; But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> whoſe thoughts were wholly taken up with what he had read in his Romantick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories; ſeeing the Conſtable and his Guard, cryed out, <hi>Oh ye haters and tormenters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Sir <hi>Billy</hi> had never ſeen any of theſe Legerdemain Tricks before, and therefore his Spirits were ſtruck into admiration, and his Soul intrance'd with wonder. <hi>Ricardo</hi> all this while ſtood by, and ſeeing his Maſter ſtruck into ſuch an aſtoniſhment, thought to make ſome ſport, as well as the Jugler, and ſlipping on his <hi>Inviſible Ring,</hi> when <hi>Hocus</hi> had laid his Tin Boxes and Balls on the Table, and was feeling in his pocket for ſome other

Inſtruments of activity, he takes them up and puts them in his pocket: <hi>Hocus</hi> ſeeing his Boxes and Balls <hi>Hi Preſto</hi> to be gone, was more amazed than Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was at his Tricks; but thinking ſome of the Company might do it to make themſelves merry, and loth to challenge any in particular, he thought to catch them by craft, and therefore pulling out a <hi>Jack in a Box,</hi> ſome Counters and Dice to do more feats withall, he lays them as it were careleſly upon the Table, yet ſtill had a ſpecial eye who took them. <hi>Ricardo</hi> thought what was his drift, yet dreading not his policy, boldly ſteps to the Table and quickly made them Inviſible. The Jugler ſeeing the reſt of his things to be gone thus without hands, ſtood like one that was ſtupified, or like Stags at a gaze, as if his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding were in an extaſie. At laſt he ſwore there was ſome Conjurer amongſt them, whoſe Art was far tranſcendent above his, for he did but play the Devil in Jeſt, but they had plaid the Devil with him in Earneſt. At this the whole Company burſt out into ſuch a laughter as if they had for ever baniſht all melancholly from their Society. This exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mirth made <hi>Hocus</hi> more vext then before, ſo that he began to ſwear like a Culter, for having now loſt his Tools, he might even ſhut up Shop for any thing he could do.</p>
               <p>And now a new project of mirth came into the noddle of one of the Company, who perſwaded the Jugler that Sir <hi>Billy</hi> had taken away his things, and that to get them again, there was no way but uſing him roughly, which he ſhould not need fear to do, becauſe Sir <hi>Billy</hi> what ever he bragged himſelf to be, was but a meer Hony-ſop, a diſh of skim'd Milk, whoſe Feet was his beſt defence, and his Tongue his beſt Weapon. The Jugler animated herewith, ſteps to Sir <hi>Billy</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Sir, I underſtand you have gotten my things, and therefore pray give me them again
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44453:97"/>

               <p>Sir <hi>Billy</hi> ſeeing his flight ſo ſwift, thought it in vain to purſue him any further, and thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in as great State as the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Victor from the Conqueſt of <hi>Darius.</hi> The Juſtice meeting him congratulated his ſucceſs, giving him as much praiſe as if it had been the thirteenth labour of <hi>Alcides</hi>; the other perſons alſo each one in proper words ſought to magnifie this his enterprize, although an attempt ſo inconſiderable, that had the Jugler had but as much valour as an <hi>Humble-Bee,</hi> with a dozen of dangerous words in his mouth, he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him with a Bull-Ruſh.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44453:102"/>
The Coroner feeling the ſmart of the blows, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing by which he received them, was ſtruck with a deep amazement, like a Man gone a far Journey from himſelf, or like unto Priſoners when they felt themſelves turned into Beaſts, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of running from his Enemy, he was ready to run away from himſelf. Sir <hi>Billy</hi> who was always more valiant of his Tongue than his hands, ſeeing the Coroner ſtand ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, as if he had lookt on the <hi>Gorgons</hi> Face, began to bruſtle up himſelf, ſpeaking ſuch Gigantick words, that if his deeds were to be meaſured by them, each one that heard him would have taken him for a Man of Valour. But Sir <hi>Billy</hi> was one of them who could ſpeak much and do but little, for the Coroner exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated at his words, ran upon him, and by main ſtrenght overthrew him, and doubtleſs had kill'd him on the place, had not <hi>Ricardo</hi> alſo run upon him, and tumbling him over Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> by that means gave his Maſter leave to riſe again.

as if he intended to make Mummy of my fleſh; but could I but ſee this black Prince of <hi>Acheron,</hi> or any of thoſe his infernal Meſſengers which thus carried me out of the fight, he ſhould ſee I would not fear to encounter with him; but thus to beat and miſuſe Men unſeen, is both Cowardly and baſe, and quite contrary to the Rules of Knight Errantry.</p>
               <p>The Coroner and his Man hearing <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, declared how they were alſo ſerved, ſhewing ſeveral Cuts and gaſhes of a Sword on their Clothes, with ſome ſlight hurts on their Bodies, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could be no other than a Spirit. This made them all amazed but only Sir <hi>Billy,</hi> who would needs perſwade them it was a puniſhment inflicted on them by the Sage <hi>Freſton,</hi> who was an Enemy to all thoſe who oppoſed Knight Errantry, and a ſpecial Friend in all times of diſtreſs to them who practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Rules of that noble Order.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>replied the old Juſtice</hi>) how comes it to paſs that <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who is at leaſt a retainer to Knight-Errantry, ſhould alſo be puniſhed by him, as well as theſe who are profeſſed Enemies of that Order?

               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who was almoſt weary of his Squire Errantry, and perceiving that his hopes of being Governour of an Iſland would not amount to be Monarch of a Mole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hill; and that all his Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and deſigns were but meer <hi>Chymera</hi>'s and Idle imaginations; was reſolved therefore to leave off this kind of Vagabonding Life, and if his Maſter would not be perſwaded to go home, to leave him in purſuance of his folly; being therefore fearleſs of his diſpleaſure, he thought to give the Gentlewoman a more Comical but truer deſcription of this Lady of perfections, which he performed in this manner.</p>
               <p>To begin with her upper parts, Her hair (ſaid he) hangs down her neck like crawling Snakes, curiouſly pleated into Elf-Locks. Her Forehead like a piece of new-furrowed Land, or like the parched Earth in the heat of <hi>Dog-days.</hi> Her Eyes like two Mill-pits continually running over, on either ſide of which hangs two Souſes or Ears, of ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious greatneſs, that were they cut off and Tann'd, would ſerve a Cobler a Month for Clouting Leather. Her Cheeks are like two ſhrimpled skins of parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and her Noſe comparable to that in the picture of Mother <hi>Shipton.</hi> Her Mouth opens and ſhuts like a Carrier Pouch, and her Teeth are like to an old Park-Pale. Her Lips reſemble thoſe of the <hi>Hogs-Fac'd Gentlewoman,</hi> and her Tongue ſounds as loud as <hi>Bow-Bell.</hi> As for her breath, I muſt crave the help of the Poet to deſcribe it.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>But for her Breath, (Spectators come not nigh,)</l>
                  <l>It lays about, God bleſs the Company,</l>
                  <l>One Kiſs, and eighteen Words of her alone,</l>

               <p>Then for her Neck, it is like a pair of Stairs up to a Belfry, and her ſhoulders able to bear the biggeſt Jeſt that can be put upon them. Her Dugs are like two ore-worn Foot-Balls, and her ſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the planks of a Cheeſe-preſs.

In brief, ſhe is one made up of Natures moſt deformities, a natural Vizard, like a Winters Apple ſhrunk up together, and half rotten.</p>
               <p>The young Gentlewoman laughed very heartily at <hi>Ricardo</hi>'s deſcription of this Lady Errant, and thought it might be more Conſonant to the truth than that delivered by Sir <hi>Billy.</hi> That <hi>Ricardo</hi> (<hi>ſaid ſhe</hi>) perhaps may be the reaſon that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter doth not carry the picture of his Miſtreſs along with him, as formerly Knights Errant were wont to do, by which they uſed to Vindicate their Beauties in Juſts and Tournaments againſt all oppoſers.

               <p>Thou impudent Raſcal, which without reſtraint of ſhame or Modeſty doſt wander about under the notion of a Knight Vagrant; nor will I take that Courſe with thee as we do with our Horſes; firſt I will ſhackle thee, and if that will not do, but that thou wilt ſtill run at random, then will I have thee put in ſuch a pound, where Old Men and Young Men are much alike, for neither go far; I mean (Sirrah) a Priſon, which is a place where a doublet with buttons is more out of Faſhion than Trunk Breeches; where people wear out their Lives like an old Suit, the faſter the better; a houſe of meager looks and ill ſmells; ſo curſed a piece of Land, that the Son is aſhamed to be his Fathers Heir in it. And thither Sirrah ſhalt thou go, if thou wilt not be ruled, maugre all the Witchcraft of thy doubty Squire <hi>Ricardo,</hi> who by his wicked ſpells ſtole away my Horſes from the Inn, whom I will cauſe to be puniſhed in a more exemplary manner than thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ricardo</hi> heard all theſe words, but truſting to the vertue of his <hi>Ring,</hi> he feared not what <hi>Thomaſio</hi> could do unto him.
