         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

infallibilitie, if in a ſyllable you be obliged to a Father? what?
are not you and your Bible the onely Judge of Controverſies?
can any one finde out the true meaning of Scripture, except
your ſelfe, who hath monopolized (with all pietie and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be it ſpoken) the Spirit of truth? To ſay otherwiſe,
were to preferre <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> but I doe forgive you,
you have dealt very moderately in this point; one onely you
mention, and him in matter of fact, the reſt of the Booke is
your owne invention, where you have as faithfully abſtained
from Learning and Antiquitie, as (and they are ſo to you)
from hereſie and ſuperſtition. If the Reader complaine of
Vineger in the Inke, let him remember that the bite of the
Viper (and ſuch they are that rend the bowels of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church) is beſt helped by the antidote of Vipers: a
phrenſie is hardly cured but by the lance, the ſcourge, the
whipping-poſt: Darke roomes indeed, and a large doſe of
<hi>Ellebor,</hi> were the fitteſt attendants for ſuch roavings: But give
me leave to convey him home to his Bedlam, there in the
paroxiſme of his madneſſe, to have his familie exerciſe; and
by the way (though I wander after him that hath long ſince
wandred from himſelfe) I hope in charity ſo be-labour the
man, that hee may henceforth know that part of Scripture
practically; (if it be not againſt his juſtification to know
any ſo) <hi>A rod is for the backe of the foole:</hi> nor wiſh I worſe
ſucceſſe to all his braying aſſociates, though their lugges be
without the Biſhops viſitation, yet I hope their necks is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that of the Parliament; that Honourable and Judicious
Aſſembly will in due time provide againſt theſe monſtrouſly
abſurd Libells, that heap of non-ſenſe, from the which ſuch
a vapor of ſtupiditie and ignorance is exhaled; that who are
ſtrangers to our better times, if they behold this Iland tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93625:5"/>
the ſame, ſhall verily thinke it under an univerſall Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.
But I have ſtayed you too long before the doore.</p>
            <p>You Vſher in that diſcourſe of yours by a preface, uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
many times before your Dreſſer-Lectures, and tell us
ſomething of <hi>conſcience, and its ſcale;</hi> not unlike the Lap-wing,
keeping the greateſt ſtir when you are fartheſt from your neſt:
conſcience in the contemplation, in the pretence, is yours;
but what have you to doe with it in the realitie, (ſo here you
preſſe it) in the practice? beware this care of yours <hi>in agendis</hi>
make you not ſuſpect of merit, if not of ſupererogation.
The peece of ſacred Scripture you make bold with, in my
poore judgement comes not home to the point: the words
doe rather concerne a voluntary then impoſed vow, if any
be ſuch; and therefore had beene more congruous (if, as you
doe, by your infallibilitie, you had juſtified the matter) to
the holy Proteſtation is made in your Parlour meetings, for
tearing a Liturgie, rending a Surplice, burning the Railes,
and pluming a Biſhop: but you cheat the world with a
froath of words, and amuſe the well-meaning; but the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
multitude with an empty noiſe of conſcience, purity, and
reformation: they ſay it is an evill ſigne to ſtumble at the
threſhold; and <hi>If God take no pleaſure in fooles,</hi> you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
a very ſlender approbation to your booke.</p>
            <p>Your next is, you tremble to ſee what ſmall account moſt
men doe make of ſo ſolemne a Vow. How doe you (which
is yours <hi>quarto modo</hi>) preach and practiſe contradictions?
Were ever the moſt ſuperlative votaries of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> Jeſuites and Seminarie Prieſts, more obſtinately miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zealous
in refuſing Oaths, as Civill and Eccleſiaſticall tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and Antichriſtianiſme then you, when they ſute not with
your paſſions, and intereſts? Witneſſe theſe of Supremacie
and Canonicall obedience; the Gate-houſe can tell us how
much leſſe you have eſteemed your bodily, then your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
liberty in ſuch caſes: And if the feare to be plundred
of a faire Eſtate, or the love to a fatter Benefice, can buy in
this niceneſſe of yours, and perſwade you to loſe a Button,
you have no more conſcience in obſerving, than you had obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in taking the Oath: For, if Authority be in the wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93625:5"/>
and ſome popular ſtars promiſe you liberty, how ſoone
doe you breake theſe cords aſunder; and with a <hi>Jusjuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
illicitum ſolummodo ſtringit ad poenitentiam,</hi> ſtart you aſide
like a deceitfull bow? Yea, thinke your ſelfe obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
your ſlackned rigour by an after-increaſe of heate
and violence? Yet are you ſtill the ſame man, love of gaine
preſcribed your oath, and the ſame abſolves you from it,
which doubtleſſe your honeſty by a mentall reſervation, did
ever lay as a ground; Happy you, whoſe conſcience can mould
and faſhion it ſelfe to the impreſſe of the times, and ebbe and
flow with the aſpect of different occaſions! bee aſhamed
therefore (tremble you cannot) when you ſee <hi>What ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
moſt of you make of your ſolemne vowes:</hi> God is not mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
nor ſhall your bragges of caſting out Devils of Idolatrie
and Superſtition in his name, ſave you in that day.</p>
            <p>Having thus skirmiſhed, you advance with the maine bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
ſubjoyning, <hi>That the Miniſters and People have taken the
Proteſtation, and have ſolemnely vowed to maintaine the Doctrine
of the Church, ſo farre as it is oppoſite to Popery.</hi> They have ſo,
and ſo might they ever performe; but cannot one Devill be
caſt out, unleſſe ſeaven enter? have they therefore vowed to
erect <hi>Anabaptiſme?</hi> is there no midde betwixt the extreames?
no ſalvation, but either in the communion of the one, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
of the other? muſt either a ſhaveling or a ſcavinger
be the ſtarre to point us out the way to Chriſt? lend us ſome
of your light, your tallow, to finde out a conſequence here,
I pray: I muſt tell you, and (<hi>Ni frons periit</hi>) you may bluſh
at it; you have defiled your fathers houſe, and laid us open to
the opprobrious inſolence of the common enemie, who eying

               </gap>) our droſſe, wantonly upbraid us, to have rejected
under the name of Superſtition all viſibilitie of a Church,
and by the title of purity, to have brought in nothing elſe but
profaneneſſe and Atheiſme.</p>
            <p>And it is not profaneneſſe to thinke ſo ſlovenly as you doe
of God and his Service, Atheiſme; to profeſſe ſo much, and
practiſe nothing at all? You are ſo point-blanke againſt an
innocent, harmeleſſe, decent worſhip; that either there have
beene no Chriſtians before your dayes, or you are none ſuch:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93625:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ours perhaps in abomination of ſo obſtinate fooliſhneſſe, may
deſperately make Apoſtaſie to <hi>Rome,</hi> but we can expect none
from thence, if you be admitted to baniſh from us the outward

See your ſelfe in him, and take theſe gleanings further:
you plead the ſame independancie with <hi>Rome</hi> from the
civill power, except it bee more eaſie for a State to tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with one Biſhop in Chriſtendome, than with one in each
Pariſh: You maintaine the excommunication of Princes,
which is denied by many of her followers; and that too, ſo
much the more dangerous in you, as you are ready to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a charter, a demiſe, of temporalities <hi>in ordine ad ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi>
not from the Pope, but by a revelation from heaven;
with the clauſe, <hi>Deus transfert imperia:</hi> you may, and it pleaſe
you, remember of <hi>Johannes Lerdenſis Rex Iſrael,</hi> who was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by ſuch a trick as this from the Shuttle to the Scepter.
Yea, in the matter of Epiſcopacie you joyne hands with the
Beaſt; you and his Holineſſe muſt have all Biſhops, except
him and your ſelves, to be in the beſt ſenſe, but of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
ſee the hot Bickerings about this plea, (if your

of the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> Vnhappy Biſhops!
grownd betwixt two factions, as betwixt two milſtones;
there the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> here the Pope of the Pariſh upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them equally as uſurpers. I could tell you further your
Ethuſiaſmes, and their traditions are from the ſame Mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
you from a tumour of preſumption, they of authority,
alike ready to belie the holy Spirit, and the bleſsed Fathers:
But having brought you to <hi>Tyber,</hi> I leave you both as twins

            <p>Here I muſt <hi>luctare cum larva,</hi> grapple with <hi>non-entities,</hi>
doubts and negatives; as if the old Sceptike Philoſophers were
revived in you, or as if <hi>Sixins Empericus</hi> had founded your ſect;
Tell me in good earneſt, why is there nothing poſitive in you,
but all your reformations conſiſt of denialls: you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
afraid, by having any thing common with others, to be
thought of the Church univerſall, which you have now thruſt
out of your Creed, and given her a bill of divorce; or elſe it is
that your Chriſtian liberty can heare of no reſtraint, even in the
fundamentals. Your objections (though like <hi>Ixions</hi> cloud, airy,
and by your owne fancie and ſuppoſition) I paſſe them by, as
the onely orthodox part in you; and ſhall ſtrictly tie my ſelfe
to your anſwers, leſt I ſeeme rather to have a cauſe, then
found a party.)</p>
            <p>In your firſt and ſecond, you make your poſture, and take
your ayme, in the third you let in the thruſt againſt the Church
of England; but with no leſſe miſtake, nor better ſucceſſe, than
when <hi>Dou Quixot</hi> (one who for a head-piece, might have
beene moderator to your dyet) juſted againſt the wind-mill,
in ſtead of the inchanted caſtle. At the firſt view, by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
glaſſe of your purity, you can diſcry foure of the beaſts
heads, and informe us, <hi>that the Liturgie, diſcipline, government and
ceremonies of the Church of England are popiſh.</hi> Suppoſe now it
were ſo, is not your curſe, who diſcovereth your mothers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
double to his, who did not cover his fathers? But I
have miſtaken you, your anabaptization doth priviledge you
to be none of her ſons. What a curſed <hi>Shimei</hi> is this to lay this
heavieſt imputation upon the moſt glorious Church in the
world? I ſhould tell you, if you had either patience or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for inſtruction, the Church of England, ſince the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath beene onely ſhe, who hath ſeriouſly entred the liſts
with the enemy, keeped them in hot blood, and ſcarce granted
a breathing time to her oppoſites, who, if not to award her
blowes, had not daign'd to blunt a pen againſt your ſect. Did
not <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</hi> and numbers more of religious
and learned martyrs, ſeale their departure from the Church of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93625:7"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> by their deareſt blood, and muſt your ſacrilegious hands
throw their ſacred duſt in the ayre, by perſwading us, that
they dyed popiſh, not as members only, but (in ſome kind) au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of that Church, that publique ſervice wee now enjoy?
How may this incourage the Romaniſts, when by our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſelves, not onely our beſt champions, but our very Church
is made theirs? How ſhall they triumph over us, and our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
debates, (they fight cloſely within doores, when we
bawle in the ſtreets) telling us, we cannot agree amongſt
our ſelves, untill wee returne <hi>ad Petram unde exciſi ſumus.</hi>
What you ſay in defence of this your generall poſition, wee
ſhall ſee in each particular, only I cannot paſſe your <hi>Impoſition</hi>
of the Liturgie; <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae:</hi> any thing that is by order
and authority is burthenſome; you idolize onely the calves of
your owne making, that is, of your crazed imagination. But
how ſhall this humor of yours ſuit with the unity of a Church?
can many ſhreads of cloth make a garment, and doe not you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that Chriſts coat was without a ſeame? Nay, for that
you care not, you will be very loth to plead right in Chriſts
Teſtament; <hi>My peace I leave you;</hi> for a needleſſe feare to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the antichriſtianiſme of Eccleſiaſticall courts. Theſe
who are in Civill or Eccleſiaſticall power, may from thence
learne, what a narrow circle you confine them within; nor
ſhould they take this ill, when ſome of you, the Antinomians,
doe pretend immunity from the morall Law, the Law of God
himſelfe (perhaps they dreame of a Patentee by the Goſpell)
and tell us with <hi>Pharabo,</hi> in the pride and hardneſſe of their
hearts, <hi>Who is the Lord that we ſhould obey him?</hi> But I haſten to
your next.</p>
            <p>Then you labour with tooth and naile to untie the oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and tell us firſt, <hi>That the Law for reformation
never intended to allow or ſet up Popery in England,</hi> nor I hope to
deface Chriſtianity. What the intention of the Law hath been,
and how underſtood hitherto, whether ſhall we believe the
Law it ſelfe, the articles, the canons, the rubrickes, the ſervice
of the Church, the ſtatutes of Parliament, the joynt conſent and
practice of all good men, and learned Writers (theſe without
a ſeeming difference, give approbation to the preſent Liturgie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93625:7"/>
and government of the Church) or you, who is <hi>filius terrae,</hi> a
Muſhrume, a ſonne of yeſterdayes? your ſelfe conceit deſerves
my pity, not my refutation, and having by your pulſe found
out your fever, pardon me if I refuſe to take ſuch a verdict upon
your truſt, untill you be reſtored to your wits, neither then
muſt you expect to be ballanced with ſo many contrary preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
teſtimonies. Your ſecond is yet of a higher reach, <hi>All hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
lawes contrary to Gods Word are invalid and voyd, ipſo facto,</hi>
and all muſt be ſuch, to the which your infallibility is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give approbation. Tel me, I pray you, whether ſhould the
Judges, or your ſelves determine the integrity of the Law?
if they, why doe not you attend their determination? how is
it, that the hand muſt reforme the head, the people their Prince?
and doe you thinke petitions, covenants, and inſurrections the
ſureſt gradations to the Kingdome of Heaven? But if your
ſelves onely, what need have you of Judges? Magiſtracie, and
Trienniall Parliaments are to you but cyphers, and viſible
nothings; your conſent is the figure which makes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
for if old Lawes be to be repealed, it is ſufficient, if you
ſay, <hi>Theſe are againſt the Word of God,</hi> no more obedience from
you; your <hi>Sic volo ſic jubeo</hi> is more than powerfull, the wall
of each Citie muſt to the ground at the voyce of your rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes.
And if new Lawes be to be made, it ſeemes it is
you that truch with the Scepter; unleſse your wiſe heads finde
them agreeable to the Word of God, <hi>all is voyde ipſo facto:</hi>
What language is this? Is it not the Dial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct of rebellion?
the very <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Tactus phyſicus</hi> of all diſorder, mutinie, and
confuſion? Now let the world judge betwixt us, whether or
not this your Doctrine ſtrikes home to the very life of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and deſtroyes it inſenſibly, as the worme that
Gourd of <hi>Jonas:</hi> every man, by this <hi>ipſo facto</hi> of yours, is
left with a ſupreame power to bee King and Prieſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Your third ground is of the ſame bullion, and carryeth
your Image, that is, of Schiſme and Democracie: <hi>You have
vowed againſt all Popery, and finding the particulars mentioned
to be ſo, you will have no more communion with them.</hi> What if
you ſhould finde the Decalogue, and the Lords Prayer (as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93625:8"/>
you have already the Creed) to be Popiſh, muſt not all the
Principles of our Religion, for your pleaſure, be drawne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the verge of a thundring abjuration? nor is this feare in
vaine: your preciſeſt Goſpellers already deny the Law, as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuteable to the Climate of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and ſome of your
beſt Rabbies make it a caſe of conſcience not to ſay the Lords
Prayer, that <hi>Magicum canticum</hi> (as they tearme it) <hi>Pontificorum;</hi>
if therefore this wantonneſſe of yours bee not reſtrained, I
appeale to your ſelves (that is, to prejudice and faction it
ſelfe) if we ſhall have more certainty of Religion left us, then
what may ſubſiſt with the ebbing and flowing of your diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and Moone-changing braines.</p>
            <p>It is your next care to draw the Parliament to your party;
but there is no communication betwixt light and darkeneſſe:
nature hath taught all <hi>Entities</hi> to intend their owne preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor can that Honourable Court forget its beeing, and
ioyne with you: plant you at ſuch a diſtance, whether your
antipathy may reach, you ſhall no leſſe exhauſt the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and authority of that moſt honourable meeting, then
the Cabage doth the ſap and life, and vigour of the noble
Vine: can this bee more evident than by the caſe in hand,
where you take the Supremacie upon you, and with intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pride and fooliſhneſſe preſumes to give us the infallible
ſenſe and meaning of the Parliament: I know you had no
ſuch Commiſſion from their Honours, as to bee their trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and to print a Declaration for them. But let us examine
your reaſons. Firſt, <hi>They intended the Proteſtation againſt all
Papery.</hi> It is granted: but are you not like the doore that
turneth all day upon the hinges, and never changeth its
place?</p>
            <p>Have you yet proved theſe things to be Popiſh? nay, though
you had, (which you ſhall never doe,—<hi>rumpantur utilia
codro.</hi>) were the probabilities of your arguments, a warrant
good enough for your reformation, without the approbation
of your Superiours? you indeed never deſire a better, whilſt
you doe what ſeemes good in your owne eyes, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But who gave you authority to cleanſe
the Temple, unleſſe you mantaine that all power is from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93625:8"/>
people, (your hands) and that you may ſtop the wel-ſpring,
the fountaine, when the fit takes you. Secondly, <hi>You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
us that the Honourable Houſe of Commons will not have the
Proteſtation extended to the maintenance of any forme of worſhip,
diſcipline, and government; nor of any Rites and Ceremonies of the
Church of England,</hi> and therefore they condemne them as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh?
What a wild conſequence is this? if that pious Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
did not finde it convenient (as it is not) to aſſert the
grounds of Doctrine and Diſcipline with the ſame oath; did
they therefore condemne all as Antichriſtianiſme? that they
did not is cleare to any that will not ſhut his eyes: firſt, from
the maine diſtance they put betwixt <hi>Popery and Popiſh Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the forme of Worſhip, Diſcipline, Government, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Church of England,</hi> interſerted by ſuch a period,
as your ends ſhall never be able to draw together: Secondly,
from their laudable and religious practice, in being at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
preſent at the ſervice of the Church, wherein none but
<hi>Familiſts</hi> (who doe conforme themſelves to any publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip)
can imagine their integrity and nobleneſſe, for all the
world would prevaricate, if they had but thought (much leſſe
declared) the Liturgie, as you would have it, to be the maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke.
And for the government of the Church by Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Biſhops (this is the heell you would moſt willingly
bruiſe, becauſe it bruiſeth your head) it is no leſſe evident that
the proteſtation doth not condemne that: Firſt, from their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſitting in the Houſe, ſhould theſe members integrate that
body, if they were already adjudged as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ims of the Antichriſt?
this were a too heterogenious fancie: Secondly, what needed
the late diſpute concerning the preſent Diſcipline, if the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
had beene already paſt? Thirdly, would ſo conſiderable
men for honeſty, wiſedome and power, of that number, whoſe
reaſons militates for Epiſcopacie have ſtood up in defence of a
maine branch of Popery, and not have beene aſhamed (if not
puniſhed) for publike maintaining the Antichriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
their late vow and order? Theſe reaſons, nill
you will you, doe convince you, that it was not the intention
of the Parliament (as you to arme them againſt Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93625:9"/>
perſons and orders in every corner of the kingdome would
beare the people in hand) to proteſt againſt (though it ſeemed
not fitting to proteſt for) the preſent Diſcipline, Government
and Ceremonies of the Church; if you had a fore-head, you
would be aſhamed of this boldneſſe, but your obduration hath
no more ſenſe,
<q>Quam ſi dura ſilex, aut ſtet Marpeſia cautes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe great patrons of Church and State, ſhall no doubt
puniſh this malepert ſaucineſſe of yours; for their love to peace
and truth cannot permit ſuch a firebrand to belie their int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and abuſe the credulous ſimplicity of the multitude: I am
confident this reply of mine ſhall firſt viſit you in the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.
Did you, I beſeech you, ever thinke it poſſible, that
the roarings and out-cries of ſuch braying ſchiſmatikes as your
ſelfe, could have induced the honourable Court of Parliament
to change upon a ſudden the whole face of the Church, as that
of a ſcene, upon the daring and miſgrounded information of
your ignorant &amp; malicious libels: the droſſe, the off-ſcourings
of the multitude are yours; theſe, and theſe only, you are able
to induce by promiſes, or deceive by pretences: Tell them, as
you doe, that they are the people of God, ſet apart for the
great worke, and ſhall not this ambition blow up the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
vulgar? Shew them they may change their fortunes, and
laſt ſhare in the publike government, you may draw them
along with you to the ſlaughter, though there you leave them
with your grand-father <hi>Munſers</hi> benediction, <hi>Si quidem populus
vult decipi, decipiatur.</hi> But doe you expect that the grave Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the kingdome ſhall be pleaſed to venture upon this
<hi>Chaos,</hi> and let you ſhuffle the cards againe, in hopes of a better
ſet? your parity brings along with it an Anarchie, and that, all
imaginable ruine and confuſion; I'll tell you in your eare, you
had better keepe your Pamphlets at home, and have reſtrained
the late zealous ſturs at Southwarke and Saint Margarets, if
you would not have had your paſſions detected; theſe ſtaring
lookes of yours ſo ſoone after the change, do fore-tell what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93625:9"/>
madneſſe you may come to at the heighth of the Moone, and
will (no doubt) perſwade that ſupreme Judicatory either to
draw blood of you in time, or to provide manacles for bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up your furious attempts, leſt you teare out your owne
bowells. Your third reaſons leanes to a thought, a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and is a ſtraine of your old lunacy; <hi>That the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houſe of Commons did</hi> intend to exclude whatſoever
ſhould be found to be a branch of popery. But who ſhould
finde it ſo? themſelves, or you? Have they reſigned that
power which God, his Majeſty, and their ancient privileges
have indued them with, into your hands? muſt they and we
be tyed to what fancy your humour ſhall be pleaſed, to thruſt
upon their juſt commands, and our due obedience? This were
a dangerous implicit faith, and of as large bounds and great
variety, as there is judgements and opinions in a kingdome:
for ſhame (if you be reaſonoable creatures) ſpare this non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe;
and rather thinke that the proteſtation hath an edge
to cut out your tongue, than to cut off what your unſetled
imagination after a Fridayes ſupper from the back of an
Oiſter ſhall Dictator-like happen to belch up. You tell us in
the fourth place: <hi>That you are all in an erected hope of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from this moſt noble Parliament;</hi> and ſo are we too;
yea, no leſſe confident than your ſelves, that all Popiſh
traſh ſhall be made packing; but may it pleaſe you to go
along with that baggage, and attend the ſafe tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe fopperies, we ſhall be rid of two great evils;
at your returne from <hi>Rome,</hi> you may take your reſt by the
way with your brethren at <hi>Amſterdame;</hi> no peace for Iſrael
how long the Jebuſites are thornes in our ſides; and if
the Papiſts and you (I cannot tell how to name you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it be Legions, you are ſo many) the Foxes, the <hi>bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeux</hi>
joyn'd by the tailes were once removed, wee ſhould
have good hopes no more to ſee our corn-fields in a fire. The
reformation you expect, is a deformation; your active zeale
extends to the purifying of Churches, yea, of Church-yards;
as lately one of your ſocietie was buried in the fields, leſt
his ſanctified body might be polluted by conſecrated, that is,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93625:10"/>
ſuperſtitious ground: a ſtrange ſeparation that hold even
amongſt the dead: But when you have baniſhed from us all
that can ſpeake as Chriſtians, what ſhall be the event? the ſad
ruines of a torne Church and State, yea, of Religion it
ſelfe is at the ſtake: for the more weake and conſcientious
people, who expect ſalvation in ſome Church, will rather
joyne with <hi>Rome,</hi> then have no Church at all, like the fiſh,
changing the hot water with the hotter fire; others, who
have made Religion their hand-maide, ſhall be bold to
laugh at piety, and thinke it nothing but an invention of
policy, to bridle the humours of the leſſe daring, and to
encompaſſe the deſignes of the more active wits; ſo the
fruits of your reformation ſhall be like theſe of <hi>Gomorra,</hi>
pleaſing to the ſight, but in effect either Apoſtacie, or
Athiſme. In your fifth ground I acknowledge your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
idiome, the compleat language of <hi>Amſteldame;</hi> their
you tell me, that <hi>ſuppoſe the Houſe of Commons had, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the removall of theſe things, but the protection rather of
the ſame, yet private Chriſtians muſt put to their bands, and
reforme themſelves, and live no longer ſchoole-boyes and punies
under the fernla of that diſcipline:</hi> Now you ſpeake to
the point, and have but dallied hitherto. Biſhops I ſee
and Parliaments are in the ſame reſpect to you, if once
they croſſe your humour; if this be not a trumpet of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
there is nothing ſo. Goe on, and give not over
till the Common-wealth be fitted to your Church (as one
of yours ſaid, the hangings to the roome) let us have
that prodigious monſter, your parity, in both, without ſo
much as diſtinction of head and feet, and then you may
reforme when, and what, and how you pleaſe. Can there
be the leaſt thought of loyalty and ſubjection beneath
this, when ſuch an o yes is made for every man to take
up armes, and to reforme what firſt comes unto his hand?
nor is it a wonder to heare this from you; e're all be
done you will ſpeake with a higher tone, even that the
propriety of all goods is your owne: For it is your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that wee have fallen from all dominion and right
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93625:10"/>
to rhe creature by the mortall ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> this, ſay
you, was reſtored by Chriſt, who reſerved the dominion
to himſelfe (there your love to Magiſtracy) but gave the
right to his children, the ſonnes of the Church, theſe
whom the conventicle hath aſſured that they are marked
with the white ſtone, you may therefore <hi>poſſidere terram,</hi>
and who beſides you doe ſo, are but uſurpers. Yet give
mee leave to wonder, if in a ſettled Church and ſtate ſome
care be not taken to ſupreſſe this madneſſe, whereby every
man is invited to a freedome and liberty of doing what
his humour ſuggeſteth; as if this <hi>Diana</hi> of yours inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
nothing elſe but phrenſie and rebellion: You will by
this your exorbitancie, make the Biſhops enemies long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and while they are going out at doores, pull
them backe by the gownes: in the time of their power,
which of you durſt vent ſuch dangerous whimſies; now
you teach us, that by one blow wee cannot lop off the
inconveniencie of Biſhops, and the inconveniencie of no
Biſhops, and that the greateſt danger in a mutation is that
all daugers cannot be fore-ſeene: if this popular refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of yours take root for Religion, Learning and
civilitie, wee muſt content our ſelves with prophaneneſſe,
ignorance and barbarity, nay, all the evills that anarchie
and confuſion can produce muſt attend upon us. But the
honourable Houſe of Commons, againſt whom by this
reaſon you have taken up the bucklers, will provide for
that fire, that gangrene of yours, which hath already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
the bed-ſtraw, and ceaſed almoſt upon the very heart
of the Kingdome.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>in regard of the whole frame and matter of it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93625:11"/>
if your anſwer be negative, I leave you to bee hiſſed at;
but if affirmative, What advantage have you gotten by this
envious calumny? Doe you thinke we may not uſe what
is in the Maſſe booke conſonant to Scripture, and pureſt
antiquity? to ſay otherwiſe, were to deny the Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and the Decalogue, becauſe they are there: Indeed I
thinke you intend no leſſe then a perfect reformation from
<hi>Rome,</hi> that is, a flat denyall of all that ever <hi>Rome</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
ſo much doth your new Creed proport: God grant
you doe not deny Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, becauſe
the Devills confeſſed him to be ſo. Tell mee in good
earneſt, are you ſo ſilly as to conceive that there have
beene Heretiques before your ſelves, who durſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to have nothing common with preceding Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
And why may there not be ſome few pearles in
that dung-hill, the maſſe-booke? If theſe be culled out,
and according to Scripture, and the beſt patterne of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Liturgies, moſt judiciouſly framed for the ſervice of
our Church, what can malice or ignorance ſay againſt
it? no greater errour in you, and our other enemies of
<hi>Rome,</hi> than not to diſtinguiſh betwixt the purging of an
old Church, and the building of a new; they upbraid
us, becauſe they ſay it is ſo, you becauſe you thinke it is
not ſo; all muſt be admitted from them, errours with
truths, all rejected by you, truthes with errors: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the perfection of the Scripture, you the being of the
Church; you no leſſe enemies to the authoritie of this,
then they to the beliefe of that. But let both of you roare
like the Lyoneſſe bereaved of her whelps, and mixe heaven
and earth together by your lowings, <hi>Naaman</hi> ſhall be the

cannot be in one point coincident: ſo neither the Service

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93625:11"/>

upon all mens <hi>conſciences;</hi> let the matter be never ſo landa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet the manner, the impoſition, is a wile of the Antichriſt:
Here I entreat <hi>Geneva</hi> to anſwer you, whoſe Church hath an
impoſed, a ſet forme of <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and whoſe worthieſt men,
<hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> doe ſtoutly maintaine the Churches power
in preſcribing Ceremonies and Orders for Unitie and Peace
ſake: It were eaſie to have loaden the Margine with quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if I had not abhorred the oſtentive fooliſhneſſe of your
ſect. Who runnes may reade here that <hi>in terminis termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus</hi>
you brand all ſuperioritie Eccleſiaſticall, whether
of King, Church, or Parliament (for all theſe are included in
this impoſition) with the minſing titles of Popery and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme;
if this be the reformation you intend, that no
law can pleaſe you, much good may it doe you, and thoſe that
deſire it: I am confident the Church and State of England are
not ſo wearie of themſelves as to become ſlaves to your fancie;
this perhaps may fit <hi>America,</hi> where there is no government
at all, but how it may ſubſiſt with <hi>a being of a kingdome</hi> here,
I underſtand it not. Popery (you ſay) is Antichriſtianiſme,
hence every Papiſt muſt be the Antichriſt; nor ſtay you here, but
bring the matter home from <hi>Italie</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and tell us <hi>by a
neceſſarie conſequence; that not Biſhops onely, but all Superiours
doe oppoſe and overthrow the Kingly office of Chriſt,</hi> which is
incommunicable to any creature and power in heaven or earth,
<hi>bona verba quaeſo.</hi> The Scripture you bring 2 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 22. is as farre
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93625:12"/>
from the point as you from truth and judgement: Speake
out, dare you ſay it in open termes, though indeed you ſay as
much, that the King and Parliament, becauſe of the <hi>Liturgie</hi>
impoſed have denyed Jeſus to be Chriſt? <hi>Tiburne</hi> for you if
you doe. You indeed ſeem rather ſtained with this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
who hath boldly and prophancly averred, that bowing at
that ſacred name is idolatrie, and (as you jeere with the bad
thiefe on the croſſe) Jeſu-worſhip. But let me from your
own principles uſe one argument againſt you; whoſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
to their people a ſet forme of prayer, doe Lord it
over the conſcience, and are the very Antichriſt, but your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie
prayers in publike are to your people a ſet forme of
prayer, you therefore are the Antichriſt. The major is your
owne, the ſubſumption is proved by this inevitable dilemma;
when you pray before your hearers, either it is as their mouth
to God, or for your ſelves only: if you ſay the laſt, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the action it ſelfe, your expreſſions, and the cauſe of
your meeting; and if the firſt, muſt not the people joyne with
you in word, or at leaſt, in thought? and is not this to bee
ſtinced and tyed <hi>to aforme</hi> of prayer how raw and ſenſeleſſe ſo
ever? By your ſole Law-giver, you expreſſe your thoughts of
authoritie; you can heare of no generall commiſſion for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Houſe of God as place and time ſhall require; but
pardon me to beleeve the Apoſtle <hi>better then you,</hi> who hath
not in vaine appointed this qualification, <hi>Omnia fiant decenter
&amp; ordine;</hi> if the Kings and States of <hi>Europe</hi> would bee pleaſed
from this your tenet to learne what a moath, a cancer-<hi>worme
you are to all Superioritie and Iuriſdiction,</hi> you would be ſent
<hi>novos quaeritare orbes. And for this cauſe the Pope, ſay you, is
proved</hi> to be the Antichriſt, in that hee fitteth <hi>in and over the
Temple</hi> of God, that is, as you pleaſe to Paraphraſe it, The
conſciences of men: it had beene well you had ſpoken with
application; you are the onely men I know, who muſt have
<hi>all mens</hi> conſciences ſquared by the ſuppoſition of your owne.
The will-worſhip you name is truely that you practiſe, that is,
an affected contradictorious way in the ſervice of God to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93625:13"/>
Scripture, to Antiquitie, to the Church <hi>you live in,</hi> to Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yea to Chriſtianitie it ſelfe. If by a <hi>Liturgie</hi> deviſed by
men, you underſtand mans deviſe, it is a groſſe calumnie, a
notorious untruth, not a ſyllable in that Booke, which is not
either (as the greater part) the words of Scripture it ſelfe, or
cleerely deducible in the very Phraſe from thence; if your
ſenſe be, that it is impoſed by humane power, you are no leſſe
miſtaken; there is either a particular warrant from Scripture,
or at the leaſt a generall Commiſſion granted for the ordering
of the Houſe of God, which extends to the full latitude of
the Booke, if you had either impartialitie to conceive aright,
or conſcience to obey; but it may be you meane that men
have contrived the Booke of <hi>Liturgie,</hi> ſo they have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Creed, which perhaps you for the ſame reaſon have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
nor was ever the Church of God ſince the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

the extenſion of good is not its touchſtone, yet this doth not
hinder it to be communicative, and that to the dimenſion of

the coſt of Phyſick for expelling malancholy. Your firſt

Church agreeable in all points to the viſible Congregation

            <p>You goe on, and tell us the godly may not communicate

there is a neceſſity laid upon us to ſearch the hearts of men,
to have their breſts made of chriſtall, to finde out their very

Nor will you meddle with tithes, this were (God ſave

a ſubject; by this outward pulſe a man may find the inward
motions of your heart, how unequall theſe are and how this
aguiſh and preternatural heat of yours foreſpeaks a ſweat from
my heart; I wiſh not that of bloud.</p>
            <p>You adde, that <hi>a dangerous error ſtifly maintained, is liable to
excommunication:</hi> I am glad you grant a poſſibility of errour;
now there is ſome hopes you may be inſtructed ſince your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
infallibility permitts you to thinke, you can thinke
amiſſe, the acknowledgement of a ſickneſſe is the firſt ſtep
to health, but how your excommunication from other
Churches and your exempted independent congregations can
be ſoadered together, I profeſſe I underſtand it not; to me they
ſeem as contradictorious, as independent, &amp; not independent:
your heriſie divides it ſelfe in ſo many croſſe wayes that it muſt
ſometimes thwart, and the more, that your extemporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
know neither Premiſſes nor deliberation.</p>
            <p>In your laſt words you ſeeme to caſt a ſmile upon the Civill
power, and give a haile to your Maſter, by granting that in a

               </gap>aternity;
but if <hi>hypotheca impoſsibilis aequipollet ſimpliciter neganti,</hi> this is
no grant at all, ſo you ſpeake of ſuch crimes as cannot poſsible
fall upon any of that ſanctification, ſuch as the roote of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,
and the errours derived from hence; nay if they did, ſuch
falterers were no more of your ſociety, becauſe you are obliged
in conſcience to ſeperate from them: ſo it is then that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
hath not only no power <hi>in Eccleſiaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

directly Antichriſtianiſme) but <hi>in Civilibus,</hi> neither to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
any member of your exempted and independent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:
this is the <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece that muſt never be of the
Common dependence and condition of the reſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
See now what neceſsity his ſacred Majeſty hath (unleſſe
he would ſell all his poſſeſſion) to buy your pearles to curb this
feaſter of yours; doe not flatter your ſelves, his authority and
yours cannot breathe under one climate your pretended free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is wholely incompatible with his due obedience, (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
theſe ſad eclipſes, theſe late ſtormes, theſe clouds that yet
threaten a tempeſt) either that, or this, withall loyalty I
ſpeake, it is not of God; nor deale you more favourably with
Parliaments; how much you regard the power, the integrity
of that moſt honorable Court this your diſcourſe can beſt give
evidence; if you once carried the buſines, you have profeſſed
it, that no Law no ſtatute ſhall oblige you further then you
find convenient to your exempted Congregation. And
how have you ſuted your reſpects to the better times? that
light of redreſſe hath onely ſerved to make your Iett the
blacker: what horrid Monſters, <hi>quot Africa non caperet,</hi> hath a
too favourable beame of toleration, raiſed out of the mud and
clay of your ignorant preſumption and droſsie wits? how is the
pleaſant land become a wilderneſſe.

us all to Aſhes: you have bin ſpared hitherto either to try the
length of your Arme how far theſe your deſignes would reach,
or that the Kingdom had not yet collected it ſelfe out of that
amazement, which by your ſuddaine irruption as that of many
rivers, you had cauſed: but it is now high time to throw full buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
of water upon your fiery heads, to take the matches from
you, and either to ſend you hence, or preſcribe you bounds; leſt
that the combuſtible body about you (all are now of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
take hold of your ſparks, and burn up all to the extirmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
firſt of order, then of religion, and laſt of humanity it ſelf.
Theſe are the prayers, and theſe the feares of all them that with
more reall ſighes and groanes, than you, to the hazard of
your buttons imploy in charming of your hearers, love the
proſperity, and long after the peace of Jeruſalem.</p>
