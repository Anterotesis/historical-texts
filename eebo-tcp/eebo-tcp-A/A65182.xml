         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Portuguez were building a Fort on the North-ſide of the River of
<hi>Amazons,</hi> to ſecure a rich Silver Mine which they had diſcover'd
there, ſent notice to the Portuguez, that they had invaded the French
King's Territories, and therefore deſir'd 'em to retire, that River
being the Limits of the two Nations; but the Portuguez refuſing to
quit their Enterprize, Monſieur <hi>de Ferolle</hi> march'd against them,
and attack'd 'em with ſo much Succeſs, that thoſe who guarded the
Mine and the Fort were killed, or put to flight. <hi>How this Conteſt
between theſe two Nations will be decided, is uncertain; but
this is certain, that whatever Europeans firſt poſſeſs themſelves of
the</hi> Iſle of the Sun, <hi>and the</hi> Boſphore <hi>or</hi> Strait <hi>of the</hi> Amazone,
<hi>will command the Entrance into, and Paſſage up that noble River,

                  <p>THE following Relations diſcovering <hi>ſome</hi> of
the richeſt Parts of the World, not yet
planted by the Europeans, and <hi>others</hi> but
little known, worthy the peruſal of the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
can hardly fail of a favourable Reception at this
Juncture; for of all the Bleſſings of Peace, none
appear more charming or profitable than Navigation
and Commerce, eſpecially to the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi>
whoſe Genius is much bent upon Improvements at Sea,
and Plantations abroad, which bring great Riches
into the Kingdom, particularly thoſe in <hi>America,</hi>
where the Spaniards by their ill Conduct have given
Opportunities to ſome of their Neighbours to put in for
a ſhare of the Wealth and Trade of that vaſt Tract
of Land.</p>
                  <p>The frequent Sacking of their Towns and ſeizing
of their Ships by the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi>
put <hi>Philip the Third</hi> upon ſearching out new ways
of tranſporting the Treaſures of <hi>Peru, Chili,</hi> and
<hi>Granada</hi> into <hi>Spain;</hi> to which end (the Coaſts about,
and in the Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> being as well known as
thoſe in <hi>Europe</hi>) Orders were diſpatched from the
Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> to the Governours of <hi>Brazil</hi> and
<hi>Peru</hi> to attempt the Navigation of the great River of
AMAZONS, that if 'twere found practicable,
the <hi>Gold, Silver,</hi> and other Merchandizes of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru</hi>
and the adjacent Countries might be ſafely and
commodiouſly ſent down to <hi>Para</hi> to be put on board
the Galleons, which would lie leſs expos'd there, than
at <hi>Cartagena, Porto Belo,</hi> or <hi>Vera Cruz,</hi> the
Soundings of the Mouth of that River being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and dangerous to Strangers. What Eſſays
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60479:3"/>
were made purſuant to theſe Inſtructions, is beſt ſeen
by the firſt Chapters of the enſuing Relation of <hi>F.
Chr. d' Acugna,</hi> to which the Reader is referr'd,
as the true Journal of the only Voyage upon, and
Diſcovery of that noble River from the Source to the

                     <hi>Chriſtopher d' Acugna</hi> was born at <hi>Burgos</hi> in
<hi>Spain, Anno</hi> 1597. and entred into the Society of
Jeſus at 15 Years of Age. After ſome Years ſpent
in Study, he went into <hi>America,</hi> and was Rector of
the Jeſuits College at <hi>Cuence</hi> under the Juriſdiction
of <hi>Quito,</hi> when <hi>Peter Texeira</hi> the Portuguez Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
came thither from <hi>Para</hi> in <hi>Brazil</hi> up the River of
<hi>Amazons.</hi> The Viceroy of <hi>Peru</hi> ordered our Author
to embark with <hi>Texeira</hi> (who return'd by the ſame
way he came) and to inform himſelf exactly in his
Voyage of every thing that might enable him to give
a ſatisfactory Account of the <hi>Amazone</hi> to the K. of
<hi>Spain.</hi> Accordingly they departed from <hi>Quito Jan.</hi>
16. 1639. and arriv'd at <hi>Para Dec.</hi> 12. following.
Thence he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and preſented to the King

of the Artillery, preſented to <hi>Mazarine</hi> Propoſals for
conquering and planting this great River; but the
<hi>Cardinal</hi> being involv'd in Domeſtick Troubles, was
not at leiſure to puſh on the Enterprize, tho it had been
firſt ſtarted by that eminent Miniſter himſelf. This
Diſcourſe of <hi>Monſieur de Pagan</hi> is extracted for the
moſt part out of <hi>Acugna,</hi> and is a ſort of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
upon him, full of Digreſſions, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the Original it ſelf, which is more uniform
and authentick, containing abundance of remarkable
Obſervations, not mentioned by <hi>Pagan</hi> nor any other
Copiſt whatſoever. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> was once reſolv'd
to plant five ſeveral Colonies; the firſt in the <hi>Iſle of
the Sun,</hi> to guard the beſt Entrance into the Mouth
of the <hi>Amazone;</hi> the ſecond on the <hi>Boſphore</hi> or
<hi>Strait,</hi> to keep the Paſſage; the third on the Points of
the <hi>Rio Negro;</hi> the fourth on the <hi>Zuanes</hi> near the
Golden Mines; the laſt on the Mouth of the <hi>Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
to watch over the Spaniſh Frontiers on that ſide
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:60479:4"/>
of the <hi>Andes:</hi> This was the Plan of his Deſign.
The many Difficulties of entring the Mouth, and
getting into the true Channel of this River of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons,</hi>
have often diſcouraged the <hi>Spaniards,
Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> from attempting to trade in it,
whereas upon Practice and Experience it might prove
as navigable as moſt of the great Rivers of the World,
whoſe Mouths are generally encumbred either with
Sands, Flats, Iſles, or impetuous Currents, which
after a few Trials become familiar. The way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was this. Firſt ſhun the
ſtrong Currents, by paſſing aſide into 2 Degrees of
South Latitude; then ſteer up agen by the Coaſt of
<hi>Brazil</hi> at 30 min. South Lat. double the Point of
<hi>Zaparara,</hi> and ſail to the South-weſt; after that
follow the Coaſt of the Province of <hi>Para,</hi> and paſs
the Channel of the <hi>Iſle of the Sun</hi> at 1 Deg. 15 Min.
South Lat. and 26 Leagues from the main Sea; laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſail Weſtward, leave the ſide of <hi>Para,</hi> and keep
the ſame Latitude to gain the Bank-ſide of <hi>Curupa,</hi>
and there enter into the beſt Road of this River at 2

that famous River, but alſo becauſe
they had very good Reaſons to believe
that it took its Courſe from the Weſt to

that deſcend from the Mountains of <hi>Peru,</hi>
it was a kind of Canal through which
there was a Paſſage from the Southern to
the Northern Sea. Upon theſe Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſome Perſons undertook to go in
ſearch of this River, but to no purpoſe.
Others afterward made the like Eſſay, but
with no better Succeſs. At length in the

Governor of the Province of <hi>Quito</hi> by the

was Governor of <hi>Peru,</hi> put himſelf in an

from thence to paſs on to the Conqueſt of

two hundred Foot and a hundred Horſe,

took a great number of Indian Slaves to

with four hundred Spaniards and four
thouſand Indians. He order'd for the
Subſiſtence of his Men four thouſand
Sheep, Cows, and Swine to be driven

directly Northward, he enter'd into the
Country of the <hi>Quixos,</hi> where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts

out of Quito, and the Difficulties he met

                     <p>THE March of our Adventurers was
retarded, not only by the Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had from the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
who diſputed their Paſſage, but alſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60479:9"/>
by continual Rains and Earthquakes ſo
violent, that many Houſes were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and deep Breaches made in the
Earth before 'em, together with ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Storms and Claps of Thunder, that
any one but <hi>Gonzalles Pizarre</hi> would have
abandon'd ſuch an Enterprize as ſeem'd to
be oppos'd both by Heaven and Earth.
However he with his Men did not give
over their March for all this bad Weather,
but croſs'd the Province of the <hi>Quixos,</hi>
till they came to the foot of ſome high
Mountains all cover'd with Snow, which
make a part of thoſe which the Spaniards
call the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and which bound the
Province of the <hi>Quixos</hi> on the North.
Tho the Rains ſtill continued they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to paſs over the Mountains, but
were not far advanc'd before the Rain
turn'd into a Snow ſo thick and cold, that
many of the Indians were kill'd by it. The
Spaniards were likely to have undergone
the ſame fate, if they had continued their
March as they began: They concluded
that nothing but Expedition could ſave
'em from the Rigor of the Cold, and
therefore left all the Cattle they had with
them, and lighted themſelves of the reſt
of their Proviſions and Baggage, hoping
they ſhould find enough on t'other ſide of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60479:9"/>
the Mountains. When they were got
over them, they enter'd into a Valley call'd
<hi>Zumaque,</hi> which is a hundred Leagues
from <hi>Quito</hi> by the account of good Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers;
there they found abundance of
Proviſions and Refreſhments, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
there two Months to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the Country, and to ſee if
they could make any advantage of it.
But this Place not anſwering the great
hopes they had conceiv'd of their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Pizarre</hi> parted from <hi>Zumaque</hi> with
ſixty good Souldiers to diſcover the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Cannelle;</hi> but in purſuing the Courſe
he had taken towards the North, he
found the way ſo rough and mountainous,
that he was conſtrain'd to change his
Road; he therefore turn'd directly to the
Eaſt, and after ſome few days march, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into that famous Country call'd by

all the Country to put themſelves

oblig'd to encamp himſelf as in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Country: And his Cruelties, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Deſpair he was in of ever
being able to find what he was ſeeking
after, had like to have put an end to his
Enterprize at once. He was encamp'd
on the Bank of a River, which ſwell'd
ſo much in one Night, that if the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
who perceiv'd the Water was apace
getting ground of 'em, had not warn'd
'em of their Danger, they had been all
drown'd; but at the Alarm they gave 'em
they ſoon ſecur'd themſelves by making
towards the Cottages of the wild People,
and <hi>Pizarre</hi> reſolv'd to return to <hi>Zuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi>
not knowing what other courſe to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60479:10"/>
take. From thence he proceeded again
with all his Men, and after a March of
four Leagues, he met with a great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
call'd <hi>Ampua,</hi> govern'd by a <hi>Cacique,</hi>
and found a great number of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
in a poſture of Defence expecting
their Enemy. But there was another and
a greater Obſtacle in his way than this
<hi>Cacique</hi> and all his Troops, and that was
a River ſo wide and deep, that he could
have no thoughts of venturing to ſwim
over it. He could therefore find no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Expedient than to enter into a Treaty
with the People of the Country, and to
deſire the help of their Canoos to croſs
this River. The <hi>Cacique</hi> receiv'd this
Propoſal with great Civility, offer'd 'em
what they ask'd, and gave 'em as many
of thoſe little Boats as they deſir'd, and
<hi>Pizarre</hi> made 'em a return of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
little Spaniſh Toys by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital.
This <hi>Cacique</hi> having receiv'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the ill Treatment many of his
Neighbours had receiv'd from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
thought of nothing more than
how to get rid of them: And to deliver

of ſuch bad Gueſts, endeavour'd to
make 'em believe there were great Riches
to be found among the People that dwelt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60479:11"/>
upon this River ſome days Journey lower.
<hi>Pizarre</hi> both by his Actions, and by the
Mouth of his Guides, who were his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
return'd him Thanks for his
Courteſy: but finding no appearance of
thoſe pretended Riches, he return'd to
<hi>Zumaque,</hi> very much diſſatisfied with his
Expedition. However, he had too much
Courage to return back to <hi>Quito</hi> juſt as
he came; he had a mind therefore to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
ſome great Exploit, and by the
Diſcovery of ſome other <hi>Peru,</hi> to render
himſelf as conſiderable as the Marqueſs
of <hi>Pizarre</hi> his elder Brother: He open'd
his Mind to <hi>Francis Oreillane,</hi> a Gentleman
of <hi>Truxillo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who was come to
join him in the Valley of <hi>Zumaque</hi> with
fifty Troopers well appointed: He very
much encourag'd his Deſign; and tho the
Rainy Seaſon was not yet paſt, that did
not hinder him from advancing forward;
he left his little Army at <hi>Zumaque,</hi> and
having taken a hundred effective Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,

Foreſts and Torrents, ſo that he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated

the Woods with Hatchets, where none had

the Province of <hi>Coca.</hi> The <hi>Cacique</hi> of
which Province came before him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him all the Accommodations the

<hi>Gonzalles</hi> promis'd himſelf much from this
kind Entertainment, and by the Aſſiſtance
of his Guides enter'd into Converſation
with the <hi>Cacique.</hi> He inform'd him that
the Country through which he had paſs'd,
which was ſo full of Mountains, Foreſts
and Brooks, was the only Paſſage he could
have taken to come thither; that it was
extremely difficult to get through it, but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60479:12"/>
that if he were willing to embark on the
River he ſaw before him, or to follow it by
Land, he might aſſure himſelf, that along
the Banks of another River much greater
than this, he ſhould find a Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding

were cover'd with Plates of Gold.
There was no need of ſaying any thing
more to <hi>Pizarre</hi> to incite him to any kind
of Enterprize; who preſently ſent two of
his Guides to <hi>Zumaque</hi> with Orders to his
Officers to come and join him, who march'd
immediately, and ſurmounting all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of the way, arriv'd much fatigued
to the Town of <hi>Coca. Pizarre</hi> having
reſted 'em ſome few days, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
put them in Battalia before the
<hi>Cacique,</hi> who was much terrified at them;
he amaſs'd almoſt all the Proviſions of
his whole Province to make a Preſent of
them to <hi>Pizarre,</hi> that by this Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
he might civilly acquit himſelf of
his new Acquaintance, who was more
impatient of his ſtay than the other; and
the next Morning having filed his Troops
along the River, he took his leave of
the <hi>Cacique,</hi> preſenting him with a fine
Sword, and put himſelf at the head of
his Cavalry, and followed the pleaſant
Courſe of the River. This good way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60479:12"/>
did not laſt long, but they had Rivulets
to ſwim over, muſt go up-hill and down-hill
in uneven ways, and march forty

                     <p>THis long March having mightily
fatigued our Travellers, they were
ſtop'd by a very ſurprizing ſight: The
River was preſs'd by two Rocks, one
on each ſide its Paſſage, at no more than
twenty foot diſtance from one another;
and the Water going through this Strait,
precipitated it ſelf into a Valley, and
made a Leap of two hundred Fathom.
Here it was that <hi>Pizarre</hi> caus'd that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Bridg to be made for his Troops
to paſs over, which is ſo much boaſted
of by the Spaniſh Hiſtorians. But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Way not at all better on the

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60479:13"/>
more and more ſcarce every day, <hi>Pizarre</hi>
reſolv'd to make a Brigantine to carry
by Water all his ſick Men, Proviſions,
Baggage, and a hundred thouſand Livres
in Gold which they had got amongſt
'em. This was no ſmall Difficulty, but
Induſtry and Neceſſity ſurmounted it;
and the Veſſel being finiſhed, <hi>Pizarre</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
all in it that hindred his March,
and gave the Command of it to <hi>Francis
Oreillane</hi> with fifty Souldiers, giving him
expreſs Order not to part far from him,
but to come every Night to the Camp.
He obſerv'd this Order exactly, till his
General ſeeing all his Men were much
pinch'd with Hunger, commanded him
to go and ſeek ſome Proviſions and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
where his Men might be refreſhed.
<hi>Oreillane</hi> had no ſooner receiv'd his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but he launched out into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the River; and the Rapidity of
the Stream carry'd him as faſt as he could
wiſh, for he made above a hundred
Leagues in three days without the uſe of
either Sails or Oars: The Current of
<hi>Coca</hi> carried him into another River
which was much larger, but nothing
near ſo ſwift; he made his Obſervation of
it one whole day, and ſeeing that the
farther he went down, the more the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60479:13"/>
widen'd, he did not doubt but this
was that great River which had been ſo
often and in vain ſought after. The Joy
he conceiv'd at his good Fortune ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

                     <p>TO this end <hi>Oreillane</hi> perſwaded his
Companions that the Country whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were arriv'd, was not the ſame
with that which their General had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
that it had not that great Plenty
the <hi>Cacique</hi> had told him he ſhould find
at the joining of the two Rivers; that
they muſt certainly float along farther
to find that pleaſant and fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60479:14"/>
where they might ſtore themſelves
with Proviſions; and beſides that, they
all ſaw there was no likelihood of getting
up this River again, which indeed they
came down in three days, but, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
could not make the ſame way
back again in the ſpace of a whole Year;
that it was much more reaſonable to wait
for their Company on this new River,
and that in the mean time it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for 'em to go ſeek Proviſions. Thus
concealing his Deſign, he hoiſted up the
Sails, and abandoning himſelf to the
Wind, to his Fortune, and to his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
he thought of nothing but of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the courſe of the River, till he
ſhould diſcover it quite to the Sea. His
Companions were ſtartled at the manner
of his putting in execution the Deſign he
had been propoſing to 'em, and thought
themſelves oblig'd to tell him that he
went beyond the Orders of his General;
and that in the extreme want he was in,
they ought to carry him the little Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
they could find; and that he had
given ſufficient Evidence that he had ſome
ill Deſign, becauſe he had neglected to
leave two Canoos at the Bank of the two
Rivers, as the General had appointed him,
for his Army to paſs over in. Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60479:14"/>
were made to him chiefly by
a Dominican Frier nam'd <hi>Gaſpard de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vajal,</hi>
and by a young Gentleman of
<hi>Badajos</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd <hi>Fernand Sanches
de Vargas.</hi> The Conſideration they had
for theſe two Perſons occaſion'd a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Company in this little Veſſel
into two Parties; and from Words they
were like to have fallen to Blows, but
that <hi>Oreillane</hi> ſtifling their Gratitude by his
Diſſimulation, by fair Proteſtations and
great Promiſes appeas'd this Diſorder.
By means of the Friends he had in the
Veſſel he gain'd moſt of the Souldiers that
were againſt him to his ſide; and ſeeing
the two Heads of the other Party left
almoſt alone, he caus'd <hi>Fernand Sanches de
Vargas</hi> to be ſet aſhore, leaving him quite
alone, without Victuals and without
Arms, in a diſmal Wilderneſs, bounded on
one ſide with high Mountains, and with a
River on the other: He had more Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
than to treat the Frier after the
ſame manner, yet he gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that it was not for him to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
any more into the Pretenſions of his
Commander, unleſs he had a mind to be
ſeverely chaſtis'd: After this he continued
his Voyage; and the next day being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to know if he might depend upon
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60479:15"/>
all that were with him for the ſucceſs
of his Reſolutions, he let 'em know that
he aſpir'd to a much higher pitch of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
than what he might have obtain'd
in the Service of <hi>Pizarre,</hi> that he ow'd
every thing to himſelf and his King; and
that his Fortune having as it were led
him by the hand, to the greateſt and
moſt deſirable Diſcovery that was ever
made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> namely, the great
River upon which they were ſailing,
which coming out of <hi>Peru,</hi> and running
from Weſt to Eaſt, was the fineſt Channel
in the new World, through which one
might paſs from the Northern to the
Southern Sea: that he could not without
betraying them all, and without raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them the Fruits of their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and Induſtry, make others ſhare in a
Favour which Heaven had reſerv'd for
them alone. That as for himſelf, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
was to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> to beg of his
Catholick Majeſty the Government of this

he promis'd them they ſhould be all

him well; that he was not uncapable of the

Poſt he deſign'd to ask of the King, and
that it was certainly due to him for
having made a Diſcovery of the Country.
That as for the Oath he had taken to

he was reſolv'd to be commanded by him
no longer; that he renounc'd the Power he

the Women mix'd themſelves with the
Men in the Battel, and ſeconded them
with admirable Bravery both in ſhooting
of Arrows, and in ſtanding their Ground.
'Twas this that gave occaſion to <hi>Oreillane,</hi>
that he might render his Diſcovery more
conſiderable and glorious, to tell that he
had enter'd into a Country of vaſt Extent
along this River, which was govern'd by
<hi>Amazons,</hi> a ſort of Women who had no
Husbands, who deſtroy'd all their Male-Children;
and who came arm'd at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

However <hi>Oreillane</hi> purſued his Courſe

They receiv'd him with a great deal of

His Diſpatches were ſoon given, but the

whoſe Mind was vain enough to receive
that Title which became him ſo little: But
he did not enjoy it long; for thoſe very

King, gave him his Death's Wound too,
and <hi>Daguirre</hi> ſucceeded him, who made

Riches of thoſe great Kingdoms. His
Reign was ſo bloody and barbarous, that
the like Tyranny was ſcarce ever heard of
in the World: Therefore the Spaniards to
this day call him the Tyrant. However
he commanded <hi>Orſua</hi>'s Veſſels, and went
down the River <hi>Coca</hi> into the <hi>Amazone,</hi>
hoping to obtain one of thoſe Kingdoms,
and to make a conſiderable Progreſs into it.
But having enter'd the <hi>Amazone,</hi> he was
not able to maſter the Current of it, and
ſo was conſtrained to ſuffer himſelf to be
carried down to the Mouth of a River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

the great Channel which goes to the

committed unheard-of Barbarities. He
kill'd all that oppos'd him, and paſt from

and all the Provinces along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Venezuella</hi> and <hi>Baccho.</hi> He then came
to St. <hi>Martha,</hi> where he put all to the
Sword, and enter'd the new Kingdom of
<hi>Grenada,</hi> deſigning to march from thence
through <hi>Quito</hi> into <hi>Peru.</hi> In this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he was forc'd to a Battel, in which he
was utterly defeated, and put to flight, but
all Ways being ſtop'd, he found he muſt

                     <p>He had a Daughter by his Wife <hi>Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>

is it of the moſt agreeable Temperature,

met with from the Inhabitants, ſome of
them gave over the Attempt, and return'd
to <hi>Quito,</hi> but others were more reſolute,
and continued with Captain <hi>de Palacios,</hi>
together with ſome few Souldiers that were
always faithful to him: But theſe being
almoſt all deſtroy'd in ſeveral Battels, in
one of which at laſt the Captain himſelf
was kill'd, the Monks made their Eſcape as
well as they could, and the two Lay-Friers
we have ſpoken of, one of whom was <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minic

                     <p>It pleas'd God ſo to favour their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
that after they had been carried from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60479:24"/>
Province to Province upon this great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they happily landed at <hi>Para,</hi> a City

<hi>Portuguez</hi> poſſeſs it, and have made it a
good Gariſon, belonging to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Maragnon.</hi> The two Lay-Friers
and the Souldiers were inquir'd of about
their long and ſtrange Voyage, but they
were all eight of 'em ſo ſtupid, that they
had made no particular Remark on any
thing; only they ſaid they had paſs'd
through divers Provinces of different Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
who eat the Men which they
take in War. The two <hi>Cordeliers</hi> offer'd
to return to the place from whence they
came, provided they might have a Veſſel
and Men granted 'em to conduct 'em,
hoping they ſhould again find the ſame
Paſſages of the Rivers by which they came
down, and ſo get back again as far as
<hi>Quito.</hi> They were brought from <hi>Para</hi> to
the City of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Maragnon, James
Raimond de Norogna</hi> being then Governor
of that Place, who having a Zeal for the
Service of God, as well as that of the
King, was willing to examin theſe Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
Friers more particularly than had been
done at <hi>Para.</hi> He diſcours'd 'em with ſo
much Patience and Sweetneſs, that he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60479:24"/>
made 'em talk reaſonably: They told him
they went from <hi>Peru,</hi> that their Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was in the City of <hi>Quito;</hi> that they
came out with many of their Brethren to
labour to convert the wild People, but
that the Indians had a greater mind to eat
'em, than to hear 'em preach; that their
Captain being dead, and their Brethren put
to flight, they with ſix Souldiers had put
themſelves into a Bark which miraculouſly
came aſhore at <hi>Para;</hi> and that they were
ready to return to <hi>Peru,</hi> if they could meet
with a convenient Paſſage. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

Indians were weary of their Labour, and
quitting their Oars, began to murmur, and
make loud Complaints that they had been
engag'd in ſo tedious a Voyage. 'Twas in

'em, and finding he put 'em off from day

that were fled back to be purſu'd, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
with all imaginable Mildneſs to
hinder others from following their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
To this end he treated the Indians
that remain'd with very kind Words, and
ſo extremely pleas'd 'em with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that thoſe that heard him convey'd
it from one Canoo to another with thoſe
external Demonſtrations of Joy and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,

from all the Canoos, that they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

and that they would never leave him. The
General having given 'em his Thanks for
their goodwill, caus'd ſome Brandy to be
diſtributed through all the Canoos, aſſuring
'em they would in a little time arrive at
the Place deſign'd. And not content in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60479:26"/>
having ſpread this Report among 'em, to
fix the Indians the more firmly in their
Reſolution, he thought it neceſſary to do
ſomewhat that might ſtill make a greater
appearance for their Encouragement. To
this purpoſe he viſited all the Canoos, and
choſe out eight of the beſt of 'em, which
he loaded with Proviſion, Souldiers and
Rowers. He made Colonel <hi>Benedito Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driguez
d'Olivera,</hi> a Native of <hi>Brazil,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of this Squadron; and having
communicated his Deſign to him, ſent him
away with a Charge to ſend him often ſuch
News as might be moſt agreeable to the
Indians. <hi>Olivera</hi> was no ordinary Man,
he had naturally a quick and piercing Wit;
and having been all his Life brought up
with the Indians, he had ſo well ſtudied
their Actions and Countenances, that they
could hardly diſſemble ſo well, but he could
with one caſt of his Eye diſcover what was
in their Minds; ſo that they look'd upon
him as a Man that could divine what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thought; and from this Conceit they
had not only a great Veneration for him,
but ſtood ſo much in awe of him, that
they yielded him a blind Obedience in what
he commanded 'em. It is not to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
after this, whether thoſe in the eight
Canoos which he was to command were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60479:27"/>
very willing to go with him. His Men
were ſo induſtrious one while at their Oars,

Indians that wear their Hair as long as

deſirous to refreſh his Troops in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
finding it to be a very fine, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

pitch'd his Camp in the Angle of Land
which was form'd by the two Rivers, and
having well intrench'd it towards the
Plain, he there plac'd his Portuguez and
Indians, and made Captain <hi>Peter Dacoſta
Favotta,</hi> and Captain <hi>Peter Bajou</hi> the chief
Commanders over 'em. Theſe two wiſe
and valiant Officers gave their General the
greateſt Proofs imaginable both of their
Conduct and Fidelity. They continued
encamp'd in this place for eleven Months,
in which time they endur'd extraordinary
Inconveniences, for they were often oblig'd
to fight with theſe long-hair'd Men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a little Food to live upon; and many
of the Souldiers fell ſick, partly by the
bad Diſpoſition of the Air, which could
not be wholſome between two Rivers,

                     <p>Many Perſons, zealous for the Service of

to have a ſhare in ſo great an Enterprize;

Knight of the Order of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> and

Lieutenant to the Captain General of the
Vice-roy of <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Corregidor</hi> of <hi>Quito,</hi>
offer'd himſelf to go on this Expedition.
The Reſpect he bare to his Prince made
him ſeek this new occaſion of ſerving him
with the ſame Affection he had done for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fifty Years himſelf, and his Anceſtors
all their days on the like occaſions. He
deſir'd of the Vice-roy that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to furniſh the Ammunition and
Equipage for this Adventure at his own
proper Charge, without pretending to any
other Intereſt in the matter, than that of
ſeeing his Maſter well ſerv'd. But the
Vice-roy not knowing how to ſpare him
from the Poſt he was already in, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
commended his Zeal for his King, and
the Greatneſs of his Offers, engag'd him to
continue in his preſent Station; and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
him, nominated his Brother Father
<hi>Chriſtopher d'Acugna</hi> in his place, who was
animated with no leſs degree of Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Jeſuits to make this Voyage with him, that
they might take exact notice of every thing
worthy of Obſervation on this great River,
and carry the Relation of it into <hi>Spain</hi> to
his Catholick Majeſty, ſignified their Mind
to the Provincial of the Jeſuits, which at
that time was Father <hi>Francis de Fuentes,</hi>
who taking it for a great Honour, that ſo
much Confidence ſhould be put in the
Members of his Community as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

the Nomination that had been made of
Father <hi>Chriſtopher D'Acugna,</hi> tho he was
Rector of the Jeſuits College at <hi>Cuence</hi>

him Father <hi>Andrew Dartieda,</hi> Profeſſor of
Divinity in the ſame College, for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Theſe two Jeſuits receiv'd their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60479:31"/>

that they ſhould go without delay with
the Captain Major <hi>Peter de Texeira,</hi> and
that after they were arriv'd at <hi>Para</hi> they

Account of all they ſhould obſerve in their

the Orders they had receiv'd, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſet forward on the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>January</hi>
1639, to begin a Voyage that laſted ten
Months before they arriv'd at <hi>Para,</hi> where
they enter'd into Port the twelfth day of
<hi>December</hi> in the ſame Year. As they left
<hi>Quito,</hi> they took the way of thoſe high
Mountains on foot, from which that great
River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> derives its Sources,
a River which has nothing in its riſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it excels other Rivers, but is ſo very
much augmented in its Courſe, that the
Mouth of it is eighty four Leagues in
breadth. Theſe Jeſuits took all the care
they could, and labour'd with all poſſible
Accuracy to obſerve every thing that was
worth a Remark; they took the Latitudes
in every place of the River where they
could do it; they took an account of the
Names of all the Rivers that run into it,
and of all the Nations that inhabit the
Borders of it: They took notice of the

all the Borders of that great River would

Original: and as there have heretofore been
great Conteſts between eminent Cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Birth of divers Hero's of former
Ages; ſo there is no leſs Emulation among
the Provinces of <hi>Peru,</hi> which of them
ſhould be the Mother of this great River,
becauſe the true Source of it is unknown
to this day. The City of <hi>Lima,</hi> as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
and as potent as it is, boaſts that
ſhe has the Mountains of <hi>Ganneo</hi> and the
<hi>Cavaliers</hi> within her Juriſdiction, and the
Fountain-head of the <hi>Amazone</hi> ſeventy
Leagues above her: But this is not the
Source of it, but of another River that
runs into the <hi>Amazone.</hi> Others maintain
that the Source of this great River pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Mountains of <hi>Moida</hi> in
the new Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and is
call'd the River <hi>Caquetta:</hi> but they are
miſtaken too, and confound the matter;
for the <hi>Caquetta</hi> and the <hi>Amazone</hi> run ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately
above ſeven hundred Leagues,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60479:33"/>
and when they come near together, the
<hi>Caquetta</hi> ſeems to turn its Courſe, and
running on the ſide of the <hi>Amazone</hi> at a
conſiderable diſtance, thus continues it,
till having at length pierced through
the Province of <hi>Agnos,</hi> it comes to add
its Waters to that vaſt River. But in

                     <p>But the truth of this matter is, that the
City of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Quito,</hi>
has the ſole Glory of producing this great
Wonder of the World. Eight Leagues
from this City is found the true Source of
this River beyond thoſe vaſt Mountains
that divide the Juriſdiction of this City
from that of the <hi>Quixos,</hi> at the foot of two
great Rocks, one of which is call'd <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana,</hi>
and the other <hi>Pulca,</hi> which ſtand
at near two Leagues diſtance one from

is a great Lake, and in the midſt of this

which is very deep and large: 'Tis from

proceeds in a winding Courſe, and by its

This Strait is three hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Defence, and ſtop the Enemy's Paſſage.
The Depth of this River is in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſo great, that no Bottom is to be found:
from the Mouth of it, to the River <hi>Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negro,</hi>
which is near 600 Leagues, there's

But at its Beginning it has Water enough
to carry the largeſt Veſſels: For tho the

without fail there riſe certain Eaſtern
Breezes, that continue three or four Hours

Sizes, and in ſo great number, that
they are not to be counted, many of them
being very near one to another. There are
ſome four or five, others ten, and others
20 Leagues in compaſs. That which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by the <hi>Toupinambi,</hi> of whom we
ſhall ſpeak hereafter, is above 100 Leagues
about: There are a great many very ſmall
Iſlands, which the Inhabitants of the
Country uſe only to ſow their Seed in;
but all of theſe, and the greateſt part of
the large ones, are overflowed by the River
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60479:35"/>
every Year; and theſe regular Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do ſo enrich them with the Slime and
Mud it carries along with it, that they
would never become barren, tho they
ſhould be every year ſown with <hi>Yu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
or <hi>Magnioca,</hi> which are a ſort of
Roots, which ſerve the Natives inſtead
of Bread, and with which the Earth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
them in great abundance.</p>
                     <p>Tho theſe frequent Inundations ſeem to
be attended with great Inconveniences;
yet the Author of Nature has taught theſe
Barbarians to make a good Improvement
of them. Before theſe Floods come, they
gather in all their <hi>Yuca,</hi> of which Root
they make a ſort of Bread called <hi>Caſſave,</hi>
which is ordinarily uſed in all the Coaſts
of <hi>Brazil,</hi> and in many other Places both
of the Continent and Iſlands of <hi>America.</hi>
They make great Caves in the Ground,
wherein they put theſe Roots; and having
well ſtopp'd them up with Earth, leave
'em there as long as the Flood laſts: this is
an infallible way of preſerving thoſe Roots
which otherwiſe would be ſubject to rot
with the exceſſive moiſture of the Ground.
When the Waters are run off, they open
theſe Caves, and take out their Roots,
and eat them, without finding them at all
the worſe for lying in the Earth. Thus as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60479:36"/>
Nature has taught the Ant to ſtore up
Food enough to nouriſh her all the Year,
no wonder ſhe has taught the Indians,

                     <p>THe Roots of Yuca we have been
ſpeaking of, ſerve theſe People for
Bread, which they eat with their other
Food; beſides this they make a Drink of it,
which they all generally eſteem as the moſt
delicious and excellent Liquor in the World.
To make the Bread, they ſqueeze out all
the Juice of the Root, and then beat and
pound it, till 'tis become a kind of Meal,
of which they make great Cakes, and
bake them in an Oven; this they call <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſave,</hi>
which has a very pleaſant Taſte
when 'tis new, but after one day becomes
very dry, ſo that it may be kept ſeveral
Months; they ordinarily put it on the tops
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60479:36"/>
of their Huts, that it may keep the more
dry. And when they have a mind to make
their Drink, they take theſe dry Cakes, and
temper them in Water, which they boil
as long as they think ſufficient, over a
gentle Fire: This Paſte boil'd thus in
Water, makes a Drink ſo ſtrong by its great
Fermentation, that it fuddles 'em like our
Wine. They uſe this Drink at all their
Aſſemblies and Entertainments, as when
they inter their Dead, when they receive
any Gueſts, when they celebrate their
Feaſts, at their Seed-time, and Harveſt;
in a word, at all times when they meet,
this Liquor is the Spirit that animates 'em,
and the Charm that holds 'em together.
They make beſides this, another ſort of
Drink, with a great deal of wild Fruit,
of which they have extraordinary plenty;
this they peel, and put in Water, with
which when it is well mix'd, it ſoon by
Fermentation acquires ſuch a Savour and
Strength, that it often has a more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reliſh than Beer, which is ſo much
in uſe in many Nations. They keep theſe
Liquors in great Earthen Veſſels, as they
do in <hi>Spain,</hi> or in leſſer ones, which they
make of the Trunk of a hollow Tree;
or elſe in Baskets made of Ruſhes, which
they cover within and without with a ſort
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60479:37"/>
of Pitch, ſo that they don't leak in the
leaſt. This Bread and Drink are not the
only Proviſions they live upon; they have
many other ſorts of Food in uſe amongſt
'em, beſides Fruit of various kinds, as
Bonanes, Ananas, Gouyaves, Amos, and
a ſort of very pleaſant Cheſnuts, which
at <hi>Peru</hi> they call <hi>Almandras de la Sierra,</hi> that
is Mountain-Almonds; but the Truth is,
they are rather of the Figure of a Cheſnut
than of an Almond, becauſe they grow
in Hulls that are briſtly, like thoſe of
our Cheſnuts: They have Palms of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinds, Coco-Nuts, and Dates that
are very well taſted, tho they are wild,
and many other ſorts of Fruit, that are
produced only in hot Countries. They
have likewiſe divers kinds of Roots, that
are good Food, as Batates, Yuca, Menſa,
which the Portuguez call <hi>Machachora,</hi>

                     <p>FIſh is ſo common with 'em, that when
any one offers it to 'em, they prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially
ſay, E'ne put it in your own Diſh.
There is ſo great a number of 'em in the
River, that without any other Nets than
their Hands, they can take as many as they
pleaſe. But the <hi>Pege Buey</hi> is as it were
the King of all the Fiſh that ſwim in
the River <hi>Amazone,</hi> from its Source till it
diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea. 'Tis not
to be imagin'd what a delicious Taſte this
Fiſh has, any one that eats it would think
it to be moſt excellent Fleſh well ſeaſon'd:
This Fiſh is as big as a Heifer of a Year
and a half old, it has a Head and Ears juſt
like thoſe of a Heifer, and the Body of it
is all cover'd with Hair, like the Briſtles
of a white Hog; it ſwims with two little
Arms, and under its Belly it has Teats
with which it ſuckles its young Ones: The
Skin of it is very thick, and when 'tis
dreſs'd into Leather it ſerves to make Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
that are Proof againſt a Muſquet Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.
This Fiſh feeds upon Graſs on the
Bank of the River, like an Ox, from which
it receives ſo good Nouriſhment, and is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60479:38"/>
of ſo pleaſant a Taſte, that a Man is more
ſtrengthen'd and better ſatisfied in eating a
ſmall quantity of it, than in eating twice as
much Mutton: This Fiſh has not free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration
in the Water, and therefore often
thruſts out its Snout to take Breath, and is
by this means diſcover'd to them that ſeek
after it. When the Indians get the ſight of
it, they follow it with their Oars in little
Canoos; and when it appears above Water
to get Breath, they throw at it their ſort of
Harping-Irons made of Shells, with which
they ſtop its courſe, and take it: when they
have kill'd it, they cut it into good pieces,
and broil it upon Wooden Grates, which
they call <hi>Boucan;</hi> and being thus dreſs'd,
'twill keep good above a Month: They
have not the way of ſalting and drying it
to keep a great while, becauſe they have
no great quantity of Salt, and that which
they uſe to ſeaſon their Meat is very rare

                     <head type="sub">The Means the Indians uſe to preſerve their
Fiſh in thoſe Seaſons wherein they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fiſh nor hunt.</head>
                     <p>THO the Indians don't know how
to keep their broil'd Fiſh very long,
yet they ſuſtain no great damage by it,
becauſe Nature has given them Induſtry
enough to get freſh Meat all their Winter,
which is the time of the Rains, during
which they can neither hunt nor fiſh. For
this purpoſe they make choice of ſome fit
places where the Floods can never come,
and there they dig a kind of a Pond of a
moderate depth, to hold a good quantity
of Water, which they incloſe round with
a Paliſado of Stakes; they bring Water
into theſe Ponds, and keep 'em always
full, that they may uſe 'em as Reſervers
for their Winter Proviſions. At the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
when the Tortoiſes come aſhore to
lay their Eggs, the Indians go to lie in
Ambuſh in the places where they know
they ordinarily come; and when they ſee
a ſufficient number upon the ſhore, they
go and turn 'em upon their Backs, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
'em from retreating; and when they
have thus ſecur'd 'em, they begin at their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60479:39"/>
leiſure to carry 'em to their Reſervers:
for this end, when they are at any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
diſtance from their Huts, they
ſtring all their Tortoiſes together with
great Cords through holes that they make
on the top of their Shells, and turning 'em
upon their Feet lead 'em to the Water,
where they tie 'em to their Canoos, and ſo
make 'em follow them home: when they
are got home, they put 'em in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers,
and unlooſe 'em, feeding 'em with
the Leaves and Branches of Trees which
they throw into them, and take 'em out
to ſpend as they want 'em. One of theſe
Tortoiſes is enough to feed a numerous
Family ſome time; ſo that 'tis not to be
wonder'd at, that theſe Indians are never
reduc'd to Scarcity, ſeeing they make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of ſo great a number of Tortoiſes,
having commonly above a hundred in each
Reſerver; ſo that the proportion they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for each Perſon in their Families is
enough to maintain ſeveral People. Theſe
Tortoiſes are as large as thoſe Targets
Souldiers formerly us'd to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
withal, and their Fleſh is as good as
that of a Heifer. At the time of their
laying, ſome Females are found with two
or three hundred Eggs in their Belly big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than thoſe of Pullets, and as good, tho
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60479:39"/>
not of ſo eaſy Digeſtion. At one Seaſon
of the Year they are ſo fat, that a good
Barrel of Fat may be taken out of 'em,
which is as good as Butter, and being
ſalted a little, taſtes extraordinary well, and
keeps very well too; this will not only
ſerve to fry Fiſh, but is likewiſe as good
for Sauces as the beſt Butter in the World:
ſo that theſe Barbarians have no abſolute
need of our Commodities, but make as
good Proviſion for their Neceſſities, as the
moſt civiliz'd Nations in the World can do.
'Tis not amiſs further to remark two things
in reſpect of theſe Tortoiſes; one is, that
after they have made a Hole in the Sand
above the Bounds of the higheſt Tides,
they lay all their Eggs at a time, one after
another, after which they carefully cover
them up with the ſame Sand they have
digged up to make their Neſt, ſo that 'tis
impoſſible for any to diſcover the place of
it. Then they return backwards into the
Water, to prevent the notice of their true
Track, and never come aſhore again till
the next Year, leaving their Eggs to be
hatch'd by the Heat of the Sun, which is
always accompliſh'd in forty days; after
which the young ones are ſeen to creep
out of the Sand, being about the bigneſs
of a Crown, and thus in a train, like Ants,
they make to the Water. The other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60479:40"/>
is, that the Sea-men bone 'em, and
ſalt them, and ſo carry 'em into all the
Colonies of the <hi>Antego</hi> Iſlands, a Trade
in which many Captains and Merchants
have found their Account.</p>

                     <p>THE Indians of this happy River
make this prudent Proviſion I have
been ſpeaking of, for a Seaſon wherein
they ſeem to want every thing; but their
Winter being paſt, their Fears are carried
away with it, and they have plenty of all
things; ſo that they never take care for the
Morrow: and becauſe they don't think
of wanting any thing the enſuing day,
they make no other Proviſion for it, than in
feeding themſelves well to day, that they
may be the ſtronger and more ready in
ſeeking their Food to morrow. They have
all imaginable Dexterity in catching all
ſorts of Fiſh that are in this River, and
have as many ways for it as there is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Seaſons. When the Inundations
diminiſh, and leave Lakes in the lower
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60479:40"/>
parts of the Lands that have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd,
they have a very pleaſant Trick
to take the Fiſh that are left in thoſe
places: They ſtrike the Water with two
or three flat Sticks, with the noiſe of
which the Fiſh are no ſooner ſtunn'd, but
they come up to the top of the Water, as
if they were dead, and ſuffer themſelves to
be taken up with the hand: Not that it is
the Noiſe that produces this Effect, but
the Quality of the Wood, which makes
the Fiſh drunk. The <hi>Galibis</hi> who are the
Natives of <hi>Cayen,</hi> and of one part of <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
make uſe of it, and call it <hi>Inecou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the moſt common way of fiſhing
which they uſe at all times, and on all
occaſions, is with an Arrow which they
dart with one hand from a ſmooth little
Board which they hold in t'other. This
Arrow having pierc'd the Fiſh, ſerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of a Cork to ſhew which way it
moves when it is wounded; they purſue
it in their Canoos, and getting hold of
the end of the Arrow they draw up the
Fiſh with it: they catch all ſorts of Fiſh
after this manner, neither ſmall nor great
can eſcape their Weapons. And there are
ſo many ſorts of 'em in this River, and all
of 'em ſo excellent, that it would be too
tedious a buſineſs to give an ample De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of 'em. There is one amongſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60479:41"/>
the reſt which the Indians call <hi>Paraque,</hi>
which reſembles a great Eel, or rather a
ſmall Conger, which has a very ſtrange
Property; for if a Man takes it in his
Hand while 'tis alive, immediately a Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Shivering ſeizes him, as if he
were taken with a fit of an Ague; but the
ſhaking preſently ceaſes upon letting it go
out of his Hand again.</p>

and Shape, the Fleſh of which is as good

more faint and wateriſh Taſte: They have
likewiſe a ſort of Hogs in the Mountains,
that are neither of our domeſtick, nor of
our wild kind of Swine, but of a particular
Species, which have a ſort of Vent upon
their Backs, like a Navel. All the <hi>Weſt

Their Fleſh is very good and wholſome,
and at leaſt may compare with that of the
wild Swine that are taken in ſome Foreſts

ſort reſembling our Domeſtick Hogs: they

to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and are as good

They have alſo Partridges, and tame
Poultry like ours, which have been

from one to another have been ſpread
throughout the Coaſts of the River of

'em: We often had experience of it in

                     <p>ALL along this River, and in all the

ſo temperate, and the Seaſons of the

proceed from the different Courſe of the

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60479:42"/>
always riſes and ſets at the ſame hour.
That which moſt incommodes 'em is the
frequency of the Inundations, which leave
a great Dampneſs in the Ground, and by
their overflowing the Plains, hinder 'em
ſeveral Months from ſowing and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Fruits of the Earth. By theſe
Floods they diſtinguiſh the Winter from

happen twice a Year all along
the whole Extent of this River.</p>
                     <p>We have obſerv'd, that thoſe who dwell
near the Mountains of <hi>Quito,</hi> ſuffer more
Heat than thoſe that inhabit along this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

there come Breezes from the Coaſt
of the Northern Sea, that continue two,
three or four hours in a day, and ſometimes
more; theſe Winds extreamly refreſh the
Air, and are a great Comfort to thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                     <p>However, it muſt be ſaid that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60479:43"/>
themſelves, is no greater than is at

by the gentle Winds, which blow
every day, and not only render the Air to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
and agreeable to the Inhabitants,
but have beſides the Property of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their Victuals and Stores from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting.
I have had the Experience of it
my ſelf in the Wafers we carried with us,
which at the end of five Months and a
half ſince we parted from <hi>Quito,</hi> were as
good as if they had been newly made.
This made me and my Companion won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the more, becauſe in our Travels in

that Bread and other things of the

                     <p>And tho all this long ſtretch of Land is
ſo near the Equinoctial Line, yet the Heat
of the Sun is not at all hurtful, nor the
Evening Air neither, tho it be very cool
and moiſt. I have good reaſon to teſtify
this, for during our whole Voyage I have
commonly paſs'd whole Nights in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Air, without getting the leaſt Pain in
my Head, or the leaſt Defluxion of Rhume;
and yet in all other Places, the leaſt walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad in a Moon-ſhiny Night, has
very much incommoded me. 'Tis true,
at the beginning of our Voyage, almoſt all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60479:43"/>
of our Men that came from cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
had Agues, but were all cur'd by

felt, nor heard of any ſuch bad Air along

that how much ſoever ſhould be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

                     <p>The ſecond thing is the <hi>Coco-tree,</hi>
which ſerves for the Compoſition of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colat;
with theſe the Banks of the River
are covered, and throughout our whole

elſe to make Huts of for our Camp. This

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60479:46"/>
throughout all <hi>New Spain,</hi> and in all other

it may eaſily be ſuppos'd there's no need of
great labour to cultivate theſe Trees along

Aſſiſtance of Husbandry and Art, makes
'em bring forth Fruit in ſo great abundance.</p>
                     <p>The third is <hi>Tobacco,</hi> of which there

does not at all ſerve to keep 'em in Amity

theſe Gods came down from Heaven on
purpoſe to dwell with them, and to ſhew
them Kindneſs. They don't ſignify their

Ceremonies, but on the contray, ſeem to
have forgotten 'em as ſoon as they have
made 'em, and putting them in a Caſe let
'em lie, without taking any notice of 'em
ſo long as they imagine they have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

ready to march out to War, they ſet up the
Idol in which they have plac'd the hopes

take that Idol with 'em to which they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60479:53"/>
yet they have not ſo much Faith in any of

that there may poſſibly be a God who is
greater and more powerful than theſe. I
made this Judgment upon what paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and one of theſe Savage People,
who yet ſhew'd nothing in his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ſavour'd of a barbarous Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This Indian had heard ſome of our
Men ſpeak of the Almighty Power of
God; and conſidering what he had ſeen
with his own Eyes, that our Army had
navigated this great River throughout its
whole Courſe, and after having paſs'd
through ſo many different Warlike Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was return'd without having receiv'd
the leaſt Damage or Prejudice from any of
'em, he thought this could not be, unleſs
the Aſſiſtance and Power of God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
us: upon this Imagination he came
to meet us, and with a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and diſquiet of Mind ſignified to us,
that for all the kind Entertainment he had
given us, he deſir'd no other Recompence
but that we would leave him one of our
Gods, ſeeing they were ſo good and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
that ſo he might take him and his
Vaſſals into his Protection, that he might
make 'em live in Peace and Health, and
continually give 'em whatever they ſtood
in need of for their Preſervation. Our Men
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60479:54"/>
did not fail to promiſe him whatever he
deſir'd, and would fain have ſet up the
Standard of the Croſs in his Village for a
certain Mark. This is a Cuſtom the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez
have introduc'd throughout all
places where Idols are worſhip'd; I know
not whether they do it from a true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Zeal, as the Action it ſelf ſeems to
ſignify, for there is a great deal of reaſon
to doubt that they ſet up the ſacred Sign
of the Croſs only for a ſpecious Pretext to
make Slaves of the poor Indians, whom
they carry away from their very Houſes,
either for their own Service, or to ſell 'em
to others; which gave me an extreme Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for theſe People who don't ſeem
unteachable, and might be more eaſily
brought to the Knowledg of the true God
by a courteous and gentle Carriage, than
by all the Rigor that can be us'd upon 'em.
What I have ſaid is certainly true, that
when the Portuguez have been kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and well treated by theſe honeſt and
charitable Indians, they in return to all
their Hoſpitality only leave 'em the Sign
of the Croſs, which they ſet up in the
moſt eminent place of their Habitations,
commanding 'em to keep this holy Sign
with ſo great Care that it may never be
defac'd; and after this when this Croſs
happens either to be thrown down by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60479:54"/>
Injuries of the Weather, or to be worn
out, or it may be to be maliciouſly broken
in pieces by ſome of thoſe Idolatrous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
who bear no reſpect to it, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez
never fail to condemn 'em all as
guilty of the Profanation of the Croſs,
and as ſuch, declare both them and all
their Children and Childrens Children
perpetual Slaves. This was the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that ingag'd me to forbid the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez

beſides, I was not willing that this

have any occaſion to believe that our God
was a piece of Wood, and that this had
the Power and Divinity of him that ſav'd
us on the Croſs, for fear of confirming him
in Idolatry. I therefore comforted him the
beſt I could, and told him the God we
worſhip'd would be always with him, and
advis'd him to pray to him for whatever
he wanted, and to put his Truſt intirely
in him, telling him I believ'd he would
one day favour him with the Knowledg of
the true Religion. By this it appears that
this Indian did not believe his Idols were
powerful Gods, ſeeing he was ſo ready to
forſake 'em to worſhip a greater Deity, if
we would have given him one.</p>

to underſtand that his Sentiments
were not different from thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which we have been relating. This
Indian who had more Knowledg, but leſs
Honeſty than the other, knowing that
there was no Divinity, nor any Power in
his Idols, ſet up himſelf for the God of all
his Country. We receiv'd Information of
this ſome Leagues before we arriv'd at the
place where he dwelt, and ſent him word
that we were coming to bring him Tidings
of the true God, who was much more
powerful than he could pretend to be, and
entreated him not to retire from his Houſe,
but to wait for our Arrival. He did ſo,
and we had ſcarce ſet our Feet to Land on
the ſhore of this Country, but he came to
us big with Curioſity to enquire what
News we could tell him of that God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
whom we had ſent ſuch a Meſſage to
him. I held a long Diſcourſe with him, to
inform him what God was; but becauſe
he would needs ſee with his own Eyes the
God that I preach'd to him, I was forc'd
to leave him in his own Blindneſs: He told
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60479:55"/>
me himſelf was God, and begotten by the
Sun; affirming that his Soul went every
Night into Heaven to give Orders for the
ſucceeding Day, and to regulate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Univerſe; ſuch was the
Inſolence and Pride of this Savage Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>Another of 'em ſhew'd himſelf much
more reaſonable; for when I was enquiring
of him how it came to paſs, that ſeeing his
Companions retir'd into the Mountains at
the approach of our Fleet, he alone with
a few of his Relations durſt come near us,
and expoſe themſelves to lie at our Mercy
without fear. He anſwer'd that he had
conſider'd that ſuch Men as had once got
up that River in ſpight of ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and were return'd in like manner
without receiving any harm, could be no
leſs than the Lords of this great River, and
would be ſure frequently to return to bring
it into Subjection, and to people it with
new Inhabitants; and the caſe being thus,
he was not willing to live always in fear
and dread in his Houſe, but choſe rather
to render himſelf to 'em in time, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to acknowledg them for his Maſters

how much Eſteem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Reſpect all
theſe Nations bear to thoſe Wizards they
have among 'em, which proceeds not ſo
much from the Love they have for 'em, as
from the continual Fear they live in of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
ſome Miſchief or other from their
Hands. There is a certain Houſe devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the uſe of theſe Sorcerers, in which
they perform their ſuperſtitious Exerciſes,
and converſe with the Devil, (a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing with 'em in this Place) which
ſerves for no other purpoſe. They alſo
keep the dead Bones of theſe Sorcerers
with as much Veneration as if they were
the Reliques of Saints: when they have
put their Bones altogether, they hang 'em
in the Air in the ſame Cotton Beds thoſe
Wizards us'd to lie in while alive. Theſe
are their Maſters, their Preachers, their
Counſellors, and their Guides: They
have recourſe to them in their Doubts to
obtain the Reſolution of 'em; and when
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60479:56"/>
they are in the greateſt Rage againſt their
Enemies, they apply themſelves to theſe
Conjurers for poiſonous Herbs, by which
they execute their Revenge upon 'em.</p>
                     <p>For the Burial of their Dead there are
different Ceremonies among 'em; for
ſome keep 'em in their own Houſes, that
by having 'em always before their Eyes,
they may (as they pretend) on all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be put in mind of Death: But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if they did it for this intention, one
would think they ſhould keep the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of their Dead in better order than
they do. Others burn their Carcaſes in
great Pits, and with them all the deceaſed
Party poſſeſs'd when alive: But in ſhort,
they all, one as well as another, celebrate
their Funerals for many Days together,
with continual Mourning and Weeping,
which they only interrupt with Drinking,
and that they do even to the Exceſs of
Drunkenneſs.</p>

We had ſufficient Opportunity
of knowing this by the Commerce we had
with many of them: For they preſently
had ſuch a good Opinion of us, that they
did not make the leaſt difficulty of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

our Hands. Some of them continued
with us a conſiderable time, eating and

been an Eye-witneſs of it; and having
been ſent by one of the greateſt Monarchs

Obſervations on every thing upon
this great River, it may be I am more
capable than another to give an account of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60479:58"/>
what was given me in charge. I ſhall ſay
nothing of the principal Mouth of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it has long ſince been known by all that ſail
into <hi>America;</hi> it is well known that it lies

Mouth of our River by which the Tyrant
<hi>Lopez Daguyrre</hi> invaded the Iſland of
<hi>La Trinidada;</hi> becauſe I never ſaw it, and
thoſe that have been there have told me
there is no direct Entrance into the River
of <hi>Amazons</hi> by the Mouth, it being the
Mouth of another River that has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with the <hi>Amazone</hi> by ſeveral
Arms, which from one ſpace to another
extend themſelves far from it, and enter
into the Sea with this other River. My
Intention is only to give the Inhabitants

of the Paſſages they have to the
River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> or rather of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

by many Rivers and Rivulets both on the

fall into the <hi>Amazone.</hi> But becauſe
'tis not certainly known from what Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

to fall into this River (which may

This River is very famous in the
Countrey for the Numbers of Indians
that inhabit the Banks of it. It has a
great many Arms that extend themſelves
into very remote Provinces, and return
to join themſelves to that Body from which
they ſeparated from a great multitude of
Iſlands, that are all inhabited by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of wild People. This Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
continually takes its Courſe parallel
with the <hi>Amazone,</hi> always running along
by it, tho at a conſiderable diſtance, and
from one Place to another ſending Arms
of Water towards it, big enough to be
taken each of 'em for whole Rivers; at
laſt gathering it ſelf together at the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of four degrees, it diſcharges it ſelf
into our River: and 'tis by that Arm of
it, which is neareſt to the Province of the
<hi>Aquas,</hi> that one muſt directly take ones

becauſe there are ſome Arms that tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North; and they that ſhall be

will certainly be expos'd to the ſame Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

from whence he was forced to retire with
much more haſte than he came, tho he
was ſo well attended with a good number
of Men.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond moſt remarkable Entrance
we find on the North ſide is by the Town
of <hi>Paſto,</hi> which alſo depends on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

you muſt croſs the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
called the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> which is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
incommodious Journey, becauſe of the
badneſs of the Ways, which you muſt travel
partly on Foot, and the reſt on Horſe-back.
You'l at length arrive at the River <hi>Puto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayo,</hi>
on which you muſt embark; and
ſailing down it, it will bring into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> at the Latitude
of two Degrees and a half, and 330
Leagues below the Port of <hi>Napo.</hi> The
ſame Way that leads to the River <hi>Puto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayo,</hi>
leads in like manner to the River
<hi>Aguarico;</hi> becauſe when you leave the
Mountains, 'tis but turning near <hi>Succombios,</hi>
and near that Town you meet the River
<hi>Aguarico,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the golden River:
you need only follow the Stream of it to

with much more eaſe. The firſt of

This River enters into the <hi>Amazone</hi>
below the River <hi>Quito,</hi> and the <hi>Napo,</hi>
at a place call'd <hi>La Junta de los Rios,</hi>
twenty five Leagues below the Port
of <hi>Napo.</hi> When the Portuguez returned,
we found a better way to join their Fleet

into this Country: For we went ſtrait
from <hi>Quito</hi> to <hi>Archidoua,</hi> which likewiſe
belongs to the Government of the <hi>Quixos,</hi>
and is under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Quito;</hi>
from whence by one day's Journey only
(which we travelled on foot, it being in
the Winter, that is in the time of the Rains,
but might be performed on Horſe-back at
any other Seaſon) we arrived at the Port
of the River <hi>Napo.</hi> This River is great and
rich, and all the Inhabitants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Ports under the Government of
<hi>Quito</hi> account it the Depoſitory of their
Treaſures; for they every Year gather
from its Shores all the Gold they need to
defray the Expence of their Families.
Beſides, this River abounds with Fiſh, and
the Fields near it are full of Game; the
Soil is very good, and requires but little
Charge to cultivate it: It returns the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60479:61"/>

Way that can be taken to go from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

'tis much more commodious and eaſy
than all the reſt. Yet I have heard on that
ſide, that near the Town of <hi>Ambatte,</hi>
which is 10 Leagues from <hi>Quito</hi> on the
River <hi>Bamba,</hi> there is another River that
comes to diſcharge it ſelf into the <hi>Amazone,</hi>

into the <hi>Amazone</hi> 20 Leagues below the River
again, that by the Order of General <hi>Texeira</hi>
forty Portuguez of his Fleet, with 200 of the

conſtantly for the ſpace of eleven Months: At
firſt they found nothing but good Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all ſorts from the Inhabitants of the
Country, to whom in return they gave all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
they had occaſion for; but this did not
continue long. This was too great a Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for Men that knew themſelves guilty of
the death of the Spaniſh Captain; for they
being the Authors of this Fact, knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that the Blood they had ſhed cry'd for
Vengeance againſt 'em, and therefore being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Apprehenſions of being chaſtis'd for their
Boldneſs on the leaſt occaſion that ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
they mutinied, and after they had kill'd
three of our Indians, took up Arms to defend
their Lives and Lands. The Portuguez on
this occaſion acted like themſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſought to be reveng'd; for it being
contrary to their Humour to put up Injuries,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60479:64"/>
or to ſuffer Indians to take the liberty of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with ſo much Inſolence as this, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
themſelves to Arms, and with their
wonted Courage, for which they are ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
flew upon their Enemies, and repuls'd
them with ſo much Vigor, that with the loſs
of a very few Men they killed a conſiderable
number of Indians, and took above 70 of 'em
Priſoners; ſome of whom died in the places of
their Confinement, and the reſt made their
Eſcape, ſo that in a little time there was not
one of them left. Theſe Portuguez did not
get much by their Victory, for they now
found themſelves reduc'd to ſuch Extremity,
that they ſaw they muſt either periſh for
want of Food, or elſe be oblig'd to go with
their Swords in their hands to fetch Proviſion
out of the very Mouths of their Enemies.
Accordingly they reſolv'd to make Incurſions
into the Country, and either by fair means or
ſoul to get a Supply for their pinching Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.
Some of 'em went out to fight, and
others kept the Camp; but both the one and
the other in ſpite of all their Bravery did not
fail to meet with frequent and violent Inſults
from their Enemies, who omitted no fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to give 'em all ſorts of Alarms, and to
do 'em all the Miſchief they could, eſpecially
upon the River, where they ſurpriz'd a great
many of their Veſſels, ſome of which they
pillaged, and brake others of 'em in pieces:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60479:64"/>
and yet this was not the greateſt Damage
they did our Men; for they laid Ambuſcades
for our Indians, and cut the Throats of all
that fell into their hands: 'Tis true, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man they kill'd, the Portuguez kill'd ſix of
them; but this Chaſtiſement was nothing
comparable to what the Portuguez uſed to
make the Indians ſuffer for ſuch kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts.
Theſe People were call'd by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
who ſaw them firſt, the Hairy Indians,
becauſe throughout this Province the Men as
well as the Women wear their Hair quite
down to their Knees. Their Weapons are
Darts, their Houſes are Huts made very neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and curiouſly with the Branches of Palm-Trees:
Their Food is like that of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Indians upon the <hi>Amazone.</hi> They are
always in War with their Neighbours at

its Waters entirely together, while it
runs with its ordinary Swiftneſs ſeveral

which are in great number, and ſome of

one may eaſily imagine there muſt needs be
vaſt numbers of Indians in a Country that
extends 200 Leagues in Length. This Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the moſt reaſonable and beſt civilized
of all thoſe that dwell along this River. This
Advantage they received from thoſe that
not long ſince went down amongſt 'em from
the Countrey of the <hi>Quixos;</hi> where after
having had Peace with the Spaniards for a
long time, they were at laſt wearied with
the ill Treatment they received from 'em,
and embarking in their Canoos, ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be carried down with the Stream
of the River, till they met with other Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of their Nation, upon whoſe Strength
and Power they could rely, and accordingly
took up their Reſidence with 'em. Theſe
laſt Comers introduc'd among the others
ſeveral things they had ſeen practiſed by the
Spaniards, and taught 'em how to live after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60479:66"/>
a more civil and regular manner. They
were all clothed, both Men and Women,
with all the Decency imaginable; their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are made of Cotton, of which they
gather a prodigious quantity; and they do
not only make Stuffs enough for their own
uſe, but make a great many to ſell to their
Neighbours, who are mightily taken (and
that not without reaſon) with the Beauty
of thoſe pretty Works with which they
deck their Stuffs: they make ſome very thin
Clothes, which are not only woven with
Threds of different Colours, but the Paint
of 'em is diſpoſed with ſo much Art in the
weaving, that the different Threds can't be
diſtinguiſhed one from another. They are
ſo ſubmiſſive and obedient to their principal
Caciques, that theſe whom they look upon as
their Princes, need ſpeak but a Word to have
whatever they command put in execution.</p>
                     <p>This whole Nation has been ſo long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
to make their Heads flat, that as ſoon
as their Children are born they put them in
a kind of Preſs; forcing Nature after this
manner with one little Board, which they hold
upon the Forehead, and another much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which they put behind the Head, and
which ſerves them for a Cradle; and all
the reſt of the Body of the new-born Infant
is as it were inclos'd with this piece of
Wood: they lay the Child upon his Back,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60479:66"/>
and this Board being bound faſt to that
which is upon the Forehead, they make the
Head of the Child almoſt as ſlat as ones Hand;
thus there being no room for the Head to
grow, but by ſpreading it ſelf wide from
one Ear to the other, they are extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
by this violent Artifice.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aguas</hi> have perpetual War with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

'em with ſo much Love and Kindneſs, that
they make 'em eat with themſelves; and
there's nothing in the World diſpleaſes 'em
more, than to deſire 'em to ſell 'em, as we
found by experience on ſeveral occaſions: I
remember once at our Arrival at an Indian
Town, they received us not only with all the
Marks of Peace and Amity, but even with
all the Tokens of extraordinary Joy: They
offer'd us all they had for our Suſtenance,
without requiring any thing in return: We
on our parts ſhewed that Civility to them that
became us; we bought their painted Cotton-Cloth,
which they very willingly parted
with; we deſired 'em to ſell us ſome Canoos,
which are better to them than the beſt and
ſwifteſt Horſes, and they preſently offer'd
'em to us; but when we began to talk with
'em about their Slaves, and to importune 'em
to ſell us ſome of 'em, this was to them
the moſt uncivil and inhumane Diſcourſe
that could be: one of them preſently gave
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60479:67"/>
us to underſtand that he would no longer keep
company with us; another ſhew'd himſelf
mightily troubled at the matter: On the one
hand they were very diligent to hide 'em
from us, on the other to get ſome of 'em that
were with us out of our Hands; in a word,
they gave us Signs enough to convince us,
that they had a greater eſteem for their Slaves
than for all the reſt of their Goods, and that
they had rather part with all they poſſeſs'd
beſides than part with them. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth of the matter, 'tis a malicious
thing of the Portuguez to report that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the <hi>Aguas</hi> are unwilling to ſell their
Slaves, is becauſe they fatten 'em, and keep
'em to eat at their Feaſts: This is a Calumny
they have invented, to palliate the Cruelties
they have exerciſed upon theſe poor Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
I may farther add, that at leaſt as far
as concerns the Nation of the <hi>Aguas</hi> I have
found the contrary true by the Teſtimony of
two Indians that were Natives of <hi>Para,</hi> who
came up with the Portuguez as far as <hi>Quito,</hi>
and ran away when they were arriv'd there;
who falling into the hands of theſe People,
were made Slaves, and remained with them
eight Months: theſe aſſured me they had
been out with them at their Wars, and that
they never ſaw 'em eat any of their Enemies,
when they had taken 'em, and made Slaves
of 'em: 'twas true indeed (they ſaid) when
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60479:68"/>
they had taken any of their Enemies that had
the Reputation of being Valiant and Great,
they kill'd 'em at their Feaſts and Aſſemblies,
only out of fear of ſuſtaining ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Damage by 'em, if they ſhould ſuffer
'em to live; but that they did not eat theſe
neither when they had kill'd 'em, but when
they had cut off their Heads, which they
us'd to hang up in their Huts as Trophies,
they roll'd their Bodies into the River.</p>
                     <p>I don't deny that there are ſome <hi>Caribees</hi>
in thoſe Parts that eat their Enemies without
any Sentiments of Horror; but this is a
Cuſtom peculiar to them, and is not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
among other Indians. And this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
may be taken notice of and credited, that
Human Fleſh has never been ſold in any of
the Publick Shambles of this Nation, as the
Portuguez have reported; who under the
pretence of revenging ſuch kind of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
commit thoſe that are incomparably

So that if the Portuguez pretend to give a
good account of any Matter, it muſt be only
from what they have learn'd of the Indians
by Signs, which are ordinarily very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

apply them to what his Fancy leads him;
theſe Difficulties ceas'd at their return, and
it pleas'd God to favour us with ſuch good

contain'd in this Relation, is written upon the

the River <hi>Yquiari,</hi> which is that the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez

the foot of a Mountain hard by: Here the
Natives amaſs Gold together in prodigious
quantities; they find it all in Spangles, or
Grains of a good alloy; they beat theſe ſmall
Grains of Gold together till they form thoſe
little Plates which they hang at their Ears
and Noſes, as we have ſaid before. The
People of this Country that find this Gold,
trade with it among their Neighbours, who
are call'd the <hi>Mavagus;</hi> as for the other they
are call'd the <hi>Yuma Guaris,</hi> which is as much

they underſtand all ſorts of Metals, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

there are Rocks in it in ſome Places, and 'tis
very full of Fiſh, and well ſtock'd with
Tortoiſes; its Banks are loaded with <hi>Maze</hi>
and <hi>Magnioc.</hi> In a word, it has every thing
neceſſary to make the Navigation of it eaſy
and agreeable. All the Banks of this River
are peopled with different Nations, which I
ſhall name one after another ſucceſſively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with thoſe that dwell at the Mouth
of it, going on with thoſe that dwell along
the River upward, which are the <hi>Cuchigua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
and bear the ſame Name with the River
<hi>Cuchiguara,</hi> &amp;c. and in fine, all the laſt are
call'd the <hi>Curiguiris;</hi> who, according to the
Report that Perſons who have been with
them, and offer'd to conduct us to them,
gave us, are Giants of ſixteen Spans height,
and very ſtout; they go naked as well as the
others, and wear great Plates of God at their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60479:78"/>
Ears and Noſtrils: We were informed that
'twould be a Journey of two Months to go
into the Province of theſe Giants from the
Mouth of this River. When we had paſſed
ſome ſpace farther, we found on the South-ſide
the People call'd the <hi>Caupunas</hi> and the
<hi>Zurinas,</hi> which are the moſt ingenious and
curious handy-craft Men that we ſaw in all
the Country. Without any other Tools
than ſuch as I have ſpoken of before, they
make Chairs in the Form of Beaſts, with ſo
much Curioſity, and ſo commodious for a
Man to ſit at his Eaſe, that I think the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Man cannot contrive better. They
make <hi>Eſtolicas,</hi> which are their ordinary
Weapons, of a very ſlender Stick, with ſo
much Art, that 'tis not to be wondred at that
other Nations in the Country are very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of them; and which is very ſtrange,
they'll cut a rais'd Figure ſo much to the
Life, and ſo exactly upon any coarſe Piece of
Wood, that many of our Carvers might
take Pattern by them. 'Tis not only to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
their own Fancies, and for their own
Uſe, that they make theſe Pieces of Work,
but alſo for the Profit it brings them; for
they hereby maintain a Trade with their
Neighbours, and truck their Work with
them for any Neceſſaries to ſerve their Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

another River on the North-ſide, call'd <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurara</hi>
by the Natives: This River extends it
ſelf a great way up in the Country, and
forms ſeveral great Lakes, ſo that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is divided into divers large Iſlands, which
are all peopled with an infinite Number of
Inhabitants. Theſe Lands lie very high,
and are never overflow'd by the Inundations,
let them be never ſo great. This Country
abounds with all ſorts of Proviſion, as <hi>Maze,
Magnioc,</hi> all kinds of Fruit, Veniſon, Wild-Fowl,
and Fiſh, and yields its Inhabitants a
liberal Maintenance; which makes it abound
as much in Men as in all other things. All

Bows and Arrows; and among ſome of
them I ſaw Iron Tools and Weapons, as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60479:79"/>
Hatchets, Halbards, Bills and Knives. I
asked them, by our Interpreters, from
whence they had thoſe Inſtruments of Iron:
they anſwered, that they bought them of
the People of that Country that dwelt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
the Sea on that ſide, who had their Goods
in exchange for 'em; that they were white
Men like us, and made uſe of the ſame Arms,
as Swords and Guns, and had Houſes upon
the Sea-Coaſt; that the only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us was, that they had all
light-colour'd Hair. Theſe Tokens were
ſufficient to aſſure us that theſe were the
Dutch that were in poſſeſſion of the Mouth
of the Smooth River, or the River <hi>Philippe,</hi>
ſome time before. It was in the Year 1638,
that they made a Deſcent into <hi>Guiana,</hi> which

and fills up half the Bed of the <hi>Amazone</hi> it
ſelf for above the length of twelve Leagues,
ſo that the Waters of the one may be eaſily
diſtinguiſhed from the other by thoſe that
ſail in this Channel. The Portuguez had
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60479:80"/>
ſome Reaſon to call this the <hi>Black River,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at its Mouth, and many Leagues above,
its Depth, together with the Clearneſs of
thoſe Waters which are pour'd into its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
from ſeveral great Lakes, make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
black, as if it were dyed, tho when it is
put in a Glaſs it looks as clear as Cryſtal. It
takes its Courſe from Weſt to Eaſt at its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
but has ſuch great Windings, that
in a very little ſpace it changes its Courſe to
different Points; but the Courſe it runs for
ſeveral Leagues before it empties it ſelf into
the <hi>Amazone,</hi> is again from Weſt to Eaſt.
The Indians that live upon the Banks of it
call it <hi>Curiguarura;</hi> but the <hi>Toupinambous,</hi>
of whom we ſhall ſpeak preſently, give it
the name of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rama;,</hi> which ſignifies [<hi>Black

which is as much as to ſay [<hi>the Great River],</hi>
to diſtinguiſh it from another, which tho it
be a great River, however is much leſs than
this, and named <hi>Pajanamira,</hi> which enters
into the <hi>Amazone</hi> on the South-ſide, a League

that this River was inhabited by a great
number of People of different Nations, the

th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

and the laſt Nation is that of the

as we were ſufficiently inform'd, that one

                     <p>All theſe Nations make uſe of Bows and
Arrows, the moſt of which they poiſon with
the Juice of Herbs. All the Lands upon this
Black River are ſituate very high, the Soil is
very good, and if manur'd, would yield
plenty of all ſorts of Fruit (even ſuch as we
have in <hi>Europe</hi>) in ſome places that lie well
to produce 'em. There are a great many
fine and pleaſant Fields all cover'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Paſturage ſufficient to nouriſh an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
ſtock of all ſorts of Cattle. There
are likewiſe abundance of good Trees, the
Timber of which is very good for all ſorts of
Carpenters Work, whether for Land or
Water: And beſides this great plenty of
Wood, the Country yields very good Stones,
and that in vaſt Quantities, fit for the nobleſt
Buildings. The Borders of it are ſtor'd with
all ſorts of Game. Indeed it has but a few

                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60479:81"/>
the reaſon of which is from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Clearneſs of the Water: But to
make amends for this Defect, the Lakes
which are in the Country, and pour their
Waters into this River, yield the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
more Fiſh than they need. This River
has at the Mouth of it the beſt Situation in
the World for the making of a Fort, and
plenty of Stones to build it, which would
be very proper to hinder our Enemies from
coming by this River to enter into the great
Channel of the <hi>Amazone;</hi> not that I think
this to be the beſt place of all for a Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for ſuch a purpoſe, but rather ſeveral
Leagues above this Mouth, in an Arm that
goes to caſt it ſelf into the River call'd <hi>Riogrande,</hi>
whoſe Mouth (as I have already
ſaid) is in the North Sea: there we might
place all our Forces with the greateſt Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of entirely ſtopping the Paſſage of our
Enemies into this new World, which they
ſo paſſionately deſire to diſcover; and which
they will ſome time or other attempt, if
they are not prevented by ſecuring this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
I dare not affirm that this River call'd
the <hi>Riogrande,</hi> into which the Arm of the
Black River enters, is the Smooth River, or
the <hi>Philippe,</hi> for both enter into the Sea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the North Cape; but by all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
I have made, I am very inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to believe that it is the River <hi>Philippe,</hi>
                        <pb n="150" facs="tcp:60479:82"/>
becauſe 'tis the firſt conſiderable River that

Mouth of it into the Sea is over againſt
the Iſland of <hi>La Trinidada,</hi> which is above a

Dunghil, not knowing to whom to apply
themſelves for the Relief of their Neceſſities.
Theſe ſeditious Words being received with
Applauſe by the greateſt part of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez,
they immediately reſolv'd to ſpeak

and therefore begg'd him to compaſſionate

they ſought ſome Relief; that they were ſure
that only along the Black River they could
get as many of thoſe Slaves which the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                     <p>The General conſidering he was but one
againſt a great many, and perceiving a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny

to put this Enterprize in execution, ſeeing
the Wind favour'd their Entrance into the

This Reſolution gave me no ſmall Uneaſineſs,

I ſoon found both that he had Courage and

At the ſame time I went to celebrate the holy

towards the Source of the River <hi>Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ari:</hi>
they continued with 'em ſome time; but
a Spaniard having caus'd one of 'em to be
whipp'd for killing a Cow, they could not
put up this Injury, but reſolv'd all to be gone;
and making uſe of the Advantage of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they all embark'd in their Canoos and
went down it as far as this great Iſland,
where they now dwell. They ſpeak the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Language of <hi>Brazil,</hi> which extends
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60479:85"/>
through all the Country that the Portuguez
have conquer'd as far as <hi>Maragnon</hi> and <hi>Para:</hi>
They told us, that when their Fathers left
<hi>Brazil,</hi> not knowing how to get Suſtenance
all together in the Deſarts through which
they were to paſs, they were conſtrain'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a March of above 900 Leagues to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
by reaſon of their multitude, ſo that
ſome went one way, and ſome another; and
by this means all the Mountains of <hi>Peru</hi> call'd
the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> are peopled with the <hi>Toupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambous.</hi>
This is a very brave and valiant
Nation of Indians, as they made themſelves
appear to be to the People whom they found
in this Iſland, where they are at preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtliſh'd.
For in all appearance theſe <hi>Toupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambous</hi>
were very few in compariſon of the
Inhabitants of this Iſland when they arriv'd
there, yet 'tis certain they ſo often beat, and
ſo entirely ſubdued all thoſe they fought
with, that after they had deſtroy'd whole
Nations, they forc'd the reſt to leave their
Native Country in fear, and to go and plant
themſelves in very diſtant Regions. Theſe
Warlike Savages uſe Bows and Arrows with
great dexterity, and have ſo noble a Courage,
and Greatneſs of Mind, that in theſe Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they ſeem not to come behind the moſt
accompliſh'd Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi> But tho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all of 'em are but the Children or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children
of thoſe that came from <hi>Brazil</hi> into
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60479:86"/>
this Iſland, yet it is to be obſerv'd that they
begin to degenerate from their Anceſtors, by
the Alliances they contract with thoſe of
this Country, and by their accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the manner of living us'd by the
original Inhabitants. They all receiv'd us
with Demonſtrations of extraordinary Joy;
and let us know, that they thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
in a little time to enter into a Treaty
with us, and to put themſelves in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Allies and Friends of the People
of <hi>Para.</hi> This Declaration of theirs pleas'd
me very much, and made me hope that no
ſmall Advantages would accrue to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by it: For if theſe valiant People once
become of our Party, it muſt needs be an
eaſy matter for us to bring all the other
Nations of the River of <hi>Amazons</hi> to reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Terms, ſince there is none of 'em but
tremble at the very Name of the <hi>Toupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambous.</hi>

                     <p>THeſe <hi>Toupinambous</hi> are a very ingenious
and intelligent People; and having
no need of Interpreters to treat with them,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60479:86"/>
becauſe (as I have ſaid) they ſpeak the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

our Portuguez, that have been born and bred
there, ſpeak as well as they, we had the
Advantage of a very particular Account of
divers things, which I am going to relate,
and which may be believed on their Report,
becauſe they are a People that have rov'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and ſubjected all the neighbouring
Countries to their Power. They told us,
that on the South-ſide near their Iſland there
are two Nations among others upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
that are very remarkable; one of 'em
are Dwarfs as ſmall as little Children, and
are called <hi>Guayazis,</hi> the other is a Race of
People that come into the World with their
Feet turn'd behind 'em, ſo that thoſe that
are unacquainted with their monſtrous Shape,
and ſhould follow their Track, would run
from 'em inſtead of overtaking 'em; they
are called <hi>Matayus,</hi> and are tributary to the
<hi>Toupinambous,</hi> whom they are obliged to
furniſh with Hatchets made of Stone to fell
great Trees with, when they have a mind to
clear a Piece of Ground; for they frame
theſe Hatchets very neatly, and 'tis their
whole buſineſs to make of 'em. They told
us moreover, that on the other ſide of the
River, that is Northward, there are ſeven
Provinces adjoining one to another, which are
very populous; but becauſe they are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60479:87"/>
but of mean Courage and Strength, and
only feed upon Fruits and ſome ſmall wild
Animals, without ever fighting one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
when they are angry, or ever taking
up Arms to defend themſelves from other
Nations, they are of no account in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
They further told us, that themſelves
had been a long time at Peace with another
Nation, whoſe Confines extend to thoſe we
have juſt ſpoken of, and had a regular Trade
with 'em for all Commodities, wherewith
either Countrey abounded; and that the
principal thing they had from this People
was Salt, for which they gave 'em other
things in exchange; and that this Salt came
from a Place not far diſtant from 'em. If this
be true, theſe Salt-pits would be of great
advantage to the Spaniards, and would ſerve
'em not only for thoſe parts of the Countrey
that are conquer'd, but alſo for the more
commodious eſtabliſhing of Colonies on the
Banks of this great River. But if there
ſhould be nothing in this Story on this ſide,
it is not to be doubted but Salt is to be found
in great abundance along thoſe Rivers that
come down on the ſide of <hi>Peru;</hi> becauſe in
the Year 1631, when I was in the City of
<hi>Lima,</hi> two Men went from thence at two
different times to ſeek ſome, and came back
with as much as they could carry: they told
us they came to a certain Place, where they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60479:87"/>
went on one of the Rivers (in all appearance
one of thoſe leſſer Rivers that form that great
one, which falls into the <hi>Amazone</hi>) and arrived
at a Mountain all of Salt, of which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
made great advantage, being become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rich by the Traffick they had in exchange
for it from thoſe Indians that came a great
way to buy it; not that it is any ſtrange thing
in <hi>Peru,</hi> and in all the Mountains, to ſee
Rocks of Salt-ſtones, the Salt of which is
very good; for no other is made uſe of in all
that Countrey: 'Tis got out of the Rock
with Iron Inſtruments in great pieces, each
of which weigh 5 or 6<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Aroba</hi> is a Weight of 25 Pounds, as the <hi>Quintal</hi> is of a 100 Pounds.</note>

this great River of the Renown'd <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi>
from whence it borrows its true Name,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60479:88"/>
by which it has been known from the very

thoſe who have navigated it, but alſo by all
Coſmographers who have given any good

the Name of <hi>Amazone</hi> ſhould have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on this River without any reaſonable
Ground; and that tho it well deſerves a
Name that might render it famous, it ſhould
only be known by a fabulous one: This does
not ſeem at all probable that ſuch a River as
this, that poſſeſſes ſo many Advantages above
all others, ſhould have deriv'd its Glory from
a Title that does not belong to it; like what
we ſee in ſome Men, who when they have
not Vertue enough to obtain the Glory they
deſire by their own Merit, are ſo mean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
and diſingenuous to deck themſelves
with the advantageous Qualities of others:
But the Proofs that give aſſurance that
there is a Province of <hi>Amazons</hi> on the Banks
of this River, are ſo ſtrong and convincing,
that it would be a renouncing of moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
to ſcruple the giving credit to it. I
don't build upon the ſolemn Examinations
made by the Authority of the Soveraign Court
of <hi>Quito,</hi> in which many Witneſſes have been
heard that have been born in thoſe Parts,
and liv'd there a long time; and of all things
contain'd in their Frontier Countries, one of
the principal which is particularly affirm'd
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60479:88"/>
by 'em is, that one of thoſe Provinces near
our River is peopled with a ſort of warlike
Women, who live together, and maintain
their Government alone, without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Men; that at a certain Seaſon of
the Year they ſeek the Society of Men in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to perpetuate their Race; but at all other
times live together in their Towns, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themſelves in manuring the Ground,
from which with hard Labour they procure
all Neceſſaries for the Support and Comfort
of Life. Nor will I inſiſt on other Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
that have been made in the new
Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> at the Royal Seat of
the City of <hi>Paſto,</hi> where ſeveral Indians
were examined, and particularly one Indian
Woman, who affirm'd that ſhe had been in
the very Countrey which theſe valiant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
inhabit, and whoſe Account was in
every reſpect conformable to what had been
before aſſerted in the foregoing Relations:
but I can't conceal what I have heard with

have been enquiring after from my firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking

the <hi>Guacaras,</hi> who are the People that have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60479:89"/>
the Privilege to converſe with theſe valiant
Women, and enjoy their Favours. They
dwell upon huge Mountains, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
high, among which there is one
that lifts its Head a great Height above all
the reſt, which is ſo buffeted with Winds,
that it is quite barren, and looks very bare;
the Name of it is <hi>Yacamiaba.</hi> Theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as has been ſaid) are very couragious,
and have always maintain'd themſelves alone
without the help and aſſiſtance of Men; and
when their Neighbours come into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
at a time concerted with them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
'em with their Weapons in their Hands,
which are Bows and Arrows, and which
they exerciſe as if they were going againſt
their Enemies; but knowing well that the
others don't come to fight, but are their
Friends, they lay down their Arms, and all
run into the Canoos or other little Veſſels of
theſe Indians, and each <hi>Amazone</hi> takes the
Hammock (a Cotton Bed they hang up to
ſleep in) which ſhe finds next at hand; this
ſhe carries home, and hangs up in a Place,
where the Owner of it may know it again
when he comes; after which ſhe receives
him as her Gueſt, and treats him thoſe few
days they continue together. Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
afterward return to their own Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and never fail to make this Voyage
every Year at the appointed time. The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60479:90"/>
Girls which they bear are brought up by
their Mothers, and inſtructed in the uſe of
Arms, as well as inur'd to Labour, as if they
were ambitious to advance the wonted Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of their Predeceſſors ſtill to a greater
Height. As for the Male-Children, 'tis not
certain what they do with 'em: I ſaw an
Indian who told me, that when he was a
Child he was with his Father at ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
and aſſured me, that they gave the
Male Children to their Fathers the next
time they came after their Birth. But the
common Report is, that they kill all their
Males as ſoon as they are born: and this is
generally ſuppos'd to be the trueſt Account.
Time will diſcover the Truth of this Matter.
'Tis certain they have Treaſures in their

other deſign than that of procuring Slaves,
were not ſatisfied in having the Maſters in
poſſeſſion: therefore they endeavour'd to
affright theſe poor Indians, whom they kept
under Guard, with terrible Menaces, and
made 'em tremble at the thoughts of the
new Cruelties they ſaid they would exerciſe
on 'em, if they would not give 'em Slaves;
and on the other hand promis'd them, that if
they would, they ſhould not only have their
full Liberty, but they would conſider 'em as
their beſt Friends; and beſides, would give
'em as many Iron Tools and Cotton Clothes
in exchange for 'em, as ſhould fully ſatisfy
'em. What could theſe poor Creatures do
more than abandon themſelves to the Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Enemies? They ſaw they were
in their hands, depriv'd of their Arms, their
Houſes plunder'd, their Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
raviſh'd. They therefore offer'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
'em a thouſand Slaves, and ſent ſome of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60479:94"/>
their Company to get 'em together; but theſe
poor Wretches were fled away to ſecure
themſelves while the Town was pillaging;
therefore they could not poſſibly get above
two hundred: Theſe they deliver'd to the
Portuguez, and promiſing to procure all the
reſt for which they had engag'd, were ſet at
liberty. In the Condition theſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were, they would have given their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Children for Slaves, to come to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
with their Enemies, as they have
frequently done. The Portuguez put all theſe
Slaves in a Veſſel, and ſent 'em to <hi>Maragnon</hi>
and <hi>Para.</hi> This I aſſert as a thing I ſaw
with my own Eyes: This Prey was very
grateful to the <hi>Portuguez;</hi> and their Succeſs
in this Expedition ſo encouraged 'em, and
excited their Avarice, that they ſoon made
preparation to go and ſeek a greater Booty of
this kind in another Province more remote
upon this great River. 'Tis not to be doubted
but they exercis'd ſtill greater Cruelties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in theſe Expeditions there go very few
that have any Honour or Conſcience, who
might be capable of aſſiſting him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
to reſtrain the Souldiers Barbarities.
Theſe things muſt needs enrage all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of this River againſt the Name of
the Portuguez. And I doubt not that when
an Attempt ſhall be made to pacify the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
and allay the Hatred theſe Violences
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60479:95"/>
have caus'd among thoſe People, it will be
found a matter of that great difficulty that
'twill ſcarce ever be accompliſh'd; whereas
in the State we left theſe People upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
when we paſs'd by their Countries, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could have been more eaſy than to have
made a General Peace with them. Theſe are
the Conqueſts of <hi>Brazil</hi> ſo much talk'd of,
and this is the Traffick the Souldiers live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and let me add, this is the true and juſt
Cauſe for which God puniſhes theſe miſerable
Souldiers to that degree, that they are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in War and Trouble, and have ſcarce
Bread to eat. And I believe, if it were not
that God in ſome ſort makes uſe of 'em to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
his Deſigns upon the Indians, and
that they are continually engag'd in War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60479:95"/>
our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would have long ſince
extirpated ſuch cruel and abominable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.
But to return to the <hi>Tapajotos,</hi> and
the famous River upon the Banks of which
they dwell; I ſay, the bottom of this River is
very good, ſo that a great Engliſh Veſſel ſome
Years ago went a conſiderable way up it,
with a deſign to make Plantations in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and to ſettle the Trade of Tobacco
with the People of the Country, to which end
they offer'd 'em very advantagious Terms:
but the <hi>Tapajotos</hi> would accept of none, but
ſurpriz'd the Engliſh unawares, and kill'd
all they could come at after they had ſeiz'd
their Arms, which they keep to this day.
Thus they made the reſt leave the Country
in more haſte than they come to it; for
they eſcap'd in their Veſſel, and by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Sail with all ſpeed avoided ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is not very big, but very wealthy, if the

that at the end of ſix days Voyage up the

quantity of Gold found below the place
where it waſhes the foot of an indifferently
large Mountain called <hi>Yuquaratinci.</hi> The

whence they have often taken a ſort of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
harder than Gold, but very white (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

they were wont formerly to make Hatchets

and Knives; but finding the Tools made of
this Metal were apt to have their Edg turn'd
when any Streſs was put to 'em, they did
not make any account of 'em. They further
gave us an account, That near the Strait I
have ſpoken of, there are two Hills, one of
which by the Signs they gave of it, is in all
probability a Hill of <hi>Azure;</hi> and it ſeems the
other, which they call <hi>Penagara,</hi> when the

juſt now ſpoken. The Indians aſſure us of
ſo much Gold along the Banks of it, that if it
be according to their Relation, this one River
poſſeſſes more Riches than are in all <hi>Peru.</hi>
The Lands this River waters are of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

the great Extent of this Country, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is larger than all <hi>Spain</hi> join'd together,
and that it contains ſeveral Mines of which
we have very certain knowledg; I ſhall only
ſay that generally the Ground of it is of
the beſt kind for the Production of all ſorts
of Grain and Fruit, and what may turn to the
Account of thoſe that inhabit it, that is to be
found in all the vaſt Extent of the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the North-ſide, and comprehends ſeveral
great Provinces of Savages. But that which is
yet more conſiderable is, that in this Country
are thoſe Fields ſo famous for the Production
of prodigious quantities of <hi>Tucui.</hi> Our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the Dutch have given a Reputation to
theſe Lands, and have often found by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
not only the Goodneſs and Fertility
of the Soil, but alſo the vaſt Profits with
which this alone is capable of inriching its

and Sorrow, becauſe they have been
always forc'd out of 'em by the Portuguez.
Therefore 'tis worth Conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this
Place is very good to make great Plantations
of Tobacco, and that there's no part of all
the Countries that have been diſcover'd that
is better for the planting of Canes, and for
making of Sugar. This Soil returns all the
Cultivation that is beſtow'd upon it with
Uſury, and produces all ſorts of Proviſion
in extraordinary plenty: There are very fine
pieces of Paſture-ground, which in their vaſt
Extent would feed an infinite number of all
ſorts of Cattle. Six Leagues above the
place where this River empties it ſelf into
the <hi>Amazone,</hi> the Portuguez had a Fort
which they call'd <hi>Del Doſtierro,</hi> that is
[<hi>The Fort of Baniſhment</hi>] kept only by
thirty Souldiers, and ſome pieces of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which was of more uſe to keep the
Indians that are reduc'd under the Power of
the Portuguez, in Fear and Subjection, and
to maintain the Authority of the Governor,

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60479:102"/>

Profits of the Riches with which <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

abounds. It offers to the Poor a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Maintenance, to the Labourer the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Recompence of his Toil; to the
Merchant a Profitable Trade; to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
an Occaſion of Signalizing himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to the Rich an Improvement of their
Wealth; to Gentlemen Honorable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments;
to Noblemen Large Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and to Kings themſelves Empires,
and a New World. But thoſe who of
all others are call'd upon to promote ſuch
new Conqueſts, and ought to be moſt
heartily concern'd in 'em, are ſuch as
with the greateſt Affection, ſeek the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Glory of God, and are
Zealouſly bent to deſign the Salvation of
the Souls of an Innumerable Multitude
of Idolatrous and Heatheniſh <hi>Indians,</hi>
who want the Help and Light the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them withal, to diſpel the ſhadows
of Sin and Death, with which thoſe
poor Wretches have been ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted.
And let none Excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from an Attempt of this kind:
Here's Work enough to employ every
one of us, and how great a Number ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Labourers ſhould devote themſelves
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60479:103"/>
to it, there will ſtill be more wanting for
ſo great a Harveſt. This New Vine-yard
will ſtill want more hands to Cultivate
and Dreſs it, how able and how fervent
ſoever they ſhould prove, who ſhall be
engag'd in this Service, But it is rather
to be wiſh'd than expected, that we ſhall
ever ſee this New World Subjected to
the Keys of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I
hope all the Illuſtrious Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> (to whom may it
pleaſe the Almighty to grant many
and happy Years,) will each of 'em be
inſpir'd from Heaven with Zeal for ſo
Holy an Enterprize as the Conqueſt of
Souls; ſome by their wonted Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for the Maintenance and Subſiſtence
of Prieſts and Miniſters of the Goſpel,
and others by their care to provide and
convey Clergymen into thoſe Countries:
And all of 'em have reaſon to eſteem it
a great happineſs for them that in the Age
wherein they live, this difficult and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
way ſhould be open'd, to bring
more Nations, and thoſe more populous
at once into the Boſom of the Church,
than all the reſt that have been hitherto
diſcover'd in the whole New World.</p>

28 Men of War and 6 Fireſhips, under
the Command of <hi>Don Paul de Contreras,</hi>
whoſe Vice-Admiral was the <hi>Amirante
Caſtana,</hi> on board whom was I. The
Two Fleets came up with each other,
near <hi>Cape St. Vincent,</hi> where they ſtaid
many Days; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> perceiving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60479:110"/>
they were like to make nothing on't, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
towards <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſtood into <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where all the Gallions
ſafely arriv'd in the beginning of the
Year 1655, except the Vice-Admiral,
which was loſt in the Channel of <hi>Bahama</hi>
upon the Coaſts of <hi>Florida.</hi> Sometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having declar'd War
againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> more openly, by
taking <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Navigation to the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> was a long time interrupted,
by their Cruiſers hovering about <hi>Cadiz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and <hi>San Lucar,</hi> where they intercepted
ſome Ships coming from the <hi>Indies</hi> rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laden, took one of the biggeſt, burnt
Two others, and put the reſt to flight,
and afterwards went to the <hi>Canaries,</hi>
where they burnt moſt of the Flota that
were arriv'd there from <hi>New Spain,</hi> and
waited orders from <hi>Madrid,</hi> what courſe
to take to eſcape falling into the hands of
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> While theſe things were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>Dutch</hi> who ſought to make their
advantage of the Troubles that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
were embroil'd in, ſent ſeveral
Ships to the River <hi>de la Plata,</hi> laden
with Goods and <hi>Negroes,</hi> which they
took in at <hi>Angola</hi> and <hi>Congo:</hi> Theſe
Ships being arriv'd in that River, and
come up to <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60479:111"/>
of the place who had a long time
been depriv'd of the Supplies which
they had us'd to receive by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gallions (who were hinder'd by the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> from making their conſtant Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages)
and were beſides in want of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi>
and other things, wrought ſo far
upon the Governor, that for a Preſent
which they oblig'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to give
him, and ſatisfying the Cuſtoms due to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they were permitted
to Land and Trade there.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
leſt the Interruption of the
Commerce, and the ſcarcity of <hi>European</hi>
Commodities in thoſe Parts, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the Inhabitants to Traffick with
Strangers (which 'tis their Intereſt to
prevent as much as they can) thought
fit to grant Licences to ſeveral of their
private Subjects to Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> at
their own proper riſque. A certain
Cavalier took one of them, and fitted
out a Ship at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> where I abode at
that time; I reſolv'd to go in her, and
that the more willingly, becauſe I had
formerly had ſome dealings with him.
He very friendly conſented to let me go
under his Name for his Nephew, that I
might conceal my being a Forreigner,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60479:111"/>
which if known would have ſtopt my
Voyage, becauſe in <hi>Spain</hi> they allow
none but Native <hi>Spaniards</hi> to go in their
Ships to the <hi>Indies.</hi> We ſet Sail about
the latter end of <hi>December</hi> 1657, in a
Ship of 450 Tuns, and in 105 Days
reach'd the Mouth of the River <hi>de la
Plata,</hi> where we met a <hi>French</hi> Frigat,
Captain <hi>Foran</hi> Commander, and fought
her ſome time, we got clear of her, and
continued our Courſe till we came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> where we found 22
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, and among them 2 <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
Laden homewards with Bulls-hides,
Plate, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>-wool, which they
had receiv'd in exchange for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
a few days after 3 <hi>Dutch</hi>
Ships going out of the Road encounter'd
Captain <hi>Foran</hi> and another Frigat, nam'd
the <hi>Mareſchale,</hi> Commanded by the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>de Fontenay;</hi> after a tough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> boarded and took
the <hi>Mareſchale,</hi> put all her Men to
the Sword, and the Chevalier among the
reſt.</p>
                  <p>This accident alarum'd thoſe of <hi>Beue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos
Ayres,</hi> and made them put themſelves
upon their guard, imagining there was a
<hi>French</hi> Squadron come into the River to
make an attempt upon their Country.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60479:112"/>
Whereupon they reſolv'd to ſend for
aid to Count <hi>Albaeliſte,</hi> Viceroy over all
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Acquiſitions in <hi>America,</hi> and
Reſident at <hi>Lima</hi> in <hi>Peru;</hi> who caus'd
to be Levy'd with much difficulty and
ſome force but 100 Men, which were
not ſent to them till 8 or 9 Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
under the Command of <hi>Don Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Comacho.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I proceed further, 'tis fit I
deliver my Obſervations concerning the
River <hi>de la Plata,</hi> and the Countries
through which it runs. In thoſe Parts
'tis call'd the <hi>Paraguay,</hi> but more vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Great <hi>Parana;</hi> probably, becauſe
the River of <hi>Parana</hi> falls into it above
the Town <hi>de las Corrientes.</hi> 'Its Mouth
(which lies in the 35th. Degree of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Latitude,</hi> on that ſide the <hi>Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Line</hi>) is between <hi>Cape de Caſtillos</hi> and
<hi>Cape de Sant Antonio,</hi> about 80 Leagues
diſtant from each, Tho' it be deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
every where, yet the commoneſt
Road into it, and moſt us'd by Sailors
is on the North-ſide, from <hi>Caſtillos</hi> to
<hi>Montvidio,</hi> which is half-way to <hi>Buenos
Ayres,</hi> and notwithſtanding there is a
Channel on the ſame North-ſide from
<hi>Montvidio</hi> to <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> the ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
place in which is Three Fathom deep,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60479:112"/>
yet for more ſecurity they croſs over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Monvidio</hi> into the South Channel,
becauſe 'tis broader and has Three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
and a half Water at leaſt where
'tis ſhalloweſt; all the bottom is muddy
till within 2 Leagues of <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi>
where lyes a ſand Bank, there they take
in Pilots to Steer them to a place call'd
the <hi>Poſſo</hi> juſt before the Town, diſtant
a Cannon ſhot from Shore, wherein no
Veſſels may enter but ſuch as have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thoſe that
have no ſuch permiſſion are oblig'd to
Anchor a League Lower. The River is
full of Fiſh, but of them there are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more than Seven or Eight ſorts good
to eat, there are abundance of thoſe
Whales call'd <hi>Gibars,</hi> and Sea-dogs who
commonly bring forth their young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and whoſe Skin is fit for ſeveral
uſes. I was told that about 5 or 6 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came there, the River was almoſt
dry'd up for ſome days, no Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left but only in the middle Channel,
and there ſo little, that they forded it
on Horſeback, as one may do moſt of
the Rivers that fall into that <hi>de la Plata,</hi>
in which there are likewiſe a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Otters,</hi> with whoſe Skins the Savages
Cloath themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60479:113"/>
The Country on the North-ſide of
the River <hi>de la Plata</hi> is of great extent,
Inhabited by none but Savages, call'd
<hi>Charuas;</hi> moſt of the little Iſlands that
lie all along the River, and the Shore
ſides are cover'd with Woods full of
Wild Boars. From <hi>Cape de Caſtillos</hi> up
to <hi>Rio Negro,</hi> as well as from the ſame
<hi>Cape</hi> to <hi>San Paulo</hi> bordering upon <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil;</hi>
the Coaſts are uninhabited, tho' the
Country, eſpecially along the River
ſeems to be very good, having little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets
running down from the Hills thro'
the Plains. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſettled firſt
there, but afterwards remov'd to <hi>Buenos
Ayres,</hi> becauſe 'twas troubleſom to croſs
over the great <hi>Parana</hi> to go to <hi>Peru.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went aſhore frequently beyond <hi>Rio
Negro,</hi> but never farther than Three
quarters of a League into the Land,
there are but few Savages to be ſeen, and
they have their Habitations a good way
up in the Country; thoſe I met with
were well made, with long Hair and
very little Beard; they wear nothing but
a great Skin, made of little ones patch'd
together, that hangs down to their heels,
and a piece of Leather under their Feet,
ty'd with Straps about their Ankles. For
Ornament they bind a Fillet of ſome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60479:113"/>
Stuff about their Heads, which comes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Fore-head, and keeps the Hair
back behind. The Women have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Garment but theſe Skins, which
they gird about their Waſtes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their heads with a ſort of little Hats
made of Ruſhes of divers Colours.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Rio Negro</hi> to <hi>Las Corrientes</hi> and
the River of <hi>Parana,</hi> the Country is
well ſtockt with Bulls and Cows, there
are likewiſe a great many Stags, whoſe
Skins they ſell for right Buff. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
about <hi>Rio Negro</hi> are the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the Sea thither, that keep Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with thoſe of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi>
and the <hi>Caſiques,</hi> and <hi>Couracas</hi> their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
do Hommage to the Governor of
that Place, from whence they are but
about 20 Leagues diſtant. One of the
chief <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Towns on that ſide is <hi>Las
Siete Corrientes,</hi> Situate near the place
where the Two Rivers <hi>Paraguay</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana</hi>
meet. Upon the <hi>Parana</hi> ſtand
Three or Four Villages pretty far from
each other, and thinly Peopled, tho'
the Country be very proper for Vine-yards,
and has enough planted already
to ſupply the Neighbouring Parts with
Wine. The Inhabitants are under the
Juriſdiction of a Governour reſident at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60479:114"/>
                     <hi>Aſſomption,</hi> which is the moſt important
Place the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and ſtands higher up the River <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raguay</hi>
on the North-ſide; 'tis the Metra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan
City, a Biſhop's Seat, has ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
very neat Churches and Convents,
and is well crowded with Inhabitants,
becauſe a great many Idle People, and
ſuch as have run out their Fortunes and
can live no longer in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi>
flock thither as to their laſt refuge. The
Land abounds in Corn, Millet, Sugar,
Tobacco, Honey, Cattle, Oaks fit for
Shipping, Pine-Trees for Maſts, and
particularly in that Herb, call'd, the
<hi>Herb of Paraguay,</hi> which they drive a
great Trade in all over the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi>
and this obliges the Merchants of <hi>Chili</hi>
and <hi>Peru,</hi> to hold a Correſpondence
with thoſe of <hi>Paraguay;</hi> becauſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Herb (with which they make a
refreſhing Liquor with Water and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
to be drank lukewarm) the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Peru,</hi> Savages and others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that work in the Mines, could
not ſubſiſt, for the Soil of the Country
being full of Mineral Veins, the Vapours
that riſe out of the Ground ſuffocate
them, and nothing but that Liquor can
recover them again, which revives and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60479:114"/>
reſtores them to their former Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                  <p>In this City of <hi>Aſſomption,</hi> the Native
<hi>Indians,</hi> as well as <hi>Spaniards</hi> are very
courteous and obliging to Strangers.
They indulge themſelves in a great deal
of liberty, even with reſpect to Women,
inſomuch that being often neceſſitated
to Sleep in the open Air (becauſe of the
exceſſive Heat) they ſpread their Quilts
in the Streets, and lie there all Night
Men and Women together: Nor is any
Body ſcandaliz'd at it. Having plenty of
all things good to eat and drink, they
give themſelves up to Eaſe and Idleneſs,
and don't much trouble themſelves with
Trading abroad, nor heaping up Money,
which upon that account is very ſcarce
among 'em, contenting themſelves with
trucking the Commodities of their own
Product, for others more neceſſary and
uſeful to them.</p>
                  <p>Further up in the Country, that is to
ſay, towards the Head of the River <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay,</hi>
in the Province of <hi>Paraguay,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Settlements of Colonies, tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thither by the <hi>Jeſuits Miſſionaries,</hi>
that prevail'd upon the Savages in thoſe
Parts, who are naturally tractable, to
quit their Woods and Mountains, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60479:115"/>
come and dwell together in Villages in
a Civil Community, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
them in the Chriſtian Religion,
taught them Mechanicks, to play upon
Muſical Inſtruments, and ſeveral other
Arts covenient to Human Life. <hi>Thus
the Miſſionaries who came upon a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Motive, are largely recompenc'd by
the Temporal Advantages which they reap
here.</hi> The report that there were Golden
Mines in this Country, could not be
kept ſo cloſe, but that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had
ſome inkling of it, and among others,
<hi>Don Hiacinto de Laris</hi> Governor of <hi>Bue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Ayres,</hi> who about the Year 1653, had
orders from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to go
and viſit theſe Settlements, and examine
into their Wealth. At firſt coming he
was well receiv'd, but perceiving that
he began to inſpect their Riches, and
ſearch for Gold, The Savages who are
ſhy of working in the Mines, took up
Arms, and forc'd him and his Followers
Fifty in Number to depart out of their
Country. The Governor who ſucceeded
him, inform'd himſelf more particularly
of this matter, and to make the beſt uſe
of his Intelligence, inter'd into a ſtrict
Alliance with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of his own
Government, who hold a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60479:115"/>
with the reſt of their Fraternity;
and having got a conſiderable Sum from
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for leave to Trade at
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> he engag'd the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to
furniſh him 100000 Crowns in Gold for
the value in Silver, for lightneſs of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
But this ſame Governor being
arreſted by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Order,
for permitting the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Trade at
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> his Gold was ſeiz'd and
confiſcated, which upon trial prov'd to
be much finer than that of <hi>Peru,</hi> and by
this and other Circumſtances, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
that it came from the Mines
found out by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>On the South-ſide of the River <hi>de la
Plata,</hi> from <hi>Cape Sant Antonio,</hi> to within
30 Leagues of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> 'tis dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sailing, becauſe of the Banks that
lie in the way; wherefore they always
go on the North-ſide, as I ſaid before,
till they come up ſo far, then they croſs
over to the South-ſide which is very ſafe;
eſpecially when the Wind blows againſt
the Stream of the River and ſwells it;
for when a Weſterly Wind blows from
Land, the Water falls; however when
the Water is at the loweſt, 'tis Three
Fathom and a half deep, both in the
North and South Channels. When we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60479:116"/>
enter'd into the South-Channel, we came
in ſight of thoſe Vaſt Plains extending to
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and thence as far as the
River <hi>Salladillo,</hi> 60 Leagues ſhort of
<hi>Cordoua,</hi> which are ſo cover'd with all
ſorts of Cattle, that notwithſtanding
multitudes of them are daily deſtroy'd
for their Skins, there's no Sign of their
diminution.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we arriv'd at the <hi>Cape</hi> of
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> we gave notice of it to
the Governor, who underſtanding that
we had the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Licence for
coming thither, (without which he
could not have permitted us entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, unleſs he would have broke
his Orders) he ſent the Kings Officers
on board to viſit our Ship, according to
cuſtom, which done, we landed our
Goods, and laid them up in a Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
hired for the time of our ſtay.
They conſiſted chiefly in Linnen Cloath,
particularly that made at <hi>Rouen,</hi> which
goes off very well in thoſe Parts, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in Silks, Ribans, Thread, Needles,
Swords, Horſe-ſhoes, and other Iron-work,
Working-tools of all ſorts, Drugs,
Spices, Silk and Wollen-Stockings,
Woollen-Cloath, Serges, and other
Woollen-Stuffs, and generally in every
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60479:116"/>
thing fit for Cloathing: which as we
were inform'd were proper commodities
for thoſe Parts. Now the Cuſtom is,
that as ſoon as a Licens'd Ship (that is
to ſay which has the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Permiſſion) comes to <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> The
Governor of the Place, or Captain of
the Ship diſpatches a Meſſenger to <hi>Peru,</hi>
with the Letters from <hi>Spain,</hi> if he has
any; or elſe to acquaint the Merchants
with his Arrival, whereupon ſome of
them immediately ſet out to <hi>Buenos Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
or elſe ſend Commiſſions to their
Correſpondents, to buy up what Wares
they think convenient. 'Twas my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be ſent upon both theſe Errands,
for among a great many Letters that
we brought with us, was a large pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
from his Catholick Majeſty for
<hi>Peru,</hi> enclos'd in a Leaden Box, as all the
Diſpatches from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court to the
<hi>Indies</hi> commonly are; to the end, that if
the Ship that carries them ſhould be in
eminent peril of falling into an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Hands, they might be flung over
board and ſunk. This Pacquet was
entruſted to my care, wherein were
many Letters to the Vice-Roy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi>
and other Prime Officers in thoſe
Parts, ſignifying the Birth of the Prince
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60479:117"/>
of <hi>Spain:</hi> and I carry'd likewiſe an
Inventory atteſted by the Kings Officers
at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> of the greateſt part of
our Lading, to be ſhewn to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of <hi>Potoſi;</hi> they rely'd upon the
conditions of the Goods as ſpecified in
the Inventory, and ſo bargain'd for what
they lik'd, but their effects did not come
to 'em till Seven or Eight Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>A Deſcription of Buenos Ayres.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I ſay any thing of my Journy
to <hi>Peru,</hi> I will ſet down what I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
remarkable at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> whilſt
I tarry'd there. The Air is pretty tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
much as 'tis in <hi>Andalouſia,</hi> but
not quite ſo warm, the Rains fall almoſt
as often in Summer as Winter; and the
Rain in ſultry weather uſually breeds
divers kinds of Toads, which are very
common in this Country, but are not
venemous. The Town ſtands upon a
riſing Ground on the ſide of the River
<hi>de la Plata,</hi> a Muſquet ſhot from the
Channel, in an Angle of Land made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60479:117"/>
by a little Rivulet, call'd <hi>Riochuelo,</hi>
which falls into the River a quarter of
a League from the Town; it contains
400 Houſes, has no encloſure, neither
Wall nor Ditch, and nothing to defend
it but a little Fort of Earth ſurrounded
with a Ditch, which commands the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and has Ten Iron Guns, the biggeſt
of which is a Twelve Pounder; there
the Governor reſides who has but 150
Men in Garriſon, which are form'd into
Three Companies Commanded by Three
Captains, whom he appoints at will, and
indeed he changes them ſo often, that
there is hardly a Wealthy Citizen but has
been a Captain; theſe Companies are not
always full, becauſe the Souldiers are
drawn by the cheapneſs of Living in
thoſe Parts to deſert frequently, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they endeavour to keep
them in the Service by a large pay, which
is <hi>per diem</hi> Four Reals, worth 1 <hi>s. 6 d.
Engliſh,</hi> and a Loaf of 3 <hi>d. ob.</hi> which
is as much as one Man can eat. But the
Governor keeps 1200 tame Horſes in a
Plain thereabouts for his ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and in caſe of neceſſity to mount
the Inhabitants of the Place, and form
a ſmall Body of Cavalry. Beſides this
Fort, there is a little Baſtion at the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60479:118"/>
Mouth of the Rivulet wherein they
keep Guard, there are but Two Iron-Guns
mounted upon it, each carrying a
Three Pound Ball; this commands the
place where the Barks come aſhore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
or take in goods, which are liable
to be viſited by the Officers of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
when they lade and unlade. The
Houſes of the Town are built of Earth,
becauſe there is but little Stone in all
thoſe Parts up as far as <hi>Peru;</hi> they are
thatch'd with Canes and Straw, have
no Stories, all the Rooms are of
a Floor, and are very Spacious; they
have great Court-yards, and behind
their Houſes large Gardens full of
Orange-trees, Lemon-trees, Fig-trees,
Apple-trees, Pear-trees, and other Fruit-trees,
with ſtore of Herbs, Cabbages,
Onions, Garlick, Lettice, Peas, Beans,
and eſpecially their Melons are excellent,
the Soil being very fat and good; they
live very commodiouſly, and except
Wine, which is ſomething dear; they
have plenty of all ſorts of Victuals, as
Beef, Veal, Mutton, Veniſon, Hares,
Coneys, Pullets, Ducks, Wild-geeſe,
Partridges, Pidgeons, Turtles, and all
kind of Wild-fowl; and ſo cheap, that
one may buy Partridges for a Penny a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60479:118"/>
piece, and the reſt proportionably.
There are likewiſe abundance of Oſtriches
who herd in Flocks like Cattle, and tho'
they are good Meat, yet none but the
Savages eat of them. They make Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brellas
of their Feathers, which are very
commodious in the Sun; their Eggs are
good, and every body eats of 'em, tho'
they ſay they are of hard Digeſtion. I
ſaw one thing of theſe Creatures very
remarkable, and that is, while the Hen
ſits upon the Eggs, they have the Inſtinct
or Foreſight to provide for their Young;
ſo five or ſix days before they come out
of the Shell, they ſet an Egg in each of
the four Corners of the place where they
ſit, theſe Eggs they break, and when they
rot, Worms and Maggots breed in 'em
in prodigious numbers, which ſerve to
nouriſh the Young Oſtriches from the
time they are hatch'd till they are able to
go farther for their ſuſtenance. The
Houſes of the better ſort of Inhabitants
are adorn'd with Hangings, Pictures,
and other Ornaments and decent Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and all that are tollerably well to
paſs are ſerv'd in Plate, and have a
great many Servants, <hi>Blacks, Moulatos,
Meſtices, Indians, Cabres,</hi> or <hi>Sambos,</hi>
who are all Slaves. The <hi>Negroes</hi> come
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60479:119"/>
from <hi>Guinea;</hi> the <hi>Moulatos</hi> are begotten
by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> upon a <hi>Black;</hi> the <hi>Meſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are born of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and an <hi>Indian,</hi>
and the <hi>Sambos</hi> of an <hi>Indian</hi> Man and a
<hi>Meſtice,</hi> all diſtinguiſhable by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Hair. They employ theſe
Slaves in their Houſes, or to cultivate
their Grounds, for they have large Farms
ſtock'd with Grain in abundance, as
Wheat, Barley and Millet, or to look
after their Horſes and Mules, who feed
upon nothing but Graſs all the Year
round, or to kill Wild-Bulls, or in fine
to do any kind of Service. All the Wealth
of theſe Inhabitants conſiſts in Cattle,
wich multiply ſo prodigiouſly in this
Province, that the Plains are quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with 'em, particularly with Bulls,
Cows, Sheep, Horſes, Mares, Mules, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Swine, Deer, and others, inſomuch
that were it not for a vaſt number of
Dogs, who devour the Calves and other
young Beaſts, they would over-run the
Country, they make ſo great profit of
the Skins and Hides of theſe Annimals,
that a ſingle Inſtance will be ſufficient to
ſhew how far it might be improv'd by
good hands: The 22 <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships that
we found at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> were each of
them laden with 13 or 14000 Bull-hides
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60479:119"/>
at leaſt, which amount to above 300000
<hi>Livers,</hi> or 33500 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> bought by
the <hi>Dutch</hi> at Seven or Eight <hi>Reals</hi> a
piece, that is under an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, and
ſold again in <hi>Europe</hi> for Twenty-five
Shillings <hi>Engliſh</hi> at leaſt. When I expreſs'd
my aſtoniſhment at the ſight of ſuch
an infinite number of Cattle, they told
me of a Stratagem ſometimes made uſe
of, when they apprehend a deſcent from
any Enemies, that is matter of greater
wonder, and 'tis this; they drive ſuch
a Herd of Bulls, Cows, Horſes and other
Animals to the Shore-ſide, that 'tis utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impoſſible for any number of Men,
even tho' they ſhould not dread the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thoſe Wild Creatures, to make
their way through ſo great a drove of
Beaſts. The Firſt Inhabitants of this
place, put every one their mark upon
thoſe they could catch, and turn'd 'em
into their encloſures, but they multiply'd
ſo faſt, that they were forc'd to let 'em
looſe, and now they go and kill them
according as they want 'em, or have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to make up a quantity of Hides
for Sale. At preſent they mark only
thoſe Horſes and Mules which they catch
to tame and breed up for Service. Some
Perſons make a great Trade of ſending
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60479:120"/>
them to <hi>Peru,</hi> where they yield 50 <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi>
or 11 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling</hi> a pair.
Moſt of the Dealers in Cattle are very
Rich, but of all the Trading People the
moſt conſiderable are they that Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
in <hi>European</hi> Commodities. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of whom are reputed worth 2 or
300000 Crowns, or 67000 <hi>l. Sterling.</hi>
So that a Merchant worth no more than
15 or 20000 Crowns is look'd upon as
a mean Retailer; of theſe laſt there are
near 200 Families in the Town, that
make 500 Men bearing Arms, beſides
their Slaves who are three times that
Number, but are not to be reckon'd of
any Defence, becauſe they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to bear Arms: Thus the <hi>Spaniards,
Portugueſe,</hi> and their Sons (of whom
thoſe that are born upon the place are
term'd <hi>Criolos,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from
the Natives of <hi>Spain</hi>) and ſome <hi>Meſtices</hi>
are the Militia, which with the Souldiers
in Garriſon, compoſe a Body of above
600 Men, as I computed them in ſeveral
Muſters, for they draw out on Horſe-back
Three times a Year near the Town
on Feſtival Days. I obſerv'd there were
many Old Men among them that did not
carry Fire-arms, but only a Sword by
their ſide, a Lance in hand, and a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60479:120"/>
at their ſhoulder: Th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

of them Marry'd and Matters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and conſequently have no great
ſtomach to Fighting. They love their
Eaſe and Pleaſure, and are entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to <hi>Venus;</hi> I confeſs they are in
ſome meaſure excuſable in this point,
for moſt of their Women are extreamly
pretty, well ſhaped, and clear skin'd;
and withal ſo faithful to their Husbands,
that no Temptations can prevail with
them to looſen the Sacred Knot: But
then if their Husbands tranſgreſs, they
are often puniſh'd with Poiſon or Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Women are more in Number
than the Men. Beſides <hi>Spaniards,</hi> there are
a few <hi>French, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Genoueſe,</hi>
but all go for <hi>Spaniards,</hi> otherwiſe there
would be no dwelling for them there,
eſpecially thoſe that differ in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from the <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> becauſe
the Inquiſition is ſettled there.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop's Revenue amounts to
3000 <hi>Patagons,</hi> or 700 <hi>l. Sterling per
Annum.</hi> His Dioceſs takes in this Town
and <hi>Santa Fe,</hi> with the Farms belonging
to both; Eight or Ten Prieſts Officiate

                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60479:121"/>

                     <p>I Left <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and took the Road
to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> leaving <hi>Santa Fe</hi> on my

'tis a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Settlement dependant
upon <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> the Commander is
no more than a Lieutenant, and does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but by order from the Governor
of <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> 'Tis a little place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
25 Houſes, without any Walls,
Fortifications, or Garriſon, diſtant 80
Leagues from <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> Northward,
Situate upon the River <hi>de la Plata,</hi> large
Veſſels might come up to it, were it not
for a great bank that obſtructs the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
a little above <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
'tis a very advantageous Poſt,
becauſe 'tis the only paſſage from <hi>Peru,
Chili</hi> and <hi>Tucuman</hi> to <hi>Paraguay,</hi> and in a
manner the Magazine of the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60479:121"/>
drawn from thence, particularly that
Herb already ſpoken of, which they
cannot be without in thoſe Provinces.
The Soil is as good and Fertile here as
at <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi> and the Town having
nothing remarkably different from what
has been obſerv'd of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> I
leave it, and proceed upon my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
'Tis counted 140 Leagues from
<hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> and becauſe
ſome parts of the Road are uninhabited
for a long way together; I furniſhed
my ſelf at my departure with what I
was inform'd I ſhould ſtand in need
of; ſo I ſet out having a Savage for my
Guide, with Three Horſes and Three
Mules, ſome to carry my Baggage, and
the reſt to change upon the way when
that I rid upon was tired.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> to the River <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
and even as far as the River <hi>Recife,</hi>
30 Leagues, I paſs'd by ſeveral Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Farms cultivated by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
but beyond <hi>Recife</hi> to the River
<hi>Salladillo,</hi> I ſaw none. Let it be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the way, that theſe Rivers as well
as all the reſt in the Provinces of <hi>Buenos
Ayres, Paraguay</hi> and <hi>Tucuman,</hi> that fall
into the River <hi>de la Plata</hi> are fordable
on Horſe-back; but when the Rains or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60479:122"/>
any other accident ſwells them, a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
muſt either ſwim over, or elſe get
upon a bundle in the nature of a raft,
which a Savage hawls over to the other
ſide. I could not Swim, and ſo was
forc'd to make uſe of this expedient
twice or thrice when I could not find a
Ford. The way was this, my <hi>Indian</hi>
kill'd a Wild Bull, flead the Hide off,
ſtuffed it with ſtraw, and ty'd it up in
a great bundle with thongs of the ſame
Hide, upon which I plac'd my ſelf with
my Baggage; he ſwam over hawling me
after him by a Cord ty'd to the bundle,
and then he repaſs'd and ſwam my Horſes
and Mules over to me.</p>
                     <p>All the Country between the River
<hi>Recife</hi> and <hi>Salladillo,</hi> tho' uninhabited,
abounds in Cattle and all ſorts of Fruit-trees,
except Walnut and Cheſnut-trees;
there are whole Woods of Nectarine-Trees,
Three or Four Leagues in compaſs,
that bear excellent Fruit, which they
not only eat raw, but bake them, or dry
them in the Sun, to keep, as we in <hi>France</hi>
do Prunes: They ſeldom uſe any other
than the Wood of this Tree for common
firing at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and thereabouts.
The Savages that dwell in theſe Parts are
diſtinguiſh'd into two ſorts, thoſe that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60479:122"/>
voluntarily ſubmit to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
call'd <hi>Panpiſtas,</hi> the reſt <hi>Serranos,</hi> both
cloathed with Skins, but the laſt ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Panpiſtas</hi> as their mortal Enemies
wherever they meet with them. All
Fight on Horſe-back, either with Lances
pointed with Iron or Bones ſharpen'd,
or elſe with Bows and Arrows, they
wear Bulls-hides faſhion'd like a Doublet
without ſleeves, to defend their Bodies.
Their Chiefs that command over them
in War and Peace, are call'd <hi>Couracas.</hi>
When they take any one of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
alive or dead, they meet all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and after they have reproach'd him,
that either he or his Relations were the
death of their Kindred or Friends, they
cut and tear him into pieces, which they
roaſt a little and eat, making a drinking
Bowl of his Scull. They feed moſtly
upon fleſh either raw or dreſs'd, and
particularly Colts fleſh, which they like
better than Veal. They catch abundance
of Fiſh likewiſe in their Rivers. They
have no ſettled places of aboad, but
ramble up and down, ſeveral Families
together, and live in Tents.</p>
                     <p>I could not inform my ſelf exactly
what Religion they were of, but I was
told that they look'd upon the Sun and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60479:123"/>
Moon as Deities, and as I travell'd along,
I ſaw a Savage upon his knees with his
Face to the Sun, who cry'd out and
made ſtrange geſtures with his Hands
and Arms. I learn'd from the Savage that
accompany'd me, that he was one of
thoſe they call'd <hi>Papas,</hi> who in the
Morning kneel towards the Sun, and at
Night towards the Moon, to ſupplicate
thoſe fancy'd Divinities to be propitious
to them, to give them fair Weather, and
Victory over their Foes.</p>
                     <p>They make no great Ceremony in
their Marriages; but when a Relation
dies, after they have rubb'd his body
with a certain Earth that conſumes all but
the Bones, they preſerve them, and carry
as many of them as they can convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about with them in a ſort of Cheſts,
and this they do in token of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to their Kindred; indeed they
are not wanting in good Offices to them
during their Lives, nor in their Sickneſs
and Death.</p>
                     <p>Along the River <hi>Salladillo,</hi> I took
notice of a great many Parrats, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagays,
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them, and
certain Birds, call'd Guacamayos, which
are of divers Colours, and twice or thrice
as big as a Parrat. The River it ſelf is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60479:123"/>
full of the Fiſh, call'd <hi>Dorado,</hi> which is
very good to eat. There is alſo a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in it, whether 'tis Meat or Poyſon
no body knows, it has Four Feet and a
long Tail like a Lizard.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Salladillo</hi> quite to <hi>Cordoua,</hi> you
go along a very fine River, that abounds
with Fiſh, which is neither wide nor
deep, for it may be forded over. On
the Bank of it you meet with little Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
every Three or Four Leagues;
which are like Country Houſes inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Spaniards, Portugueſe,</hi> and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
who have all the neceſſary acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations
of Life they can wiſh, and
are very Civil and Charitable to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
their principal Wealth is in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Mules, in which they Trade with
the Inhabitants of <hi>Peru.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cordoua</hi> is a Town Situate in a pleaſant
and fruitful Plain upon the ſide of a
River, bigger and broader than that I
have juſt ſpoken of: 'Tis compos'd of
about 400 Houſes, Built like thoſe of
<hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> It has neither Ditches,
nor Walls, nor Fort for its defence; He
that Commands it is Governor of all the
Provinces of <hi>Tucuman;</hi> and tho' it be
the place of his ordinary Reſidence, yet
he is wont now and then, as he ſees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60479:124"/>
to go and paſs ſome time at <hi>St.
Jago de l' Eſtro,</hi> at <hi>St. Miguel de Tucuman,</hi>
(which is the Capital City of the Province)
at <hi>Salta</hi> and at <hi>Xuxui.</hi> In each of theſe
Villages there is a Lieutenant, who has
under him an <hi>Alcalde</hi> and ſome Officers
for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. The
Biſhop of <hi>Tucuman</hi> likewiſe uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
at <hi>Cordoua,</hi> where the Cathedral
is the only Pariſh Church of the whole
Town; but there are divers Convents of
Monks, namely of <hi>Dominicans, Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,</hi>
and thoſe of the Order <hi>de la Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi>
and one of Nunns. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
have a College there, and their Chappel
is the fineſt and richeſt of all.</p>
                     <p>The Inhabitants are Rich in Gold and
Silver, which they get by the Trade
they have for Mules, with which they
furniſh <hi>Peru</hi> and other Parts; which is
ſo conſiderable, that they ſell about 28
or 30000 of 'em every Year, which they
breed up in their Farms. They uſually
keep 'em till they are about Two Years
old, then expoſe 'em to Sale, and have
about Six <hi>Patagons</hi> a piece for 'em. The
Merchants that come to buy 'em, carry
'em to St. <hi>Jago,</hi> to <hi>Salta</hi> and <hi>Xuxui,</hi>
where they leave 'em for Three Years,
till they are well grown and become
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60479:124"/>
ſtrong, and afterwards bring 'em to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,</hi>
where they preſently have Vent for
'em, becauſe there as well as in the reſt
of the Weſtern part of <hi>America,</hi> the
greateſt part of their Carriage is upon
Mules. The People of <hi>Cordoua</hi> alſo
drive a Trade in Cows, which they have
from the Countrey of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and
carry to <hi>Peru,</hi> where without this way
of Subſiſtance 'tis certain they would
have much ado to live. This kind of
Traffick makes this Town the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in the Province of <hi>Tucuman,</hi>
as well for its Riches and Commodities,
as for the Number of its Inhabitants,
which are counted to be at leaſt 5 or
600 Families, beſides Slaves who are
three times the number. But the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of 'em of all degrees have no other
Arms but a Sword and Poignard, and
are very indifferent Souldiers, the Air
of the Country, and the Plenty they
enjoy, rendring them Lazy and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Cordoua</hi> I took the way of St.
<hi>Jago de l' Eſtro,</hi> which is 90 Leagues
diſtant from it. In my Journey I from
time to time, that is Seven or Eight
Leagues, met with ſingle Houſes of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
and <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who live very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60479:125"/>
they are all Situate upon ſmall
Rivulets, ſome of 'em at the Corners of
Forreſts which are frequently to be met
with in that Country, and are almoſt
all of <hi>Algarobe</hi>-wood, the Fruit of which
ſerves to make a Drink that is ſweet
and ſharpiſh, and heady as Wine; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of them in open Fields, which
are not ſo well ſtock'd with Cattle,
as thoſe of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> but however
there are enough of 'em, and indeed
more than needs for the ſubſiſtance of the
Inhabitants, who alſo make a Trade of
Mules, and Cotton, and Cocheneil for
dying, which the Country produces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Jago de l' Eſtro</hi> is a Town of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
300 Houſes, without Ditches or
Walls, Situate in a flat Country, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Forreſts of <hi>Algarobe;</hi> it
lies on an indifferently large River, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
for Boats, and pretty well ſtor'd
with Fiſh. The Air is very hot, and
ſultry, which makes the Inhabitants la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
and effemminate. Their Faces are all
very Tawny; they are mightily given
to their Divertiſements, and mind Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
very little. There are 300 Men that
can bear Arms, taking in as well the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages
as Slaves, and they are all ill
Arm'd, and but very mean Souldiers.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60479:125"/>
The greateſt part of the Women are
handſome enough, but have generally a
kind of ſwelling in the Throat, which
they call <hi>Coto</hi> in the Language of the
Country, and ſeems to be much the ſame
with what we call a Wen. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is ſufficiently ſtor'd with Wild-Fowl,
Venizon, Wheat, Rye, Barley; and
Fruits, as Figgs, Peaches, Apples, Pears,
Plumbs, Heart-Cherries, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
There are abundance of Tigers, that are
very fierce and ravenous; Lions that
are very gentle; and Guanacos that are
as big as Horſes, with very long Necks,
little Heads, and very ſhort Tails, in
the Stomachs of theſe Creatures the
<hi>Bezoar</hi>-ſtone is found. There are Four
Churches in this Town, namely the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Church,
that of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that of
the <hi>Recollect Friers,</hi> and one more.
Here the Inquiſitor of the Province of
<hi>Tucuman</hi> has his reſidence; he is a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Prieſt, and has Commiſſaries or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
under him, whom he places in
all the other Towns of the Province.</p>
                     <p>After I had continued Three Days at
<hi>St. Jago,</hi> I went from thence to <hi>Salta,</hi>
which is 100 Leagues from it, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>St. Miguel</hi> of <hi>Tucuman</hi> on the left
hand, which is a Town under the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60479:126"/>
of <hi>St. Jago,</hi> I took the Road of
<hi>Eſſeco,</hi> finding in my way ſome little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
of <hi>Spaniards</hi> here and there, and
very few Savages. The Country is flat,
and conſiſts partly of Fruitful Plains,
and partly of Forreſts full of Algarobe
and Palm-trees; which bear Dates ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
leſs than thoſe in the Eaſt-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as well as many other ſorts of Trees
and Plants, amongſt others, thoſe that
yield Pitch, and thoſe that produce Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheneil
and Cotton. There are divers
ſmall Lakes, about which there are great
quantities of Salt produc'd, which is us'd
by the People of that Country. I ſtay'd
one day at <hi>Eſſeco,</hi> to prepare my ſelf
ſome Proviſions to live upon. It's Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is upon a very handſome broad
River, which yet may be foarded on
Horſeback. This Town was formerly as
big and as conſiderable as <hi>Cordona,</hi> but
is now ruin'd, there being not above 30
Families left in it, for the reſt deſerted
it, becauſe of the great number of Tigers
that infeſted 'em, devouring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and ſometimes Men when they
could ſurprize 'em, beſides an incredible
number of Venemous Flies, that ſting
very ſmartly, with which the Country
is fill'd for four or five Leagues about
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60479:126"/>
the Town; ſo that there's no going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
without being mask'd. This
Country is alſo ſufficiently Fruitful in
Wheat, Barley, Vines, and other Fruit-trees;
and would abound in Cattle if the
Tigers did not devour 'em.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Eſſeco</hi> to <hi>Salta</hi> is 15 Leagues:
And this ſpace of Land, would be like
that I have juſt now ſpoken of, but that
it is Gravelly in ſome places. One may
eaſily diſcern <hi>Salta</hi> about 2 Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one comes at it; becauſe it ſtands
in the middle of a fine Plain, which
is fertile in Corn, Grapes, and other
ſorts of Fruit, Cattle, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of Life: Encompaſs'd in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with Hills, and ſome pretty high
Mountains. The Town is upon the
bank of a Little River, over which there
is a Bridge: It may contain about 400
Houſes, and 5 or 6 Churches and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
the Structure of which, is like that
of thoſe I have before deſcrib'd. 'Tis
not encompaſs'd with any Walls, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
or Ditches; but the Wars the
Inhabitants have had with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
have train'd them in Martial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and render'd 'em more careful
to have Arms in a readineſs than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
They are about 500 Men, who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60479:127"/>
all bear Arms, beſides Slaves, Moulatos,
and Blacks, who are three times as many.
'Tis a place of great reſort, becauſe of
the conſiderable Trade they have, in
Corn, Meal, Cattle, Wine, Salted Meat,
Tallow, and other Commodities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they Trade with the Inhabitants of
<hi>Peru.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Twelve Leagues beyond it lies <hi>Xuxui,</hi>
which is the laſt Town of <hi>Tucuman</hi> on
the ſide of <hi>Peru.</hi> There are up and down
on the Road a great many Cottages or
Farms, and more than in any other
place, tho' the Country is not ſo pleaſant
nor ſo fruitful, being almoſt nothing
elſe but Hills and Mountains. This
Town of <hi>Xuxui</hi> contains about 300
Houſes: 'Tis not very full of People,
becauſe of the continual Wars the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of it, as well as thoſe of <hi>Salta,</hi>
have with the Savages of the Valley of
<hi>Calchaqui,</hi> who are continually haraſing
of 'em. The Cauſe that ſet theſe Wars
on Foot is as follows; The Governor
of <hi>Tucuman, Don Alonſo de Mercado,</hi>
and <hi>de Villa Corta,</hi> having receiv'd Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that the Houſe of the laſt <hi>Incas</hi>
or Kings of <hi>Peru,</hi> which was call'd the
White-houſe, was in this Valley, and
that there was a great deal of Treaſure
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60479:127"/>
there, which the Natives kept as a mark
of their Ancient Grandeur, gave advice
of it to his Catholick Majeſty, and
begg'd leave to make a Conqueſt of it,
and ſubject it to his Government, as it
had far'd with ſo many other places
which he obtain'd. To accompliſh his
deſign, he thought meet to employ <hi>Don
Pedro Bohoriers</hi> a Moor, and Native of
<hi>Eſtramadura,</hi> as being a Perſon who had
been accuſtom'd to converſe with Savage
People, and was capable of carrying on
Intreagues amongſt 'em, and ſo more fit
than another, to make this deſign ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
but the buſineſs had a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Event. For this <hi>Bohoriers,</hi> when
he was got among the Savages of this
Valley, and had gain'd their Affections,
inſtead of acquitting himſelf of his
Commiſſion, endeavor'd to eſtabliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Power amongſt 'em, in which he
ſucceeded ſo well, that by his Craft and
good addreſs, he brought 'em to chooſe
and acknowledge him for their King;
after which he declar'd himſelf againſt
this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Governor, and began a War
with him towards the end of 1638, and
ſeveral times routed him and his Forces,
which gave occaſion to ſeveral of the
<hi>Indian</hi> Natives, that were under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60479:128"/>
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to throw of their
Yoke, and joyn with the People of
this Valley, who by theſe additions have
render'd themſelves ſomewhat formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Hither alſo the Slaves of <hi>Peru,</hi>
particularly thoſe that ſerve in the Mines,
fly, when they can find an opportunity
to make their eſcape: And the ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
they find here, draws a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 'em to this place; inſomuch that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not have half Men
enough to work in the Mines, if they
did not get Negros from <hi>Congo, Angola,</hi>
and other places on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi>
by means of divers <hi>Genoeſe</hi> that go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to fetch 'em, and ſell 'em to them
at a price concerted between 'em.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Xuxui</hi> to <hi>Potoſi</hi> they count
a 100 Leagues, the way is very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome,
and there is but this one Road
to go from <hi>Tucuman</hi> to <hi>Peru.</hi> Two
Leagues from <hi>Xuxui</hi> I began to advance
to the Mountains, between which there's
a little and very narrow Valley, that
reaches as far as <hi>Omagoaca,</hi> which is 20
Leagues beyond, and along it there runs
a ſmall River, which one is oblig'd to
paſs and repaſs very often. Before you
are got 4 Leagues in this Road, you
meet with Vulcanos, or Burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60479:128"/>
full of Sulphurous matter, which
break out in Flames from time to time,
and ſometimes burſt open and throw
quantities of Earth into the Valley, which
makes the way ſo dirty when a Rain
comes ſoon after it, as it almoſt always
happens, that ſometimes you muſt be
forc'd to ſtay Five or Six Months, or till
the Summer comes to dry it to make it
paſſable. Theſe Vulcanos continue for
2 Leagues upon this Road, and in all
this ſpace, there are no Houſes either of
<hi>Spaniards</hi> or Savages, but beyond it all
along as far as <hi>Omagoaca,</hi> there are a
great many little Cottages, inhabited on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Indians,</hi> and depending on ſome
Towns of theirs, which are govern'd by
their Chiefs, whom they call <hi>Couracas,</hi>
who have a Cacique over them, whoſe
Orders they obey, and whoſe reſidence
is at <hi>Omagoaca,</hi> which is a Town of 200
Houſes, built of Earth, and ſtanding in
no good Order. The Land about it is none
of the beſt, however they ſow Wheat
there, and a great quantity of Millet,
which the <hi>Indians</hi> ordinarily uſe. As
for Cattle, they have very few, and
commonly eat Beef dry'd in the Sun,
which is brought them by thoſe that
Trade with 'em; they have alſo Goats
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60479:129"/>
and Sheep of their own Product.</p>
                     <p>The moſt of theſe Savages are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
and live according to the Rules
of the Roman Catholick Religion; they
have a Church at <hi>Omagoaca,</hi> which is
ſupplied with Prieſts, who go from time
to time to celebrate Maſs there: Theſe
Prieſts dwell at <hi>Socchoa,</hi> which is the
Plantation of <hi>Don Paulo d' Obaudo,</hi> who
is a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but born in this Country,
and is Lord Proprietor of it, which
contains not only all the Valley of <hi>Oma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goaca,</hi>
but likewiſe a great ſpace of Land
beyond, and is a Country of about 60
or 80 Leagues in extent, where there are
a great many <hi>Vigognes</hi> of whoſe Wool this
Lord makes a very conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
He takes theſe Creatures with a great
deal of eaſe by means of his Subjects the
<hi>Indians,</hi> who have no other trouble than
that of making a great Incloſure with
Nets about a Foot and a half high, to
which they tie a great many Feathers
that are blown to and fro by the Wind,
after which the Savages hunt theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and drive 'em within the Nets, as
they do Wild-Boars in <hi>France</hi> into the
Toils; when this is done, ſome come
on Horſe-back within the compaſs of
Ground in which they are inclos'd, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60479:129"/>
while the poor Beaſts dare not go near
the Nets for fear of the Feathers that
play about 'em, they with certain Bowls
faſtened to Cords, knock down and
kill as many of 'em as they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Omagoaca</hi> to <hi>Mayo,</hi> they count
it 30 Leagues, &amp; there's nothing to be
met with along this way, but a very
few Plantations of Savages, becauſe 'tis
ſo very Cold here in the Winter, that
'tis hard to be endur'd.</p>
                     <p>The way from <hi>Mayo</hi> to <hi>Toropalca</hi> is
through very pleaſant Plains, there are
Two hundred Houſes in the Town, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by Catholick Savages, only one
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> lives there with his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>Beyond <hi>Toropalca,</hi> is the Country of
<hi>Chichas</hi> which is very Mountainous, and
is ſtor'd with divers Mines of Gold and
Silver, and Work-houſes where they
prepare the Metal. 'Tis 25 Leagues in
extent as far as <hi>Potoſi,</hi> where I arriv'd
after a Journey of Sixty three Days.</p>

                     <head>A Deſcription of the City of Potoſi,
and the Mines there.</head>
                     <p>I Was no ſooner alighted from my
Horſe, at a Merchants Houſe to
whom I had been recommended, but I
was conducted by him to the Preſident
of the Provinces of <hi>Los Charcas,</hi> to
whom the Order I carried from the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> was directed, as the Principal
Director of his Catholick Majeſty's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in this Province, in which <hi>Potoſi</hi> is
Situate, which is the place of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Reſidence, altho' the City <hi>de la
Plata</hi> is the Capital. After I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Order to him, I was brought
to the Corregidor, to deliver that which
belong'd to him, and afterwards to thoſe
other Officers for whom I brought Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
they all receiv'd me very well,
particularly the Preſident, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with a Chain of Gold for the
good News I had brought him.</p>
                     <p>But before we go any farther 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
I ſhould give ſome deſcription
of the City of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> as I have done of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60479:130"/>
others. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call it the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
City, but no body could ever tell
me for what reaſon; 'tis Situate at the
Foot of a Mountain, call'd <hi>Arazaſſou,</hi>
and divided in the midſt by a River,
which comes from a Lake inclos'd with
Walls, which lies about a quarter of a
League above the City, and is a kind of
reſerver to hold the Water that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the Work-houſes of that part
of the City, which is on this ſide of the
River, over againſt the Mountain, is
rais'd upon a little Hill, and is the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt inhabited part; for on
that which is on the ſide of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there's ſcarce any thing but Engines
and the Houſes of thoſe that Work in
'em. The City has neither Walls, Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
nor Forts for its defence, there are
reckon'd to be 4000 Houſes well built
of good Stone, with ſeveral Floors, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the Buildings in <hi>Spain.</hi>
The Churches are well made, and all
richly adorn'd with Plate, Tapeſtry,
and other Ornaments, and above all
thoſe of the Monks and Nunns, of
whom there are ſeveral Convents of
different Orders, which are very well
furniſh'd. This is not the leaſt populous
City of <hi>Peru,</hi> with <hi>Spaniards, Meſtices,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60479:131"/>
Strangers,</hi> and <hi>Natives</hi> (which laſt the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Indios</hi>) with <hi>Moulatos</hi> and
<hi>Negroes.</hi> They count there are between
3 and 4000 Natural <hi>Spaniards</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arms, who have the Reputation of
being very ſtout Men and good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The number of the <hi>Meſtices</hi> is not
much leſs, nor are they leſs expert at a
Weapon, but the greateſt part of 'em,
are Idle, apt to quarrel and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
therefore they commonly wear
Three or Four Buff-waſt-coats one upon
another, which are proof againſt the
point of a Sword, to ſecure themſelves
from private ſtabs. The Strangers there
are but few, there are ſome <hi>Dutch, Iriſh,</hi>
and <hi>Genoeſe;</hi> and ſome <hi>French,</hi> moſt of
whom are of <hi>St. Malo, Provence</hi> or <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi>
and paſs for People of <hi>Navarre</hi>
and <hi>Biſcaye.</hi> As for the <hi>Indians</hi> they are
reckon'd to amount to near 10000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the <hi>Moulatos</hi> and the <hi>Blacks:</hi> but
they are not permitted to wear either
Swords or Fire-Arms, no not their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racas
and Caciques, tho' they may all
aſpire to any degree of Knight-hood,
and to Benefices, to which they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
rais'd, for their laudable Actions,
and good Services. They are alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to wear the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> habit, but
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60479:131"/>
are oblig'd to cloath themſelves in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner, in a cloſe-coat without
ſleeves, which they wear next their Shirts,
to which their Band and lac'd Cuffs are
faſten'd, their Breeches are wide at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion; their Legs
and Feet naked. The <hi>Blacks</hi> and <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latos</hi>
being in the Service of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
are habited after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Mode, and may bear Arms, and all the
<hi>Indian</hi> Slaves after Ten Years ſervice are
ſet at liberty, and have the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
with the others. The Government
of this City is very exact, by the Care
which is taken by Twenty four Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
who are conſtantly obſerving,
that good orders be kept in it; beſides
the Corregidor and Preſident of <hi>Los Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
who directs Officers after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Spain.</hi> It is to be obſerv'd, that
excepting theſe two Principal Officers,
as well at <hi>Potoſi</hi> as every where elſe in
the <hi>Indies,</hi> all the People, whether
Knights, Gentlemen, Officers or others,
are concern'd in Commerce: of which
ſome of them make ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that in the City of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> there
are ſome reckon'd to be worth, Two,
ſome Three, and ſome Four Millions of
Crowns; and a great many worth Two,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60479:132"/>
Three, or Four hundred thouſand
Crowns. The common People to live
much at their eaſe, but are all proud and
haughty, and always go very fine, either
in Cloth of Gold and Silver, or in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
or Silk trimmed with a great deal
of Gold and Silver-Lace. The Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Houſes is very Rich, for
they are generally ſerv'd in Plate. The
Wives both of Gentlemen and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
are kept very cloſe, to a degree
beyond what they are in <hi>Spain;</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go abroad, unleſs it be to go to
Maſs, or to make ſome Viſit, or to ſome
publick Feaſt; and that but rarely. The
Women here are generally addicted to
exceſs in taking Coca: This is a Plant
that comes from the ſide of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> which
when it is made up in Rowls and dry'd
they chew, as ſome do Tobacco; they
are ſo heated, and ſometimes abſolutely
fuddled by it, that they have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of themſelves at all: 'Tis likewiſe
often us'd by the Men, and has the ſame
effects upon them. They are otherwiſe
very Temperate in eating and drinking,
tho' they have before dwelt in places
well ſtor'd with all ſort of Proviſions,
as Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Venizon, raw
and preſerv'd Fruits, Corn and Wine,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60479:132"/>
which are brought hither from other
parts, and ſome from a great diſtance,
which makes theſe Commodities dear, ſo
that the meaner ſort of People; eſpecially
thoſe that have very little before-hand,
would find it hard enough to live there,
if Money were not very plenty, and
eaſie to be got by them that are willing
to work.</p>
                     <p>The beſt and fineſt Silver in all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
is that of the Mines of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of which are found in the Mountain
of <hi>Aranzaſſe,</hi> where beſides the prodigious
quantities of Silver that have been taken
out of Veins, in which the Mettal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear'd, and which are now
exhauſted, there is almoſt as great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of it found in places where they
had not digg'd before; nay from ſome
of the Earth which they threw aſide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
when they open'd the Mines, and
made Pits, and Croſs-ways in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
they have taken Silver, and have
found by this, that the Silver has been
form'd ſince that time, which ſhews how
proper the Quality of this Ground is
for the production of that Metal: But
indeed this Earth does not yield ſo much
as the Mines that are found by Veins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rocks. There are beſides
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60479:133"/>
theſe another ſort of Veins of Earth
which they call <hi>Paillaco,</hi> which are as
hard as a Stone, and of the Colour of
Clay, which were ſlighted heretofore,
and yet as Experience has ſince taught,
were not ſo contemptable as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd;
ſince Silver is got out of 'em
with ſo little Charge, that there is no
inconſiderable profit found in the Work.
Beſides the Mines of this Mountain, there
are a great many others about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
at a greater diſtance, that are pretty
good, amongſt others thoſe of <hi>Lippes,</hi>
of <hi>Carangas,</hi> and of <hi>Porco;</hi> but thoſe
of <hi>Ouroures</hi> that have been lately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
are better.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> does not cauſe any
of theſe Mines to be wrought on his
own account, but leaves 'em to thoſe
Perſons that make the Diſcovery of 'em,
who remain Maſters of 'em after the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regidor
has viſited 'em, and declar'd
'em Proprietors, on the accuſtom'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and Privileges. The ſame Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regidor
deſcribes and marks out the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfices
of the Ground, in which they
are allow'd to open the Mine on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
which does not for all that, limit
or reſtrain their work under-ground;
every Man having liberty to follow the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60479:133"/>
Vein he has found, let the extent and
depth of it reach never ſo far, tho' it
ſhould croſs that which another has dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
near it. All that the King reſerves
for himſelf, beſides the Duties we ſhall
hereafter ſpeak of, is to give a general
direction by his Officers, for all the
work of the Mines, and to order the
number of Savages to be employ'd in 'em;
to prevent the diſorders that would ariſe,
if every Proprietor of the Mines ſhould
have liberty to ſet as many of 'em to
work as he pleas'd; which would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
give occaſion to thoſe that are
moſt powerful and Rich, to ingroſs and
have ſo great a Number of 'em, that few
or none would remain for others to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
to keep their work going forward:
for this would be contrary to the Kings
Intereſt, which is to make Proviſion that
that there be a ſufficient number of Slaves
for all the Mines that are open'd. For
this end he obliges all the <hi>Couracas</hi> or
Chiefs of the Savages, to furniſh every
one a certain number, which they muſt
always keep compleat, or elſe are forc'd
to give twice as much Money as would
have been paid in Wages to thoſe that
are wanting, if they had been preſent.
Thoſe that are deſtin'd for the Mines of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60479:134"/>
                        <hi>Potoſi,</hi> don't amount to above Two
thouſand and two or three hundred,
theſe are brought and put into a great
Encloſure which is at the Foot of the
Mountain, where the Corregidor makes
a diſtribution of 'em to the Conductors
of the Mines, according to the Number
they want, and after Six days conſtant
Work, the Conductor brings 'em back
the Saturday following to the ſame place,
where the Corregidor cauſes a review to
be made of 'em, to make the owners of
the Mines give 'em the Wages that are
appointed 'em, and to ſee how many
of 'em are dead, that the <hi>Couracas</hi> may
be oblig'd to ſupply the number that is
Wanting: for there's no Week paſſes but
ſome of 'em die, either by divers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
that Occur, as the tumbling down of
great quantities of Earth, and falling of
Stones, or by Sickneſs and other Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
They are ſometimes very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded
by Winds that are ſhut up in
the Mines; the coldneſs of which joyn'd
to that of ſome parts of the Earth, chills
'em ſo exceſſively, that unleſs they
chew'd <hi>Coca,</hi> which heats and fuddles
'em, it would be intolerable to 'em. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
great hardſhip which they ſuffer is,
that in other places, the Sulphurous and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60479:134"/>
Mineral Vapours are are ſo great, that it
ſtrangely drys 'em up, ſo that it hinders
'em from free reſpiration; and for this
they have no other remedy, than the
Drink which is made with the Herb of
<hi>Paraguay,</hi> of which they prepare a great
quantity to refreſh and moiſten 'em,
when they come out of the Mines at the
times appointed for eating or ſleeping;
this Drink ſerves 'em alſo for Phyſick
to make 'em Vomit, and caſt up what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
incommodes their Stomachs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
theſe Savages they ordinarily
chooſe the beſt Workmen to break up
the Oar between the Rocks; this they
do with Iron-barrs, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
call <hi>Palancas,</hi> and other Inſtruments of
Iron; others ſerve to carry what they
digg in little Baskets to the entrance of
the Mine; others to put it in Sacks, and
load it upon a ſort of great Sheep, which
they call <hi>Carneros de la Tierra,</hi> they are
taller than Aſſes, and commonly carry
Two hundred Pound weight; theſe ſerve
to carry it to the Work-houſes which are
in the Town along the River, which
comes from the Lake I have ſpoken of
before. In theſe Work-houſes which are a
Hundred and twenty in Number; the
Oar is refined, of which take the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60479:135"/>
account. They firſt beat it well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Anvils with certain great Hammers,
which a Mill continually keeps at work,
when they are pretty well reduc'd to
Powder, they paſs it thro' a fine Sieve,
and ſpread it upon the Ground about
half a Foot thick in a ſquare place that
is very ſmooth, prepar'd for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
then they caſt a great deal of
Water upon it, after which they with
a Sieve ſpread upon it a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Quick-ſilver, which is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by the Officers of the Mint, and
alſo a Liquid ſubſtance of Iron, which
is prepar'd by Two Millſtones, one of
which is fix'd, and the other is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turning, between theſe they put an
Old Anvil, or ſome other Maſſy piece
of Iron, which is worn away and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
with Water by the turning Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
ſo that 'tis reduc'd to a certain
Liquid Matter. The Oar being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd,
they ſtir it about and mix it, as
Men do when they make Mortar, for a
Fortnight together, every day temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with Water; and after this they
ſeveral times put it into a Tub, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is a little Mill, which by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſeparates from it all the Earth with
the Water, and caſts 'em off together,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60479:135"/>
ſo that nothing but the Metallick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
remains at the bottom, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
put into the Fire in Crucibles,
to ſeparate the Quick-ſilver from it,
which is done by Evaporation, for as
for the Iron ſubſtance, that does not
Evaporate, but remains mix'd with the
Silver, which is the reaſon that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Eight Ounces (for example ſake)
Three quarters of an Ounce or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts
of falſe Alloy.</p>
                     <p>The Silver when thus refin'd is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the Mint, where they make an
Eſſay of it whether it be of the right Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy,
after which it is melted into Barrs
or Ingots, which are weigh'd, and the
fifth part of 'em deducted, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the King, and are ſtamp'd with
his mark; the reſt appertain to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
who in like manner applies his
mark to them; and takes 'em away from
thence when he pleaſes in Barrs, or elſe
converts 'em into Reals and other Money.
This fifth part is the only profit the King
has from the Mines, which yet are
eſteem'd to amount to ſeveral Millions;
But beſides this, he draws conſiderable
Sums by the ordinary Impoſitions upon
Goods, without reckoning what he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
upon Quick-ſilver, both that which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60479:136"/>
is taken out of the Mines of <hi>Guancave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
which are Situated between <hi>Lima</hi>
and <hi>Cuſco;</hi> and that which is brought
from <hi>Spain,</hi> with which Two Veſſels
are loaded every Year, becauſe that
which is taken out of theſe Mines is not
ſufficient for all the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They uſe divers ways of Carriage, to
Tranſport all the Silver that is annually
made about <hi>Potoſi</hi> for <hi>Spain;</hi> firſt they
Load it upon Mules, that carry it to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
which is a Port on the South-Sea,
from whence they Tranſport it in ſmall
Veſſels to the Fort of <hi>Lima,</hi> or <hi>Los
Reys,</hi> which is a Fort upon the ſame
Sea, Two Leagues from <hi>Lima;</hi> here
they Embark it with all that comes from
other parts of <hi>Peru,</hi> in Two great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
that belong to his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
each of which carry 1000 Tuns,
and are Arm'd each with 50 or 60 Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Canon; theſe are commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a great many ſmall
Merchant Ships as Richly Loaded, which
have no Guns but a few Petareroes to
give Salutes; and take their Courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Panama,</hi> taking care always to ſend
a little Pinnace 8 or 10 Leagues before
to make diſcoveries. They might make
this way in a Fortnights time, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60479:136"/>
the help of the South-wind which
reigns alone in this Sea; yet they never
make it leſs than a Months Voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by this delay the Commander of
the Gallions makes a great advantage in
furniſhing thoſe with Cards that have a
mind to play on Ship-board, during the
Voyage, which amounts to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Sum, both becauſe the Tribute
he receives is Ten Patagons for every
Pack of Cards, and becauſe there is a
prodigious quantity of 'em conſum'd,
they being continually at play; and
there being ſcarce any body aboard, but
is concern'd for very conſiderable Sums.
When the Gallions arrive at <hi>Panama</hi> on
the Continent, they put their Lading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoar,
and wait to hear of thoſe from
<hi>Spain,</hi> who commonly about the ſame
time, or a little after, arrive at <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belo,</hi>
which is 18 Leagues from the
North-Sea; in the mean time they carry
thither part of the Gold, Silver, and other
Commodities of this Fleet which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
for <hi>Europe,</hi> upon Mules by Land,
and part by Water upon the River of
<hi>Chiagre,</hi> in Boats made of an entire piece
of Wood call'd <hi>Piragouas.</hi> A few days
after they are unladen, and after the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
are likewiſe arriv'd from <hi>Spain;</hi> a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60479:137"/>
very great Fair is held there, for a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
together, in which they Sell and
Barter all ſorts of Goods neceſſary for
each Country; which is perform'd with ſo
much honeſty, that the Sale is made only
by the Inventories, without opening the
Bales, without the leaſt Fraud. The Fair
being ended, they all retire to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to which they reſpectively belong.
The Gallions that are to return into
<hi>Spain,</hi> go to <hi>Havana,</hi> in the Iſland of
<hi>Cuba,</hi> where they wait for the Arrival of
the Flota of <hi>la Vera-Crux</hi> in <hi>New Spain;</hi>
as ſoon as that has joyn'd 'em, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their Courſe together, paſſing thro'
the Channel of <hi>Bahama</hi> along the Coaſt
of <hi>Florida,</hi> they touch at the Iſland of
<hi>Bermudos,</hi> where they commonly meet
with Advice of the State of Affairs in
<hi>Europe,</hi> and with orders to direct them
how to avoid any diſaſters, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their Voyage in ſafety. As for
the Gallions of <hi>Peru,</hi> after they have
taken in a new Cargo at <hi>Panama,</hi> they
return to <hi>Lima,</hi> ſteering divers Courſes,
becauſe of the Contrariety of the Wind,
which keeps 'em Two or Three Months
at Sea. Being there, they diſpoſe of
what they have for <hi>Peru:</hi> And the reſt
of the Goods is taken off by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60479:137"/>
of <hi>Chili,</hi> who give a great many
Commodities of their Country in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for 'em; as Goats-leather, which
in the Language of the Country is call'd
<hi>Cordouan,</hi> Cordage, Hemp, Pitch and
Tar, Oyls, Olives, and Almonds, and
above all a great quantity of Duſt of
Gold, which is taken out of the Rivers
of <hi>Capiapo, Coquinbo, Baldivia,</hi> and others
which fall into the South-Sea. And now
we are ſpeaking of the Commodities of
<hi>Chili,</hi> ſome ſmall matter muſt be ſaid
concerning this great Province or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
At the Mouths of thoſe Rivers,
of which I have juſt been ſpeaking, there
are good Ports, and Cities, each of which
conſiſt of about 4 or 500 Houſes, and
thoſe ſufficiently ſtock'd with People.
The moſt conſiderable Cities upon the
Sea-Coaſt, are <hi>Baldivia, la Conception,
Copiapo</hi> and <hi>Coquinbo. Baldivia</hi> is Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and has a Garriſon in it, uſually
compos'd only of Baniſh'd Men, and
Malefactors of the <hi>Indies;</hi> the Three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are Cities of Trade. Farther up
in the Countrey is <hi>St. Jago de Chili,</hi>
which is the Capital of all <hi>Chili,</hi> where
there is likewiſe a ſtrong Garriſon, and
ſome regular Troops, by reaſon of the
continual War they have with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60479:138"/>
call'd <hi>Aoucans.</hi> Beyond it in the
Mountains, lies the little Province of
<hi>Chicuito,</hi> of which the principal Places
are <hi>St. Juan de la Frontera,</hi> and <hi>Mendoca,</hi>
round about theſe Towns, there grows
a great deal of Corn, and abundance of
Vines, which furniſh the Country of
<hi>Chili,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Tucuman</hi> as far
as <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three Weeks after my Arrival at <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſi;</hi>
there were great rejoycings made
for the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which laſted for a Fortnight together,
during which time all Work ceaſed,
throughout the City, in the Mines, and in
the Adjacent places, and all the People
great and ſmall, whether <hi>Spaniards, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
Indians,</hi> or <hi>Blacks,</hi> minded
nothing elſe but to do ſomething extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
for the Solemnizing of this
Feſtival. It began with a Cavalcade,
made by the Corregidor, the Twenty
four Magiſtrates of the City, the other
Officers, the Principal of the Nobility
and Gentry, and the moſt eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the City; all richly Cloth'd.
All the reſt of the People, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Ladies being at the Windows,
and caſting down abundance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd
Waters, and great quantities of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60479:138"/>
dry Sweet-meats. The following days
they had ſeveral Plays, ſome of which
they call <hi>Juegos de Toros,</hi> others <hi>Juegos
de Cannas,</hi> ſeveral ſorts of Maſquerades,
Comedies, Balls, with Vocal and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Muſick, and other Divertiſements,
which were carry'd on one day by the
Gentlemen, another day by the Citizens;
one while by the Gold-ſmiths, another
while by the Miners; ſome by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of divers Nations, others by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
and all with great Magnificence,
and a prodigious Expence. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings
of the <hi>Indians</hi> deſerve a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
remark, for beſides that they
were richly cloth'd, and after a different
manner, and that Comical enough; with
their Bows and Arrows; they in one
Night and Morning, in the Chief Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
place of the City, prepar'd a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the form of a Labyrinth, the Plats
of which were adorn'd with Fountains
ſpouting out Waters, furniſhed with all
ſorts of Trees and Flowers, full of
Birds, and all ſorts of Wild-beaſts, as
Lions, Tygers and other kinds; in the
midſt of which they expreſs'd their Joy
a Thouſand different ways, with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Ceremonies. The laſt day
ſave one ſurpaſs'd all the reſt, and that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60479:139"/>
was a Race at the Ring, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
at the Charge of the City with
very ſurpizing Machines. Firſt there
appear'd a Ship Tow'd along by Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
of the bulk and burden of a 100
Tuns, with her Guns and Equipage of
Men cloth'd in Curious Habit, her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
Ropes, and Sails ſwelling with
the Wind, which very luckily blew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Street through which they
drew her to the great publick place,
where as ſoon as ſhe arriv'd, ſhe ſaluted
the Company, by the diſcharge of all
her Canon; and at the ſame time a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Lord, repreſenting an Emperor of
the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> coming to Congratulate the
Birth of the Prince, came out of the
Veſſel attended with Six Gentlemen, and
a very fine Train of Servants that led
their Horſes, which they mounted, and
ſo went to ſalute the Preſident of <hi>Los
Charcas,</hi> and while they were making
their Compliment to him, their Horſes
kneel'd down, and kept in that Poſture,
having been taught this Trick before.
They afterwards went to ſalute the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regidor,
and the Judges of the Field,
from whom when they had receiv'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to run at the Ring againſt the
Defendants, they acquitted themſelves
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60479:139"/>
with great Gallantry, and receiv'd very
fine prizes diſtributed by the hands of
the Ladies. The Race at the Ring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finiſh'd, the Ship and a great many
other ſmall Barks that were brought
thither advanc'd to attack a great
Caſtle wherein <hi>Cromwel</hi> the Protector,
who was then in War with the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> was feign'd to be ſhut up; and
after a pretty long Combat of Fire-works;
the fire took hold of the Ship,
the ſmall Barkes, and the Caſtle and
all was conſum'd together. After this
a great many pieces of Gold and Silver
were diſtributed and thrown among the
People in the Name of his Catholick
Majeſty: And there were ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons that had the prodigality to
throw away Two or Three Thouſand
Crowns a Man among the Mob. The
Day following theſe Rejoycings were
concluded by a Proceſſion, made from
the great Church to that of the Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
in which the Holy Sacrament was
carry'd, attended with all the Clergy
and Laiety; and becauſe the way from
one of theſe Churches to the other had
been unpav'd for the Celebration of the
other Rejoycings, they repair'd it for
this Proceſſion with Barrs of Silver,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60479:140"/>
with which all the way was entirely
cover'd. The Altar where the Hoſt was
to be Lodg'd in the Church of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects
was ſo furniſh'd with Figures,
Veſſels, and Plates of Gold and Silver,
adorn'd with Pearles, Diamonds, and
other Precious Stones, that ſcarce ever
could any thing be ſeen more Rich:
For the Citizens brought thither all the
rareſt Jewels they had. The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Charge of this whole time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
was reckon'd to amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
500000 Crowns.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Divertiſements being ended, the
reſt of the time that I continued at <hi>Potoſi,</hi>
was employ'd in compleating the Sale
of the Goods, the Inventories of which I
had brought with me, and I oblig'd my
ſelf to cauſe theſe Goods to be deliver'd
in a certain time at <hi>Xuxui,</hi> and to pay
all the Charge of Carriage ſo far. I
took moſt of my Payment in Silver,
namely in Patagons, Plate, Barrs, and
Pignas, which is Virgin-ſilver; and the
reſt in <hi>Vigogne</hi> Wool, and when I had
quite finiſh'd the buſineſs for which I
was ſent to <hi>Potoſi;</hi> I left the place to
return to <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> the ſame way I
came. I loaded all my Bales upon Mules,
which is the ordinary way of Carriage
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60479:140"/>
to paſs the Moutains which divide <hi>Peru</hi>
from <hi>Tucuman.</hi> But when I was arriv'd
at <hi>Xuxui,</hi> I thought meet to make uſe of
Waggons, which is much more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
and thus I continu'd my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels;
and after a Journey of 4 Months
happily arriv'd at the River of <hi>Lucan;</hi>
which is 5 Leagues from <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi>
where I met with <hi>Ignatio Maleo,</hi> who
was got thither before me; he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the River in a little Boat, which
we reſolv'd to make uſe of, to convey
moſt of the Silver I had brought with
me, privately to our Ship; we thought
meet to take this Courſe to avoid the
riſque we muſt have run of being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated,
if we had brought our Veſſel by
<hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> becauſe of the Prohibition
of the Exportation of Gold and Silver,
tho' this order is not always very regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
obſerv'd, the Governour ſometimes,
ſuffering it to be carried out privately,
Conniving at it, for ſome preſent, or
elſe not being very ſtrict in taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not omit here to tell the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not ſuffer the
Silver of <hi>Peru,</hi> and of other Neighbouring
Provinces to be Tranſported by the River
of <hi>la Plata,</hi> nor all ſorts of Veſſels to go
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60479:141"/>
and Trade there without Permiſſion:
It is from this Conſideration, that if
they ſhould give way to a free Trade
on that ſide, where the Country is good
and Plentiful, the Earth Fruitful, The
Air wholeſome, and Carriage Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious;
the Merchants that Trade in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru,
Chili,</hi> and <hi>Tucuman,</hi> would ſoon
quit the way of the Gallions, and the
Ordinary Paſſages through the North
and South-Seas, and through the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
which is difficult and Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and would take the way of <hi>Bue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos
Ayres:</hi> And this would infallibly
cauſe moſt of the Cities of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to be deſerted, where the Air is
bad, and the Neceſſaries and Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Life are not to be had in ſuch
plenty.</p>
                     <p>When we had ſecur'd our Silver by
the precaution we had us'd, I came to
<hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> with the reſt of our Goods;
where I was no ſooner Arriv'd, but our
return to <hi>Spain</hi> was reſolv'd on. But
leaſt any thing ſhould be found on board
us to give occaſion for any Seizure, when
the Kings Officers ſhould make their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Viſit on our Veſſel, before it went out
of the Port; we thought convenient at
firſt to Embark only thoſe Commodities
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60479:141"/>
that took up the moſt room, as <hi>Vigogne</hi>
Wool, Leather of ſeveral ſorts, amongſt
others 16000 Bulls-hides, with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Bales and Cheſts belonging to the
Paſſengers that were to return with us, and
about 30000 Crowns in Silver, which is
the largeſt Sum that is permitted to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, to ſupply all neceſſary charges that
may occur in the Voyage, and to pay off
the Ship. But after this Viſit was made,
we made an end of Embarking the Silver
we had hidden, which with the reſt of the
Lading might amount to about Three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of Livers.</p>
                     <p>We parted from <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> in the Month
of <hi>May</hi> 1659, in company of a <hi>Dutch</hi>
Veſſel, Commanded by <hi>Iſaac de Brac,</hi> which
was alſo richly Laden; he engag'd us to
ſteer our Courſe with him, becauſe his Ship
leak'd; and this fault increaſing in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of the Voyage, we were oblig'd to put
in at the Iſland of <hi>Fernande de Lorona,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
3 Degrees and a half of the Line on the
South-ſide. It prov'd well for us, as well
as for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that we ſtop'd here. For
having a mind for fear of the worſt to take
in a new Proviſion of Freſh-Water here,
we perceiv'd the greateſt part of that we had
taken in at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> was run out, and
of a Hundred Barrels, which we thought we
had remaining of our Store; we had but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60479:142"/>
Thirty left. Therefore tho' the Water we
found there had a very flat Taſte, and had
this ill quality, that it preſently caſt them
that drank of it into a Looſeneſs, we were
however neceſſitated to fill our Barrels with
it. And an Accident unhappy enough
befell thoſe of our Men that went to fetch
it from the Rock out of which it ſprang,
for having ſtripp'd themſelves almoſt naked,
to work the more commodiouſly, the heat
of the Sun ſcorch'd 'em ſo vehemently, that
it made their Bodies all over red, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe parts upon which the Sun dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its Rays with the greateſt violence, were
full of Buboes and Puſtules, which were
very troubleſome, and made 'em very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
for a Fortnights Time.</p>
                     <p>I went aſhore to ſee this Iſland, which is
about a League and an half in compaſs, and
uninhabited. One of our Pilots told me
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> poſſeſs'd it, while they held
<hi>Fermanbues</hi> in <hi>Braſil,</hi> and that they had a
ſmall Fort there, ſome ſmall remains of
which were ſtill left, that they ſow'd Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
and Beans there, of which they had a
tolerable Crop, and that they bred up a
great many Fowls, Goats and Hogs. We
ſaw a great number of Birds, of which ſome
were good to eat; we continu'd there
Four days, but when we ſaw the <hi>Dutch</hi>
could not be ſo ſoon in a condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60479:142"/>
their Voyage, being oblig'd to put
their Cargo aſhore, and to lay their Veſſel
upon one ſide to refit; we ſet ſail, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Voyage ſufficiently troubleſome by
the Storms we ſuffer'd, which ſometimes
drove us towards the Coaſts of <hi>Florida,</hi> and
ſometimes upon others, we at laſt diſcover'd
the Coaſts of <hi>Spain.</hi> Inſtead of going to
<hi>Cadiz,</hi> being under apprehenſions of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who were ſtill at War with
the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> we thought convenient to
make to <hi>St. Andero,</hi> where we happily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
about the middle of <hi>August.</hi> We were
immediatly inform'd that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
came to Moor at the ſame Port in their
return from <hi>Mexico,</hi> for the ſame reaſon
that brought us thither, and that they ſet
Sail but Two days before our Arrival. And
becauſe the Officers of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
that had been ſent to 'em were ſtill there,
we thought beſt to treat with them, as well
to ſave the Fine we had incurr'd, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the place from whence we were
ſent out, as that we might not be troubled
with a viſit from them. And for 4000 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagons,
which we preſented 'em, we were
excus'd and exempted from any ſearch. We
therefore put our Silver and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
aſhore there, part of which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſent to <hi>Bilboa,</hi> and part to <hi>St. Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
where in a little time they were ſold
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60479:143"/>
and diſtributed to ſeveral Merchants, who
Tranſported 'em to divers places to put 'em
off. When we had finiſhed the Sale of all
our Commodities, there was an exact account
ſtated among thoſe that were concern'd in
the Ship, both of their Charge and Profit of
this Voyage; about the detail of which I
ſhall not trouble my head. I ſhall only ſay,
to give a ſhort account of it in Groſs, that
the Charge conſiſted firſt in 290000 Crowns
employ'd in buying the Goods with which
our Veſſel was Loaded at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Dues of Exportation from <hi>Spain.
74000 Livers</hi> for the Freight of the Veſſel
for 19 Months, at the rate of 3200 <hi>Livers
per</hi> Month, 43000 <hi>Livers</hi> more for the pay
of 76 Seamen great and ſmall for the time,
at the rate of 10 Crowns <hi>per</hi> Month one
with another. 30000 Crowns ſpent in
Victualling the Ship for that time, as well
for the Ships Crew as for the Paſſengers,
there being a very good Proviſion made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in thoſe long Voyages beyond the
Line the Sailers muſt have good Suſtenance,
and the Paſſengers muſt have a great many
Sweet-meats, good Liquors, and other Coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. More 2000 Crowns for the
Dues of Entry at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to the Officers of the Place; and 1000
Crowns in Cuſtom at our going from
thence; more in Expences, Impoſts and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60479:143"/>
Charges in carrying our Goods from <hi>Buenos
Ayres</hi> to <hi>Potoſi,</hi> and from <hi>Potoſi</hi> to <hi>Buenos
Ayres,</hi> at the rate of 20 Crowns for a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or 100 weight; more 4000 Crowns to
procure an Exemption from being ſearch'd
and viſited at our return to <hi>Spain.</hi> And in
fine ſome other Expences, as well in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of Entry, when we Landed our
Goods in <hi>Spain,</hi> as in ſome other things not
fore-ſeen, which did not amount to any
great Sums. Theſe were almoſt all the
Principal Articles of the Charge, which
being deducted and paid, the Profit was
found to amount to 250 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
that which was got by the Hides,
which came to 15 <hi>Livers</hi> a piece, that being
the Ordinary Price, tho' they coſt but a
Crown at the firſt hand; and likewiſe what
was got by the Paſſengers, of whom we had
above 50 on board us, as well in going as
coming, which was not inconſiderable; for
one Man who had nothing but his Cheſt
paid 800 Crowns, and the reſt paid propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
for their Paſſage and Diet.</p>
                     <p>We were told at <hi>St. Andero,</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Veſſels which we had ſeen at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi>
were ſafely arriv'd at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but that
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador being inform'd that
they came from the River <hi>de la Plata,</hi> and
had brought thence a prodigious Quantity
of Silver and other Commodities, as well
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60479:144"/>
on the account of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, as
for ſeveral <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had taken the
opportunity of the return of theſe Veſſels to
come back into <hi>Europe,</hi> and had remitted
their Money from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Cadiz</hi> and
<hi>Sevil</hi> by Bills of Exchange, beſides the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Goods which they ſent thither, had
given advice of it to the Council for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who judged this Money
and theſe Effects liable to Confiſcation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Prohibited from
Trading upon Forreign Veſſels, and from
Tranſporting Silver to any other place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Spain;</hi> and accordingly had ſeiz'd and
confiſcated the greateſt part of 'em, the reſt
being ſaved by the precautions ſome of the
Merchants took, who were not ſo much in
haſte as the others. The ſame Embaſſador
having remonſtrated at the ſame time, what
would be the Conſequence of Tolerating
Strangers to continue to trade in the River
of <hi>Plata,</hi> without putting any reſtraint
upon 'em, the Council had ſo much regard
to his advice, as to Equip a Veſſel with all
ſpeed at <hi>St. Sebaſtian,</hi> which they Loaded
with Arms and Men, to ſend to <hi>Buenos
Ayres</hi> with very ſtrict orders, as well to ſeize
the Perſon of the Governor for having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels to come and Trade
in the Country, as to take an exact account
of the Acquaintance and Intelligence the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60479:144"/>
                        <hi>Dutch</hi> had gotten there, as alſo to reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
things ſo well there, in fortifying the
Garriſons, and in Arming them better than
they had yet been in time paſt, that for the
Future they might be in a condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
Forreigners, and to hinder their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
and Communication in the Country.
Soon after our Arrival, <hi>Ignatio Maleo</hi> the
Captain of our Ship, receiv'd an Order
from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to come to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
to inform the Council for the <hi>Indies</hi> of the
Condition in which he found and left
things at <hi>Buenos Ayres:</hi> He was deſirous
that I would accompany him thither, which
I did. As ſoon as we arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> he
gave in the Memories, not only of all he
had obſerv'd in the River of <hi>Plata,</hi> but
alſo of the means that might be us'd to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Strangers from having the leaſt thoughts
of Trading there, and that firſt by keeping
Two good Men of War at the Mouth of
the River, to diſpute and hinder the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of ſuch Merchant Ships as ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to go up to <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi> in the
ſecond place by ſending every Year Two
Ships Loaded with all things the People of
thoſe parts have occaſion for. That being
this way ſufficiently ſupply'd, they might
have no thoughts of favouring the deſcent
and entrance of Strangers, when they ſhould
come thither. He moreover made a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60479:145"/>
of changing the uſual Way of carrying
Goods, which are ſent to <hi>Peru,</hi> and brought
them by the Way of the Gallions; that it
might be ſettled on the River of <hi>Plata,</hi> from
whence he aſſur'd 'em, the Carriage of 'em
by Land to <hi>Peru,</hi> would be more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
perform'd, and at a cheaper Rate, as
well as with leſs Riſque, than any other
Way. But of all theſe Propoſals the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Spain</hi> reliſh'd only that of ſending
to <hi>Buenos-Ayres</hi> Two Veſſels laden with
Commodities proper for the Country. And
<hi>Maleo</hi> having obtain'd a Grant, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for this Purpoſe, upon the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it, we return'd to <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> to
make Preparation for this Voyage, and to
ſet our Affairs in order; which we ſo well
diſpatch'd, that in a little time, we had a
Veſſel ready to ſet ſail, which <hi>Maleo</hi> order'd
to be bought at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and to be
brought to the Port from whence we were
to go, being partly laden with <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
with other Commodities, taken up at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi>
St. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and <hi>Bilboa,</hi> bought in
groſs at a Venture, in which Affair I was
employ'd, having undertaken it by <hi>Maleo</hi>'s
Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Preparations, and while
we waited for the Diſpatch of the Grant,
that had been promis'd him by the Council
of <hi>Spain,</hi> it happen'd that the Baron of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60479:145"/>
being in haſte to go into <hi>England,</hi>
in Quality of Ambaſſador from his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Majeſty; and having Orders to make
uſe of the firſt Ship that was ready to Sail,
took <hi>Maleo</hi>'s Veſſel; which, yet ſerv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to carry his Baggage, the King of Great
<hi>Britain</hi> having ſent him a Frigat at the ſame
time, in which he croſs'd the Sea. During
the Stay, which <hi>Maleo</hi> was oblig'd to make
in <hi>England,</hi> he made new Proviſion for his
Voyage to the <hi>Indies;</hi> and ſeeing his Grant
was not yet ſent him, he thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to take a Commiſſion, from the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Vateville,</hi> as Captain-General of the
Province of <hi>Guipuſcoa,</hi> in my Name, and
that of <hi>Paſcoal Hiriarte,</hi> commanding his
Ship to go in purſuit of the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> on
the Coaſt of <hi>Brezil;</hi> that this might ſerve
us for a Pretext, to go into the River of
<hi>Plata.</hi> Being fortified with this Order,
we embark'd, and having ſtopp'd at <hi>Havre
de Grace</hi> to ſet <hi>N</hi>—aſhoar, who thought
good to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to ſolicite a
Commiſſion alſo from the Council of <hi>Spain,</hi>
for the Two Veſſels, with which we agreed,
that they ſhould come and joyn us at <hi>Bue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos-Ayres;</hi>
we continued our Courſe, and
after many croſs Winds, we arriv'd in the
River of <hi>Plata:.</hi> As we enter'd into it, we
met Two <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels that came from <hi>Bue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos
Ayres;</hi> the Captains of which inform'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60479:146"/>
us, that one of 'em could by no means ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
leave to Trade there; but that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arriving there before him, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
when the Government was oblig'd
to ſend a very important Meſſage in all haſte
to his Catholick Majeſty, relating to his
Service, was ſo happy, by the promiſe he
made of taking the Courrier, who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
for <hi>Spain</hi> on board him, as to find
means of diſpoſing of all his Goods, and
of bringing away a very Rich Cargo, in
which he ſpake the very Truth; for he had
the prudence before he came to the Port, to
take out his richeſt Goods, and leave 'em
in an Iſland below, and only reſerv'd thoſe
of the greateſt bulk to be expos'd to the
View of the Officers, of which he had made
a falſe Envois at the price of the Country,
ſeparate from the general one, and had
made the Value of his Cargo to amount to
270000 Crowns. He agreed with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
to leave theſe Goods with him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he would give him for 'em 22000
Hides at a Crown apiece, 12000 pound of
<hi>Vigogne</hi> Wool at 4 <hi>Livers 10 Sous per</hi>
Pound, ane 30000 Crowns in Silver to pay
the Charges of Equipping his Ship; which
was perform'd accordingly. But under the
pretence of his Bargain, and while the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was Loading in the Veſſel, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
under-hand ſold his Richeſt Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60479:146"/>
and for the Value of 'em which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to 100000 Crowns, he got at leaſt
400000. Thus the Captain of the Ship
and the Governor both made a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
but this Governor whoſe Name
is <hi>Don Alonza de Mercado</hi> and <hi>de Villacorta,</hi>
being a very diſintereſted Man, and not at
all greedy of Money, declar'd that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this buſineſs was for the King his
Maſter, and gave him advice of it by this
Courrier.</p>
                     <p>Being ſeparated from theſe Veſſels, we
came to an Anchor before <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi>
but for all the Inſtances and Offers we could
make one time after another to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
we could never obtain his Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to put our Goods aſhore, and to expoſe
'em to Sale to the People of the Place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we had no Licence for it from <hi>Spain.</hi>
He only conſented to let us go into the
City from time to time to procure Victuals
for our Men, and ſuch other Neceſſaries as
we wanted. He treated us with this Rigour
for Eleven Months, after which there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
an Occaſion which oblig'd him to
uſe us better, and to enter into a ſort of an
Accommodation with us. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ship in the Port, the ſame that
a Year before had brought Troops and
Arms from <hi>Spain,</hi> to reinforce the Gariſons
of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and of <hi>Chili,</hi> of which I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60479:147"/>
have ſpoken above; which contin'd here
all this time upon her own private buſineſs,
but the Captain that Commanded her could
not manage his Affairs with ſo much ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but it came to the Governor's Ear, that
he deſign'd in prejudice of the Prohibition
that was made, to carry away a great
quantity of Silver, and indeed he ſeiz'd on
a Sum of 113000 Crowns that was juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be carry'd of, of which the Captain
could have no reſtitution made; and fearing
a greater diſapointment, namely that he
ſhould be ſeiz'd, he ſet Sail to return into
<hi>Spain,</hi> without waiting for any Letters for
his Catholick Majeſty, with which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor
would have intruſted him, together
with the Information he had receiv'd
of the Intelligence the <hi>Dutch</hi> had gotten
in the Country, which he had a mind
to ſend into <hi>Spain</hi> with all ſpeed, as
well as ſome Perſons whom he had ſeiz'd,
that were guilty of holding this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> among whom there
was a Captain, nam'd <hi>Alberto Janſon,</hi> a
<hi>Dutch</hi>-man. The flight of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
therefore oblig'd the Governor to alter
his carriage toward us, and to facilitate the
Return of our Veſſel, which he thought
good to make uſe of, for want of another
to carry his Letters and Priſoners into <hi>Spain;</hi>
upon condition we would take upon us
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60479:147"/>
this Charge, he ſuffer'd us after a tacite
manner to do our buſineſs, and to carry off
4000 Hides; but we having great Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the Merchants of the Place, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
our Affairs ſo well, that under the
Umbrage of this permiſſion, we ſold all
our Goods, and brought away a Rich Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
in Silver, Hides, and other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
after which without looſing any time
we took our Courſe for <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At our Arrival in the River of <hi>Corunna</hi>
in <hi>Gallicia,</hi> we receiv'd Advice by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which <hi>N</hi>—ſent us to the Ports upon
all the Coaſts, that there was an Order from
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſeize us at our return,
becauſe we had been at <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave. Upon this we reſolv'd (after
we had ſent the Letters and Priſoners, that
were committed to our Charge to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Corunna</hi> by the hand of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant
Major of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Affairs of that Country in our
Veſſel) to paſs out of that River, and to
go 6 Leagnes from thence into the Road
of <hi>Barias,</hi> where I found a ſmall Veſſel, in
which I loaded the greateſt part of what I
had on my own account, and that of my
Friends. The Governor of <hi>Corunna</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
advice of it, diſpatch'd a Hoy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
me to ſtop me, but I us'd that precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diligence, that this Hoy could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60479:148"/>
come up with me, ſo that I happily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
in <hi>France</hi> at the Port of <hi>Socca,</hi> where
I by this means ſav'd the fruit of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and long Voyage. The great Ship
which I left in the Road of <hi>Barias</hi> had not
ſo favourable a Lot, and one may ſay, was
ſhip-wrack'd at the very Port; for having
left the Road of <hi>Barias,</hi> to get ſpeedily to
that of <hi>Santonge,</hi> to ſecure all the Goods
ſhe had on board, except 4000 Hides, of
which her Bill of Lading gave an account,
and having begun to put 600 Hides into a
<hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel that ſhe met there, the bad
Weather conſtrain'd her to put in at the
Port from whence ſhe firſt went out, where
ſhe was Confiſcated with all her Cargo for
the uſe of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
before ſpoken of, that ſhe had not the
Permiſſion of his Catholick Majeſty for her
Voyage.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were tranſacting, the
Sergeant Major of <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> Arriv'd at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having
Cauſed the Informations he brought to be
examin'd, which principally inſiſted upon
the neceſſity there was of ſending new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
of Men and Ammunition, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Cariſons of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> and of
<hi>Chili,</hi> the better to ſecure the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Enterprizes of Strangers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
from the attempt of the Savages of <hi>Chili,</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60479:148"/>
immediately orderd Three Veſſels to be
Equipp'd for this purpoſe, the Command
of which was given to <hi>N</hi>—. There was
good ſtore of Ammunition Embark'd in
'em, but for Recruits of Souldiers, there
were but 300 Men, of whom the greateſt
part were ſent into <hi>Chili.</hi> In the ſame Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
there were Lawyers ſent, to form a
Court of Common-Juſtice, which they call
an Audience, at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> where there
were only ſome Officers for the Deciſions of
Petty Matters before, the Greater Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remitted to the Audience that is Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
at <hi>Chaquiſaca,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>la
Plata,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Los Charcas,</hi> 500
Leagues from <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>N</hi>—return'd from this Voyage,
he came to <hi>Oyarſon</hi> in the Province of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcoa</hi>
his Native Country, from whence
he ſent me an account of himſelf, and we
agreed to have a ſecret Enterview upon the
Frontiers; accordingly we met, and gave
one another an account of the Affairs in
which we were both concern'd; and by
this account we found there were about
60000 Livers due from him to me, which
he has not yet paid.</p>

                  <p>THE Diſcovery that I and Father <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamel,</hi>
have made of divers Savage
Nations on the Continent of <hi>Guiana,</hi> near the
Iſland of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> obliges me to draw up a
brief Relation of our Voyage, and to preſent it to
your Reverence, that you may know what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
we may have here, and how many
Miſſionaries may find a fit Occaſion for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their Zeal. If I had had ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
whom I might have left with the <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues</hi>
and the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> I ſhould have pierc'd
much farther into the Country; but the <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues</hi>
who were our Guides, not daring to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
farther into the Country of the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> to
retain the good will of 'em both, we ſhould have
left a Miſſionary in each of theſe Nations, that
the <hi>Acoquas</hi> might have conducted us to their
Friends, who (as far as I can conjecture) reach
quite to the <hi>Equinoctial Line.</hi> We might alſo
have paſs'd to the Weſt of the River <hi>Maroni,</hi>
and have enter'd into an Alliance with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that extend to the River of <hi>Surinam,</hi>
upon which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have planted (1) a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony:

we need not be afraid that the People of any
<hi>European</hi> Nation will trouble us in our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
becauſe there's no gain to be made by
'em; beſides, that we run the riſque of being

convenient in ſending us Miſſionaries of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Conſtitution, of great Vertue, and of a

in theſe parts there can little or no Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be brought to relieve them in caſe of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

Reverend Father <hi>Gerard Brion,</hi> Superior-General
of the ſaid Miſſions, and Father
<hi>Mace,</hi> and Father <hi>Alarole;</hi> he arriv'd in the
Iſland of <hi>Cayenne</hi> the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1673.
and parted thence Ten Days after: Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Stay there, he regulated divers
Affairs, as well Temporal as Spiritual; and
among other Things, finding we had yet
no Knowledge of any other People, but
the <hi>Galibis,</hi> and <hi>Aracarels,</hi> our Neighbours,
who dwell near the Sea, and among whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60479:152"/>
the Fathers of our Society employ'd their
Talents, with abundance of Zeal; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to attempt a Diſcovery of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that lie remote from the Sea. It was
my Happineſs to be choſen for ſo pious a
Work; and I was particularly inſtructed
by my Orders, to diſcover the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> a
very populous Nation, according to the
Report, ſome <hi>Nouragues,</hi> who frequent the
<hi>Galibis,</hi> gave us; withal, telling us, they
were a Warlike People, and us'd to eat
Men. One of theſe <hi>Nouragues</hi> being ask'd,
Two Months before the Arrival of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Father-Viſitor, <hi>If it were true, that
the</hi> Acoquas <hi>us'd to eat their Enemies,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<hi>That he came from 'em Four Months
ago, and then they had just made an end of
boiling in their Pots, and eating a Nation,
which they had deſtroy'd.</hi> I deſir'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Father, <hi>Francis Bechamel,</hi> for my
Comrade, who has a great Deal of Zeal
for theſe Miſſions, and has an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Faculty of learning ſtrange Languages;
beſides that, he already underſtood the
Tongue of the <hi>Galibis,</hi> which many of the
<hi>Nouragues</hi> alſo ſpeak; ſome of whom we
were oblig'd to take for our Guides, to
conduct us to the <hi>Acoquas;</hi> for we yet
know no other Way to come at 'em, but
through the Country of the <hi>Nouragues:</hi> And
Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> took care to provide ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60479:152"/>
                     <hi>Galibis,</hi> to conduct us to the <hi>Nouragues,</hi>
who dwell above the Source of the River
(2) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi> and to buy ſome <hi>Caſſave</hi> and
<hi>Paſte</hi> of (3) <hi>Ovicou</hi> for his Voyage, which
we counted would be for about Ten Days.</p>
                  <p>This Father having provided all Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;
namely, Three <hi>Galibis,</hi> ſome <hi>Caſſave,</hi>
and <hi>Paſte</hi> of <hi>Ovicou,</hi> in hopes of finding
by the good Providence of God, either Fiſh,
or Veniſon, with the Aſſiſtance of our <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
we left the Port of <hi>Cayenne</hi> the <hi>25th</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> taking our Leave of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father <hi>Brion,</hi> Superior-General, and
Father <hi>Mace,</hi> and Father <hi>Bechet;</hi> but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the (4) <hi>Chevalier de Lezy,</hi> our
Governour, who did us the Honour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us together, with the Fathers of our
Society, quite to the <hi>Canoo,</hi> in which we
embark'd in the Afternoon, having our Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherman
to ſteer the <hi>Canoo,</hi> and Three <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Galibis</hi> to row with our Two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
All of us were of Opinion, That
our <hi>Canoo</hi> was too ſmall, and indeed it
would have prov'd ſo, if we had embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the coming up of the Tide, for at that
time the Waves are very rough near the
Shoar; but we avoided this Danger by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking
a little before the Tide came up;
ſo that we were out of all danger when the
Tide began to drive us into the River,
which gives its Name to this Iſland; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60479:153"/>
our <hi>Canoo</hi> being very light, and not
eaſie to be turn'd, was very fit to get clear
of ſeveral little Falls that are in the River
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi> which we were to paſs almoſt quite
through, 'till we came to the Entrance of
a leſſer River, that let us into the Country
of the <hi>Nouragues,</hi> the firſt Nation that we
were willing to be acquainted with, that
by their Means we might find a Paſſage to
the <hi>Acoquas.</hi> Our Way was between the
Iſland of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> and the main Land; and
in the Evening we arriv'd at the Houſe of
one <hi>Deſlauriers,</hi> that had ſettled himſelf
there; we continued with him for a certain
Reaſon, all the next Day, being the <hi>26th</hi> of
<hi>January.</hi> Since God was pleas'd to protect
and lead us by the Hand, as it were in all
this Voyage; we muſt confeſs, that it was
he who inſpir'd us with the Reſolution to
begin it by the River <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via;</hi> for we knew
but two Ways of entering into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Nouragues,</hi> one by the River <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi>
and t'other by the River (5) <hi>Aproague;</hi> this
laſt is very difficult, becauſe the Falls of the
Water are ſo great, that the <hi>Sapayes,</hi> and
<hi>Galibis,</hi> that live at the Mouth of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
require a very large Reward to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this Voyage; and indeed, are the
more unwilling to undertake it, becauſe
they are afraid of thoſe <hi>Nouragues,</hi> that eat
Humane Fleſh: So, that when any of 'em
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60479:153"/>
go into thoſe Parts, they ſtay there as little
time as they can: Therefore it is ſcarce poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to go this Way, and if we had gone
it, we ſhould have been altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that dwell
on the Coaſts of the River <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi> and with
the <hi>Nouragues</hi> that dwell above the Source
of it. But without knowing any thing of
this before, we choſe to paſs into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Nouragues,</hi> by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi> and have
this Way viſited that whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> we left the Sieur
<hi>Deſlauriers</hi> ſomewhat late, and therefore
proceeded but a little way that Day: Our
<hi>Galibis</hi> brought us into a Hut of the (6)
<hi>Maprouanes,</hi> as well to ſhelter us from a
great Shower of Rain, as to lodge us
(7) there that Night. Theſe <hi>Maprouanes</hi>
are about Thirty in Number, who retir'd
from their Country, near the River of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons,</hi>
to avoid the Perſecution of the
<hi>Portugeſe,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> call'd the
(8) <hi>Arianes,</hi> who have almoſt extirpated
that Nation: We found nothing there but
<hi>Caſſave</hi> and <hi>Ovicou;</hi> and to the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
we had nothing but <hi>Caſſave,</hi> beſides
Two Fiſhes, and a Couple of Fowls, which
the <hi>Galibis</hi> took, (which ſerv'd us for Four
ſmall Meals) and a little Piece of Fiſh we
met with at another <hi>Indian</hi> Cottage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60479:154"/>
The <hi>28th</hi> we arriv'd at a Mountain, where
a certain <hi>Galibi,</hi> nam'd <hi>Maure,</hi> dwells;
this is Twelve Leagues from the Mouth of
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via:</hi> And Two Leagues below this
Mountain, the Land upon the River, which
is hitherto very low, and almoſt always
overflow'd, is a high, fine Country, as far
as the Dwelling of the firſt <hi>Nouragues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>29th</hi> we lay in a Wood, and ſo we
did on the <hi>30th,</hi> having paſs'd by a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
of the <hi>Galibi</hi>'s, which contain'd but
very few People, to make the bigger Day's
Journey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>31ſt</hi> we lodg'd in a <hi>Galibi</hi>'s Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
whoſe Family conſiſted of about Six
or Seven, but Three or Four of 'em were
abſent.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt of <hi>February</hi> we paſs'd the Night
in the Woods, and on the Second we lay
at a <hi>Galibi</hi>'s Cottage again; and this was
the pooreſt, and moſt pitiful Hut that ever
I ſaw among the <hi>Indians</hi> of this Country;
there was in it only one Man, and his Wife
and Children, who had nothing at all that
Day to ſup on. One of their Children
was much ſwell'd, and in a languiſhing
Condition, with a continual Fever, of
which we thought it could never recover;
therefore Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> baptiz'd it; and
the Conſolation this gave us ſweeten'd all
our paſt Hardſhips.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60479:154"/>
The Third we went aſhoar in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Nouragues,</hi> after having this Day,
and the Day before paſs'd Three Falls in
the River <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via,</hi> and another in the River
of the <hi>Nouragues;</hi> but this was nothing in
compariſon of the Falls of Water we were
to paſs on the Rivers of <hi>Aproague</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was now time to land, for our (9)
<hi>Caſſave</hi> would have been ſpent if we had
had but a little farther to go in thoſe great
Deſarts, and vaſt Foreſts, that are all along
upon this River; upon which there are
no other Cottages but thoſe I have been
ſpeaking of, and thoſe of ſome <hi>Galibis</hi> and
<hi>Areacarets,</hi> who live towards the Mouth
of it, and are in all about a Hundred or
Sixſcore Perſons. This River winds very
much, and runs a Courſe of near Fifty
Leagues.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Galibis</hi> ſerv'd us in this Voyage with
a great deal of Reſpect, and gave us Acceſs
to the Chief of theſe firſt <hi>Nouragues,</hi> to
whom we preſented a Hatchet, to engage
him to enter into an Alliance with us; they
did not remember, that they had ſeen above
One <hi>French</hi> Man before in their Country;
ſo that the Women and Girls, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
travell'd into the Country of the <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
were mightily amaz'd at the Sight of
us. If one might judge of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60479:155"/>
by theſe People, one might very well
ſay, the <hi>Nouragues</hi> are a very courteous and
affable People. Some of 'em could ſpeak
the Language of the <hi>Galibis</hi> very well, and
ſerv'd for our Interpreters. They did all they
could to ſeek Proviſion, to treat us well;
but being unſucceſsful in their Hunting, we
had only <hi>Caſſave,</hi> and a little Meat at one
of our Repaſts, but with great Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Kindneſs. We bought <hi>Caſſave</hi>
of 'em for the Supply of the Men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to our <hi>Canoo;</hi> and on the Sixth of
<hi>February,</hi> after the <hi>Galibis</hi> had been treated
with a ſmall Feaſt after the Faſhion of the
Country, they parted from us at about Ten
a Clock in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>We alſo left this firſt Cottage of the <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues,</hi>
on the Seventh of <hi>February,</hi> to go
a Journey of Four and Twenty Leagues by
Land, over very rugged Mountains; but
went only half a League from thence to
lodge that Night, being attended with Two
young <hi>Nouragues,</hi> each of about Sixteen
or Seventeen Years of Age, who were to
carry our Baggage; here we were to take
another Man, who had promis'd to carry
our Proviſion for us, which conſiſted of
<hi>Caſſave,</hi> and <hi>Paſte</hi> of <hi>Ovicou:</hi> This Man's
Wife, in this Second Hut, was ill of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in her Breaſt, which ſo tormented her,
and had ſo exceedingly waſted her, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60479:155"/>
ſeeing her under ſo terrible a Diſtemper,
without the Help of any Medicine, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
ſhe could not recover, and that in
Probability, ſhe would live morally the
reſt of her Days; for theſe People endure
their Pains and Hardſhips very patiently, as
we obſerv'd in all the <hi>Galibis;</hi> therefore we
reſolv'd to baptize her: In order to this,
Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> took care to inſtruct her,
having already made ſome Improvement
in the Language of this People, and had
likewiſe the Aſſiſtance of one of our young
<hi>Nouragues,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Galibis</hi>
Tongue. This poor ſick Woman receiv'd
his Inſtructions very well, and was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
which was an occaſion of great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us.</p>
                  <p>The Eighth, having Bread and Paſte of
<hi>Ovicou</hi> enough to ſerve us Four Days, we
ſet forward with our Three <hi>Nouragues,</hi> to
perform our Journey of Four and Twenty
Leagues, over Mountains all the way, which
the <hi>Nouragues</hi> ſometimes perform in a Day
and a half; but ordinarily in Two or
Three Days, when they have Women in
their Company. One of our <hi>French</hi> Men
of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> that came thence on the <hi>27th</hi>
of <hi>January,</hi> follow'd us cloſely with Seven
<hi>Galibis,</hi> and overtook us where we lodg'd
the Second Night, who gave me a Letter
from the Reverend Father <hi>Brion,</hi> our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60479:156"/>
written the day he came away,
which gave us no ſmall joy, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a great deal of Good Advice, that
might be ſerviceable to us in our Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>French</hi>-Man was much fatigu'd with
his Journey, and ſent his <hi>Indians</hi> before him
the day following, who in that one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tenth of <hi>February,</hi> went as much
ground as we could do in a day and a half,
by reaſon of the difficulty of the ways. He
having joyn'd himſelf to our Company, and
comparing our <hi>Nouragues</hi> with his <hi>Galibis,</hi>
found a great alteration, and could not
but admire the Meekneſs and Patience of
theſe Three <hi>Indians,</hi> but eſpecially their
Reſpect. They carry'd our Proviſions, yet
they durſt not take any without asking, tho'
we had often told 'em that they might take
of 'em when they pleas'd. This day we
paſſed the River <hi>Aratay,</hi> which throws it
ſelf into the <hi>Aproague.</hi> The <hi>Aratay</hi> is a fine
River, which comes from a Country that
is Situate between the Source of the River
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via</hi> and the County of the <hi>Mercious,</hi> which
the <hi>Nouragues</hi> ſay is a ſpace of Land that
extends about Seven days Journey. We
were forc'd to paſs this River <hi>Aratay</hi> which
is pretty wide and deep, and the Stream of
which is ſomewhat Rapid, in a little <hi>Canoo,</hi>
in much danger of being caſt away, as this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60479:156"/>
                     <hi>French</hi>-Man that joyn'd us happen'd to be,
when he repaſs'd it in his return, where he
loſt what he carry'd with him; which
was all he had in the World. After this
we lodg'd a third time in the Woods, and
on the Eleventh of <hi>February,</hi> being very
weary we about Noon Arriv'd at the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Imanon</hi> the <hi>Nourague</hi> a Famous
(10) <hi>Piaye</hi> (or Phyſician) in all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where we found the <hi>Galibis</hi> that had
advanc'd before us the preceding day.
Theſe <hi>Galibis</hi> mutinied againſt this poor
<hi>French</hi>-Man, and probably were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of hindring the <hi>Nouragues</hi> of that place
from ſelling any thing to him; ſo that he
loſt his Journey. Nay he was oblig'd to
entreat one of our <hi>Nourague</hi> Guides to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of his Iron Wares, which he
brought to trade with, becauſe theſe <hi>Galibis</hi>
refus'd to help him. And there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for it but Patience, ſince he was 80
Leagues from <hi>Cayenne,</hi> in a Nation that had
no Commerce with the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We did not part with our Three Guides
without regret; but we could not detain
'em, becauſe they were oblig'd to return for
ſeveral good Reaſons. The Principal of
'em whoſe Name was <hi>Paratou,</hi> told us, for
our comfort, that in the place where we
now were, which they call <hi>Caraoribo,</hi> from
the Name of a little River that paſſes by it,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60479:157"/>
we ſhould find a great many <hi>Paratous,</hi> he
meant a great many <hi>Nouragues,</hi> as good
humor'd as himſelf. But we found a great
deal of difference in the Temper of thoſe
Guides we had from <hi>Caraoribo</hi> to the <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas,</hi>
and of thoſe we had before.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as theſe had left us, we enter'd
into a good Correſpondence with the Chief
<hi>Camiati</hi> the Father of <hi>Imanon,</hi> by preſenting
him with a Hatchet; this is a very Famous
Chief, and the Principal one the <hi>Nouragues</hi>
have, and the next to him in Eminence, is
the Chief of the <hi>Nouragues</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>via.</hi> This
<hi>Camiati</hi> the day after our Arrival came to
his Son's Cottage, (for his own is upon the
River <hi>Aproague</hi>) he may be about 60 Years
of Age, and ſeems to be ſtill very Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
His Countenace tho' lean has a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Mien, but withal he has a Savage Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;
his Humour is but very indifferent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Strangers, tho' mild enough toward his
own People, to whom according to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of the Country, he every day gives
the Good-morrow, and the Good-night,
from the Oldeſt People to Children of
Fifteen Years of Age. He promis'd us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us quite to the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> when his <hi>Canoo</hi>
was made, to whoſe Country he pretended
he would go himſelf, and deſir'd but the
ſpace of Ten Days to finiſh this <hi>Canoo;</hi> now
tho' we knew well enough after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60479:157"/>
the <hi>Indians</hi> us'd to reckon, who are
often Three Months in doing what they
might perform in the ſpace of Ten Days:
we reſolv'd however to continue with him
to have the advantage of being under his
Protection; and to perſwade him, if we
ſhould find him make too long a delay, to
borrow another <hi>Canoo,</hi> that was at Five
Days Journy diſtance from us; and in the
mean time to acquaint our ſelves with
the Language of the <hi>Nouragues</hi> as much as we
could, which (as we were told) differ'd but
little from that of the <hi>Acoquas</hi> and <hi>Mercious.</hi>
The Language of the <hi>Galibis,</hi> which ſome of
us underſtood, and which was very Familiar
to Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> was ſome help to us on
this Occaſion. This <hi>Nouragues</hi> Tongue is
not of an eaſie and ſoft Pronunciation like
that of the <hi>Galibis,</hi> but has a great number of
Words that muſt be pronounc'd with very
rough Aſpirations, others of 'em can't be
pronounc'd without ſhutting the Teeth; at
another time one muſt ſpeak through the
Noſe; and ſometimes theſe Three difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
all occur in the ſame Word.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> immediately began to
apply himſelf to the ſtudy of this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
and I made ſo much advantge of
his Labour in which he ſucceeded to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that by means of the <hi>Galibis</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
I made a ſmall Diſcourſe of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60479:158"/>
of the World; to make theſe People
know ſomething of their Creator. <hi>Imanon</hi>
the Maſter of this Hut was the firſt that
took delight in hearing this Diſcourſe, and
after him the Chief himſelf; and Five or
Six others, as they were working would
repeat in that very indiffent <hi>Galibis</hi>
I could ſpeak, theſe Words; <hi>God made
the Heavens, God made the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Here
were many Men that had each of 'em Two
Wives, and one of 'em who had Three;
this did not hinder me from telling 'em in
the Account I gave 'em of the Creation of
Mankind; that God made but one Woman
for the Firſt Man, and that he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one Man to have Two Wives. And
tho' all theſe <hi>Nouragues</hi> perceiv'd we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
their Cuſtom of taking Two or
Three Wives at a time, yet they ſaid not a
word againſt the Chriſtian Law for not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
the ſame Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Seeing theſe People ſo docile and pliable,
I was willing to try if the Songs of the
Church would pleaſe 'em, and accordingly
I ſang the <hi>Magnificat</hi> in the firſt Tune, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bechamel</hi> and our Two Servants joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with me. This was ſo grateful
to 'em, that afterwards we ordinarily ſang
ſome Hymns three-times a day to their
great ſatisfaction. Nay ſome of 'em learn'd
to anſwer to the <hi>Litanies</hi> of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60479:158"/>
which we ſang every Evening. In
the mean while our Chief's <hi>Canoo</hi> went
forward but very (11) ſlowly, and we
thought we had mnch better endeavour to
prevail with him to borrow another, with
which he comply'd, and ſent Two of his
Men for this end Five Days Journey
from his Houſe, to get a convenient one
for us.</p>
                  <p>It was the Twenty eighth of <hi>February,</hi>
when theſe Men parted from us, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the next day which was the Firſt
of <hi>March</hi> diſpatch away another Company
of his Men, we thought convenient to
make uſe of this occaſion to engage ſome of
'em to carry our Baggage, whom Father
<hi>Bechamel</hi> accompany'd, together with one
of our Servants, while I and our other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
remain'd with the Chief, that we
might give him no offence; becauſe we
ſtood in need of his Protection.</p>
                  <p>After I had continu'd a Fortnight with
him, making all the Children ſay their
Prayers Morning and Evening, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my little Inſtruſtions to the greateſt
part of thoſe I was acquainted with, but
eſpecially to Three Young Men who were
well Marry'd, confirming 'em in the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
they had made never to take a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife; of which promiſe they ſeem'd
to make no difficulty. I ſet forward the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60479:159"/>
Fifteenth of <hi>March,</hi> to ſeek Father <hi>Bechamel,</hi>
and to wait for the Chief of the Cottage,
who was to go by Water Five days after
with his <hi>Canoo;</hi> I had but Three Leagues to
go by Land, whereas it was near Fifteen by
Water. From that time I found thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſtill more teachable, and when the
Captain return'd, among Four and twenty
Perſons, there were not above Three, but
ſignified they took a great deal of pleaſure
in my Inſtructions. During our ſtay here,
a Serpent came in the Night in the place
where we lay, and bit a Hound, ſo that he
died in 30 Hours after. This Accident was
Injurious to us, becauſe the Chief, and the
Owner of the Dog attributed it to the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which we ſang; ſo that I durſt not
Sing any more, but contented my ſelf to
make every body in the Cottage ſay their
Prayers, except three (as I ſaid before)
namely the Chief <hi>Camiati</hi> and Two other
Old Men.</p>
                  <p>The Ninth of <hi>April,</hi> after I had much
importun'd the Chief, that we might ſet
forward; he told us, he was not willing to
make this Voyage, and that all his Men
ſhould go to ſet us in our way, and ſhould
leave us when we went aſhore to go by
Land to the Rivers that lead to the <hi>Acoquas,</hi>
whether Four of the Company ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
us. We underſtood that their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60479:159"/>
was determin'd without any regard to
us; however we did not ſcruple to pay 'em
for it, being willing to make uſe of this
Opportunity, becauſe it was no eaſie matter
to meet with another. However I oppos'd
the Deſign of having ſo many Men go with
us, becauſe the Two <hi>Canoos</hi> they had were
too ſmall for ſuch a Company: This was
a great difficulty with us, and was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
till the next day, when we repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Chief, that we would leave
him our little Cheſt, that we would take
very few of our (12) things out of it for
our Voyage, that when we return'd I would
continue with him; that if he was not
pleas'd to aſſiſt us in our Voyage, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Cayenne,</hi> that then he muſt never
expect to ſee any of us again, and would
have no more of our Commodities; this
made him reſolve to leſſen the number of
his Men.</p>
                  <p>The Tenth of <hi>March</hi> we parted, being
Sixteen in Number, of which the Chief
would needs be one for Three days, that
he might bring back his <hi>Canoo.</hi> In the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
we went aſhore into the Woods,
and on the Eleventh, after we had paſs'd
ſeveral Falls of Waters in the way we made
the Two days, we Arriv'd at a Cottage of
the <hi>Nouragues,</hi> Ten Leagues from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
here we were well receiv'd, and went
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60479:160"/>
forward the Third day with a Third <hi>Canoo</hi>
which was very ſmall; it carry'd only Two
Men, a Woman, and a Girl of Ten or
Twelve Years Old. We paſſed Two Falls
that were difficult enough, and Arriv'd at
a Third, which the <hi>Canoo</hi> could not paſs,
which has oblig'd the <hi>Nouragues</hi> to make a
way to draw their <hi>Canoos</hi> by Land almoſt
half a League, this fall is at Two Degrees, and
Forty Six Minutes of Northern Latitude.
The <hi>Indians</hi> drew only the little <hi>Canoo</hi> by
Land; for the Chief left us and return'd
back with the Two others; and we who
were then Fifteen in Number went to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
in a great <hi>Canoo,</hi> that was above the
Water-fall, which the Two Perſons that
were ſent by <hi>Camiati</hi> had borrow'd; Four
Leagues higher, we found the Mouth of
the River <hi>Tenaporibo:</hi> and went to lie in a
Cottage hard by, which was yet upon the
River <hi>Aproague,</hi> where we found Five <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rague</hi>
Travellers, who were going to the
Country of the <hi>Mercious;</hi> beſides whom
there was a Woman who had a little Girl
of Seven or Eight Months Old that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill. <hi>Imanon</hi> (of whom I have ſpoken)
was now the Chief of our Company; he is
the greateſt Phyſician (that is the greateſt
Juggler) of the Country: who tho' he is a
great Hypocrite, and very much for plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Wives; yet did not ſcruple to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60479:160"/>
us, that this Child was very Sick;
when we had examin'd the matter we jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it neceſſary to Baptize her, which Father
<hi>Bechamel</hi> did, at the time when theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
parted from us. I had before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
a little Girl in the Cottage of this <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
immediately after it was born, becauſe
the Mother of it when ſhe brought it into
the World had left it in the (13) Dirt, from
whence they would not take it up for a
long time, being told of this diſorder, and
finding they would put nothing under the
Infant to keep it from the coldneſs of the
Mud, and of the Night I baptiz'd it.</p>
                  <p>The Fourteenth we left this Hutt, and
preſently enter'd into the River of <hi>Tenapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribo,</hi>
which is very deep and rapid, tho' it
winds much; we were not the Firſt <hi>French</hi>-Men
that had been upon this River; and
we have been inform'd that Three <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men
were kill'd and Eaten there (14) ſome
Years ago by the <hi>Nouragues:</hi> 'Tis very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to Navigate this River, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of its narrowneſs, and becauſe the
great Trees upon the Banks of it when they
fall, often extend their Branches to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, ſo that one muſt either paſs over
or under theſe Trees, which is not done
without a great deal of difficulty. We lay
one Night in the Woods, and on the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Arriv'd at a Hutt where we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60479:161"/>
to the Eighteenth, which was the
laſt Day we were upon this River, and in
the Evening we ſaw the laſt Company of
the <hi>Nouragues</hi> on this River, 80 Leagues
from the Mouth of it: This Company
conſiſts of Four Huts, at a little diſtance
one from another, wherein there are above
Sixſcore Perſons, of a good natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and very teachable: There was not
one in the Cottage, where we lodg'd, but
was taught by us, to pray to God every
Day; this Cottage was compos'd of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Men, ſome of whom were ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
others were married only to one Wife,
with whom they liv'd very well; and there
is great Probability of making good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of 'em. This Cottage is at Two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
Forty Two Minutes of Northern
Latitude, and together with the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
ones, and two others at Two
Leagues diſtance, might give employ to a
good Miſſionary.</p>
                  <p>We left this Hut, on the Twenty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>April,</hi> towards Evening, to go
and ſeek our Guides, who were not far off,
with whom we advanc'd by Land, and
went only Five Leagues among very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Mountains.</p>
                  <p>The Twenty Ninth we travell'd about
Ten Leagues, in a Way a little more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
and lay in the Woods as we had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60479:161"/>
done the Night before. Our Three Guides
ſhew'd us Two Rivulets, which they ſaid
were <hi>Tenaporibo</hi> and <hi>Camopi,</hi> that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rapid; and Five or Six Leagues beyond,
<hi>Tenaporibo</hi> is Forty Foot broad, and full
Twelve in depth: And at Fifteen Leagues
diſtance, or a little more, the River <hi>Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi</hi>
is as big as the <hi>Sein</hi> is below <hi>Paris,</hi> from
whence one may conjecture what Compaſs
it takes in its courſe.</p>
                  <p>The Thirtieth we went to lodge upon
the River <hi>Eiski,</hi> from whence Two of our
<hi>Nouragues,</hi> went to the <hi>Nouragues</hi> of the
River <hi>Inipi,</hi> to borrow a <hi>Canoo,</hi> and ſo to
come again at us, where we lodg'd; for the
River <hi>Eiski</hi> runs into the <hi>Inipi.</hi> This they
did for our Eaſe, our Journey having been
very hard, conſidering our Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt of <hi>May</hi> they came to us again,
with a pretty handſome <hi>Canoo,</hi> wherein
there were Three <hi>Nouragues,</hi> that never had
ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Man, or any other <hi>European,</hi>
in their Lives. Their Aſpect was very
ſweet, and they ſeem'd to be of a very
tractable Diſpoſition; when they had ſeen
us they returned Home, and we embarked
in this <hi>Canoo,</hi> a little after Noon, and came
to lodge in the Woods, upon the River
<hi>Inipi,</hi> where our Guides (15) mended the
<hi>Canoo;</hi> and the next Day, being the Second
of <hi>May,</hi> having gone down this River,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60479:162"/>
which has a very rapid Stream, about Ten
Leagues, we enter'd into the River <hi>Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi>
in which we we went Four Leagues
more, and that againſt the Stream: For <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipi</hi>
loſes its Name, and with <hi>Camopi</hi> makes
a great River, which goes and joyns it ſelf
to the River (16) <hi>Yapoque,</hi> Five Days Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
from thence. <hi>Camopi</hi> is very ſwift, and
has ſo many difficult Falls, that 'tis no eaſie
Matter to number them; we went up this
River the Third and Fourth of <hi>May,</hi> with
a great deal of Difficulty and Danger. The
Fourth of <hi>May</hi> we lay upon a flat Rock,
where we found a Piece of a Min'd Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the Covering of which our Men
mended with Boughs: That Day we paſs'd
through a perilous Place, not only becauſe
of a dangerous Fall of Water; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
becauſe it was commanded by a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Nouragues,</hi> which is the Laſt of that
Nation, the Maſter of it is a <hi>Morou,</hi> the
Name of an <hi>Indian</hi> Nation, one of whom
was hang'd at <hi>Cayenne,</hi> above a Year ago,
for killing a <hi>French</hi> Man: We had Reaſon
to fear, that he would, after the Manner
of the <hi>Indians,</hi> revenge this Man's Death
upon us; but one of our Guides, who
was alſo a <hi>Morou,</hi> had married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and we hop'd the Preſence of this
young Man, whom we then took to be a
<hi>Nourague,</hi> would divert his ill Humour;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60479:162"/>
as indeed it happen'd: And after we were
got aſhoar upon our flat Rock, which is
in the Country of the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> we were
greatly comforted to ſee our Three Guides
ask for their Supper by the Sign of the
Croſs, where no Perſon had ever done it
before; and that, without having any need
to be put in mind of it. But that which
ſtill increas'd our Joy, was, that the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of our Guides, who might be about
Seventeen Years of Age, after Supper, of
his own accord, ſang in the Tune of the
Church, <hi>Sancta Maria, Ora pro nobis;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been yet taught no more than that. I
continued the Litanies, and he anſwer'd
me. Towards Evening our principal Guide
gave a Signal, with a ſort of a Pipe, that
may be heard at a great Diſtance. The next
Day, being the Fifth of <hi>May,</hi> we had a
very rainy Morning, which hinder'd us
from going forward; but notwithſtanding
the Rain about Nine a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we ſaw three young <hi>Acoquas,</hi> who were
ſent to know who we were, we went with
them towards Noon, and about Three a
Clock arriv'd ſoon after them, at the firſt
Hut of the <hi>Acoquas;</hi> which is at Two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and Twenty Five Minutes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Latitude. They were mightily pleas'd
to ſee us; for in all appearance, they had
ſome conſiderable time before heard of our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60479:163"/>
Voyage. They ſo familiarly acquainted
themſelves with us, that in Three Days
time, there was not one of them that refus'd
to pray to God; and we every Day put 'em
upon ſaying their Prayers Morning and
Evening. The Second Day our firſt Guide
brought us to two other Cottages not far
off; where we were entertain'd with as
much Kindneſs, as Strangers could deſire of
a Savage People: Immediately, thoſe that
liv'd about a Day's Journey more remote
receiv'd the News of our Arrival, and came
to ſee us. They all admir'd our Hats, our
Caſſocks, our Shooes, a Gun; which we
made our firſt Guide diſcharge from time
to time, in great Companies of 'em; the
Pictures of our <hi>Breviaries,</hi> our Writing,
and the Songs of the Church, which they
deſir'd to hear a great many times in a Day.
They heard our Inſtructions with Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſeem'd to have very good Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to be much affected, when we
told 'em, that formerly the People of our
Country were ignorant of God, and that
ſome good People came into our Nation,
who taught us, that there was a God, who
would make us happy for ever in Heaven;
and what we were to do, that we might
go to that bleſſed Place: That we were
come to do them the ſame good Office, that
they might go to Heaven as well as we.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60479:163"/>
That which gives me good Hopes of the
Converſion of this Nation, is, that they
heard thoſe Commands of God with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
which are moſt oppoſite to their
ancient Manner of living. And this gives
me occaſion to ſpeak more diſtinctly of
what I have remark'd in theſe Two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nouragues</hi> and the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion, are the ſame with the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libis.</hi>
They acknowledge there is a God,
but don't worſhip him. They ſay he dwells
in Heaven, without knowing whether he
is a Spirit or no, but rather ſeem to believe
he has a Body. The <hi>Galibis</hi> call God
(17) <hi>Tamoucicabo;</hi> that is as much as to ſay,
the Ancient of Heaven. The <hi>Nouragues</hi> and
the <hi>Acoquas</hi> call him <hi>Maire,</hi> and never talk
of him but in fabulous Stories: They have
a great many Superſtitions, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
like the idle Tales and Fooleries of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in which I never obſerv'd 'em practiſe
any Idolatry: But I am very much afraid
their Phyſicians, by their juggling Tricks,
debauch the Women and Maids; for they
have given me great Reaſon to think ſo.</p>
                  <p>The natural Diſpoſition of the <hi>Nouragues</hi>
and <hi>Acoquas</hi> is mild; but the more remote
from the Sea the <hi>Nouragues</hi> live, the more
tractable you'll find 'em; for the frequent
Concourſe they have with the <hi>Indians,</hi> on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60479:164"/>
the Sea-Coaſts, renders 'em more uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
and difficult to be treated with. 'Tis
certain, the <hi>Acoquas</hi> are quite another ſort
of People, than the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Cayenne</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
'em to be, who account 'em fierce,
cruel, treacherous and perfidious, to thoſe
they entertain, For if one may judge of
that Nation, by near Two Hundred of 'em,
whom we have ſeen, they are an honeſt,
affable, pleaſant People, and are very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
and ready to receive what is ſaid to
'em. Tis true, they not long ſince exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
a ſmall Nation, and eat ſeveral of
them; but I attribute this Barbarity to the
ill Cuſtom of the Country, rather than to
the Diſpoſition of the People; and this
ſeems the more probable, becauſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
Two or Three Days after our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
that there was half a Day's Journey
from us, ſome of the Fleſh of a <hi>Magapa</hi>
(the Name of a People that are their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
whom they had newly kill'd with
another, while they were watching their
opportunity to ſurprize one or other of the
<hi>Acoquas</hi> alone; and beſides, one of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Cottage having ſet before us the
Jaw of a young Man; we told 'em, <hi>This
was not well done, and that God forbids us
to kill an Enemy, when we take him Priſoner,
and to eat him afterwards:</hi> At this they
look'd down very much without giving
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60479:164"/>
one Word of a Reply. Another time, the
Maſter of one of the Cottages having heard,
that the <hi>Galibis</hi> to hinder us from underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this Voyage, had threaten'd us, that
we ſhould be roaſted by the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> was
fill'd with great Indignation at it, and
could not be pacified till I told him, I took
thoſe <hi>Galibis</hi> for Lyars and Fools: Having
moreover, told 'em, I had been made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
of War by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and reſtor'd
to the <hi>French,</hi> without receiving any harm;
and that God would not allow us to kill
thoſe we took in War; they ſeem'd pretty
well to approve of this Law. And tho'
this barbarous Cuſtom is a Point ſo much
eſtabliſh'd and receiv'd in all Times among
the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> and among the <hi>Nouragues</hi> too;
yet it ſeems, by what I have been relating,
to be no difficult Matter to reſtrain 'em
from this Savage Practice, of killing and
eating their Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polygamy</hi> is a Second Obſtacle which we
found againſt the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
theſe Two Nations of the <hi>Nouragues,</hi>
and <hi>Acoquas;</hi> for where there's one Man
to be found, that has but one Wife, there
are ſix, who have each of 'em two or
three. The Hope that may be conceiv'd
for the eradicating of this Vice, is, not
concerning Perſons that are already pre-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in this evil Cuſtom, but only thoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60479:165"/>
that have yet but one Wife, and young
Men that are not yet married, who might
be perſwaded to be content with one Wife.
I confeſs, there's no hope of working upon
the others.</p>
                  <p>The Way of Living among the People
of theſe Two Nations, is very agreeable,
and has ſomething more courteous in it,
than that of the <hi>Galibis.</hi> For Inſtance, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Galibis,</hi> thoſe that are married,
dine every one apart, and thoſe that are
unmarried eat all together; and all the
Women, Maids and little Children, go to
another ſide of the Hut to eat. The <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues</hi>
and <hi>Acoquas</hi> do quite otherwiſe, for
the Husband eats with his Wife, or Wives
and Children with admirable Agreement
and Union. They don't drink (19) much,
but are great eaters; and are always Fiſhing
or Hunting, in which they ſpare no Pains,
to get their Living. They are all Lyars,
as well as all other <hi>Indians,</hi> that we know.
And when they perceive their Lyes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
they retire, ſeeming to be a little
aſham'd, but will not fail to frame a Lye
again on the next Occaſion. The <hi>Nouragues</hi>
endeavour'd to fright us with a great many
Stories of their own Invention, to make us
alter our Reſolution of going to the <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quas,</hi>
that we might ſpend all our Stock of
Goods with them; ſometimes telling us,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60479:165"/>
they had ſeen the Track of ſome ſtrange
wild Beaſt; ſometimes that the <hi>Caranes,</hi>
their Enemies, were running up and down
their Woods, and that they had obſerv'd
the Steps of Three of that Nation not far
from their Hut: But when they ſaw they
could not terrifie us, they did what we
would have 'em. This Vice induces 'em
to promiſe much, and to perform but little;
which alſo is occaſion'd by the little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they have, to eſteem any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Value and Importance of
it; for this makes 'em not matter what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
they do any one, in breaking their
Word; nor how much they diſhonour
themſelves in ſo doing. To have a thorough
Conception, how common this is in theſe
Two Nations (which is alſo rife among all
the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations we are acquainted with)
one muſt compare 'em to little Children,
who eſteem what they ſee only by Fancy:
They are alſo ſubject to Steal; ſo that ſome
times they muſt be narrowly watch'd, or
elſe they will be pilfering one thing or
other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nouragues</hi> make about Six or Seven
Hundred Perſons, the <hi>Mercious,</hi> who dwell
on the Weſt-ſide of 'em, are equal to 'em
in Number; the <hi>Acoquas</hi> are South of 'em,
and conceal'd from us the Strength of their
Nation; however, I ſuppoſe it may be three
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60479:166"/>
or four times ſtronger than that of the
<hi>Nouragues;</hi> for having ask'd an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
how many Cottages there were on
one ſide, to which we pointed; ſhe told
us, there were Ten; then pointing toward
the Quarter, where their Chief dwelt, ſhe
took a (20) Handful of her Hair, to ſignifie
to us, the great Number of Cottages there
were on that ſide. Between the <hi>Acoquas,</hi>
and the <hi>Mercious,</hi> they told us, there was
the Nation of the <hi>Pirios,</hi> which the <hi>Acoquas</hi>
ſay, are equal to themſelves in Strength:
On the Eaſt and South-Eaſt-ſide are the
<hi>Pirionaus,</hi> and on the Eaſt the <hi>Pirios</hi> and
<hi>Magapas,</hi> and in the midſt of all theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the <hi>Morous,</hi> who are very barbarous.
Theſe Nations all ſpeak one and the ſame
Language, and are underſtood by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes,</hi>
who are the Enemies of the <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragues.</hi>
They alſo ſay, the <hi>Maranes,</hi> who
are a very great People, underſtand the
ſame Tongue: On the South South-Weſt
of the <hi>Acoquas</hi> are the <hi>Aramiſas,</hi> whoſe
Language borders on that of the <hi>Galibis,</hi>
having a great many of the ſame Words in
it, tho' they are unacquainted with that
Nation. The <hi>Acoquas</hi> ſay, theſe <hi>Aramiſas</hi>
are a very great Nation. If there be a Lake
of <hi>Parima,</hi> theſe People can't be Forty
Leagues diſtant from it on the North-ſide:
We could get no Account of this Lake.

There was not one <hi>Indian,</hi> who when
we enquir'd of them, whether they did not
know of a vaſt Place of Water like the Sea,
the Sand of which is <hi>Caracoli</hi> (for ſo they
call Gold, Silver and Copper) could give
me the leaſt Intelligence of it. Theſe
(21) <hi>Aramiſas</hi> are in the ſame Longitude,
wherein the Maps place the Eaſtern Part of
the Lake of <hi>Parima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After we had been with the <hi>Acoquas</hi>
Twelve or Thirteen Days, the Air grew
unwholſome, by an exceſſive Heat, at a
time when there was very little Wind;
which ſeldom fails to blow in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
and indeed, 'tis that that renders 'em
habitable. Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> was taken with
a Tertian Ague, and the ſtrongeſt of our
Servants alſo fell very ſick: We therefore
preſs'd our Guides to return, ſince they
were not willing to conduct us any farther,
nor ſuffer the <hi>Acoquas</hi> to go and fetch their
Chief, who dwelt at the Diſtance of Three
Days Journey, from the Place where we
were, with whom we would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
an Alliance. Theſe Three Guides
became inſolent, upon the Suppoſition, that
it was to honour them that the <hi>Acoquas</hi>
came in ſuch great Numbers; tho' in all
appearance, it was the Curioſity of ſeeing
us <hi>French</hi> Men that brought 'em together:
They became very troubleſome, eſpecially
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60479:167"/>
the <hi>Morou,</hi> who gave ſufficient Indications
of his wicked Diſpoſition, perſwading the
<hi>Acoquas,</hi> that we ought to leave them
all our Wares; theſe ſo unreaſonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
did not much ſurprize us; but to give
'em good Hopes of our Return, we left an
(22) Iron Tool of Half a Crown Price with
one of 'em, who had but one Wife, upon
Condition, that I ſhould have a great
(23) Hamock when I came again; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
I would then give him a Bill and a
Knife, to make up what this wanted of the
Value of it. I made choice of this Man
on purpoſe to ſignifie what reſpect I had
for lawful Marriages; and he underſtood
me very well, and promis'd me, he would
not take a Second Wife, during the Life
of this he already had, with whom he had
liv'd at leaſt Eight or Nine Years, for
they had a Daughter about Seven Years
old; however, this Project facilitated our
Return.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> we embark'd on the
River <hi>Camopi,</hi> in Two <hi>Canoo</hi>'s; Father <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamel</hi>
was in the leaſt of 'em, with our
principal <hi>Nourague,</hi> and an <hi>Acoquas,</hi> who
had a Mind to go with us to <hi>Cayenne;</hi> and
I went in the other with our Two Servants,
the <hi>Morou,</hi> and the young <hi>Nourague,</hi> who
not taking care to guide the Veſſel right,
let it run ſo near the Precipice of a great
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60479:167"/>
Fall of Water, that thoſe in the other <hi>Canoo,</hi>
cry'd out, believing we ſhould be loſt: But
theſe Two young Men, with much ado,
brought our <hi>Canoo</hi> under a Rock, that brake
the Violence of the Stream, and getting up
the Rock, with all their Might, drew the
<hi>Canoo</hi> out of this Danger. 'Tis abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more dangerous to go down theſe Falls,
than to get up 'em; becauſe they choſe
thoſe places where the Water runs leſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to get the <hi>Canoo</hi> up with main
Strength, whereas in going down 'em they
take the ſwifteſt Part of the Stream, ſo that
one runs a greater Hazard of one's Life,
than can eaſily be expreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>After having paſs'd theſe Dangers, the
Second Day after we embark'd, our young
<hi>Nourague,</hi> that had never run the like Riſque
before, ſaid in his own Language, <hi>God is
good, and is not angry with us.</hi> When we
came to the Place, where we were to go
by Land, betwixt the River <hi>Inipi</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naporibo,</hi>
our Guides, who were well load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Hamocks, and other things, which
they had bought of the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> were not
willing to help us, which yet they would
have done, if that <hi>Morou</hi> had not put 'em
out of Humour: They walk'd very faſt, as
the <hi>Indians</hi> are wont to do, when they
are loaded, and at laſt left us at Five
Leagues diſtance from <hi>Tenaporibo;</hi> but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60479:168"/>
by the Goodneſs of God we got thro'
without loſing our Way, by following a
Path, in which theſe <hi>Indians</hi> had thrown
little Boughs, in ſeveral places where it
was not eaſie to diſcern the Track; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
which Way they went. When we
came within Three quarters of a League of
the firſt Cottages, we heard ſome <hi>Nouragues</hi>
calling to us, who brought us <hi>Caſſave</hi> and
<hi>Fiſh</hi> to eat, and ſome <hi>Ovicou</hi> to drink.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Day of <hi>June</hi> our young <hi>Morou,</hi>
being drunk, treated us very ill, which
made us reſolve to return to <hi>Cayenne</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Canoo,</hi> and in the Company of other
<hi>Indians,</hi> and the rather becauſe our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
increas'd upon us. I had a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fever, and a great Cough, and Father
<hi>Bechamel</hi> was very ill, as well as the luſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of our Servants. And now as we had
need of the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to find a Conveniency for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
ſo it pleas'd God to manifeſt to us,
how particular a Care he took of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
in furniſhing us with what we
needed; not indeed, at the Time we wiſh'd,
nor after that Manner we thought beſt, but
in ſuch a Seaſon, and in ſuch a Way, as
was moſt convenient for us, 'till at length
we arriv'd at <hi>Cayenne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second Day of <hi>June</hi> we made an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with the firſt <hi>Nourague,</hi> who had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60479:168"/>
done us ſome Service at <hi>Caraotibo,</hi> Three
Leagues from <hi>Aproague,</hi> who was of a very
good Temper, and was come thither with
two other <hi>Nouragues</hi> of the ſame Place,
who had a Kindneſs for us, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to return Home as ſoon as they could.
We determin'd to ſet forward the next
Day, to prevent our <hi>Morou,</hi> and our other
Guides, who were elſewhere, from oppoſing
our Deſign. We were to go three Leagues by
Land, or Seven by Water, to get to this
Man's <hi>Canoo;</hi> but I was ſo ill, I could not
go by Land, and our Servant was asbad as I,
ſo that we were forc'd to ſeek a <hi>Canoo,</hi> to go
by Water, the Providence God provided
us a little One, which we hired, that was
ſunk in the Water, but was big enough to
carry Four of us; namely, the <hi>Indian</hi> and
his Wife, our Servant and my ſelf. Father
<hi>Bechamel,</hi> tho' very weak, had the Courage
to undertake the Journey on Foot, with
our other Servant. We were deſirous to have
gone forward the next Day, from the Place
where this <hi>Nourague</hi>'s <hi>Canoo</hi> lay; but we
ſhould not have been able to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
this Fatigue: It pleas'd God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for our Welfare, on this occaſion, in
permitting the <hi>Indians</hi> to detain us Eleven
Days in this Place, where there were near
Sixty Perſons: The Chief of whom, who
had a Son in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Cayenne,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60479:169"/>
plac'd us in a Cottage by our ſelves, that
we might not be diſturb'd, with the Noiſe
of a great Merry-meeting they were going
to have, and order'd his Wife to treat us
the beſt ſhe could: This was partly from
his good Humour, and partly to ſecure
his Son from receiving any ill Treatment
from the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Cayenne.</hi> God was pleas'd,
during our ſtay here, to give us an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
again, to inſtruct a Woman that was
almoſt eaten up with Cancers; ſo that ſhe
was at length baptiz'd by Father <hi>Bechamel,</hi>
the Day before we left this Place: This Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was ſo weak, that he could not repeat
his Breviary walking; and yet the next
Day, he was ſtrong enough to walk near
a League from thence to embark. There
now remain'd but one Difficulty to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with, ſince we were in the Hands of
Three very honeſt <hi>Nouragues;</hi> and that was,
how to get away from <hi>Camiati</hi>'s Cottage,
with our little Cheſt that contain'd all our
Goods; and to find a convenient Paſſage
to the Mouth of the <hi>Aproague;</hi> for I had
promis'd <hi>Camiati,</hi> to continue with him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my return from the <hi>Acoquas;</hi> and thoſe
People are not very eaſie, when they ſee
us carry our Commodities out of their Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
ſo that we had Reaſon to fear, that
he would detain us with him, at leaſt Two
Months, before he would conduct us to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60479:169"/>
the <hi>Indians,</hi> that dwell at the mouth of the
<hi>Aproague:</hi> But it pleas'd God to remove all
theſe Obſtructions; for our Three <hi>Noura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
promis'd to convey us to the Sea, upon
condition that we would give 'em an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Reward. And as we went by <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati</hi>'s
Cottage, we found he was gone a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and thoſe we found in his Cottage
were only his Two Wives, and ſome Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
who durſt not hinder us from taking
our little Cheſt, and our Three Guides,
tho' they were affraid to diſpleaſe <hi>Camiati</hi>
their Chief, yet knew not how to refuſe to
lead us to a Cottage that was a League low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
where at that time no body dwelt, and
hither they were to go in order to paſs by
Land to <hi>Caraotibo</hi> where they dwelt, and to
conduct their Wives thither, and then to
come back again to us; tho' they would
fain have ſet us aſhore at <hi>Camiati</hi>'s Houſe, and
left us there.</p>
                  <p>When we Arriv'd at the empty Cottage, I
found my ſelf ſo ill, that I thought I ſhould
have died; but being ſomewhat recruited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and perceiving the Maſter of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo</hi>
had a mind to go and ſpeak with <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati,</hi>
and that one of our Servants deſir'd to
go with him, to fetch a Hound he had
bought that was run away thither. I gave him
an Iron-tool of half a Crown price to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from me to <hi>Camiati,</hi> that he might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60479:170"/>
his Wives to prepare me a Hamock, and
bid him tell him I would pay the reſt at my
return, which ſhould be as ſoon as I had
recover'd my Health: this I did to prevent
his offering any injury to our Servant, and
that he might not oppoſe us in our deſign
of going back. The Maſter of the <hi>Canoo</hi>
told the Story of the Affront the Young
<hi>Morou</hi> gave us, and of the ill Condition of
my Health, ſo well to <hi>Camiati;</hi> that when
he had receiv'd the Preſent I ſent him, he
would needs accompany me to the Mouth
of the <hi>Aproague,</hi> to the Cottage of the Chief
of the <hi>Sapayes,</hi> whom he had had a mind to
Viſit a great while, being his very good
Friend. He came accordingly the next day
with one of his Sons, who was about Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Years of Age, and his Two Wives, and
ſent home Two of our Guides, taking their
places, he ſent the Woman, and one of our
Servants one League by Land. Our other
Servant continued in the <hi>Canoo</hi> to row, or
to uſe the Term of the Country to <hi>Pagay,</hi>
with theſe Three ſtout <hi>Nouragues;</hi> we alſo
remain'd in the <hi>Canoo,</hi> by reaſon of our
Weakneſs, which would not ſuffer us to go
this League by Land. They lighted the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo</hi>
thus, that they might the better paſs a
fall of the River, that was ſo rough and
difficult, that the <hi>Indians</hi> could not chooſe
but turn pale at the extreme danger we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60479:170"/>
were in. One time amongſt others they
toil'd ſo hard to keep the <hi>Canoo</hi> from being
carry'd down a precipice of Water, that
when they had made ſhift to get under a
Rock, that breaks the Violence of the Stream,
they were forc'd to reſt themſelves for half
a quarter of an Hour, becauſe they were ſo
much ſpent, that they could ſcarce fetch
their Breath. I have twice been very near
being caſt away in two Ships, but the ſight
of this fall of the River was more dreadful
to me, than any thing I ever ſaw at Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Nineteenth of <hi>June</hi> we paſs'd down
Two of theſe Falls, at the firſt they ſent the
Women away by Land, and croſs'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to know of a <hi>Galibi</hi> that was lately come
thither to make a new Cottage, what courſe
they had beſt take to avoid being over-ſet,
becauſe the Bed of the River declin'd, ſo that
it gave an extraordinary rapidity to the
Stream; and beſides there were a great many
Rocks under water, againſt which we were
liable to be daſh'd, and ſo caſt away. And
obſerving our Men were in a great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
in their minds about it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the directions this Man gave 'em,
we intreated him to conduct us through
this difficult paſſage, promiſing him a
Fiſhing-hook for his pains, which he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undertook, and happily perform'd.
At the Second which was the laſt we met
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60479:171"/>
with upon the <hi>Aproague,</hi> we all went aſhore
and walk'd along the River-ſide upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uneven Rocks, and the <hi>Nouragues</hi> held
the <hi>Canoo</hi> by a Line which they tied behind
it, and ſo let it go gently down this place,
which is very dangerous at Low-water, for
the Flowing of the Tide covers it, tho'
'tis Twenty Leagues up the River.</p>
                  <p>After we had paſs'd theſe many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by the mercy of God; we at laſt had no
Caſſave left, no Meat nor Fiſh, nor <hi>Ovicou,</hi>
when we were diſtant a days Voyage and
a half from the Cottage of the <hi>Sapayes,</hi> but
God of his Goodneſs was pleas'd to make
Proviſion for our great neceſſity; for as
we coaſted along the River we ſaw a Dog
barking; upon which the <hi>Nouragues</hi> call'd
out to know if any body were a Hunting,
and preſently to their great joy perceiv'd it
was their good Friend, the Chief of the
<hi>Sapayes,</hi> who came to us, and ſaluted us all
with demonſtrations of Friendſhip. We
did what the <hi>Nouragues</hi> would not venture
to do, that is, to ask him to ſell us ſome
Proviſion; acquainting him, that neither
we nor the <hi>Nouragues</hi> had any left. When
he underſtood in what neceſſity we were,
he ſent to fetch his <hi>Canoo,</hi> which was a
large one, and very well ſtor'd with <hi>Caſſave,
Ovicou,</hi> Meat and Fiſh (24) <hi>Boucaneed;</hi>
which he furniſh'd us and the <hi>Nouragues,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60479:171"/>
and we paid him for it immediately. He
told us his Lodging was a League off,
whither he would come and meet us in the
Evening, and that becauſe his little half-cover'd
Hut had only room enough for
him and his Men, we muſt make another
for our ſelves. He came according to his
word toward Night, and the next day he
made Father <hi>Bechamel</hi> and me go into his
<hi>Canoo,</hi> becauſe he thought the <hi>Nouragues
Canoo</hi> was over-loaded.</p>
                  <p>On the 21ſt we Arriv'd at the Cottage of
this Chief of the <hi>Sapayes,</hi> where we were
kindly entertain'd. We were no ſooner got
thither, but we began to think how we
ſhould get from thence to <hi>Cayenne;</hi> and we
could think of no better way, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the Chief of the <hi>Sapayes</hi> to conduct
us thither himſelf, which would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up Three Weeks time, and would have
been a great charge to us, but the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God had made Proviſion for us,
for the next day we were inform'd that a
Chief of the <hi>Galibis</hi> would come the day
following to take a <hi>Sapaye</hi> with him to go
to <hi>Cayenne,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Maroui,</hi>
from whence he was to fetch his Son, who
had been there with the <hi>Sapayes</hi> for Two
Years, as well as the Son of the Chief of
the <hi>Sapayes.</hi> He was willing to take us in
his <hi>Canoo</hi> for a ſmall matter, and we went to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60479:172"/>
Lodge at a ſmall Iſland, which is in the
River at a pretty good diſtance from the
Sea; here we ſtay'd the Twenty fourth of
<hi>June.</hi> I obſerv'd that the Sea came up here
Eight Foot high, and concluded from
thence, becauſe it covers the laſt Fall of the
River, that it declines but Eight Foot in
the ſpace of Twenty five Leagues from the
Sea. In the Night they heard the Cry of a
Bird, and ſaid to one another in the <hi>Galibis</hi>
Tongue, <hi>Hark how the Devil cries;</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
'em, telling 'em they were miſtaken,
and that the Devil had no Body, but was
a Spirit as our Souls are, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to be Inviſible and Immortal, which
yet they do not ſay of the Devils, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that their Phyſicians or <hi>Piaies</hi> kill 'em
with great Clubs. <hi>The Nouragues</hi> of one
Cottage made the Figure of a Man in the
the way by which they thought the Devil
came to their Cottage in the Night, to
make 'em Sick; that ſo while he ſtop'd at
this Fantome and took it to be a <hi>Nourague,</hi>
the <hi>Piaies</hi> that watch'd for him might take
their opportunity, when they ſaw him, to
knock him on the head. We parted from
this Iſland to go and lodge at <hi>Co,</hi> from
whence the next day we ſaw a great many
<hi>Canoos</hi> of the <hi>Galibis</hi> at Sea, which were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward the River of <hi>Amazons,</hi> theſe
the Maſter of our <hi>Canoo,</hi> and the <hi>Sapaye</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60479:172"/>
went to viſit, drawing their <hi>Canoos</hi> along
over the Mud at Low-water, and found in
one of 'em the Two Young Men they were
going to ſeek for at <hi>Maroui.</hi> They had
now nothing to do but to carry us to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne;</hi>
and becauſe the Sea was ſo rough,
that they could not well bear up againſt it,
we deſir'd 'em to ſet us aſhore at <hi>Mahuti,</hi>
the firſt place we could land at in the Iſland
of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> which they compaſs'd with a
great deal of Labour. As ſoon as I ſet my
Foot upon the Sand, I fell down upon my
Knees to thank God for the Protection he
had favour'd us with for a Hundred and
Seventy Leagues, ſince we came from the
Country of the <hi>Acoquas,</hi> for our whole
Voyage was Two hundred and forty
Leagues. We went to lodge at the Houſe of
Monſ. <hi>Fontain,</hi> whoſe Eſtate lies in this part
of the Iſland; and he receiv'd us with
great Joy. The next day being the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeventh, Father <hi>Bechet</hi> came to fetch us
with Two Horſes, and we borrow'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of (25) Monſieur <hi>Fontaine,</hi> and ſo
Arriv'd at the Fort of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> where the
Governor was pleas'd to treat us with all
imaginable Friendſhip. And all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came about us, to ſee us, and to ſignifie
the geat affection they had to us. In three
Months I hope by the Grace of God to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
the Marſhes of the <hi>Aracarets,</hi> the <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60479:173"/>
the <hi>Mayes,</hi> the <hi>Marones,</hi> and the
<hi>Couſſades,</hi> whoſe Habitations ſtand more
thick and cloſe one to another, than thoſe
I have given an account of in this Relation.
Here's a great Field open'd to the Goſpel-Labourers,
into which I am ready to conduct
thoſe that are willing to employ themſelves
in it, as well as to diſcover to 'em a great
many other Nations: Being fully reſolv'd
by the Grace of God to expoſe my Life for
ſo Glorious a purpoſe, as the Propagation
of the Goſpel, and the Converſion of ſuch
Numbers of People.</p>

down their Beds and Hamocks, and hang 'em
in the <hi>Carbet,</hi> which is their kind of Hall or
Out-houſe, the Props of which not only
ſerve to ſupport the Roof, which is made of
Palm-leaves, but alſo to hang up all the Beds
of the Men and Boys in the Family, and
thoſe of Strangers, when at any time they
entertain 'em. This <hi>Carbet</hi> is plac'd Ten or
Twelve paces on the upper-ſide of the Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

of the Hut ſerves for the <hi>Carbet;</hi> where
the Men ſpend the day (when they are at
home) in making their Bows and Arrows,
and what other conveniencies they want;
for their buſineſs is different from that of
the Women in theſe Parts, as well as in moſt
other Places. But there's one thing belonging
to the other Sex which the Men have uſurp'd,
that deſerves to be treated on in a particular
Article, of which I ſhall only ſpeak a word
or two here by the by. They go to bed, when
their Wives are deliver'd, and receive the
Compliments of their happy delivery as if
they had endur'd the pain, and accordingly
anſwer their Viſitors as the Women do on
the like occaſion in other places. This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom

which frequently hold 3 or 4 days,
continuing till they have drank up all their
Liquor; which is what the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Faire

very ſtrong by fermentation, as that
which they call <hi>Palinot,</hi> which they make
with <hi>Caſſave</hi> that is bak'd more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
The pieces of which they pile up one
upon another when they are very hot, and
keep 'em thus till they begin to be mouldy,
after which they mix them with <hi>Potatoes,</hi>
which they cut in ſmall pieces as well as the
<hi>Caſſave,</hi> and put them in great Earthen Jarrs,
then they pour a proportionate quantity of
Water upon 'em, and ſo leave all to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and work together till this Liquor is
as ſtrong as they deſire; which is after about
5 or 6 days fermentation. They ſtrain it
before they uſe it, and then 'tis of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Conſiſtence of Beer, of a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
taſt, but much more heady and intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating.
They have beſides a great many
ſorts of drink, the diverſity of which Reſults
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60479:177"/>
from the different Fruits of which they make
'em. But that which they ordinarily make uſe
of, is as white as Milk, and of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.
It is very refreſhing and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and is compos'd of <hi>Caſſave</hi> bak'd after
their ordinary manner, and <hi>Potatoes</hi> boil'd
with it, till they are of the conſiſtence of
Paſte, this they put into Baskets lin'd with
the Leaves of <hi>Bonano</hi>-trees, in which it keeps
good for a Month, and then begins to grow
ſower, but not quite ſo ſoon if it be kept in
a cool place. When they uſe it they ſteep
as much as they have preſent occaſion for in
a ſufficient quantity of Water, and if they
are at leiſure they ſtrain it: But they often
only ſteep it, and drink it without ſtraining,
and if Sugar or Sugar-cains bruis'd be mix'd
with it, it comes very near the taſt, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

<hi>Ovacou</hi> upon the Continent; and <hi>Ovicou</hi> in

why the <hi>Europeans</hi> can never attain to make
it ſo good as the <hi>Indians</hi> do, is becauſe theſe
chew the <hi>Potatoes</hi> and <hi>Caſſave,</hi> before they
boil 'em together, and underſtand better
what degree of boyling they require, to give
this Liquor its greateſt perfection. But the
ſeeing this way of its preparation turns ones
ſtomach more than the reading of it; and

the Wine that waſhes the dirty Feet of the

Cotton-thread, but courſer. Thoſe of <hi>Brazil</hi>
have all a great Fringe on each ſide, and have

place, that are made juſt alike: The <hi>Galibis</hi>
paint moſt of 'em Red, after they are made,
and while they are yet upon the Loom. The
<hi>Brazilian</hi> Women make ſcarce any but white
Hamocks; and if they mix either Red, or
Blue, or Green, with the White, or all of
'em together (as they do frequently) they
work 'em with Thread ready dyed, and ſo
the Men don't touch 'em; whereas in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
theſe Beds are painted only by the Men,
the Women leaving this Work to them,

Foot long, and 3 or 4 Inches Diameter;

lie a-croſs upon two Pieces of Wood, about
8 or 9 Foot from the Ground, more or leſs,
according to the Length the Work-woman
is order'd, or deſigns her ſelf to make her
Bed. The other round Stick hangs direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Sticks that the Warp of the Hamock is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd,
after which they have a kind of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60479:179"/>
Shuttle, which they put through the
Threads, to weave it after the Manner of
our Gloth: But becauſe they put their Shuttle
through Thread by Thread, one above and
the other below; this Work is extreamly
tedious, and has need of no leſs Patience
than theirs.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Brazil</hi> having much more work
about 'em, require the more Time and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
to make 'em; but one ſort and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are very much bought in the Iſlands,
where almoſt all the <hi>Europeans</hi> make uſe of
'em; and they are very good to uſe in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
eſpecially in thoſe Places, where they
have but bad and uncleanly Beds, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> whither one might carry
'em without much trouble, they being very
light; for the biggeſt of 'em don't weigh
above 5 or 6 Pound, and thoſe of <hi>Brazil</hi> not
above half ſo much, becauſe they are thin
and fine; with 2 Pegs, or 2 great Nails
they may be hang'd up any where. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
place the Props of their Houſes at a
convenient diſtance one from another, for
this Purpoſe: They don't go out far into
the Country without theſe Beds; and there
are always enough left in their Houſes for
Strangers.</p>
                  <p>This ſort of Beds is likewiſe us'd almoſt
in all Southern <hi>America,</hi> to carry wounded
or ſick People in; thoſe that are put to this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60479:179"/>
uſe, have at each end a great Ring, through
which they put a Pole of a ſufficient length
for the Bed, and ſtrong enough to bear a
Man's Weight: And thus two <hi>Indians,</hi> one
before and t'other behind, carry the ſick
Man, ſupported in his Hamock, by the Pole
which they bear upon their Shoulders.</p>

the Manner the other do their Cotton
Hamocks. <hi>Pite</hi> is a kind of Hemp or Flax, but
much longer and whiter, of this they make
their Cords for the Tackling of the Maſts
and Sails of their <hi>Canoos,</hi> as for other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
this <hi>Pite</hi> is alſo much lighter and
ſtronger than Hemp, and nothing near ſo

RELATION
OF
G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>IANA,
AND OF THE
COMMERCE
THAT
May be Settled there.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iana</hi> is a great Country, on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of Northern <hi>America,</hi> which
extends in Latitude, from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
Line, to the Tenth Degree, on the
ſide of the Arctique Pole, and in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
from the River of <hi>Amazons</hi> to the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renoque,</hi>
which contains near Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Leagues on the Sea-Coaſts, with an
immenſe Stretch into the Countries that
border upon <hi>Brazil,</hi> on the South-ſide, and
<hi>New Audalouſia</hi> on the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60479:181"/>
Our <hi>French</hi> Seamen are wont to call <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi>
by the Name, of the <hi>North-Cape,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that is the moſt remarkable Cape on
that Coaſt; and thoſe that have Buſineſs in
thoſe Parts, commonly put aſhoar there, to
get ſome Knowledge of the Country.</p>
                  <p>This Cape is between the 2 and 3 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Northern Latitude, and between
the 345 and the 346 Degrees of Longitude.
This Part of the Continent is water'd with
abundance of Rivers, ſome of which will
carry great Veſſels up a conſiderable Way
beyond the Mouths of 'em; and upon the
Shoars of 'em; an infinite Number of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
might be made, which would turn
to a very conſiderable Account, as well in
regard of the Traffick that might be made
with the Natives, and the Fiſhing-Trade
that might be carried on in theſe Rivers,
and along the Sea-Coaſt, as of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Labour and Induſtry of the
Planters.</p>
                  <p>The divers Settlements the <hi>French</hi> have
made there at different Times, ſufficiently
prove the Poſſibility of living in good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with the <hi>Indians,</hi> provided
they be treated civilly; and with more
Honeſty and Sincerity than
<note n="*" place="margin">Monſieur <hi>de la Barre</hi> had not yet made a Settlement there, when this Account was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> they have done, who have
hitherto had the Conduct of
theſe kind of Enterprizes,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60479:181"/>
fall into their Hands. The ill Treatment
the Natives have receiv'd from them, for
which they have ſometimes made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
amends by way of Reprizal, have not
render'd 'em irreconcileable, as we have been
taught by Experience, when we have made
tryal of it on different Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>They are tolerably endued with good
Senſe, which they have opportunity to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
and refine by a long Train of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
with which the many Years they
live, furniſh 'em: For they count a Man
dies young, if he don't live above 100 Years.</p>
                  <p>They have a pretty good Judgment, and
have good rational Thoughts, about things
within the Compaſs of their Notice, and
within the Reach of the Light of Nature,
with which alone they are furniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>They obſerve their Words with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs,
and inviolably practiſe the Maxim,
of not doing to others, what they would
not have others do to them.</p>
                  <p>They are rather inclin'd to Peace than
War, which yet they engage in, either when
they have ſome juſt Quarrel, or when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
or Honour prompt 'em to it.</p>
                  <p>They are ſufficiently induſtrious, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have both Patience and Skill
in Fiſhing and Hunting, yet they have the
Fore-ſight, not to let their Subſiſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon Hazard; and therefore willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60479:182"/>
cultivate their Ground, in proportion
to their Occaſions, and the Bigneſs of their
Families.</p>
                  <p>Before <hi>Europe</hi> had furniſh'd them with
Tools of Iron and Steel for this Purpoſe,
they made themſelves ſome of hard Stones;
but beſides that the Labour of making 'em
was intolerable, the Pains they took in
uſing of 'em, was alſo ſo very great, that
they laid aſide the uſe of 'em, as ſoon as they
found they could do more Work in a Day
with our Hatchets, Bills and Knives, than
they could do in 6 Months with their Stone
Tools; which now are good for nothing,
but to be kept in the Cloſets of the Curious,
as ſo many Proofs of the wonderful Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of thoſe People.</p>
                  <p>They ſpeak a Tongue, which is not only
underſtood by all the Nations, which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> on
the other, have oblig'd to retire into <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana;</hi>
but is alſo intelligible to the <hi>Carraibes,</hi>
who are the Natives of the <hi>Antilles,</hi> and
uſe this Language: Which I have known
by the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Iſles of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi>
St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and others where I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to converſe with them. In ſhort, this
Language is ſpoken for the Space of above
Four Hundred Leagues on the Sea-Coaſts,
and in many Places above Sixſcore Leagues
up in the Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60479:182"/>
They bring up all ſorts of tame Fowl,
which they exchange with us for Toys, as
well as wild Fowl, and other Game, which
is there in great Plenty; as alſo abundance,
both of Sea, and Freſh-water Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>They build us Houſes after their Faſhion,
which are commodious enough for the
Country; they clear our Ground and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our Letters, they ſerve to load and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
Merchant Ships; and in a Word,
there's ſcarce any kind of Service but may
be obtain'd of 'em by a courteous Carriage,
and by giving 'em a few Trifles of a ſmall
Value, when they have occaſion for 'em.
They undertake even to load Ships entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a kind of Fiſh, which they catch
in the Rivers with a ſort of Harping-Iron;
and this they perform upon ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Terms, that thoſe who follow this
Trade by their Means, always find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Profit in it; becauſe the Vent
of 'em is always ſpeedy and certain in the
Iſlands, where there is a great Conſumption
of 'em made; ſo that one may ſay, this ſort
of Fiſh, and the Sea-Tortoiſe, are the Cod-fiſh
of the Continent, and the <hi>Antego</hi> Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis the <hi>Manna,</hi> upon which the
Colonies between the <hi>Tropiques</hi> live, as much
as many of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and ſome others,
do upon Cod-fiſh. This Fiſhing Trade
is practis'd all the Year in moſt of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60479:183"/>
on this Coaſt, except the Fiſhing for
Tortoiſe, which holds but 3 or 4 Months in
the Year; during which, the Females come
to lay their Eggs in the Sand, beyond the
Marks that are left of the higheſt Tides, and
that in ſo great abundance, (eſpecially on
the Shoars that are leaſt frequented) as can
hardly be imagin'd: For 10 Men can turn
as many of 'em in a Night, as 100 can dreſs
in a Week.</p>
                  <p>In the Night, which is the only time
they take to lay their Eggs, they wait 'till
they have paſs'd the Bounds, which the
higheſt Tides have mark'd, and then turn
'em upon their Backs, and being once in this
Poſture, they can by no means recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon their Feet to go back into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Among the Plants which the <hi>Indians</hi> cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
in their Plantations, Cotton is one of
thoſe that principally employs 'em, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Women who make this their
particular buſineſs; and thus find means to
adorn themſelves; for they know how to
ſpin it as fine as can be deſir'd. And if the
diſorders that have happen'd in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
upon the Continent, had not hinder'd
the Eſtabliſhing a Regular Traffick of it,
which might have been eaſily accompliſh'd;
I ſay, if it had not been for this, all <hi>Europe</hi>
might have been furniſh'd with it, in all
manner of ways in which it could have been
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60479:183"/>
imploy'd, without coſting the <hi>French</hi> any
more trouble or charge in a manner, than
that of receiving it; becauſe of the natural
and general inclination the <hi>Indians</hi> have
both for Work, and for Finery; eſteeming
a grain of Chriſtal to hang about their Neck
or at their Ears, as much as we ſhould do a
Diamond of the ſame bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it being well known, that Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
is one of thoſe Commodities that are
conſum'd the moſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Price
of which is leaſt varied, the Inhabitants of
the Iſlands would never have left off culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
it, if there had been Women enough
to ſpin it, without which it can't be Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
but with a great deal of Trouble,
and little Profit.</p>
                  <p>The Hamocks or Cotton-beds which the
<hi>Indians</hi> ſell us for a Bill or Hatchet, are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſold in the Iſlands with conſiderable
Advantage; every one there having one of
'em, and there are none of them brought from
any other Country than <hi>Guiana,</hi> except from
<hi>Braſil,</hi> and that but rarely, becauſe of the
ſmall Commerce the <hi>French</hi> have there.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Rocou</hi> is a red Die, and valuable
when 'tis natural, ſuch as the <hi>Indians</hi> ſell
us, before it has been falſified by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
who carry it into <hi>Europe.</hi> See

There are to be had among 'em likewiſe
divers ſorts of Gumms, Woods, and Roots
proper for Phyſick, which are good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in <hi>France,</hi> as well as ſeveral ſorts
of Wood proper for Dying; and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Cabinets and Inlaid Works, among
which is the Letter-wood, which the <hi>French</hi>
call <hi>Bois de la Chine,</hi> and which grows in no
other place in the World but on this part of
the Continent. The Natives cut it and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it in great burthens quite to the Ships ſo
cheap, that a 1000 weight of it comes to
but a Crown; whereas that quantity was a
long time ſold for a 100 Crowns, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for leſs than 150 <hi>Livres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe Animals that are fit for
ſport; as <hi>Apes</hi> of divers kinds, <hi>Sapajous, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marins,
Sagovius, Parrots, Arras</hi> and <hi>Tocaus:</hi>
I omit a great many other things, which
this Country produces; and one may ſay,
this large Compaſs of Ground has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
this Advantage above the Iſlands of
<hi>America,</hi> that there is no fear of tiring it;
as we are taught by Experience, the Iſland
of St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and others have been in
a little Space of Time, where the Land is
become almoſt barren, meerly by being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-burden'd
with continual Crops, becauſe
it can never be ſuffer'd to reſt, by Reaſon
of the ſmall Portion of Ground that every
Inhabitant poſſeſſes; which yet does not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60479:184"/>
hinder 'em from raiſing every Year a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Quantity of Sugar, beſides Ginger,
Indigo, Caſſia, and other Commodities that
are cultivated and made there.</p>
                  <p>This Country of <hi>Guiana</hi> is diverſified
with Hills, Plains and Meadows; and there
are ſcarce any Mountains but would turn
to a good Account, if they were manur'd:
The Land is every where ſo fertile, that one
Man may eaſily get, with his own Hands,
a Livelihood for Twenty People, the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation
of it is ſo very eaſie. The Fruits
of it are excellent, and very plentiful; and
all our ſorts of <hi>Corn</hi> grow there all the
Year round, without diſtinction of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that in a very little time: And
there being no Winter, the Trees are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
cover'd with Bloſſoms and Fruits,
and always with Leaves.</p>
                  <p>The Air is very good, and the Climate
very Temperate, tho' it be between the
<hi>Tropiques;</hi> for the Heat is continually mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
by a freſh Eaſt-wind, which blows
all the Year, except in the Night, when
the <hi>Breezes</hi> come from the Land, which
are only felt one or two Leagues toward
the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Waters are excellent, and keep good
throughout the longeſt Voyages, as has
been often experienc'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> where
they are never found to ſtink at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60479:185"/>
of the Ships, that have taken in their
Proviſion of 'em in this Country. It muſt
not be omitted, that there are on this Coaſt
a great many Iſlands ſo proper for the Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cattle, that provided ſome neceſſary
Precautions be obſerv'd, there is no doubt
but there would in a ſhort time be as great
a Number of 'em produc'd (if a Stock were
carried thither) in proportion, as in the
other Iſlands, whither Ships go every Day
for Hides; as they do to St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and
elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>This Account being drawn up only as a
Succinct Memoir of <hi>Guiana</hi> in general, and
of <hi>Cayenne</hi> in particular; I thought not
meet to extend it further, nor to give the
Detail of a Country, where the <hi>French</hi>
have now a Colony, from whence a more
ample Information may be expected.</p>
