            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Honour, some considerable time ago, being much Concern'd about the <hi>best Method</hi> in the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of your <hi>Children,</hi> was pleas'd to ask my Opinion therein: But my Thoughts concerning it, at that time, being but in the <hi>Embryo, conceiv'd</hi> upon the Reading a Treatise of <hi>EDUCATION,</hi> writ by the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious</hi> Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> to whose Opinion fearing I might be too partial by the Satisfaction his other Writings gave me, and knowing how <hi>unsafe</hi> and <hi>invidious</hi> it is to oppose <hi>Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Customs,</hi> I, as handsomly as I cou'd, declin'd the Matter. Only I ventur'd upon your pressing me further, to tell you I should prefer a <hi>Domestic</hi> to a <hi>public Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> Your Honour was pleas'd to inform me, you were of the same Mind, and desir'd me to enquire out a <hi>Tutor,</hi> proposing such a <hi>Sallary</hi> as I believe few Gentlemen in <hi>England</hi> give, and which might have invited into your Family a Man of <hi>Sobriety, Parts</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi> But tho' I durst not then venture my <hi>callow Thoughts</hi> abroad, after they were <hi>fledg'd</hi> and <hi>confirm'd</hi> by <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>mature Advice,</hi> at the Instance of your Worthy Brother, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> IAMES HUSTLER.</note> (a <hi>GENTLEMAN</hi> of that <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> that I dare not write his Character; and if I durst, of such <hi>Modesty,</hi> I shou'd be afraid to lose a Friendship, which has been so many ways to my Credit and
<pb facs="tcp:50980:3"/>
Advantage) I sent them to you in a few <hi>Proposals,</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make a <hi>Domestic Institution less chargeable</hi> to the <hi>Parent,</hi> and more <hi>Useful</hi> and <hi>Easie</hi> to the <hi>Child.</hi> Upon the Reading of which, some <hi>Objections</hi> arising, I was desir'd to <hi>answer</hi> them, and subjoyn the Reasons of the said <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Method,</hi> which I <hi>purpos'd</hi> to do with all the <hi>brevity</hi> I cou'd, and send them to you the same day. But beginning to think what <hi>Method</hi> to use therein, it seem'd necessary to shew there was a General <hi>Male-Treatment</hi> of <hi>Children;</hi> and this I conceive to be not only the most <hi>proper,</hi> but most <hi>useful</hi> way of <hi>proceeding</hi> in Cases of this Nature. For if I can prove a Reformation is necessary, I have gained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Point; and having no Ambition my <hi>Diminutive Name</hi> shou'd stand in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Reformers,</hi> shall be satisfy'd in the hopes of seeing some other more happy and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Proposals, in order to the effecting thereof. An honest and ingenuous Man ought not to be concern'd, that his <hi>Methods</hi> for <hi>Reformation,</hi> of any grievance in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> are rejected, if he has been so happy to Convince that <hi>some</hi> or <hi>other</hi> were Necessary.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS Of a Method of Institution, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Advantages of giving Children an <hi>Ingenuous</hi> and <hi>Liberal Education,</hi> are so well known in <hi>England</hi> to all <hi>ranks</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Men, we need no <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Edict,</hi> by which those <hi>Parents</hi> were depriv'd of the Freedom of their City, who were negligent in this Particular, being look'd upon fit for nothing but to cleanse Shoars, and carry Burdens, who condemn'd their <hi>Sons</hi> never to be fit for any better Employment. But tho' we are sufficiently Convinc'd of the <hi>Usefulness</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> thereof, we are very negligent and careless of the <hi>Methods</hi> whereby to effect it, and so more blame-worthy than some of the ignorant <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians,</hi> who possibly saw no such real benefit thereby. To be solicitous about the <hi>End,</hi> and neglect the <hi>Meaens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays I know not whether more <hi>Levity</hi> or <hi>Imprudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We generally think to give our Children education is but in other words, to send 'em to School; to whom, or for what, is not much material. It may be, about six or seven years after, 'tis expected a Lad shou'd understand Latin; if he does, all is well, if not, cries the Parent he's a Blockhead, I'll ne'r trouble my head further about him. If he is a Gentleman, may be he adds, He had as good play at Home as at School; and so the Youth being fit Company for none but Servants, familiarly converses and saunters away his Time with 'em. And now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told you his Company, you may guess at his Manners,
<q>
                  <l>Uva conspectâ livorem ducit ab uvâ,</l>
               </q>
But if a Tradesman, Away with the Dunce, I'll put him to 'prentice forthwith; so <hi>this</hi> often occasions <hi>that</hi> too, to be done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50980:4"/>
precipitately, and so he is little better for serving a tedious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiship, in a whipping <hi>Bridewell,</hi> under a flogging <hi>Orbilius.</hi> The better did I say? nay, generally worse, being habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated there to several Vices, which often keep him Company as long as he lives.</p>
            <p>But, if after all, the Parent is resolv'd, in spight of the <hi>Muses</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> his Son shall be a Scholar, after a sound Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is sent to another School, 6 or 7 years longer, to make his Verse end—<hi>Berecynthius Atys,</hi> and read a little—  <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without knowing any thing of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and perhaps Common Sense.</p>
            <p>To reform these, and such like Abuses, in Childrens common treatment, several worthy Persons have taken great pains, (as Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Fleury;</hi> but above all, the Learned and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> (whom I have not the Honour to know but by his excellent Pen) and treated this subject so well, that they will always be reckon'd as our best and chiefest <hi>Reformers.</hi> Not have they miss'd of success amonst <hi>discerning</hi> and <hi>impartial Readers;</hi> but most being otherwise, and the <hi>Heresies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown,</hi> and <hi>slubborn,</hi> a thorow <hi>Reformation</hi> cannot be expected on a sudden.</p>
            <p>Having often highly extoll'd the Method of learning <hi>Latin,</hi> as a <hi>Native of Rome,</hi> being convinc'd both by great Reasons, and great Authorities it must be the best; and being accus'd by some of Singularity, tho' following so great <hi>Authors,</hi> because I had made <hi>Proposals</hi> to some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> by which I suppos'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign might be best answer'd, I thought my self concern'd to give a Publick Account of my so doing; in the performance whereof, I shall insist in this Order:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Enquire into the manner of our Childrens general <hi>Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> both by <hi>Parent</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> and make some <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> on both.</item>
               <item>2. Lay down a <hi>Method,</hi> in 10 <hi>Proposals,</hi> whereby I conceive it easie to teach them to understand a <hi>Roman Author</hi> very well, write <hi>Latin elegantly,</hi> speak it <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>easily,</hi> gain a considerable knowledge in <hi>Logic, Rhetoric, Geography, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. in the space of two years.</item>
               <item>3. Assign the Reasons of the said <hi>Proposals,</hi> and answer <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>And lastly, Leave the whole to the Iudgment of the Candid and Iudicious Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50980:4"/>The Reasons of the slow Proficiency, and careless Institution of our Children, are such as either the <hi>Parents,</hi> or <hi>Master,</hi> is chargeable with.</p>

            <p>Who don't ordinarily take care to have their Children taught to read, till they are so habituated to <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Idleness,</hi> that their Teacher must have as much Labour to bring 'em into love with their Book, as otherwise wou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>No doubt, as soon as they can <hi>speak,</hi> they may be taught to <hi>read</hi> either by Father or Mother, with case and pleasure, without ever imposing it as a Task upon 'em. The Ingenious Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> tells us of a Person of great Quality and Worth, who by pasting the <hi>six Vowels</hi> on the six sides of a <hi>Die,</hi> and the remaining 18 <hi>Consenants</hi> on the sides of three other <hi>Dies,</hi> has play'd his Son into <hi>Spelling</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> with the greatest <hi>eagerness</hi> imaginable; and I doubt not but the said worthy Patriot may teach him <hi>Arithmetic, History, Music,</hi> with but a little deviation from that his so excellently <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived</hi> Method. <hi>Facile est inventis addere.</hi> This very Method, for fear of bad Consequences afterwards, may not be so well, but from it we have an hint for an hundred very harmless Inventions to teach Children to Read.</p>

If they do take care to send 'em to <hi>School,</hi> perhaps 'tis to some <hi>Woman</hi> who never knew any thing of <hi>Orthography,</hi> tho' she may make a shift to read her <hi>Prayers,</hi> or Murder a <hi>Gazette,</hi> confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Period with another, which she must needs do, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been acquainted with the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Pointing.</hi> Hence it comes to pass, that <hi>Vulgar People,</hi> who only have learn'd to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write</hi> at this rate, commit such horrible blunders in <hi>Spelling,</hi> and making no <hi>Points,</hi> are at the hazard of having no one, that writes <hi>true,</hi> to understand what they mean.</p>
            <p>I admire that <hi>Parents,</hi> that design their <hi>Children</hi> a <hi>Liberal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> shou'd commit them to such; they had better let all alone, for they contract such ill <hi>habits,</hi> as will cost their Master afterwards dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the trouble to unlearn 'em, as were requisite to learn 'em to read, and I shou'd scarce undertake to teach 'em for a double Reward: For to <hi>teach</hi> has a great deal of pleasure, to <hi>unteach</hi> has none at all to recommend it. To which I may add, That it not only discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Pupil, but is apt to create in him an aversion to his <hi>Tutor:</hi> And thus both the <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Scholar</hi> labour in vain.

And what is this <hi>good Scholar?</hi> He understands <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi> As tho' this were <hi>Accomplishment</hi> enough! This is so far from it, that 'tis undoubtedly but one <hi>Qualification,</hi> and that one of the least too, of a good School-master to little Children, whose tender years are to be imbu'd with <hi>Piety,</hi> and Principles of right <hi>Reason:</hi> He ought to be a <hi>Vertuous, Modest,</hi> and <hi>humble Man,</hi> and very <hi>patient;</hi> his chief business ought to be to dissipate by soft and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle means, those <hi>passions</hi> that would <hi>over-cast</hi> the early <hi>dawnings</hi> of infant <hi>Reason,</hi> that it may shine out <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>glorious;</hi> and with a gentle hand, to weed out the <hi>Tares</hi> which perhaps were sown when the Parents slept, before they are grown so high, as to choak the <hi>Culture</hi> of an <hi>Ingenuous</hi> and <hi>Liberal Education,</hi> to cherish the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Kindness,</hi> and <hi>good Nature,</hi> till they are grown into <hi>HABITS;</hi> to settle a <hi>Reverence</hi> to their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> and a <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Respect</hi> for <hi>all,</hi> and they will soon enough after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards learn to exert them in a <hi>fashionable Mein,</hi> and <hi>decent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,</hi> which, when they have learn'd with a <hi>Dancing-master,</hi> will more admirably become them, when their <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> not forc'd by <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Fashions,</hi> not <hi>Ap'd</hi> and <hi>Mimick'd,</hi> but found to be real by the Divine sweetness of their Looks, which no Art can teach, will not only challenge from all Persons an high Commendation of their Parts and Breeding, but also gain 'em every where an <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> for their <hi>Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ought not only to have these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> but a reasonable knowledge of Arts and Sciences, as <hi>Logic, Rhetoric, History, Geography,</hi> &amp;c. to speak <hi>Latin</hi> well and <hi>promptly,</hi> and understand the <hi>Greek Tongue;</hi> neither too young, nor too old, a proper well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Person, and of a good Presence.

            </p>
            <p>I confess it. And therefore get in one, as many as you can, and <note place="margin">A.</note> be content to abate him some of these last, (I mean as to Accuracy) but never any of the first; for in those that are to study as <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> this Age looks upon it a greater <hi>Accomplishment</hi> to have a taste of all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> so as to be able to discourse, and give some tolerable Account of each, as occasion shall offer, than to stick close to any particular Study, neglecting the rest, provided that when they are called to any <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Imployment</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> they then apply themselves close to that <hi>Study,</hi> which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50980:5"/>
may best qualifie them for it, and make all their other <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> as much as they can subservient thereto: But if design'd for <hi>Scholars,</hi> in whatsoever their Master is deficient, they may perfect themselves by their Industry, and a <hi>Tutors</hi> assistance, in the <hi>University.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Parents think 'tis well enough to send their Children to a <hi>publick School:</hi> Those that are not able to give them a <hi>Domestic,</hi> or more private <hi>Education,</hi> I censure not; but such persons as have good <hi>Estates,</hi> and some of <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Worth,</hi> who perhaps have taken great pains to form their <hi>Childrens Mind,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> with <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> till they are come to 7 or 8 years of Age, and then for the sake of a little <hi>Latin</hi> run so great an hazard to have the beautiful <hi>Image</hi> spoild, and the whole Work effac'd, some will be apt to Arraign of either <hi>Levity, Incogitancy,</hi> or both.

            <p>But further, Would publick <hi>School-masters</hi> (as 'tis next to an Impossibility they should) take care of their <hi>Morals,</hi> and be never so sollicitous of <hi>Cultivating</hi> their early Years with <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> yet at Noon or Night, when dismiss'd from <hi>School,</hi> they would be apt to saunter about, and loyter in the Streets, where they wou'd see various Objects to divert their thoughts, hear se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Common,</hi> if not impious Sayings, of <hi>Porters, Car men,</hi> and <hi>Kitchen-Wenches,</hi> which much abhor from that <hi>Phrase</hi> and <hi>Diction</hi> they ought always to be Accustom<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am sorry I shou'd have <hi>Occasion</hi> to subjoin my next <hi>Reason:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of good <hi>Estates,</hi> and I fear some of <hi>Quality,</hi> do give their <note place="margin">Reason <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> Children a very mean and ordinary <hi>Education,</hi> because they are loth to be at any extraordinary Charge about it: Of this, <hi>Plutarch</hi> vehemently complains, in his Time, in these words; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Many People are grown so Covetous, and (<hi>I will not translate</hi> my Authors <hi>word</hi>) so slighting of their Children, that for fear
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50980:6"/>
               <hi>of paying a greater price for their Tuition, they chuse Men of</hi> no <hi>Account for their Childrens Tutors, purchasing for them a cheap Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tells us a biting reply of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who being ask'd by one of these Fathers what he would ask for his Sons <hi>Education,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said he. <hi>O Hercules!</hi> cry'd the other in a great Astonishment, <hi>Why, I can buy a good Slave for that Money: Why, and so you may,</hi> reply'd the Philosopher, <hi>then you will have two</hi> Slaves, <hi>the</hi> Slave <hi>you have</hi> bought, <hi>and the</hi> Slave <hi>you have</hi> begot.</p>
            <p>But to set aside all <hi>Arguments</hi> drawn from the <hi>Usefulness, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> since these are no <hi>Topicks</hi> to insist on with such a <hi>Reader,</hi> we will endeavour to convince him that the laying out his <hi>Money</hi> in his Sons <hi>Education,</hi> is not <hi>incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> with his own <hi>Maxims.</hi> If he had a piece of <hi>Land</hi> that were very barren and stony, but with a little <hi>Agriculture</hi> wou'd be as good as any of his <hi>Neighbours,</hi> wou'd he spare his Money here, where there was a prospect of a considerable Advantage? Wou'd he not rather order his <hi>Bailiff</hi> forthwith to <hi>Manure</hi> and <hi>Cultivate</hi> it? And is the <hi>Cultivating</hi> of his Son, a matter of lesser moment, from whence probably, in the very Letter, more profit may come into his <hi>Pocket</hi> than from his <hi>Field?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or when he has a considerable stock of Money by him, is he not apt to be uneasie, till he has put it out to <hi>Interest,</hi> hearken'd out a <hi>Mortgage,</hi> or wisely transmuted it into good <hi>Terra firma;</hi> because, says he, let <hi>Fires, losses at Sea, change of Government,</hi> any, or all of these happen, this will stay upon the spot, I shall still have this to leave my Son, Yet tho' the Land, as he saith, will still abide on the spot, he knows how moveable a skin or two of Parchment is. One would think now, if he could light of a Purchase more secure, and more advantageous too, for his Son, he should not grudge to lay out his Money upon it. If he ask me what that is, I answer: <hi>A Vertuous and Learned Education;</hi> and that too, (if he be as careful as he generally is) he may have a very good Penny-worth. Only let him remember, <hi>The best is the best Cheap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fondness</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> of some <hi>Parents,</hi> who can scarce <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4.</note> endure their Children out of their sight; For (say they) we are not sure they will be so indulg'd, and treated with that <hi>care</hi> and <hi>tenderness,</hi> they are at home. And what then? Suppose they should not, where would be the harm of it? Perhaps, nay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, the inuring them to a little more hardship, may in a great measure contribute to their <hi>health,</hi> by <hi>confirming,</hi> and <hi>fortifying their Constitution.</hi> This the <hi>Lacedaemonians, Romans,</hi> and other Wise, and Warlike <hi>Nations,</hi> knew; and therefore were far enough from bringing up their <hi>Children</hi> with that <hi>softness,</hi> and <hi>niceness,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50980:6"/>
as our Cocker'd Citizens are. And certainly, whether we respect their Bodies or Minds, this nice and over-tender treatment of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, must be very pernicious to them; it makes their <hi>Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> weak and infirm, subject to catch cold with every little breath of <hi>Air,</hi> and their health often various, and uncertain all their life long. Then as to their Minds, they must not be cross'd, nor contradicted, they must have their humour in every thing. What a piece of barbarous Cruelty is it in <hi>Parents</hi> to suffer those <hi>Passions</hi> to get strength in the pretty Creatures, the <hi>breaking</hi> of which will cost them so dear, and dearer if never <hi>broken!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, a <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>sober Tutor</hi> may manage a <hi>Child</hi> to his Advantage both ways much better, who 'tis probable will never suffer those <hi>Irregularities</hi> in his <hi>Meat, Play,</hi> or <hi>Sleep,</hi> which the ill-tim'd and pernicious <hi>Indulgence</hi> of many <hi>Parents</hi> often winks at, and oftner sees not; And too great, or too little a weight, too quick, or too slow a <hi>Motion,</hi> often put this delicate <hi>Movement</hi> out of order. He will sooner see the first rising of any <hi>Disorder</hi> or <hi>Tempest</hi> in the <hi>Passions,</hi> even (like the Prophets Servant) when no bigger than a Man's hand, and so may dissipate, and scatter them with more case, that so they may not <hi>over-cloud</hi> the <hi>Sky</hi> of their <hi>dawning Reason,</hi> before the bright <hi>Sun</hi> of their <hi>Vertue</hi> can well be perceiv'd to be risen in their <hi>Horizon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Charge I have against <hi>Parents,</hi> is their frequent <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5.</note> their Sons from one School to another, upon the slightest Reasons, and sometimes none at all; then which, nothing is more apt to rebate the Masters diligence, who cannot tell but another may reap the fruit, and have the credit of his care and pains, and the Child, by this means, is most certainly balk'd, for being put into one Method by his first Master, into another by the second, and perhaps into the first again by the third, or it may be into a new one, he loseth some years, and is not at last so good a <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> as if he had been intrusted, or continued with any of the three. They ought to be very great and cogent Reasons, which oblige a Parent to remove his Child, if he has been a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time under a Master, especially when the Pupil respects him, and makes, tho' but a flow, Proficiency under him. Parents ought to say so to their Sons as <hi>Tully</hi> does to his:</p>

            <p>Some persons neglect to enquire into their <hi>Childrens Proficiency,</hi>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6.</note> even sometimes, tho' very <hi>learned</hi> themselves, perhaps, thinking it too mean a thing, or not their <hi>Province,</hi> to concern themselves in examining School-Boys Exercise; but <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> thought not so, who, tho' he kept a <hi>Tutor</hi> at home for his <hi>Sons,</hi> would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50980:7"/>
himself, even in the <hi>Tutors</hi> presence, give them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precepts of <hi>Virtue,</hi> but <hi>Grammar</hi> too, exciting at once both the diligence of <hi>Tutor</hi> and <hi>Pupil.</hi> But the <hi>Great Augustus,</hi> tho' labouring under the weight of <hi>Years</hi> and <hi>Empire, thought not so,</hi> who constantly taught his two Grandsons, <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Caius.</hi> But <hi>Tully thought not so,</hi> who, tho' of <hi>Consular Dignity,</hi> and a great <hi>States-man,</hi> supporting, as it were, with his own Shoulders, a tottering <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> made Account he had not yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his duty to his Son, by sending him to <hi>Athens,</hi> the most learned <hi>City</hi> and <hi>University</hi> of the World, to be instructed by <hi>Cratippus,</hi> one of the greatest Philosophers of the Age, unless himself also wrote him a <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Ethics,</hi> by which to <hi>form</hi> and <hi>regulate</hi> his Manners. These <hi>Examples</hi> I do not produce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would persuade <hi>learned Parents</hi> to toil and labour at the <hi>Oar,</hi> like these great Personages, (tho' perhaps, if they shou'd, their <hi>Fere</hi> wou'd often make them amends) but that they wou'd think it not so mean an Employ, now and then at leisure hours, to inquire into their Sons proficiency, that if either <hi>Tutor</hi> or <hi>Pupil</hi> be <hi>remiss,</hi> they may <hi>admonish</hi> him, or <hi>diligent, incourage</hi> him.</p>
            <p>These are the Reasons of the great <hi>Obstacles</hi> and <hi>Remoras</hi> in Childrens <hi>Education,</hi> occasioned by the <hi>Parents,</hi> some being tardy in one particular, and some in another. Now come we to those, which on the <hi>Masters</hi> part lie against their improvement in learning <hi>Languages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Masters</hi> have a <hi>standing Method,</hi> not only in teaching <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1.</note> their <hi>Pupils</hi> a <hi>Language,</hi> but also in the <hi>Motives,</hi> by which they propose to raise and fix their <hi>Attention.</hi> This may proceed from a want of <hi>Reflection,</hi> that Chiidrens <hi>Passions,</hi> as well as of elder People, are excited by different <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Motives.</hi> Now whilst a Master continues ignorant of the <hi>particular Motives</hi> by which he must raise <hi>Attention</hi> in every particular <hi>Scholar,</hi> he must needs be often at a loss, let his <hi>general Method</hi> be never so good, and let him take never so much pains. He had as good talk to the Wind, and Plough the Shoar; <hi>the one</hi> would as soon learn, and the other be cultivated, as several of his Pupils.

            <p>Not that I go about to depreciate <hi>Lilly's Grammar,</hi> especially with the <hi>Oxford Notes;</hi> no, perhaps it is the best that ever was writ, but several <hi>Rules,</hi> and many more <hi>Exceptions,</hi> seem rather to be <hi>calculated</hi> for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of riper <hi>Iudgments,</hi> than to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of <hi>Childrens Capacities.</hi> Nor did the Learned <hi>Compilers</hi> ever design a fourth part of them to be learn'd without book by <hi>Children;</hi> they only propose a Boy should learn his <hi>Declensions</hi> and <hi>Conjugations</hi> very well, which when he understands, <hi>not by rote,</hi> but reason (as they phrase it), and is more cunning <hi>in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>

               <hi>diligent Man, if the Scholar have a mean Capacity:</hi> then they Advise to let him pass to the <hi>Concords,</hi> to <hi>know the agreement of Parts among themselves, thence to the</hi> Syntax, but not to learn the <hi>Rules</hi> as <hi>they follow in Order, but as occasion shall offer it self Reading and Persing some Author, wherein not only the</hi> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>of the</hi> Tongue, <hi>but some plain Lesson of Honesty and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is contain'd.</hi> And after some time <hi>of turning</hi> English <hi>into</hi> Latin, and <hi>Vice versa</hi> a little below, they add, <hi>If to this were adjoyn'd some use of speaking, (which must also necessarily be had) he shall be brought past the wearisome bitterness of his Learning.</hi> This method seems to me so rational, that I am almost tempted to believe some <hi>School-masters</hi> have never read the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Grammar</hi> they daily teach, or if all have, I wonder (tho' some Learned and Ingenious Men may) others should have reason to think they have found out a better way of teaching their <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> than the <hi>Compilers</hi> themselves had. In my Iudgment, those <hi>Masters</hi> who take a different <hi>method</hi> to their Prescriptions, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as before Excepted) walk a tedious round; but especially such as teach all the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Exceptions</hi> as they follow one another, before their <hi>Pupil</hi> reads an Author. For if <hi>Children</hi> should by the <hi>Masters</hi> diligence, and continual beating their brains about the sence of this, or that particular <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> be brought to some little Notions about them, 'tis ten to one, but being forc'd to summon all their thoughts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the next, the <hi>Ideas</hi> they had conceiv'd about the former are quite <hi>obliterated;</hi> by this means it often comes to pass that one poor <hi>Exception,</hi> which perhaps might not occur above once in an <hi>Author,</hi> at last is understood at the loss of two or three <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules,</hi> and some <hi>Leather</hi> in at the bargain. Sure I am, that the learning this line,
<q>
                  <l>Tartara Taygetus sic Taenara Massica, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
stood me in the latter, if not in the former, which had I never learn'd, had not been a pin of matter, since no Word is of one Gender in the Singular, and another in the Plural Number.</p>
            <p>Nor would I, by what I have said of <hi>Lilly's Grammar,</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as if I thought that a perfect <hi>model.</hi> It's greatest Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers have confess'd, there are many <hi>Deficiencies</hi> to be <hi>supply'd,</hi> but more <hi>Redundancies</hi> to be <hi>retrench'd;</hi> and the modest <hi>Compilers</hi> themselves thus preface it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore it is not amiss, if one seeing by Tryat, an</hi> Easier <hi>and</hi> Readier way <hi>than the common sort of</hi> Teachers <hi>do, would say what he hath prov'd, and for the</hi> Commodity allow'd, <hi>that others not knowing the same</hi> might by Experience <hi>prove the like, and then</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50980:8"/>
               <hi>by proof</hi> reasonably Iudge <hi>the like, not hereby excluding the</hi> better way <hi>when it is sound out, but in the mean while forbidding the</hi> worse.</p>
            <p>This I believe I may venture to say, It may be easie for any <hi>Master,</hi> on half a Sheet of Paper, to extract out of this <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> what is sufficient for any Lad to know before he reads an <hi>Author.</hi> But I proceed:</p>
            <p>The <hi>harshness</hi> and <hi>severity</hi> of others, is a great obstacle to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4.</note> Childrens <hi>Improvement.</hi> Were they to perform their hard <hi>task,</hi> and carry <hi>burdens</hi> like <hi>Slaves,</hi> and not for every little <hi>Omission,</hi> or <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> to be thump'd like them, I shou'd think their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion something different. Nay, I fear they are beat sometimes for not performing <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> for not making <hi>Brick</hi> without <hi>Straw;</hi> I mean, for not finding <hi>Matter</hi> as well as <hi>Words.</hi> And is not this an <hi>AEgyptian Slavery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whom a body would scarce take for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> unless by their <hi>Fasoes,</hi> pretend a liberty to scourge them, in order to their <hi>Manumission,</hi> I should be rather content my Son should be no <hi>Denizen</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than pay so dear for his <hi>freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, when <hi>ill Principles,</hi> long indulg'd, are grown to <hi>ill Habits,</hi> and a Master has in vain, a long time, attempted to <hi>Weed</hi> them out gently with his hand, there may be occasion for a <hi>Spade</hi> or a <hi>Mattock,</hi> to dig them up at once, but that being once done, I can see no occasion afterwards, in any case whatsoever. When Boys, as <hi>Quintilian</hi> has observ'd, <hi>Facile sanabilibus labor ant malis,</hi> why should we always have recourse to the extreamest remedy? <hi>Correction,</hi> like <hi>Physick,</hi> where it has no <hi>operation,</hi> commonly doth harm, and the often <hi>repetition</hi> of it either spoils the Part, or at best fortifies it against it. Few, I believe, have been whipp'd into <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> but many, to my knowledge, have been whipp'd from them; and then it is the worse for them that ever they were sent to <hi>School,</hi> for either the <hi>severity</hi> of their <hi>Treatment</hi> makes them have an utter <hi>aversion</hi> for their Book as long as they live, or if they retain a <hi>love</hi> for it still, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>lard</hi> their discourses in <hi>common Conversation</hi> with such <hi>scraps,</hi> and serve it in with such <hi>bombast,</hi> that I must needs think he has a strong stomach that does not <hi>nauseate</hi> it. I declare it, when I hear this horrid <hi>Iargon,</hi> I know not which is greater, my pity or indignation. Certainly, nothing is more unbecoming a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> nothing more silly and ridiculous, than this <hi>Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick humour.</hi> If the Company be learn'd, nothing can grate their Ears more harshly; if unlearned, 'tis an <hi>unmannerly Abuse.</hi> This
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50980:9"/>
I take to be a <hi>worse plague</hi> than the former, and both of them are generally the effects of a <hi>Rod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis strange to me that <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Qvality,</hi> nice enough of their Honour in other points, should suffer their Children to be whipp'd and abus'd by every <hi>little fellow,</hi> whose understanding a little <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> is the only Title he has to the <hi>Birchen Scepter,</hi> wherewith he Tyrannizes like the Abdicated <hi>Dionysius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curtius</hi> tells us, That the Power of <hi>scourging</hi> the Children of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Curtius,</hi> lib. 8.</note> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Nobility resided only in their Kings, and a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even by their Command was look'd upon to be so disgraceful, that <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> for executing it, had almost paid his Life for satisfaction to the disgrac'd <hi>Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' our <hi>Noblemen</hi> sometimes may indulge them this Power, I wonder our <hi>Strabo's</hi> should so willingly forfeit the favour and respect of their <hi>Pupils</hi> in time to come.</p>
            <p>The reason of our <hi>Obligation</hi> to our <hi>Physicians,</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> is not (as <hi>Seneca</hi> reasons very well) because we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Health</hi> of the one, and <hi>Erudition</hi> of the other, tho' both <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> de be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiis, <hi>cap. 5.</hi>
               </note> things unvaluable, because both of them set a value upon them, and that value we paid. <hi>Quid ergo? Quare Medico &amp; praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori plus quiddam debeo, nec adversus eos mercede defungor? Quod ex Medico &amp; praeceptore in amicos transeunt, &amp; nos non arte quam vendunt obligant, sed benignâ &amp; familiari tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione. What then? What is the reason I am still oblig'd, and not out of my Physicians and School-masters debt? Because of a Physician and School-master they become friends, and do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us by the Art, which they sell, but by their kind and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging devoirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Some both <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private School-masters,</hi> being <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5.</note> more devoted to their own <hi>Interest,</hi> than to the <hi>good</hi> of their Pupils, undertake more than they have time to manage; so by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in more <hi>Pupils</hi> they send out fewer <hi>Scholars.</hi> But this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is equally the fault of the <hi>Parent,</hi> who sending his Son to a Master, whose Time and Labour being to be divided amongst so many, can hope for little of either to fall to his Sons share.</p>
            <p>Having thus gone thro' my <hi>Reasons</hi> of, and <hi>Animadversions</hi> upon the <hi>Obstructions</hi> in <hi>Childrens Institution,</hi> let me beg of <hi>Parents</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of those failings for the future, wherewith I have charg'd 'em, by taking an especial care of the first 6 or 7 years the <hi>little Ones</hi> are under their Wing, and I hope I shall propose the best <hi>Method</hi> to manage them afterwards; for I don't doubt, if Vertuous and Ingenious Men be encourag'd, they can ever want fit <hi>Tutors,</hi> either in the following manner of teaching 10 or 12 together, or,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50980:9"/>
(which is next best) in their own <hi>Families.</hi> Let them but take care of the main matters in their <hi>Infancy,</hi> and they need not fear but <hi>Languages</hi> will be had afterwards easie and cheap enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Childrens</hi> Minds are soft and moist <hi>Clay,</hi> such as may be easily thrown on the <hi>Wheel</hi> even how you please, but <hi>Age</hi> hardens it, and <hi>Custom</hi> confirms it, and then your <hi>Vessel,</hi> whether <hi>honourable</hi> or <hi>dishonourable,</hi> cannot be alter'd; therefore be sure to <hi>fashion</hi> it right, and <hi>season</hi> it well. I admire to see several <hi>Parents</hi> treat their Children like <hi>Bruits,</hi> till 6 or 7 years of Age, which is the ready way to keep them so much longer. Next to the Care of forming their Minds, succeeds that of <hi>teaching them to read;</hi> and, methinks, this might be done without sending them out of doors, as is usual to a <hi>Mistress,</hi> where, besides the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences I have before recounted, among Children of worse <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> they often learn <hi>ill Words,</hi> and <hi>ill Things.</hi> Since <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens</hi> Minds are pure <hi>Virgin Parchment,</hi> is it not a thousand pities to suffer it to be scrall'd over with foolish and senceless <hi>Characters,</hi> much more to be <hi>blotted</hi> and <hi>blurr'd</hi> with <hi>Anger, Envy, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Sullenness,</hi> when it may so easily be prevented?</p>
            <p>When they read <hi>English</hi> very well, 'tis time to dispose of them to a <hi>Master,</hi> not only to teach them <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> as is usual, but enjoyn him to <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>polish</hi> that Work which you have begun with so much success, to take care they be instructed in <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> in <hi>Arts, Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Languages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some will be apt to think, the perfecting of all this will be <note place="margin">Obj.</note> a Matter of great difficulty, and many Years; and that the learning of <hi>Latin</hi> alone taking up so much time, when will the rest be perfected, which are usually the <hi>Studies</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> not <hi>Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer: I do not mean they should be <hi>separate,</hi> and <hi>succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>

               <p>Hence they may not only be told the Names which not often occur in their <hi>Authors,</hi> or if they did, the Name only being known, and not the Idea, would easily ship out of their Memory, and whilst it was there, was of no use.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Natures</hi> also will be of great Advantage to them hereafter. To which I may add. That from their very <hi>Names</hi> they may learn a good part of the Heathen <hi>Mythology,</hi> as of <hi>Daphne, Narcissus, Hyacinthus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Their <hi>Play hours,</hi> I mean, <hi>their Absence from their Books,</hi> (for their whole <hi>Institution</hi> ought to have no other Name) ought to be made as <hi>beneficial</hi> as any other. Hear what the Pious and Learned Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> saith on this head: <hi>Methinks it might very well be contriv'd, that their Recreations might sometimes consist of such ingenious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, that they might at once both play and learn.</hi>

                  </note> answer: Their Master, who is always to be present as before, shall (after three Months spent in learning so much <hi>Grammar</hi> as may be necessary for them) never speak any other Language to them, nor suffer any other to be spoke before them. The Mistress of the House, in some measure, should understand and speak Latin, at least such forms as will suit her Occasions, which are about <hi>Dressing</hi> and <hi>Undressing,</hi> and serving them with <hi>Meat;</hi> and no Servant, at any time, be suffer'd to speak to any of them but before the Master, and that in a <hi>prescrib'd form.</hi>

I am apt to believe, few of these could have been perswaded to declain <hi>ad aram Lugdunensem,</hi> tho' great Orators themselves, and great Rewards promis'd to such as came off with Applause. And why? Because the Punishment inflicted in case of failure, being so great, might have possibly so busied, and taken up their thoughts, as to have spoil'd the <hi>eloquent Harangue.</hi> But a Boy has rarely any Reward in a School; nay, scarce extorts an <hi>Euge</hi> from his <hi>Task-master</hi> if he doth well, and is certainly <hi>whipp'd</hi> if he doth not: Can he blame him then if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his hand from the <hi>Ferula,</hi> when himself, in such a case, would do the same?

               <p>But the giving them frequent Rewards tends to make them <note place="margin">Obj.</note> vain, proud, or covetous.</p>
               <p>Some, perhaps, it may, but that the Masters prudence ought <note place="margin">Answ.</note> to prevent, and he may do it several ways; I will instance in one.</p>
               <p>It may be propos'd, when their <hi>Praemiums</hi> amount to such a Sum to buy this or that pleasant Book, near and delicately bound; this or that fine Map or Picture; and when one has made up the Money, and bought the Book, an emulation will be excited in all the rest till another has got it. After which, every one will strive the more to ingratiate himself into the Masters affection, the more have been serv'd before him, when he perceives his Praemiums are purely the Reward of Merit. Only the Master ought to take care, that two or three of the last have their Monies made up at the same time, least any should be discouraged.</p>

And as the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> has observ'd, is neither so <hi>tedious</hi> to Master nor Scholar.

               <p>Nor ought the <hi>Tutors,</hi> through <hi>Covetousness,</hi> to think it <hi>too few.</hi> For having so small a <hi>Complement,</hi> they need take none in but Children very well <hi>descended,</hi> and such as have had a <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>sober Education.</hi> And these Proposals being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, they will deserve the <hi>respect</hi> of Persons of <hi>Quality,</hi> whose <hi>Interest</hi> may stand them in good stead.

               <p>But what need these <hi>Collections,</hi> when daily Experience tells<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, That Children, after having learn'd <hi>English,</hi> are in a Years<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ordinarily taught <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> and that with <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> both to themselves and Master?

               <p>If Authorities were wanting, where Reason and Experience speak so loud, 'twere easie to accumulate them.

                  <q>His Teachers never could bring him to learn the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rules of Grammar, but [he] chose rather to converse with the Books themselves, from whence the others were taken.

                  </q> And this very Consideration was the occasion of my</p>

               <p>And here I cannot but observe the <hi>Cause</hi> our Learned <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whom all <hi>Foreigners</hi> own to write <hi>Latin</hi> very <hi>politely,</hi> attempting to speak it, do it so awkwardly, and (as it were) <hi>unnaturally;</hi> because they have not learn'd it in this <hi>natural</hi> way: They must needs speak it slowly, who having been taught by multiplicity of <hi>Rules,</hi> their Mind is imploy'd in three different things at the same time: 1. Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Rules</hi> by which they learn'd it. 2. Thinking of the <hi>English</hi> sense which they carry along with them. And 3.

               </p>
               <p>The reason of this is, because Children finding no restraint <note place="margin">

               <p>When their Desire is sufficiently heightned, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend notwithstanding 'tis so great a <hi>Privilege,</hi> yet you love such an one (your favourite) so dearly for his diligence, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that you could almost find in your heart to give him a little <hi>insight</hi> into it; then proceed as tho' you were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the rest should be admitted to this <hi>favour,</hi> and such a proceeding, I question not, will oblige some of the rest quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by their <hi>Attention</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> in their own <hi>Studies,</hi> (when they find those are the only ways to recommend 'em) labour to ingratiate themselves into your favour, to enjoy the

Privilege of your <hi>favourite.</hi> So by degrees you may wind up their <hi>inclinations</hi> to what heighths you please, and bring them all by degrees, with <hi>submission</hi> and <hi>thankfulness,</hi> to accept the favour.</p>
               <p>Thus I have, as short as I cou'd, given the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Proposals,</hi> and Answer'd such Objections as I cou'd think of, or have been made to me by Parents, when I have desird them to tell me their Opinion of Mr. <hi>Lock's Method in learning Latin,</hi> which (because upon the Reasonableness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 196. <hi>Pr.</hi> Ed.</note> these Proposals are grounded) I shall transcribe from the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Ingenious</hi> Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If therefore a Man cou'd be got, who himself speaks good <hi>Latin,</hi> who would be always about your Son, and talk constantly to him, and make him read <hi>Latin,</hi> that wou'd be the <hi>true, genuine,</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> way, of teaching him <hi>Latin;</hi> and that I cou'd wish, since besides teaching him a <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> without <hi>Pains</hi> or <hi>Chiding,</hi> which Children are wont to be whipp'd for at School six or seven years together, he might, at the same time, not only form his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> but instruct him also in several <hi>Sciences,</hi> such as are a good part of <hi>Geography, Astronomy, Chronology, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,</hi> besides some parts of <hi>History,</hi> and all other parts of <hi>knowledge</hi> of things that fall under the <hi>Senses,</hi> and require little more than <hi>Memory.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But hold—I had like to have forgot the <hi>Grand Objection,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obj.</note> not levell'd at any particular part, but at the whole Design. The <hi>Method</hi> is <hi>singular,</hi> I dare not venture upon it for my <hi>Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope 'tis a <hi>singular good one,</hi> and then no Matter. Is it <note place="margin">Answ.</note> reasonable? If so, it ought to be try'd. If this were any <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> there never would have been, nor never would be, any <hi>Improvements</hi> in the <hi>World.

               <p>But if, for all that, any will think <hi>Singularity</hi> an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I will beg of them to accept of it against our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50980:15"/>
Method of <hi>Education in England,</hi> as being different from that of all Learned <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Ages,</hi> that have been before us. I never heard that the <hi>Iews, AEgyptians, Phaenicians, Persians, Graecians, Romans,</hi> ever Study'd <hi>Languages,</hi> or if they did, that they were ever denominated <hi>learned</hi> from thence, much less order'd their Children to spend ten or twelve of their best Years in learning <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sounds,</hi> as tho' they were not only the <hi>Vehicles</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but <hi>Knowledge</hi> it self. No, no, their Masters gave them a quite different <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> they Admonished them to study <hi>themselves,</hi> and the <hi>Universe,</hi> to <hi>Converse</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> to observe the <hi>heavenly Influences;</hi> were continually preaching to them <hi>Iustice, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> in their tender Years, and afterwards, <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomics,</hi> and <hi>Politics,</hi> to know how to <hi>steer</hi> and <hi>guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> first, and then the <hi>Ship</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> if they were to be <hi>Public Men:</hi> They made them acquainted with the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of other <hi>Governments,</hi> not by <hi>reading Books,</hi> but <hi>sending them Abroad,</hi> where their having learn'd Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was reckon'd as one of the least benefits of their Travels. Nay, by many 'twas look'd upon a disadvantage, and such as had them were always cautious of intermixing them with their own. And were not these better <hi>Institutions</hi> of Youth, than purely <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> which our <hi>School-Masters</hi> hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with such earnestness, neglecting the sense?

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50980:18"/>Nay, we are not only singular in our Manner of <hi>Education</hi> to former Ages, but this too, in those <hi>Countries</hi> which are more concern'd to admire <hi>Latin</hi> than we, because the <hi>Service</hi> of their Church is in that Tongue: For they take greater care about their Childrens <hi>Morals,</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> than Latin, but we postpone these Matters of infinitely more Concernment, or if we have taken any care in them, are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to run the risque; Latin they must have, tho' at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Innocence,</hi> and six or seven Years of their best time, to be Instructed in useful knowledge to boot. And does not this look like the Proverbial purchase, <hi>Pro thesauro Carbones?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do they learn it as we do, confounding themselves with unncessary <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Exceptions</hi> of <hi>Grammar;</hi> but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Conversation,</hi> and the Authors from whence they were taken, and by this Method can often <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>write</hi> it tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well in a Year, and, perhaps, have at the same time profited in some <hi>useful Knowledge.</hi> And admit they do not understand it so well, as who have spent seven or eight Years about it, yet well enough for their Occasions, to read an Author, and converse with Strangers, (which last we sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, after all, can do); and how Gentlemen, Tradesmen, and all Persons, who do not design their Children for Scholars, shou'd think so many Years in learning a Language (tho they were sure they would be Critics in it) which, after all, would be but of very little use, well spent, I cannot easily imagine, when to understand it, as abovesaid, may do as well to all intents and purposes; nay, better for Conversation, and may be attain'd so easily. Here 'tis proposd, because unexperienc'd in this way to take <hi>two years</hi> to do that, which the <hi>Scots, French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> often do in one; and yet to save a Child four or five years, which wou'd have been spent at School in learning Latin, which may be Imploy'd to a far greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in writing a <hi>good Hand,</hi> reading the best <hi>English Writers,</hi> polishing and perfecting his <hi>English Style,</hi> learning <hi>Merchants Accounts,</hi> studying the <hi>Mathematics,</hi> improving those <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> which he had so good a taste of in reading <hi>Latin,</hi> learning the Art of a decent <hi>Carriage</hi> and <hi>Comportment</hi> with a Dancing-Master, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with Gentlemen of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> in the World, whose <hi>Conversation</hi> will be much more Advantageous to him, than of any Scholar: And are not all these <hi>Accomplishments</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50980:18"/>
preferrable to the being a <hi>Critic</hi> in a Tongue, which exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in Books, can never perfectly be understood? Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness several things in <hi>Cato</hi> of Husbandry, <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Plautus,</hi> which are not understood; upon which, notwithstanding, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will <hi>Comment</hi> and <hi>Criticize in Infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But such as their Parents design for <hi>Scholars,</hi> in this Method, after one year, their Master may put upon reading <hi>Sanctius's Minerva,</hi> with <hi>Scioppius's</hi> Notes, and other Pieces of <hi>Criticism</hi> upon <hi>Grammar;</hi> or which, I take to be much better, to teach them from their Observations upon <hi>Authors,</hi> to make a <hi>Critical Grammar</hi> themselves, and when they have done it, they will not need so many Rules of Grammar before they read a <hi>Greek Author,</hi> as they had occasion for, before they learn'd a Latin one; and so the Tutor may proceed much after the same way as before, reading Lectures upon <hi>Authors,</hi> and still improving the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of Useful Knowledge.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Method</hi> I think best, in the Treatment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Children, which I hope, by the blessing of <hi>God,</hi> and careful Endeavours of <hi>Able</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> Men, may be of use to the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
