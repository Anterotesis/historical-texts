            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TOo many of the contentions of this
age do tell the world how much
the several parties differ in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Malignity, Humility and Pride,
Love and Malice, Meekness and Cruelty;
But I think verily the controversie here man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
between this brother and me, doth but
tell you how weak and fumbling a thing
mans understanding is here in the flesh, and
what great diversity of apprehensions all men
have in many things, who agree in the main;
and how diversity of Lights or appearances,
<pb facs="tcp:60850:3"/>
may cause great and confident contrariety of
judgments, yea, and changes in the same
person. The difference between <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul. Gal.</hi> 2.
tell us how far the best of mortals are from
perfection. Our difference I think is not
caused by contrariety of worldly Interests,
(which yet divided even <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family
and <hi>Lot</hi>'s, and much worse, <hi>Joseph</hi>'s bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
from him) For as neither of us have
any great matters of worldly wealth, but
our daily bread (which is enough,) so I am
perswaded that he seeketh no such thing, and
I am sure I cannot if I would, who daily
expect to give up my account, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me a thorn in the flesh, enough to cure
at least the expectation of fleshly and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasure and prosperity.</p>
            <p>Read not therefore these books, as the
conflict of enemies, but as the consultation
of unfeigned loving friends who fain would
understand the truth: You see he abhorreth
the silencing or persecuting the ministers of
<pb facs="tcp:60850:3"/>
               <hi>England</hi> for Nonconformity: Yea, and
all disaffection on such accounts.</p>
            <p>And though I shew the great mistakes in
his writing, impute them not to the habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
weakness of his judgment; But 1 to the
badness of his cause. 2 To the newness and
crudity of his thoughts about it: For
though he hath been long a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Minister, yet it is but lately that
he hath received the satisfaction which he
here expressed, being before purposed no
more to <hi>declare</hi> or <hi>subscribe</hi> what he here
defendeth: And new thoughts are seldom
well digested.</p>
            <p>I speak this the rather because some say that
<hi>he is an honest weak man, that hath
shewed his good will to defend their
cause, but was not able to do it as it
will shortly be done by some greater
men that are about it.</hi> But my opinion
is that his concessions and coming so near
the truth doth give him so much advantage
against us, that the ablest of them that
<pb facs="tcp:60850:4"/>
stand at a greater distance, are like the
more to marr their matter, and assault us
with less success than he.</p>
            <p>And I advise his Reader to pardon such
slips in the book which I confute, as concern
not much the cause in hand, but are only
the oversights of the well meaning Author.
As when <hi>pag.</hi> 8. he distributeth the
<hi>Learned Ministry into several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;</hi>
of which one is <hi>such as have no
Learning,</hi> and another such as <hi>have a
little,</hi> &amp;c. It's easie to know that this
was a meer oversight. And in his supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>pag.</hi> 145. when he saith <hi>[<q>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
doth assent and consent to the
use of all the lyes and wickednesses
of men and devils.</q>]</hi> It's like the
Reader will think that he meaneth by the
<hi>use,</hi> that <hi>[men and devils use to lye
and do wickedness,]</hi> or act these sins:
If so, it were odious blasphemy indeed:
But by conference I have cause to believe
that the Author's judgment is sound in those
<pb facs="tcp:60850:4"/>
points; and therefore that it is but an heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
speech, and that he meaneth no more
but that <hi>[God consenteth when lyes
and wickednesses are committed that
men make good use of them in esse
cognito,]</hi> as to repent of them or hate them
or take warning to avoid the like; and that
God himself will use them as <hi>occasions</hi> of
some accidental good; as sickness is used to
honour the skill of the Physician: And
that the word <hi>Assent</hi> slipt in because his
cause was in his thoughts. If you say,
<hi>This is a ridiculous equivocation:
To make such use of the Liturgie in
esse cognito</hi> as to hate it, or <hi>perswade</hi>
from <hi>it, no enemy will deny;</hi> but
what is that to <hi>using</hi> it? To use the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
is to read and practise it, and so to
use lying and wickedness is to lye and do
wickedly: that which you call sin <hi>object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
in esse cognito</hi> is not sin indeed, but
the idea of it: but it is the real Liturgie
which we must make a Covenant to use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60850:5"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> And who can manage an ill cause
without somewhat that is too like it? And
who doth any thing which needeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
or amendment? And who is so wise
as to speak wisely at all times? Let us
pity one another, and pray for a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mind, and long for the world of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in perfection. O how much harder is
it to justifie proud Schismatical silenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and persecutors of the just, than
to excuse the failings of the weak! and with
how great a difference shall they be shortly
judged, as sure as there is a day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be expected! Yea, how much easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
will it be for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi>
for <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Americans</hi> at that day,
than for those that malignantly oppressed men
of most serious piety, and fought against
Christ as by his own pretended authority,
and in his name.</p>

DEFENCE

NON-CONFORMIST'S
Plea for Peace,

M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> J. CHENY,
THE
Non-conforming Conformist.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>§ 1. DEar Brother, I have diligently read
and considered your Book, and
think it my duty to give a short
Account of the Effect.</p>
               <p>I have reproved many that blame you for not
telling me first of it, and knowing what I could
say to it, before you ventured to publish it; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60850:9"/>
of our true Love and Acquaintance: 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a man should be willing to try and hear the
utmost, before he engage too deep: 3. Because if
you mistake, it is many and heinous sins that you
may be guilty of, by hardening multitudes in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency.
To which I answer then, 1. I consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not you before I wrote, and why then must
you needs consult me. 2. A wise man can conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
what may be said against him, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
3. You might suspect some hinderance to that
which you judged a necessary duty. 4. You have
heard and read what the Non-Conformists say,
as I did what the Conformists say, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consultation.</p>
               <p>But I am most impatient with them that suspect
your intention and design, and do hereby profess
to them that know you not so well as I do, that I
do from my heart believe you to be a better
man than my self, of good judgment in other things,
of greater meekness, patience, humility and self-denyal;
and do verily believe that your End was
to promote Christian Love and Concord (which
was mine.) And as I wrote to cure mens uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
thoughts of the Non-Conformists; so did
you, to cure or prevent mens thinking worse of
the Conformists than they do deserve; an End
that's good and necessary.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But our measures of understanding are so
various, that it is no wonder that we differ about
the means: And therefore lest I should be guilty,
1. Of deserting the Truth, and Cause of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
2. And of the loss of the Plaister which I
made to heal the ulcerated minds of the haters and
reproachers, and silencers of them that deserve it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60850:9"/>
not. 3. And of the sin of such as be drawn by your
Book to that which hath the aggravations which I
named, and fear my self, I shall take the freedom
of telling you and others, my thoughts of your
performance in your Book.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I. I perceive it is not your design to draw
any man into so much Conformity as will procure
him allowance in the Publick approved Ministry:
And then what the better will the Church be for
his change in all the rest, while one point of Non-conformity
will keep him out as well as a hundred?
For 1. You profess that you cannot justifie all,
though you fain would. 2. You over-pass some
in your defence. 3. You call your self a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Conformist. 4. You are fain to fly from
your Country, being an excommunicate man, and
to live in a poor condition among strangers, to
keep out of the Goal, to avoid the Writ <hi>de excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municato
capiendo;</hi> and yet you lived under the
Worthy and Learned Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> accounted
one of the most moderate and best in <hi>England.</hi>
And what good would so much Conformity do
the Church? Can we serve them in a Prison any
better than Non-Conformists may? But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of your Defence it self.</p>
               <p>§ 4. II. You would have your Reader have
my Book before him, and you profess to answer
it; and yet you profess so far to lay it by your
self, as 1. To omit answering a great part of it,
especially which justifieth our Preaching and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
(yea I think you plead for them;) and
my large Answer to the Charge of Schism you
seem to approve, which we accept, and so that is
no part of our Controversie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60850:10"/>
§ 5. 2. But you also avoid the Defence of the
Corporation Declaration, which is a matter of so
great importance to all the Cities and Corporations
of <hi>England,</hi> as perhaps may prove more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than the silencing of a thousand of the best
Preachers among us for Non-conformity. But I
blame you not for not doing more than you are
able.</p>
               <p>§ 6. 3. But why did you avoid the Order of
my Book's Objections? and also the answering of
any chief intimated reasons (while yet I did but
intimate some few disclaiming argumentations?)
why do you tell us, that you take them as you
remember them, without the Book, and satisfie
your own conscience, while you seem to answer
the Book? And what drew you to begin with
Reordination (which none of the Antient Non-Conformists
are put upon?) But your disclaiming
to defend the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Oath, and your profession
that some part of the Subscriptions and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the Law enjoyned to Ministers, you never
made your self, doth bid us to believe you, that it
is to draw men <hi>to think mildly of conscientious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
that you write, if not to judge Conformity
lawful, and a duty in case of silencing, &amp;c.]</hi> And I
doubt not but you will so far prevail.</p>
               <p>But when you tell us of a Noble man impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Treason, that made it his business only to
put by that charge, you may remember that when
the Great and Good Duke of <hi>Sommerset</hi> had so
done, and the shout was made for his being found
<hi>not guilty,</hi> he was yet (though the King's Uncle
and Protector) beheaded as a Felon: Such a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
doth little good. And you say truly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60850:10"/>
[<hi>I am not to yield to the smallest Sin to save my
Life.</hi>]</p>
               <p>§ 7. I see not how this agreeth with what you
say, <hi>
                     <q>After that Mens weakness and ignorance may
make it their duty of two perceived Sins proposed
to them, to take the safer side, and that is to
avoid the greater.</q>] Answ.</hi> Doubtless it is a gross
Contradiction to say, <hi>It is a duty to choose,</hi> or not
avoid the least Sin: For that is no Sin which a
Man is not bound to avoid; and undoubtedly when
two Sins are proposed, every Man is bound to avoid
both, though not as equal with equal Zeal: And
God never necessitateth Man to choose either, or
not to avoid both: But if our own Badness disable
us from avoiding both, we must be most careful to
avoid the greater. I cannot pray without sinful
dulness, or imperfection of Faith: But I must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
avoid a total Omission than imperfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
for all the Faults are eminently in this. No
Sin is to be done on pretence of avoiding a greater
Sin: But sometime the avoiding of a great Sin,
may make another thing <hi>(e.g.</hi> the omission of that
which else would have been a Duty) to be then
no Sin, that else would have been a Sin. Negative
Commands bind <hi>ad semper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 8. <hi>You say,</hi> 
                  <q>If the Non-conformist err, it
is on many accounts a safe Error, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
a refusal to Subscribe and Conform to a
number of things in their own nature indifferent:
Rigid Conformists confess them to be but Trifles
comparatively, the Church might be without them
and yet do well: And Moderate Conformists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
them to be burdensom, and the Church might
be and do better without them, or if they were left
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60850:11"/>
to each Man's choice and will.</q> Answ. <hi>But if we
prove them far from indifferent, Non-conformity
will prove a necessary and great Duty: However,
I doubt the Imposers will give you as little thanks
for this description of the Case, as they do us for
Non-conformity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Specially when you add that
for this,</hi> [<q>We are thought Seditious, Factious,
Schismatical, worthy to be Silenced, Imprisoned,
Anathematized, and used as Intolerable.</q>] <hi>They
will not love the Glass that sheweth them such a
Face as you dislikingly describe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Especially when you tell them that you</hi> [<q>Are
satisfied that it is in it self a great and dreadful Sin,
to Silence the Non-conformists, and do by them as
hath been for these many Years.</q>] <hi>And</hi> [<q>Blame
those loose Conscienced Men, who think that their
Humours, Opinions, Lusts, and proud and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Wills, are fit to be the standard of Unity,
Uniformity, and Edification to all the Churches.</q>]
<hi>This is but cold pleading for Conformity.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOu begin with Reordination. And, <hi>1st.</hi>
I told you how the Church in all Ages
hath commonly abhorred it: The Canons, called
the Apostles, depose both the Ordainer that doth
it, and the Ordained. <hi>Gregory Magnus,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it with twice Baptism (which perhaps you
may think lawful too) you are for it upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>Toties quoties.</hi> You tell us how loth we should
be as to Condemn that which so many worthy
Men held as were the old Conformists: And may not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60850:11"/>
I tell you that you should be more Cautelous how
you contradict all Ages of the Church, even to
this Day.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Had you heard as great a Man as I have
done, declare that he could not take them for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
or take the Sacrament of them that had
not Episcopal Ordination; and had you heard my L.
Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> give such Reasons openly for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
as I did; and had you seen the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of so Learned a Bishop as I have seen, to
prove such no Ministers as are Ordained but by
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and heard such Men, and so many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
for it as I have done, you could not have
thought that the judgment of those that impose
Reordination, was, or is, that Men are true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ that are Ordained by <hi>Presbyters</hi>
only? So that your sense of the Imposition is
feigned.</p>
               <p>§ 3. It is a known thing that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is not of your singular opinion for Reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination:
You may as well feign them to be for
Rebaptizing: They all renounce it with our
Consent: Therefore they that require Men to be
Ordained by Bishops, must needs hold that they
had no true Ordination before; or else they should
be for that which they abhor. So that it's past doubt,
you talk of you know not what, when you make
this to be but the singular Opinion of one Mr.
<hi>Dodwel,</hi> disowned by all; though much in his
Book besides, be by most disowned: And it is not
every later Bishop that made the Law, or altered
the Liturgy,</p>
               <p>§ 4. You say that [<q>
                     <hi>Ordination once validly
done by eminent</hi> Presbyters, <hi>and grave substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60850:12"/>
Ministers, it doth to all intents and purposes
make him a compleat Minister.</hi>
                  </q>] And elsewhere
you maintain the Validity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and say, <hi>
                     <q>That it is a taking God's Name in
vain, when it is done without urgent Reasons.</q>]</hi> I
have moved to you, that the present Imposers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the contrary, (and I think, considering how
much the King and Parliament left to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Convocation) the present Settlement
proveth what was the Convocations judgment, who
are the present Church of <hi>England</hi>'s representative.)
They that are against Reordaining, and yet call
men to be ordained, certainly judge them unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
before: And you are to take your Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and speak the words in the known sense of
the Imposers; or else you equivocate: And what
Reasons have you to deceive them? At least it is
notorious scandal to seem to do it in an ill sense.
And when you pretend that your Ministry else
must be forsaken, we say, No: It is but to save
you from suffering for your Ministration, as long
as you can use it on suffering terms: And you have
not escaped suffering, nor saved your Ministry by
Conforming. If you would rather suffer, than
not Preach to Non-Conformists when you had an
allowed Church of Conformists, should not we
rather suffer than by our Reordination submit to
that which is the Churches or Laws publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
that we were no Ordained Ministers of
Christ before? when after that we have never the
more liberty for our Ministry, unless we conform
to all the rest. I remember three Worthy men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained
one fourteen, and two seventeen years
ago, that had never the more liberty to Preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60850:12"/>
§ 5. You say that <hi>[<q>Ordination by eminent and
Senior Presbyters is Episcopal Ordination, though
not in the vulgar sense. For a Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
in the sense of Scripture are the same.</q>] Ans.</hi>
Remember this when you subscribe to the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Order. And I believe you cannot name
two Bishops in <hi>England</hi> (if one) that had a Vote
in Parliament and Convocation for making the
imposing Laws that were of your mind: Nor
two that will now say, that it is lawful to be twice
ordained Presbyter: And remember 1. That it
is the Act of Uniformity that requireth this last
Ordination. 2. That the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> came into their places since;
and were none of the Legislators.</p>
               <p>§ 6. You say <hi>[<q>If the Presbyters excel those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Ordination by them is more excellent than
by these.</q>] Ans.</hi> And yet can you assert that they
are distinct Orders, when the Power of Ordaining
is made the chief part of the Bishops Order? I that
am against you stick at this somewhat more than
you, when the Law and Canon make the Bishop
of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> And as I was ordained by a Bishop;
so I never joyned with Presbyters in ordaining any
man, nor did venture to lay hands on any in
an Ordination.</p>

               <p>§ 1. YOur second Section is of our Assent to the
words in the Book of Ordination of the
Notoreity of the Antiquity of the three distinct
Orders. And 1. You justifie it by telling us that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60850:13"/>
                  <hi>[difference of Holiness, Wisdom, Usefulness may be
said to make different Orders.]</hi> But this is too lusory
in a serious business. Words of Art or Science are
to be understood according to the use of the men
of that <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science:</hi> And the many old School
Disputes, and Controversal Writers tell us long
ago, how they understood the word <hi>[Orders]</hi> as
Offices in <hi>Specie</hi> differing from <hi>Degrees</hi> in the same
<hi>Species.</hi> In your equivocal sense you say true, that
there are more than three Orders, or threescore:
Yea, in the usual sense of old they had seven Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and yet they held Bishops and Presbyters to
be but one of the seven; as I shewed you out of
<hi>Spelman</hi> in <hi>Aelfrick</hi>'s Canons of this Church of
<hi>England,</hi> in the very times of Popery.</p>
               <p>§ 2. You say you make it not an Article of
your Faith, that this sense of Episcopacy is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all men that diligently read Scripture and
Antient Writers.] But the question is, Whether
you <hi>Assent to it,</hi> (or more?) If not, how can you
say you do? The Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> in <hi>Naked
Truth</hi> hath given you some reasons of dissent, and
Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> and many such have done so before
him.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Whether you hit their sense or not, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>§ 1. YOu next choose to speak of our Assent
and Consent to the Bishop's Oath <hi>[to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
himself in obedience to the Arch-Bishop, and to
his Seat or Metropolitan Church, and to his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.]</hi>
And you tell us that all men are bound to
subject themselves one to another: This again is
too gross equivocating. Do you believe that this
is the <hi>Species</hi> of subjection, which is meant in the
Book and Oath?</p>
               <p>§ 2. You better tell us, that being <hi>Episcopus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
sedis, he may be reverenced as the Fore-man of
a Iury.]</hi> But is this <hi>obeying</hi> him, and his Church
and Successors? Is not this also Equivocation? Do
they swear Obedience to the Fore-man and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors?]</p>
               <p>§ 3. Your best answer is, <hi>It is enjoyned by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.]</hi>
And if it were but obeying them in Civils,
or <hi>circa sacra,</hi> in matters determinable by the King;
this answer had much in it: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> when it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in the exercise of the Word, and Keys, and
Matters which Christ hath predetermined, those
Non-Conformists that are not for the Divine Right
of Arch-Bishops, cannot assent and consent to it:
And those of them that are for it, do (with you)
hold that there should be Parochial Bishops, or to
every Church; and that those that you call Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans
are indeed Arch-Bishops: And they are not
for Arch-Bishops over Arch-Bishops, lest it lead
you to a Pope, (as he was in the Empire at least.)</p>
               <p>§ 4. And Successions so often prove unhappy,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60850:14"/>
that we like not setting up one Church over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the end of the world, when we cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it at all. They that are (contrary to the
<hi>Carthage</hi> Fathers) for a Bishop of Bishops, would
yet have him their Ruler but as an Arch-Bishop, as
General Officers in an Army over the Colonels, but
not that our Church shall be set over many others;
much less to swear to unknown Successors.</p>
               <p>§ 5. And I told you divers old Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Bishops swearing inferiours to them, as
the cause of many mischiefs; and sad experience
taught them to make that Canon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>§ 1. NExt you speak of the Oath or Covenant
of Canonical Obedience: And you
1. Doubt whether it be an Oath. In the Act of
Ordination it is but a Covenant: But (what they
do now) I know not; but heretofore it was also
imposed as an Oath. You tell me of my Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
I grant that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o far as they exercise but such
power as belongeth to Officers of the King, we
may obey him in covenanting to obey them. But
it is in the exercise of the Keys proper to Christ's
special Officers, that the Book meaneth, which you
assent to; even in matters of sacred Guidance, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
and Absolution. And you say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to satisfie 1. Those that are under obtruded
and unlawful Bishops, that come in so contrary
to Christ's and the Old Churches Order, as that
the Old Canons decree them to be no Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2. Nor to satisfie those that think Chancellors use
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60850:14"/>
of the Keys to be unlawful. 3. Nor those that
think that <hi>Officials, Surrogates, Commissaries, Arch-Deacons,</hi>
being no Bishops, have no just power but
what the King may give them, and not a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Power of the Keys (see Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it.)</p>
               <p>§ 2. But after you think that none but the Bishop
is the <hi>Ordinary;</hi> but the Church-Laws and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use contradict you, and call all these, when
Judges of the Court, your <hi>Ordinaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. And I told you (which you pass over) that
this is condemned by the Decrees of Antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
as a mischievous thing.</p>
               <p>§ 4. You say, <hi>It binds us not to obey the Canons,
else the Oath of Allegiance would bind us to it, and
all the Statute-Laws.] Answ.</hi> This hath more
seeming strength than the rest. But 1. If it did
hold, it removeth but one branch of the difficulty.
2. And indeed he that sweareth Obedience to the
King, doth swear to obey him according to the
Law: And so he that sweareth Obedience to the
Bishop, may mean more, and include Mandates;
but he cannot reasonably mean less, and exclude
the Governing Laws. But yet as we never meant
that the King's Laws are all blameless, or that we
will obey them if they command us to sin against
God, but only will shew our submission by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
So I confess our Oath to Bishops, as such, can
mean no more. But then, were I under a King,
whose very frame of Laws were unlawful, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to extirpate Piety, I should doubt whether I
might simply swear to obey him as my Governor.
How far the Canons are more unmeet instruments
for true Church-Government than our Laws
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60850:15"/>
are for Civil Government, I will not here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>

               <p>§ 1. YOur fifth Section is about the words <hi>[Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c.] in Ordination.
1. Two things you include in the sense: 1. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Qualifications. 2. Investiture.</hi> But I told you
1. Inward Qualifications are presupposed, and the
person examined accordingly. 2. I never heard or
knew of any that received them by Ordination.
3. By Investiture it is the Ministerial Office that is
given them: To none of this do you answer.</p>
               <p>But you say, Christ used the words, and no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
thing then conferred, <hi>&amp;c.] Ans.</hi> 1. If
Christ intended their after-reception of the Holy
Ghost at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> it followeth not that we must
use such words, that can promise or give no such
spirit. 2. There were five several sorts of Mission
or Commission then given to Christ's Ministers.</p>
               <p>1. Christ sent out the twelve and seventy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarily
to Preach, do Miracles, and return; and
gifted and blessed them accordingly.</p>
               <p>2. He chose twelve as related to the number of
the Tribes, and ordained them stated Apostles to
the Jews, or Circumcision; and he qualified them
accordingly by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>3. He ordained them Apostles to all the world
(indefinitely) and accordingly renewed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
For this he qualified them with ordinary
gifts of his Spirit initially now at his resurrection,
together with their new Commission, and more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60850:15"/>
fully and miraculously at <hi>Pentecost:</hi> You know how
ignorant the Apostles were of Christ's Death, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
Resurrection, Ascension, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen:
And then Christ opened their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in these Articles, and gave more Faith (and
answerably we must conceive other grace was
given) than they had before. This cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed:
And is not this giving of the Holy Ghost
more than man must now pretend to imitate?</p>
               <p>4. Besides these, there were after-missions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Apostles (as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas)</hi> or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
messages in particular Provinces.</p>
               <p>5. And there was the Ordaining of Bishops or
Elders as fixed Guides of particular Churches:
And these being ordinary Officers, were ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be qualified before they were ordained, and
not to receive their Abilities by their Ordination:
And this is the Ordination that we have to do
with.</p>

Consecrated: The words were originally used to
the Church over which the Bishop was placed.

Men in a Church in <hi>London,</hi> or a private Chappel,
to come forth and speak their Exceptions? If you

much to a Manuscript, in which Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> is the

Infants Salvation, being made here
an Article of Faith, I have much more to say
against: But you answer not to any of the strength
of my Objections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60850:16"/>
1. And how strange is it that you saw a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript
of Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s, telling us of <hi>[this Clause
coming surreptitiously into the Book,]</hi> whereas he
was Dead two Years before the Book was altered,
or that Clause put in? Indeed, there was another
in that sounded almost like it, which meant no
more than that <hi>[A Baptized Child hath all that
is necessary to Salvation,]</hi> supposing his right, <hi>(ex
parte Ecclesiae) though he die without Confirmation,
or the Eucharist,</hi> which were formerly given to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants:
But this never said what the new Article saith.</p>
               <p>§ 2. You say, many Conformists say, <hi>It is no
part of Assent and Consent, because it is not used as
part of the Church Service, and they subscribe to no
more.] Answ.</hi> Name not those Conformists, lest
you Dishonour them. Do they declare their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to all things contained in the Book, and mean
only the Service which they must say? Or do they
<hi>[Consent to the use of all,]</hi> and take an Article of
Faith to be put in for no use? Intreat them not
to take the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy,
with that Latitude and Exceptiousness.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>You say, you can Assent to it in a sound
sense: And</hi> [it's more than you can prove that all
Infants are saved, but all that have right before God
are saved, but not those that have no right before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But you were told that the Church
signifies her sense by the Canons, which forbid
the Minister (on Penalty) to refuse any Child,
that hath God-Fathers, not excepting <hi>Pagans, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
Atheists,</hi> or <hi>Apostates:</hi> Why did you not
answer that?</p>
               <p>2. A Right before God, signifies either proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be a Child that is under the promise of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60850:17"/>
in the sense of 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 14. Else were your
Children unclean, but now they are holy.]</hi> And of
such I am of your mind. Or else it signifieth only
one that the Minister hath, <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> a right to
Baptize. And so he hath as to any adult Atheist,
or Heathen (or his Child) if he deceitfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Christianity. I suppose you speak in the first
proper sense.</p>
               <p>But if you think that the sense of the Rubrick
you are mistaken. No one knoweth better than
Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> and he will tell you otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi>
That God's merciful Covenant giveth us Right to
bring any Child in the World to be Baptized for
Salvation, as it giveth any Man right to take in an
exposed Orphan into his House. And if the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
were to become Proprietor, and take the Child
for his own (as <hi>Abraham</hi> Circumcised the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born in his House) I would not dispute
against it, though I were in doubt: But I have
proved to you that the Liturgy, or Canon, oblige
the Sponsor to no such thing, nor are they to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it: and you your self suppose the contrary,
that the Parent is the First Covenanter: This Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
then speaketh of any Child, and you limit
it to the Seed of the Faithful, and so Equivocate.
At our Conference at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1661. before
the Bishops, I put this true Case; [I have in my
Parish a profest Infidel, that derideth openly the
Scripture, and the Life to come; but for fashion
saith beforehand, <hi>I will bring my Child to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and say as the Book requireth, and refuse
my Child if you dare.]</hi> The Reverend Bishop
<hi>Sanderson</hi> was in the <hi>Chair,</hi> and answered me,
none of them contradicting, That if I Baptized
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60850:17"/>
him according to the Church of <hi>England</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
God-Fathers, I need not scruple it. I askt
him, By whom that Child had right more than
any other Heathen's Child? Seeing, 1. The God-Father
is oft as bad as the Parents. 2. And the
God-Father taketh not the Child as a Proprietor
for his own. Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> answers, That he
knew some that did take them, and Educate them
as their own. I answered, 1. The Canon, or
Rubrick, require it not. 2. I never knew one
Man yet that did it, or that ever thought that as
a Sponsor, he was obliged so to do. 3. If it were
otherwise; Poor Mens Children could get no God-Fathers,
and Rich Men would have none. And
what's this then to the sense of the Article in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
that speaks of all Baptized Children? (It
being of the Baptized <hi>quâ tales,</hi> and an <hi>indefinite
in re necessaria.)</hi> You dare profess that <hi>of all,</hi> and
<hi>undoubtedly certain by the Word of God,</hi> which you
think is—true but of those that have <hi>right before
God.</hi> And may not one profess any thing at that
Rate?</p>
               <p>Besides, I that know why the old words were
changed into these, and by whom it was brought
in, urged and procured, am fully satisfied of the
sense of them that did it, by experience.</p>
               <p>Your Exposition of the Doctrine of Baptism
here adjoyned, is very sound and good. As to
your <hi>Catholicon</hi> which gets down all, I may cause
you to cast it up anon.</p>

               <p>1. About denying Christian Burial to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized
Infants, and the Excommunicate, as not
signifying their Damnation. But if you take in
the foresaid Rubrick Articles that pronounceth
certain Salvation to them if Baptized, you may see
what is like to be the meaning of the Church here:
And also if you read, how they use to expound
their Anathema, or Major Excommunication;
and on what account it is often made. Doctor
<hi>Heylin</hi> tells you, That the necessity of Baptism
was one of Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s first Thesis's publickly
maintained in <hi>Oxford.</hi> You are now Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
your self, but not with that Anathema which
is of the hardest signification. But this is little to
my objected Case.</p>
               <p>2. But the doubt is about the words, that in
sense pronounce all others that are Buried in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
saved. And you would make us believe
that the Rubrick, which excepteth the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
and the other two sorts only, meaneth
also the excepting of the <hi>Excommunicable,</hi> or <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious</hi>
wicked Men. But by such stretches what
words may not <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Papist</hi> take by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his own making? If three sorts excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
limit you not from excepting more; What
can do it? I have tried the sense of the most Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man in these Liturgick Changes that I know,
whether he would consent that the words should
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60850:19"/>
be further extended to except the <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
or <hi>Notoriously Flagitious;</hi> and he most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously
rejected it, as if it would leave power
to every <hi>Presbyter</hi> to Damn whom he would (and
to Excommunicate Men after Death) without a
Bishop.</p>
               <p>3. But you will prove your feigned Sense to be
right, because the <hi>Canon</hi> 68. saith, <hi>[If the party
Deceased were denounced Excommunicate (Majore
Excommunicatione) for some grievous and notorious
Crime, and no Man able to testifie of his Repentance,
the Prayers are not to be said at his Burial.] Ans.</hi>
Could you have more evidently confuted your
self? The Church alloweth you, yea, requireth
you to forbear the said Prayers, 1. If it be a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Sinner. 2. Excommunicated. 3. And
that <hi>(Majore Excommunicatione.)</hi> 4. And there be
no proof of his Repentance. And hence you can
infer, That the Church meant it also of <hi>Notorious
Sinners not Excommunicate.</hi> What Alchimy is
this? Whereas the Church is herein specially care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that the Priest may not be the Judge: What
need the <hi>Major Excommunication</hi> be put in, if it
were not meant? The Canon here declareth the
Churches Sense more obligingly, than any Bishop
can do.</p>

               <p>§ 1. <hi>YOur fourteenth Section is of the doubt</hi>
[Whether we may Declare our Consent that
none should be admitted to the Communion, till he
be confirmed, or desirous and ready to be confirmed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this 1. You say of your own head,</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
is not intended for them that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
admitted to the Lord's Table;] <hi>without any
proof, though clean contrary to your Covenant of
Conformity. The words are, That</hi> [<q>None are to be
admitted till,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.] And you say, That by</hi> [None]
<hi>is meant</hi> [None except all that have been so already
admitted, that is, most of the Communicants by far
in <hi>England,</hi> and all that come out of <hi>France, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>What a great limitation hath
this</hi> [None?] None except almost all, or most.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boccaline</hi> tells us of a device at <hi>Rome</hi> to make a
man's throat swallow a Pompion; and then no
doubt any Physician may procure the swallowing
of a Pill.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>But you are</hi> perswaded you shall not meet
with one person that will not desire it rather than be
put from the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60850:20"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But it is not your <hi>own practice</hi> only that
you must profess consent to, but to the <hi>Use of the
Rubrick,</hi> as it is a Law to all others: Do you think
no other shall meet with such, because <hi>you</hi> may not?</p>
               <p>2. Remember that the Confirmation in question
is little kin to that which I and Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> have
written for: A very Learned Bishop told me late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it is for the giving of the Holy Ghost by
Imposition of hands: And (whatever you feign)
it is confined to the <hi>Order</hi> of Bishops. Do you know
what <hi>Dallaeus de Confirmat.</hi> hath said against it?
And that all are against it as with us that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Diocesan Prelacy? I know few Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
in <hi>England,</hi> that are for it, or desire it.
When I pleaded for it in 1660. hoping to have
reduced the English Confirmation to that which I
described in my <hi>Treatise of Confirmation,</hi> had you
but heard how much the truly Learned, judicious,
honest Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> said against it, who is a publick
Professor in <hi>Oxford,</hi> a Conformist, and the King's
Chaplain, you would not think that you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meet with any that will not desire it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I think most of <hi>England</hi> are unconfirmed;
if they desire it, what keepeth them from it?</p>
               <p>4. They may not desire it, and yet not be
kept from the Sacrament: For he that receiveth
it not of you, or any Conformists, may receive it
of others: And all the Conformists that ever I saw
deliver the Sacrament, give it to the unconfirmed,
and never ask them whether they desire it. And
yet you must covenant not to give it to any such
as desire not Confirmation and Consent that this be
imposed on all others.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But you say, <hi>Such a remote possibility shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60850:21"/>
not keep you from Conformity.]</hi> That is, <hi>You will
Consent to the Use of this Rubrick,</hi> which requireth,
that none in <hi>England</hi> give the Sacrament to any
that desire not our Episcopal Confirmation, which
almost all the Non-Conformists desire not; and most
of <hi>England</hi> shew by their practice, that they desire
not, because you conceit that you shall meet with
none such your self, who perhaps may never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacrament, (at least till you are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
from your Excommunication.) And yet you
are so honestly against Division, that you will not
separate from the Non-Conformists, and their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
though you suffer for it. These things
hang not well together.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOur 15th Section is against my greatest
Objection; the manner of baptizing by
God-fathers sole sponsion, in the Liturgy: Where
you take your own Order, and not mine (to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your self,) and put four questions, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
the main, or say as good as nothing to it.
My first question is, Which way the Child cometh
to have right to Baptism, any more than all the
Infidels Children in the world? That is, <hi>Whether
the meer Sponsion of God-fathers who adopt not the
Child, nor take him for their own, nor are at all
required to do so, do give or prove a Right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
(and consequently to undoubted Salvation or
pardon) in all the Infants of Apostates, Sadduces,
Infidels, Brutists, Arrians, Socinians, Wicked men,
Atheists;</hi> yea or of any other? I told you how
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60850:21"/>
Conformists and other Divines here differ; but
you easily pass by the difficulty.</p>
               <p>2. And the next question is, Whether the
Church of <hi>England</hi> require any ground of title
in the Infant besides the Sponsion of the fore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
God-fathers, and God's general Promise?
And I have proved that they do not: It is not the
Parents Christianity or Faith that they require,
nor the Grandfathers, nor any Pro-parents, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopters
or Proprietors. Nor do they ask, <hi>Whose
Child it is?</hi> but forbid us to refuse any that have
God-fathers; nor do they suffer the Parent to be
one of the God-fathers, but forbid him so much
as to speak there, as dedicating his own Child to
God, and forbid us to urge him to be present:
Yet are they utterly disagreed of the Child's title:
Some say it is from God's Covenant only; and that
all Children on Earth have title, and want but
one to offer them to Baptism, as he may take in
an exposed Orphan. Some say that the <hi>God-fathers</hi>
Act is his <hi>Title</hi> to Baptism. Some say, it is the
Churches Faith. And by the <hi>Church</hi> some mean
the <hi>Ministers;</hi> some mean that Parish; some mean
the Diocesan Church; some the National Church;
and some the Universal Church: But you seem to
think the title is from the Parent, but you speak
it not out, nor much meddle with the case; and
the Church seemeth not to be of that mind; though
St. <hi>Paul</hi> say <hi>[Else were your Children unclean, but
now are they holy.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. But you say, <hi>The Parent is not excluded nor
forbid to be present.] Ans.</hi> But 1. No man in the
Town is forbid to be present: Doth it follow that
any man giveth title to the Child who may but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60850:22"/>
be present if he will? If the Parents Faith were
thought necessary to the Title (or a Pro-parents)
the Book would require it, and require the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to take account of it, or at least would suffer
the Parent to be one of the Sponsors, or to speak
one word of Sponsion, all which is expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Canon, and by the Book appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to others.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>But you say,</hi> If he will he may profess and
Covenant for his Child, yea, the Minister may and
ought to urge and require him.] Ans. <hi>What, and
yet Conform? When he is forbid, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
forbid to suffer it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>But say you,</hi> [<q>The Canon is no part of
the Liturgy, nor are we bound to it wherein it is
against the Liturgy and good Order.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. By the Can. 36. we are all to subscribe to
use no other form in Administring the Sacraments
but the Liturgy: And you shall be no Minister
here if you subscribe not to that Canon, though
you should say, <hi>It is against good Order.</hi> 2. The
Liturgy it self appropriateth the whole Sponsion
to the God-Fathers. 3. Our question is of the
Churches sense herein: And it is the same Church
the made the Canons; and still owneth them:
Therefore in the Canon the Church expoundeth
her sense, more obligingly than you, or any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
can expound it. So that for you to assent
and consent to the form of Baptism in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
sense, and when you have done, to say that
you may and must go against it, because the Canon
binds not, is a method of Conforming, which I
will not follow you in.</p>
               <p>§ 5. What you tell me of my Decision in my
Directory, is nothing to our present Case.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60850:22"/>
                  <hi>But you say,</hi> The Canon supposeth the Parents as
present, or Consenting and Principal, for he procureth
the God-Fathers, and the Sureties are his Deputies,
or Seconds, and yet undertakes not the Parents duty.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I have proved to you that the Canon, or
Church, neither foundeth the Title in the Parent,
nor permitteth him any Sponsion; and professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
layeth it all on the God-Fathers, saying; <hi>That
it is by that the Child believeth, and promiseth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth,</hi>
&amp;c. And no such word of the Parents
Faith: Nay, all Children of Infidels or Atheists;
must be thus Baptized. This therefore is your
meer disproved Fiction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Parent must procure the
God-Fathers, no way proveth that he is supposed
to be a Christian or Consent, or that he is the
Principal Sponsor: For it is for the Child's sake,
that the Law bindeth him to get Sponsors, and all
Atheists and Infidels among us, are bound to send
their Children with Sponsors to be Baptized as well
as Christians.</p>
               <p>§ 6. You say, <hi>The Sureties undertake not to do
the Duties of a Parent, nor more than they can do,</hi>
&amp;c.] <hi>Ans.</hi> Then it is not undertaken at all: For
all that is to be undertaken is by them, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all required of the Parents.</p>
               <p>§ 7. As to the Interrogatories, and Profession,
that the Child is said to <hi>Repent, Believe, forsake
the Devil, Consent,</hi> &amp;c. and not only to be the
<hi>Child</hi> of one that <hi>Repenteth, Believeth</hi> (which is
his Title) you say it is but to <hi>oblige</hi> the <hi>Infant:</hi>
But professing to <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Repent</hi> at present,
and promising to do it hereafter, are different
things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60850:23"/>
But you say, <hi>These words may be submitted to
till better may be had.] Ans.</hi> And why may you
not say so of any Untruth? But the question is,
whether they may be <hi>Consented</hi> to, and approved?</p>
               <p>§ 8. <hi>As to the great Question,</hi> [Whether it be
the Intention of the Book that we deny Baptism to
such as cannot procure God-Fathers, and God-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or to such as out of Conscience scruple and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to procure them, and will stand as Undertakers
themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] <hi>You say,</hi> No surely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas, how little know you what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is which you defend? 1. Are not all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to subscribe to Administer the Sacraments
in no other Form than the Liturgy? <hi>Canon</hi> 36.
2. Doth not the Liturgy make the God-Fathers
Office necessary? and a great part of the Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Office is the Ministers Speech to them and
their Answer, and the Charge laid on them. Can
you say all these words if no Sponsor be there?
Or can you have such Answers? 3. Doth not
the Church Command that <hi>no Parent be God-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his own Child,</hi> and no Questions or Answers
be used but the words of the Liturgy? 4. And
did you ever know a Child Baptized without any
Sponsor? You rightly call your self <hi>The Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Conformist;</hi> for you plead for it and against
it, in the same Lines? Your contradiction meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
through all your Book.</p>
               <p>§ 9. <hi>You add,</hi> [<q>If it be lawful to violate a
Divine Command to save the life of a Beast (the
Sabbath) sure it is lawful to violate a Humane
Rule, or Order, rather than cast Infants out of
the Church, and deny them Christian Baptism.</q>]
<hi>Ans.</hi> It is so: And therefore it is unlawful to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60850:23"/>
to that which I must not do, and to Covenant
to use that which I must not use. If I must not
obey it, I must not Covenant to obey it.</p>
               <p>But perhaps you mean that the Law-makers
intended, that in such cases the Ministers have
leave to violate it, and admit Men to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
that will not have God-Fathers, for God
intended such liberty in his Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> God's Law was not violated by <hi>David,</hi>
the Priests, or the Disciples, in the instanced cases
of the Sabbath: For he never forbad them what
they did in those Circumstances: Yea, his Law
had been violated <hi>[I will have Mercy and not
Sacrifice]</hi> had they done otherwise; and he hath
no Contradictory Laws: It is said that the Priests
in the Temple brake the Sabbath and are <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
that is, They violate materially the outward
rest of the Sabbath, but they violate not God's
Law; else they were not blameless. But you can
prove no such things by the Church Laws in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
as that Ministers may break them by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
such Persons to the Sacrament as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth.
For, 1. You Covenant to Administer
only according to the Liturgy. 2. The Canon
punisheth all Ministers that give it against the
Prohibition. 3. And the Rubrick excludeth your
supposed power of Dispensation. Can you believe
your self that the meaning of the Liturgy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
is <hi>[None shall be admitted that desire not
God-Fathers, except such as will not out of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Conscience?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are those then admitted, that through <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness
desire not God-Fathers?</hi> If so, then you
make the sense to be <hi>[Those that have not God-Fathers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60850:24"/>
shall not be admitted to that Sacrament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
all that will not,</hi> viz. <hi>Conscienciously, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely.]</hi>
If not, then the sense must be <hi>[You
shall admit none to that Sacrament that have no
God-Fathers, through Parents Prophaneness, but all
that have none through scruple of Conscience.]</hi> And
who cannot pretend such scruple? And who will
not pretend it, when that will justifie them? And
how would the Bishops reproach such an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which either maketh every Priest a judge of
Mens Hearts, (whether their pretence be true or
not) or else admitteth all that will not have God-Fathers,
while the admission of any of them is
expresly forbidden? It is a stretching Exposition
indeed which is against the whole form of the
Office, and the express words of the Churches
Canon, <hi>[No Parent shall be God-Father to his
own Child.]</hi> Try whether any two Bishops in
<hi>England</hi> will allow you any such Exposition.</p>
               <p>If such be allowed in this Case, why not in all
other like it? And so the meaning of Law, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and Rubrick be, [You shall do thus except
when you have Moral Reason against it, such as
is Mercy, which must be preferred.] Do you
know how many have been Fined and sent to Goal
for Preaching, though they pleaded for it Mercy
to Mens Souls? Do you believe that it was the
meaning of the Parliament and Bishops, [You
shall keep no Conventicles, nor omit the Liturgy
or Ceremonies, or Subscription, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless when
<hi>Mercy</hi> is to be preferred?] They that have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
that cannot bear the Liturgy, when they
omit it in mercy to the Flock. I pray you get us
an authentick signification of this Sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60850:24"/>
The words cited by you in the Preface to the
Articles of 1604 are impertinent to our business:
It followeth not that you have leave to break the
Laws when you think mercy requireth it, because
<hi>
                     <q>they are not equivalent to the Eternal Word of God,
nor bind conscience as of necessity in the nature of
them,</q> considered in themselves]</hi> and not in the
Authority of the Commander. Again I ask, Shall
any man escape punishement by such a plea of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Are not two thousand Ministers silenced, and
more, that pleaded <hi>Mercy</hi> to themselves and others,
for the reason of their Non-conformity? Did your
Learned, Pious, Moderate Bishop, excuse you for
that plea? Doth not the express words of the Law,
and Canon, and Rubrick, and the sentence and
execution of all Judges to this day, confute your
exposition and exception?</p>
               <p>You truly say <hi>[It is a sin to make a false con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Law.]</hi> But if against the express
words, and scope, and common judgment and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
you will presume to put your sense, which
is merciful, because <hi>Charity thinketh no evil.</hi> Any
thing, almost, may be so said, consented to, and
sworn.</p>
               <p>I have spoken with a Papist that hath taken the
Oath of Supremacy, and wrote for it; because it
is to be supposed that it is only the spiritual power
called Pastoral, which the Pope claimeth over
<hi>England,</hi> or such give him; and only the Power
of the Sword which the King claimeth, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him and Foreigners. And he citeth a fairer
pretence for his exposition than you do here for
yours: And thus all may take up the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
that hold but the Popes Spiritual Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60850:25"/>
over us and all the world. What words can
be so bad, that a man may not feign in Charity a
good sense of?</p>
               <p>§ 9. You say the Liturgy alloweth <hi>private
Baptism without the Cross, and God-fathers. Ans.</hi> 1.
Thence I must gather, that it doth not so allow
publick Baptism; no not on pretence of necessity
and mercy; else why had they not exprest their
allowance of one as well as of the other? 2. And
even there, it must be repeated after in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
with God-fathers that believe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in the <hi>Name</hi> of the Child; (And in the house
there is nothing named, or required of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but <hi>some one</hi> (whoever) is only to <hi>name</hi> the
child.)</p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>In the Margin you say</hi> [<q>There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
prohibition in all the Liturgy, tying Ministers
in no case, to baptize without the Cross, and to
give the Sacrament to kneelers only: and to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
none without Sureties.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I am glad that your whole writing favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of that spirit of Love and Christian Peace and
Forbearance, as your dislike of these things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.
And while we agree about the sense of God's
Law, we shall not break Charity for our differing
of the sense of the Laws of man: But seeing you
put these great points (of my Non-conformity)
here together, I shall briefly repeat the reasons of
my exposition against yours.</p>
               <p>Words are to signifie the mind and the matter.
If the Book speak intelligibly, so as to oblige us to
one sense, it's nothing to our case whether the
<hi>prohibition be express.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>The Liturgy-Rubrick saith</hi> [<q>There shall be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60850:25"/>
for every male-child to be baptized, two God-fathers,
and one God-mother; and for every fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
one God-father, and two God-mothers.</q>]</p>
               <p>II. The whole transaction, beside prayer to
God, and the act of Baptizing, is mainly speech to
the God-fathers, and demands of them, and their
answer, by professing Abrenunciation, Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be Baptized, resolved Obedience: They
must name the Child. They are exhorted to see
that the Child be taught what a solemn Vow, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and Profession he made by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to
be brought up to the Bishop to be confirmed.</p>
               <p>III. In the Baptism of the Adult, the God-fathers
are called but <hi>[Witnesses]</hi> as not giving the
person <hi>Title</hi> to Baptism. But in the Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
they do <hi>profess</hi> and <hi>covenant</hi> in the Child's
name, and he doth it by them, as his very <hi>Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. The Catechism saith, That <hi>Repentance</hi> and
<hi>Faith</hi> are required of persons to be Baptized; and,
as the old Book said, <hi>They perform them by their
Sureties;</hi> so the new one saith, <hi>They promise them
by their Sureties,</hi> and therefore are Baptized.</p>
               <p>V. For the Cross, the Liturgy saith <hi>[<q>Here the Priest
shall make a Cross on the Child's fore-head.</q>]</hi> And it
referreth us to the Canon for the sense and reasons.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>The Communion-Rubrick saith,</hi> [He shall
deliver it into their hands, All meekly kneeling.]</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>The last Rubrick saith,</hi> [It is ordained in
this Office, that the Communicants shall receive the
same kneeling.]</p>
               <p>VIII. <q>
                     <hi>The same Church by Can. 36. requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
every Minister to subscribe that he</hi> will use
the Form in that Book prescribed in Publick Prayer,
and Administration of the Sacraments, and no
other.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60850:26"/>
IX. And the Can. 27. saith, <hi>[<q>No Minister when
he celebrates the Communion, shall wittingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the same to any, but to such as kneel,
under pain of suspension.</q>]</hi> Can the Church more
plainly speak the sense of her Liturgy? You say <hi>It
is against Schismaticks.</hi> Yes, 1. That is the end;
and the words express the means. 2. And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository,
calling those Schismaticks that scruple
and refuse to kneel.</p>
               <p>X. Those that say the Liturgy hath any thing
contrary to the Scripture, or that the Ceremonies
are such as he may not use, approve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
<hi>ipso facto:</hi> And therefore as Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
not to be admitted to the Sacrament till
they repent of that their wicked Errour, Can. 4,
5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XI. Can.</hi> 14. <q>All Ministers shall observe the
Orders, Rites and Ceremonies prescribed in the
Book of Common-Prayer, as well in reading the
holy Scriptures, and saying of Prayers, as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Sacraments, without either dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
in regard of Preaching, <hi>or in any other
respect</hi> (note that) <hi>or adding any thing in the
matter or form thereof.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>XII. Can.</hi> 29. [<q>No Parent shall be urged to
be present, nor be admitted to answer as God-father
for his own Child; nor any God-father or
God-mother shall be suffered to make any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
or speech than by the Book of Common-Prayer
is prescribed in that behalf.</q>]</p>
               <p>If yet the Church have not declared her sense
of the Liturgy, but that I may Baptize without
Cross or God-fathers, and give the Sacrament to
them that sit, rather than refuse them, I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60850:26"/>
no mans words. And what can constrain
an unwilling person to understand?</p>
               <p>XIII. Yet I say again, If I practice on any
pretence of mercy, according to your Rule, the
Judges will condemn me; the Justices will send
me to the common Gaol, among Rogues, to lie
six months, and will fine me twenty pound, and
forty pound a Sermon, as I have tryed; and the
Bishops or their Courts will excommunicate me,
and prosecute me to lay me in Gaol; as you have
tryed who fly to escape it. And are not these
made Judges of the sense of the Law? and will not
all this convince us what it meaneth?</p>
               <p>Because you have put three of the chief matters
of my Non-conformity here together, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
all together. If you will prefer the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Bishops before all this, I pray you do
not pretend that some honest Bishop (that had no
hand in our Changes and Silencing) saith to you
in private; but get it us under the hands of many
of them, if you can [that because mercy is to be
preferred before sacrifice, we may Baptize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Cross, and God-fathers, and may give the
Sacrament to them that kneel not, if they dissent
through consciencious fear of living.]</p>

               <p>§ 1. IN your sixteenth Section you profess your
liking of sitting at the Lord's Supper ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than kneeling: How then can you declare
[Assent, Consent and Approbation] to the Liturgy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60850:27"/>
(expounded by the Canons) which in plain words,
and by sharp penalties on Dissenters, so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
kneeling before sitting.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Your preferring the <hi>preaching and hearing
of the Word, and Prayer, and Praise, as more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than the carnal</hi> (you mean the <hi>outward) part
in the Lord's Supper,</hi> is very far from Conformity
to the common sense of the Bishops, who ordered
the Altaring of the Communion Tables, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
bowing towards them, and suspended so
many Ministers on such accounts; even far from
the sense of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> expressed in his life
by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and of the whole Church of <hi>England</hi>
expressed in the Canons of 1640.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I answered before your conceit that the
Liturgy alloweth you to give the Sacrament to
them that kneel not, and your distorting the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
because the Title is against Schismaticks, when
they mean that those that kneel not, shall be taken
and excluded as Schismaticks, and so excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
(as I have proved) and not that the word
is distinguishing and limiting, allowing you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
those to sit that are not Schimaticks. The
Bishops will deride that Exposition. They that
heard us at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> can tell you who that Dr.
(now a Dean) was, who craved leave to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the Case against me, and to have proved
<hi>[That it is an Act of mercy to those that scruple and
refuse to receive the Sacrament kneeling, to deny
them the Communion of the Church therein.]</hi>

            <div n="18" type="chapter">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60850:27"/>
               <head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOur seventeenth Section is for the Cross
in Baptism. I distinctly proved that
the Church imposeth it [<q>As a Symbol of our
Christian Profession, and as a consecrating
dedicating sign, by which 1. God's part of
the Covenant is signified, even the Grace by
him given, and the duty by him imposed on us.
2. And the Receiver's part is signified, and by
solemn Engagement there professed, even his
<hi>Faith</hi> in Christ crucified, and his resolution and
self-obliging Consent or Covenant to be the
Lords as dedicated to him, and to perform all
the future duties of the Covenant,</q> And that
this is the true description of a Sacrament of the
Covenant of Grace. The word [Sacrament] larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
taken, may signifie no more than man may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute:
But a <hi>Sacrament strictly</hi> taken as thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
I suppose man may not institute. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ hath instituted two as an act of his
Royal Prerogative. And if any Institution be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to his Kingly and Priestly Power, it must be
such: No other can be named excluding this. And
if none be proper, what is it for him to be Great
and One Law-giver to his Church? If Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the chief part of Supreme Government, be
common to him and Bishops, why is not that Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Common?</p>
               <p>2. And if Christ would have had any more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of the Covenant of Grace, he would have
somewhere expressed his Commands and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to his Ministers to make them: But
he that hath given them full Commands and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60850:28"/>
for Preaching, Prayer, Baptizing, and his
Supper; and for their other duties for the Flocks,
hath not said a word to them of this; either bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them make new Sacraments, or telling them
how many, or directing them what, or how to
do it; nor how to use them when made; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to bless them.</p>
               <p>3. To make more, seemeth to accuse Christ's
Law or Institution of Imperfection: Subordinate
actions do not so: But to make Ordinances <hi>ejus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
generis,</hi> with those which he made, not as a
meer man, nor as a meer Minister, but as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
or King of the Church, doth seem to say,
That Christ left half his work undone. Did he
institute Baptism and his Supper, as a meer Man,
or a meer Minister? then <hi>à quatenus ad omne</hi> any
<hi>Man,</hi> or any <hi>Minister</hi> may do the like, and make
more Sacraments: But if as King of the Church,
and as Saviour, then none but our King of the
Chuch and Saviour may do the like.</p>
               <p>Christ hath instituted one day of each week to
commemorate his Resurrection, as God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
instituted a weekly Sabbath (as I have proved
in a peculiar Treatise.) Men may set apart one
day in a year for special Thanksgivings, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations,
and one day in a week, <hi>e. g.</hi> in a
time of Plague and danger, to fast and pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But if any should make another weekly day of
holy observance, to commemorate the same work
of Christ's Resurrection, or our Redemption, which
Christ did separate that day to commemorate, I
think he would be both an unjust accuser of
Christ's Law, as insufficient, and an unjust usurper
of his Prerogative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60850:28"/>
4. And it is considerable to me, that though
Christ so extraordinarily Commissioned and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
his Apostles to record his Words and Acts
in Scripture, and settle Church-Orders and Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Offices, and teach the Nations to observe all
that he had Commanded them; yet even them did
did he never Commission to make a new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Covenant of Grace; nor did they
ever make one; but contrarily rebuked those that
would but have kept up some of the old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Divine or Humane: And was not the Cross
a stumbling and foolishness to the World in the
Apostles Days? and yet they never made such a
Sacrament. And who hath equal Power with
them?</p>
               <p>§ 2. If any say the Church doth not make it a
Sacrament, I answer: 1. It is not the <hi>Name</hi> that
we contend about, but the thing. 2. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proved it by the Constitutive parts which you
answer not. 3. If Christ had Instituted the Cross
as the Church doth, <hi>[as a Badg of our Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
dedicating the Child to God as a solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
Figure, by which the Minister in God's
Name, and in the Persons, pronounceth him Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
and engaged, as signifying both God's part
or Grace of the Covenant, and Mans part or Duty.]</hi>
I ask, Whether you would not have c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led this a
Sacrament? And if it want but <hi>Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Benediction,</hi> it wanteth indeed a due Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
but it is still a Humane Sacrament, though
not a Divine; and therefore an unlawful Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I would but know whether Men may make
New Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace, or
not? If yea, how many? and <hi>Quo jure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60850:29"/>
§ 3. And God's Prohibition, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or diminishing, is not washt away so easily
as your words would make Men believe. You
say, <hi>It reacheth to the whole Duty of Man, and
Government of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> There be
some things in the Duty of Man and Church-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that God hath left to Man: To do those is
no addition to God's Laws: But to do the like
work that God by his Law hath done, which he
never left to Man, seemeth to me the Addition
there forbidden: <hi>e.g.</hi> If Men had made another
Tabernacle, another Ark of the Covenant, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
holy Vestment for <hi>Aaron,</hi> another Sacrament
like Circumcision, or the Passeover; he that so
reproved their worshiping in the High Places,
would have reproved these.</p>
               <p>§ 4. But the sum of your defence is <hi>ad Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
to my self, for granting the lawfulness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
private professing Signs, and of the Cross as
such: It's strange to me, that you that are so ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious,
can discern no more difference between,
1. Private and publick Church-actions. And,
2. Between a bare professing Sign <hi>in genere,</hi> and
a <hi>Sacramental Covenanting-dedicating Symbolical
Sign</hi> in specie.</p>
               <p>1. Every Sacramental Symbol is a professing
Sign: But every professing Sign is not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Symbol (a solemn Sacramental Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Mutual Covenant, by an investing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the parts of both the Covenants.)
Doth it follow then, that because Men (yea, any
Man) may make a professing Sign of his Mind,
that Man (yea, every Man) may make a new
Sacrament? An <hi>Israelite</hi> might have lift up his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60850:29"/>
Hand to signifie consent to a Duty, or to answer a
Question: But might he therefore have imitated
Circumcision, or the Passeover? When a Man
is Baptized, if you ask him whether he consent,
he may signifie it by <hi>Bowing, lifting up his Hand,
by Writing,</hi> which are all but to the same use as
Speech: But he must Sacramentally signifie it by the
reception of Baptism, as the instituted solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
Symbol of his Religion. But for any to
make to the Church of Christ, a new Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Symbol for such a Covenanting use, is another
Matter.</p>
               <p>A Man that at the Lord's Supper, is asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he consent to Christ's Covenant, may signifie
it as aforesaid: But he may not therefore joyn to
the Sacrament such another Covenanting Symbol
of Christianity, <hi>e. g.</hi> To make (or consent to,
and approve and use) a Law that all Christians
shall, solemnly after the Eucharist, have their Heads
anointed with Oyl, to signifie that they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, and hereby Covenant with him
and the Holy Ghost, as signifying his Grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and their Duty performed and promised;
and this applied by a Minister Officiating, as by
his Commission.</p>
               <p>§ 4. I perceive by your mistaking Inferences,
that you understood not my distinction of <hi>Private</hi>
and <hi>Publick,</hi> and thought I had meant <hi>Secret,</hi> or
<hi>Open,</hi> or before <hi>Few</hi> or <hi>Many:</hi> Whereas I speak
in the sense that these words are commonly used in
Politicks, <hi>e. g.</hi> When they distinguish <hi>Index pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus
&amp; privatus, Res publicae &amp; privatae, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones
publicae &amp; privatae,</hi> &amp;c. Publick is that
which either belongeth to the <hi>Society,</hi> or a <hi>Publick
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60850:30"/>
Officer</hi> as such: As a meer Subject is <hi>Homo priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
so his Actions and Affairs, meerly as his, are
<hi>private:</hi> The <hi>Aerarium</hi> of the Commonwealth
though kept secretly is the <hi>publick Treasure.</hi> The
judgment of a publick Judge, when few are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in his Chamber, is <hi>Iudicium publicum;</hi> and
the judgment of a meer Arbitrator before thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
is <hi>Iudicium privatum:</hi> A private Man's
arbitrary Words or Actions in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>
at the Bar, are <hi>Actiones privatae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. I have more reverence for the Ancient
Christians, than to be a bold condemner of all their
Actions, which I wish they had not done (and
had they foreseen the Consequents, they would
not have done). And I must, <hi>Fide humanâ,</hi> give
some credit to those ancient Writers, specially such
as <hi>Augustine,</hi> who tells us of Miracles adjoyned
to some use of the Cross: And considering how
they used it, I find it was (when those things
were done) as a private arbitrary professing Sign,
such as it would have been to say by words <hi>[I
am a Christian,]</hi> or <hi>[I trust in Christ,]</hi> or <hi>[I
am not ashamed of a Crucified Saviour.]</hi> And if
when one asked them of their Faith, or derided
them for trusting in a Crucified Man, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by crossing, I judge them not for so doing:
The occasions and Persons might excuse such a
private professing Action. But if they would turn
this into a <hi>publick Church-Ordinance by a Law, and
into a Humane Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
requiring all to receive it as the common Badge of
Christianity; I reproach not the approvers, but
I dare not approve it, or so use it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60850:30"/>
§ 6. <hi>You say,</hi> [We must reduce what is said in
the Canon to the words in the 39 Articles, and the
Liturgy, for they contradict not themselves.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no shew of contradiction. If
the Church in three Books express her sense,
must I not set all together, and take them in all?
And when the Liturgy purposely referreth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
to the Canon for her sense and reason,
it's an odd way of expounding it, to forsake the
Canons Exposition, and say, I reduce it to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy.
Doubtless all three together express their
sense.</p>
               <p>§ 7. The second Commandment forbad not all
private use of Images, either a Civil, or meer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative
or Monitory private (yea, or publick)
use. As it forbad not <hi>Iacob</hi> to pitch a stone of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
or the <hi>Israelites</hi> to make a Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Monitory Altar, and yet forbad such an
Altar for Worship to be erected without God's
Order. But it was <hi>external symbolizing with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
by Images,</hi> which the second Commandment
forbad; that is, either worshiping them, or God
by them; or by setting them up in the place of
Worship, seeming so to do. So it is not all use
of a Cross that breaketh the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
When you have proved lifting up the hand,
or laying it on the Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Sacraments, I
shall further answer you: Or if the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
oblige us not to use <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sacraments</hi>
(as it is now one of Christ's Commandments) then I
shall confess that it forbiddeth not us to devise the
like.</p>
               <p>§ 8. You say, <hi>[If it be a Sacrament, it would
be universally unlawful. If Baptism had not been
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60850:31"/>
ordained by Christ, it would have been traiterous
and sinful to use it as a Sacrament.] Ans.</hi> You
grant us enough; I durst not have used the word
<hi>traiterous</hi> so boldly, lest I should anger the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
But when did you prove that every
<hi>professing sign</hi> is used to the same use <hi>in specie,</hi> as
the covenanting dedicating Symbol of the Cross
is? This was a supposition not so easily to have
been begged.</p>
               <p>§ 9. As to my Simile, <hi>That Baptism is Christ's
Badge or Colours;</hi> it illustrates in the point of simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude:
And so it doth, that the King would take
it ill to have a publick badge of the Order of the
Garter to be added to his Star by a private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
much more for any to make a Law for all his
Subjects, to be known by a badge of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
               <p>You say, <hi>That it's lawful to wear those Colours
in the Troop, which he may wear out. Ans.</hi> Yes,
if he may wear them out <hi>in specie</hi> to the same use
and ends. But if you at a Funeral wear a black
<hi>Ribbon,</hi> and your General's Colours be white;
and some Souldiers will make a Law, That the
badge of all the Souldiers shall be <hi>black Ribbons,</hi>
joyned to the white, it would not then be lawful
for you in or out of the Troop to wear that black
as the badge of a Souldier, much less to declare
that you approved of, and consented to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
And when you tell me, <hi>I allow the use of
it,</hi> I tell you, <hi>I allow not your use prescribed by the
Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> I can never prove that Christ forbad it:
<hi>And yet you say before that,</hi> It's traiterous to have
made a Sacrament (without Christ.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60850:31"/>
But you affirm, That it's made but for the same
use in Baptism, which I allow out. But why did
you not give some answer to my express proof of
the contrary? Or why put you me so oft to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it? It is an outward visible sign, by which in
the solemnizing of the Covenant between Christ
and us, the person is dedicated to God, by receiving
the said sign of the Grace of the Covenant, and the
obligation of the Covenant, and of the persons
professed consent and engagement to the duties of
it.</p>
               <p>1. That it is a <hi>Badge</hi> of Christianity, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Canon saith twice.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That it is an</hi> honourable Badge by which the
Infant is dedicated to the service of God; <hi>the same
Canon saith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That it is a <hi>Covenanting sign,</hi> both the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
words, and these of the Canon shew.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That it is a sign of professed</hi> Consent <hi>to the</hi>
Covenant-duties <hi>there named</hi> [Not to be ashamed
to confess the Faith of Christ crucified, and manfully
to fight under his banner against the World, Flesh
and Devil, and to continue Christ's faithful Servant
and Souldier to his lives end.] <hi>The words shew,
and none denyeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That it is an <hi>Obliging sign,</hi> both as imposed
by God's Minister, and as self-obliging by the said
professed Consent, is also exprest in the same words.
And this is it which is called The <hi>Covenant-Vow.</hi>
The person is Vowed or Devoted to God by two
Sacramental signs, Baptism and the Cross.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>That it signifieth also God's Grace given by
that Covenant, the words of the expository Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
30 shew:</hi> [To dedicate them by that badge to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60850:32"/>
his service, whose benefits bestowed on them in
Baptism, the name of the Cross did represent [To the
service of him that dyed on the Cross.]</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Yea, that it is an</hi> Investing sign, <hi>delivering
the Church-priviledges, appeareth in the words:</hi>
[We receive this Child into the Congregation of
Christ's Flock, and do sign him with the sign of the
Cross.]</p>
               <p>8. And that it is to operate Grace morally on
the <hi>Intelligent,</hi> is exprest in the foresaid words of
instructing and obliging signification, with the
preface of the Liturgy <hi>[To stir up the dull mind of
man to the remembrance of his duty to God by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and special signification whereby he might be
edified.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. endeavouring to prevent
what followed, I used these same reasons with the
great Bishop, who, I think, hath had the first and
and chief hand in the matter as it standeth, and
he denyed but two things of the Sacramental
Cross; 1. That it is of God's institution, which
he thought essential to a Church-Sacrament: To
which I say, It is a humane unlawful Sacrament;
but that it is not Divine we easily grant.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That the Cross giveth Grace.</hi> I answered, that
<hi>effectually it doth not,</hi> because God will not bless
unlawful means: But it is appointed by man to
give or work Grace. This I proved, 1. Because
as it is a Receiving sign into the Church, it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
by Investiture the Relative Grace of Church-priviledges.
2. As the Water of Baptism worketh
morally, by signifying the washing of Christ's
Blood; so the Cross is to operate morally, by signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Christ's Crucifixion, the benefits of the Cross,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60850:32"/>
and our duty. But he laid the stress of his Cause
on this assertion, That Sacraments, as such, are to
give grace otherwise than by such moral operation;
and it is no Sacrament that is not instituted to give
God's grace otherwise than morally.] I told him
how commonly Protestants maintain that they are
not instituted to give grace physically; but only
<hi>morally,</hi> and by investiture in relations. And here
we broke.</p>
               <p>And because I must expect that from others that
are driven to it, this will be the last refuge; I will
add, that even the wisest Papists themselves do
maintain only such moral Causality in Sacraments.</p>
               <p>§ 11. And here, with respect to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Article of the certainty of Baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Salvation; and also the answering of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
I shall cite some of their words, to shew
you at how great a loss the most Learned Papists
are about things that every poor English Minister
may <hi>be certain</hi> of, or profess to hold, or else be
silenced or ruined: Though it be ascribing too
much to the <hi>opus operatum</hi> in Sacraments that we
grievously accuse the Papists of.</p>
               <p>I. Aquinas <hi>of the Efficacy of Sacraments, saith,
1. That they are</hi> aliquo modo Causae gratiae. 2. <hi>Not

Law by which your Cause and ours are to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I would vie with you against your Plea from
Humane Opinion, or Authority: And shew you,
1. That the Apostles not using it, will weigh
down the Ancients and others using it. 2. That
the Ancients used it not so ill as we must do, as a
Sacrament of the Covenant; but as a meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Sign of their not being ashamed of Christ;
till it did degenerate by degrees. 3. That the
Learning and Piety of them that have refused it,
hath been equal to theirs that so used it. 4. That
he that readeth <hi>Bernard, Gerson, Kempis, Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luus,
Gerhardus, Zutphaniensis, Sales,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
such (yea, Persons of Resolution) will
think there have been very holy <hi>Papists;</hi> and for
number they exceed the <hi>Protestants:</hi> And yet that

White Garment, Milk and Hony, not knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on Lord's Days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were more generally
used of old, and yet are not now so well thought
of: Nor the giving the Eucharist to Infants, nor
the Millenary Doctrine, much the Ancients Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

               <p>§ 13. Your main Argument you say, is, that
<hi>[Ye obey that Command,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. And Christ
doth not forbid you to use the Cross.] <hi>Ans.</hi> As
if you should say, When I Celebrate Christ's two
Sacraments, I obey his Commands; and he hath
not forbidden me to use two (or ten) more. As
when you are commanded to believe in Christ as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60850:35"/>
your Saviour, it is implied that you must take no
other for your Saviour; so when you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to Hear and Obey him as the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
and King of the Church, it is implied that
you Hear and Obey no other as such: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give to no other any of the Prerogatives of
Christ, and ascribe nothing to Man's Law which
is proper to his, which you confess to make a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is: Lest your hear, <hi>In vain do they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
me, teaching for Doctrine the Traditions of
Men:</hi> If it be Sin, it is worse than Suffering. Do
you think Worshiping in the high Places, was
worse than this?</p>
               <p>§ 14. You plead the Law of Nature, even
Mercy to the Magistrate's Soul, to keep him from
Silencing and Persecuting; and to the Peoples
Souls, that they may have good Ministers.] <hi>Ans.</hi>
What then? If the Cross be lawful to be used as
prescribed, then no doubt I should use it. If it
be not, must I sin when the Magistrate bids me
to save him from Persecuting me? The Martyrs
might so have saved <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> by a
Lye: But this is no saving them: For if they
First draw me to Sin, endanger my Soul, and
would Silence me, or destroy my Body if I did
not; this doth increase their Guilt, and not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it. 2. And you may exercise Mercy to the
People, as Ministers did the first 300 Years, in a
Suffering way, and by good Example, better than
by Sin, and consent to corrupt the Ministry and
Church.</p>
               <p>§ 15. You call the Crossing, and such things
<hi>[<q>Trifles and Bawbles, on which weak and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Minds dote, yet wise Parents may please their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60850:35"/>
Children with Bawbles.</q>] Ans.</hi> The Bishops
will be more offended at this, than the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists:
They that cannot allow us the pity due
to weak Children, will not take it well to be told
that we are Fathers, and they the Children whom
we must please with Bawbles.</p>
               <p>And you say, <hi>[<q>The external part of Baptism,
is not so excellent as Prayer or Preaching.</q>] Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Words,</hi> be not matters worth our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
but remember, <hi>Words</hi> are part of Baptism
too; and the Solemnizing the great Vow and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
between God and believing Sinners, on
the terms and to the great ends of Baptism, is a
high transaction of unspeakable Concern: And
it's shame to many that cry out against <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
that they reverence it far less than they.</p>
               <p>§ 16. <hi>But you say,</hi> [<q>We assent not, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not to the Imposing of it.</q>] Ans. <hi>Nor I, and
therefore I will not say that I do. Is not the</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of the Cross expresly in the Book? <hi>And do
you not plead for it openly, declaring that you</hi>
Assent <hi>and</hi> Consent to all things contained in it, and
prescribed by it? <hi>What can be plainer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 17. You say, <hi>[I<q>t's better to do a doubtful
small Evil, than forbear a certain and great
Good.</q>] Ans.</hi> Negatives bind <hi>ad semper,</hi> but
Affirmatives do not. And that which is <hi>Evil</hi> and
<hi>not Good,</hi> is ill called <hi>Better:</hi> No evil must be
done that can be avoided: None that good may
come of it. The Apostles and Pastors of the
three first Ages did good against the will of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.
What if a Man doubt whether a Lye or
Perjury be Sin in such a case? must he therefore
do it that he may Preach without Persecution?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60850:36"/>
It is no Duty to you, much less a greater which you
cannot do, but on condition you will Sin.</p>
               <p>§ 18. <hi>You say that</hi> [<q>Though he that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
is damned if he eat, the case is not like the
using of the Cross, because there is liberty.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I have said so much of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. in my
Treatise of the <hi>Church Called,</hi> that I need not add
much more. The advantage seemeth to me more
on the other side: They that did eat, or forbear,
did it in Conscience to the Will of God, as they
that kept a Day or not. But that Text expresly
commanding even Church-Governors, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to mutual forbearance in such
things; here Conscience towards God is set against
our obeying the supposed unlawful command of
Man, and our escaping Persecution. The <hi>Iews</hi>
then Persecuted those Christians that would not
conform to their Law in Meats and Days, even
to the Death, and more sharply than the <hi>Romans</hi>
did: And they seemed to be Scandalized by them,
to the hindrance of their Conversion. Why then,
was that Case free, and ours of the Cross not
free?</p>

               <p>§ 1. YOur 18th Section is about giving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
to all the Parishioners, thrice a
Year. You say, <hi>It could not be the Churches
meaning to give it to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Darkness is a great advantage to one that
must be hid, or run away; and confusion to one
that must defend an Error. They are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60850:36"/>
parts of our Dissent, 1. That all the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
are enjoined to Communicate thrice a Year.</p>
               <p>2. That we are enjoined to give it (not to all,
but) to more than we can with a safe Conscience.
You prove that there are Limitations to the last;
but that proveth not that they are so to the first.</p>
               <p>Do you think that it will excuse a Man that
Communicates not, to say, [I am not willing to
be Confined,] or [I am out of Charity,] or (I
am a scandalous Sinner,) or (the Church did
suspend me for Scandal, or Contumacy:) If it
will, the <hi>Papists</hi> may save their Estates, or others
called New Recusants at least: But the Law and
Liturgy, and Canon, all shew the contrary: If
they are unfit, it's long of themselves, say they:
And that shall not excuse them from a Gaol.</p>
               <p>You will say, It commandeth them not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
unfit, but to be fit and then receive. <hi>Ans.</hi>
True: But, 1. All the Parish of natural Capacity
are commanded to be fit and then receive, and
punished if they do not, though morally never so
unfit. 2. Fitness is not gotten by bare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
3. There are multitudes unfit, and ought
not in that unfitness to receive, that <hi>the Law</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no hold on for any other Fault; and many
that cannot receive it; much less can the Minister
by the Law keep away. Too many know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be secret Atheists, and more to be Infidels,
or Sadduces, that believe no Life to come: Many
are conscious of secret Fornication, Drunkenness,
Stealing, Deceiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rhe Minister or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is no judge of these: Yet if they Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
not, they break the Rubrick and Law, and
are to be punished. Many hundreds are conscious
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60850:37"/>
of secret unpreparedness, and many timorous ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
People so afraid of eating and drinking Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they dare not come: And many
on many accounts are unwilling; and yet all these
are commanded to come. In a word, No <hi>unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

and yet all such are commanded on great Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to Communicate thrice a Year.</p>

admit to our wrong and theirs; which you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOur 19th Section is for our accusing
those that we refuse to the <hi>Ordinance,</hi>
within fourteen days, that he may proceed against
them according to the Canon. And first you tell
us a strange thing, which were it true, would half
reconcile me to the <hi>English</hi> sort of Prelacy, <hi>viz.
[<q>That the lesser Excommunication out of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregation, seems to be allowed to all
the Parish Ministers.</q>]</hi> Say you so! What a
sleep have I been in these 50 Years, (since I have
been Ordained it's 41 Years) that never could
hear or read of any such thing? I have indeed
read some honest Passages like it, in the <hi>Reformatio
Legum Ecclesiast.</hi> published by <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> which
died before it was born, and only shewed the good
purposes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and his Divines. But
in our Articles, Canons, Liturgies, or Book of
Ordination, I can find no such thing, nor imagine
what could thus deceive you. Nor can I see any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60850:37"/>
such thing in <hi>Cosms</hi>'s Tables, nor in any Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist's
Writings, which describe our Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
What was in Doctor <hi>Mocket's</hi> Book
that was burnt, I know not; By the Execution
done on it, and their hatred of Arch-Bishop <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi>
I should think it was as likely to be there as
any where: But if it were, it is no proof. The
Laws and Authorized Church-Canons and Forms,
must decide the Case. Were there but any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Parish Discipline, I would never quarrel
against Diocesans; Nay, could I but have been
a Pastor, and not a meer Slave, or Executioner of
the will of others, against my Conscience.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>I cannot imagine what you mean, unless
it be that the Canon and Rubrick say, That we
shall not</hi> admit to the Communion, <hi>such</hi> [As be
openly known to live in Sin, notorious, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
nor any who have maliciously and openly
contended with their Neighbours, till they be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled;
nor any that desire not Confirmation.]</p>
               <p>But, 1. Do you take this temporary suspension
of my act of delivering this Man the Sacrament,
to be the <hi>Minor Excommunication,</hi> viz. <hi>our of that
particular Congregation?</hi> You are much mistaken,
as any Bishop or Chancellor can tell you. He is
Member of that Congregation still: You only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend
your own Act, and his Reception, till his
Case be tried and judged by the Chancellor, or
Diocesan, whether he shall be cast out, or not.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, could all our importunity with the
Bishops, have prevailed but for a Power in the
<hi>Parish Minister,</hi> (for Pastor they would not have
been called) to <hi>suspend his own Act, and not give,
or deny the Sacrament against his knowledg and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60850:38"/>
Conscience,</hi> I should not have said much against
Diocesans, nor any reasonable Appeals to them.
But I will tell you what I take our Case to be,
after my long enquiry.</p>
               <p>I. The great Parishes that have many score thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Souls, are such as the Priest (or Incumbent,
I may call him) knoweth not one of a multitude
of his Parishioners. (And Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
Pref.</hi> saith, <hi>A man cannot take charge of, or
answer for the Souls that he knoweth not.)</hi> And
though fame say, That in such a Parish there are
multitudes of Atheists, Infidels, Hobbists, Brutists,
Socinians, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
while they are almost all strangers to the Minister,
he can deny the Sacrament to none of them <hi>pro
tempore.</hi> And how can the Incumbent know in
such Parishes what they are?</p>
               <p>II. If he know a man to be a Papist, if he be
a Church-Papist, or have a dispensation, he cannot
on that account deny him the Sacrament. Yea,
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> in the Life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it his commendable design to have drawn the
Papists into our Churches, (as they were, say some
others, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Reign; and this, say they, is to be a Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
Protestant, to be one that will communicate
with the Papists in our Liturgy.) But many good
Ministers dare not give the Sacrament to a Papist,
till he repent and renounce the Papal Universal
Government, and their grossest corruptions.</p>
               <p>III. If the Minister know any man to be an
Adulterer, Fornicator, Drunkard, or Heretick, or
Infidel, by private conference, confession, or other
notice, and cannot prove it, he must give him the
Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60850:38"/>
IV. If he (that converseth not with one of an
hundred himself; and can know them but by
hear-say) shall hear a neighbour or two, or ten,
report that such a one is taken by those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with him to be an Heretick, Atheist, Infidel,
Scorner at Christ and Scripture, a Fornicator,
Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he cannot deny him the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unless the reporters will stand to it as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
And it's known, 1. That few that can
prove it will tell it the Minister. 2. Good people
that hear it, cannot prove it. 3. Those that can
prove it, and privately tell it, will not trouble
themselves, and offend their neighbours, by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
it openly. What need we more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience?
Do not your Books and Complaints
tell us, that not only Coffee-houses and Taverns,
but other places are witnesses of abounding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,
Infidelity, or Sadduceism; and that our
Parishes have great numbers of them? And how
many such have you known in <hi>London</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
or openly suspended? And are not
the <hi>London</hi> Ministers able good men, that would
do it if they could? Ask them why it's never
done. If you say, that such come not, but excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
themselves: I answer, 1. Are they not
still members of the Parish-Church? 2. How doth
the Minister know that they come not, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
very few of his Parishoners? 3. It's known
by their acquaintance, that such ordinarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
so far as to satisfie the Law. For what
should hinder them when it is their interest?</p>
               <p>V. If the Minister should have private proof
against one Atheist of forty; or one Drunkard or
Fornicator of many, if he cannot get his witnesses
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60850:39"/>
to travel far, and for nothing become odious to
the accused, to attest it before the Chancellor or
Bishop, the Minister must give him the Sacrament
after he is acquit by the Court for want of
proof.</p>
               <p>VI. If proof be brought, and the Proctors fail
managing it, or the Chancellor favour the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
or the man resolve before he goeth [I will
say, I repent, and then deny me the Sacrament if
you dare,] or if his saying he repenteth, satisfie the
Judge that knoweth him not, while the Minister
that is his neighbour heareth no sign of it; but
contrarily of his malice against him for accusing
him, he must still give him the Sacrament, if the
Chancellor acquits him.</p>
               <p>VII. Nay, if he be excommunicated first, and
by friends, fees, or saying I repent, get the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's
Absolution, he must be received to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
though the Minister see not the least sign
of his repentance, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>VIII. If Ignorance be so common in the Parish,
that we have reason to judge that of twenty or
thirty thousand Parishioners (more or fewer) one
half of them understand not the very Essentials of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and of the Sacrament; yet the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
must refuse none. I that have but three ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
can seldom have all three such as with my
plain teaching will be brought while they are
with me, to understand all the Essentials, and be
capable of the Sacrament. And though in general
experience telleth us of the great numbers of such,
yet the Minister cannot know them. He that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not their faces, much less ever catechized half.
And commonly children and ignorant people will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60850:39"/>
say the words of the Creed and Lord's Prayer,
when they are grosly ignorant of the sense. 2. And
if the Minister know such an one to be so grosly
ignorant, the Law giveth him not power to deny
him the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>IX. How should the Minister have power to
excommunicate one out of a particular Church,
when his Parish is not a particular Church, but a
part of a Diocesan Church only? It's known,
now it is maintained by Bishops, That the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san
is the particular Church; That it is no Church
that hath not a Bishop of its own: That <hi>Ecclesia
est plebs Episcopo adunata;</hi> and therefore the name
of Pastor is usually appropriated to the Bishop; and
in most places of the Liturgy where <hi>Bishops, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi>
and <hi>Curates</hi> were joyntly named, one of the
two first is put out of the New Book, and only
Bishops and Curates, or Pastors and Curates men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
And who can cast out of a Church, that
is no Church in the Rulers sense?</p>
               <p>X. I have had many Parishioners that have
made me know that they take me for none of their
Pastor, nor will do; nor themselves for any of my
Flock; and yet to satisfie the Law, or fame, or
humour, they will demand the Sacrament. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
cannot refuse such a one, but must do the
one part of a Pastor's Office to them that disclaim
the relation.</p>
               <p>XI. If I upon strong suspicion of gross Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
would desire my neighbours (aged or
young) to come and speak with me, and would
try them and instruct them; or if I desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with them on a just private suspicion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
or Atheism, or accusation or fame of wicked
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60850:40"/>
living; and if they refuse to speak with me, or
give me any answer or account, but shut their
doors against me, and bid me meddle with my
own business, I have no power to refuse them
the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>XII. I have known many persons, that for fear
of being guilty of the body and blood of Christ,
would be in danger of desperation or distraction,
should they receive it: Yet if, for fear of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
such unwilling ones come, I must
give it them. And I know too many that let me
know, that though they will have the Sacrament,
they do not consent to the Essentials of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Covenant, but think Christ's terms too
hard (till they have sinned longer;) yet these
must I admit to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>XIII. On the other side, I must give it none
that dare not take it kneeling, nor any that think
Conformity unlawful, nor that the Canon calleth
Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>XIV. I must give it to none of the most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of my Flock, whom the Bishop or Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
will excommunicate, if it be but for not
paying fees, or not appearing at his Court.</p>
               <p>XV. The Priest must publish the Chancellor's
or Bishop's Excommunication, if against the most
conscionable of his Flock.</p>
               <p>XVI. And he must publish the Chancellor's or
Bishop's Absolution, though he know the party to
be most unworthy.</p>
               <p>XVII. He hath no power to judge whom to
take into the Church by Baptism, but must Baptize
any Child of Atheists, Brutists, Heathens, Infidels
or Hereticks, that have but God-fathers, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60850:40"/>
take them for their own, though his conscience
be against it, as is aforesaid.</p>
               <p>XVIII. He hath no power to forbear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Absolution from all sin in absolute terms,
to any sick man that will say he repenteth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it, though by never so much evidence the
Priest judge it to be either counterfeit, or from
meer attrition or fear, without love.</p>
               <p>XIX. I have proved that he hath no power to
forbear pronouncing all Atheists, Infidels, Brutists,
Adulterers, Drunkards, worldlings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saved, at
their Burial, except the unbaptized, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and self-murderers.</p>
               <p>XX. In a word, the Priest is so far from having
the power of excommunicating out of a particular
Church, that he hath no power to do the necessary
previous acts. 1. If he would tell him his fault
privately, the sinner may refuse to speak with him,
as is said. 2. If he would take two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
he may refuse yet to speak with him, or hear
him. 3. If he would tell the Church where he
hath Communion, and would publickly admonish
him before them all, and pray for him by name,
that he may repent, he doth more than he can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and the man may have his Action against
him accordingly at Law.</p>
               <p>XXI. If a Minister will prosecute at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Court all that he hath cause to keep from
the Sacrament (as he must do within fourteen
daies) 1. It will take him off all his Ministerial
studies almost, in many great and wicked Parishes.
It will be work enough to travel long journeys as
an Informer. 2. It will spend all his Benefice, in
the charge of journeys, Proctors, and bringing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60850:41"/>
so far. 3. He shall but get the hatred of
sinners, and never be like more to do them good:
Whereas, had he power to use true Pastoral Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
with them, his love and tenderness might
possibly melt them into repentance, which a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's
Court, so like a Civil Judicature, and putting
them to great expences and danger, is unlike to
do. Nor did I ever in my whole life know one
sinner brought to Repentance seemingly serious,
by their Courts.</p>
               <p>XXII. To conclude, If the Minister have
power to keep any from the Sacrament for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
daies, till he prosecute them, they will as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
have all other Communion with that Church
even in Prayer, Praise and Thanksgiving, and the
Baptizing of his Child, <hi>&amp;c. Albaspineus</hi> (that great
and notable describer of the Churches Customs)
tells us, that the Old Excommunication did shut
them out of all other Church-Communion, as well
as the Sacrament; even their oblations were not
accepted.</p>
               <p>If I understand the Case of the Parish-Priests,
and their Power of Discipline, this is it. And is
this the Power of the Keys or Excommunication?</p>
               <p>If you ask me, How I would have all this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;
I have oft enough answered it, and will not
here repeat it. Only I would have a Minister have
some such freedom as a School-master or Philosopher
hath in his School; and not a meer slave or Agent
of others, to take in and use, and exclude and say,
as strangers to the Flock command him, against his
conscience and knowledge of the Case; till it be
proved, that it shall justifie him at judgment for
all such actions, to say, The Law, Bishop or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
commanded me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60850:41"/>
§ 2. You tell us as by your many Years Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that private repelling by Counsel and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
may serve with most. And 1. I wonder
that you that had but a small Country Chappel
and no Church at all, where near Neighbours
might easily be spoken with, should talk of your
Experience as an argument against that which is of
notorious matter of Fact. 1. Shew me where
Law, Canon, or Rubrick, giveth power to the
Priest to refuse a Parishioner that saith, [I take you
not for my Pastor, nor to have any authority
over me, but as the Bishop's Curate, to do what
the Law bids you, and I will not speak with
you.] 2. Do you not now dwell in <hi>London?</hi>
where Parishes are so great that the Parson can
do no such thing on one of a Multitude, nor doth
so much as know them? And know you not that
<hi>de facto,</hi> there are Multitudes that will refuse, and
scorn to give you any account, or hear you, or
come to you, or admit you to any such discourse
with them? I had the most obedient tractable
People to deal with that ever I knew: And yet I
had some that attempted by present violence to
Murder me, for Admonishing them, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them the Sacrament; and many that would
give me no other account of themselves, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of me to deliver them the Sacrament as the
Canon and Liturgy order it, whenever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at Church and require it: Hundreds and
Thousands will stoop to no other Terms in the
great Parishes of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. I confess, if ever I had been thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
under our Prelates, and had thought my
self able (as I do not) for the care of some of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60850:43"/>
the smaller Parishes, I should have most trusted
to the New Liturgy for my power to keep away
some of the grosly Ignorant <hi>[as being not ready to
be Confirmed,]</hi> because they know not the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism.
But now I perceive by you, this were not
like to serve my turn; for you say, [It is only for
those that <hi>never yet Communicated,]</hi> when as mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of the Aged are grosly ignorant of the
Essentials that have long Communicated. 2. And
divers of these grosly ignorant Persons are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
long ago. Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> was one of the
Learnedst and best Bishops, that ever I knew:
And when I was fourteen or fifteen Years old, I
and my School-fellows, and abundance of Boys
and Girls, when he came into the Country, went
as to some Spectacle, and without any certificate,
or question to us, or instruction of us, we all
kneeled in a long row in a Church-yard, in the
Path-way, and as he went by, he laid his Hands
on every one, and huddled over a short Collect,
of which I scarce understood one sentence that he
said; and I was never the wiser, nor fitter for the
Sacrament that I perceived.</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>But you say, that</hi> [The Order binds to a
Repelling by publick Admonition and Church Power
notifying to the Congregation, such a Man's Crimes
and Scandals, as a Fornicator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and warn him
not to come to the Sacrament, till he have made
open confession of his Sins, and reformed his Life.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What <hi>Order</hi> is it that <hi>binds us to this?</hi> If
you mean <hi>Christ's Order,</hi> we must do it: If you
mean the Churches, where shall we find it? This
is like the Rubrick new Article of Faith, which
will Silence us all who are not <hi>certain by God's
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60850:43"/>
Word,</hi> that Baptized Infants (without exception)
are <hi>undoubtedly saved;</hi> and yet that Charity was
wanting that should but once have cited the Text
that maketh it <hi>undoubtedly certain.</hi> A short labour
for so great an End. So when you might know
how very far it would go to reconcile me to our
Prelacy, could I but prove what here you say, yet
you will not so much as tell me where to find it:
Nay, if you that have studied the Law, would
but have told me how to escape, when I am accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for doing it.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>But your next is too apt to provoke
Laughter, viz.</hi> [<q>Suppose you honestly tell the
Ordinary, that the uncapable are too many to
be presented, lest Violence make them worse, and
Excommunicating them signifie nothing, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
them to rise in Rebellion, or Mutiny, and
turn you and us out of Place <hi>(that reason is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable)</hi>
or quite leave our Assemblies, and turn
<hi>Quakers, Papists, Infidels,</hi> and precipitate Souls
to Hell by Obstinacy and Viciousness: But if you
will leave it to me, I will Christen their Children
and keep them within the Church; <hi>(Is that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
them?)</hi> as Hearers, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Candidates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do I not then honestly
perform the Law?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Your honesty I shall commend. And
Christ's Law you may much perform. But
what Law of the Church is it that you thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form?
What is the Law that giveth you any such
power? What Law forbids it you, I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Let the Rejected sue you, and let the Judges
tell you, whether you have kept the Law: The
issue will answer you better than I can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60850:42"/>
                  <hi>But you say,</hi> It is the Intention of the Law that
you perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You have proved me also, and all of us,
Conformists, before we were aware. The <hi>end of
the Law is to edifie and save Men, and to prefer
Mercy before Sacrifice: But all this I do, or endeavour
in my Preaching, Dwelling, and Practice:</hi> Ergo,
<hi>I am a Conformist, and perform the Law.</hi> But that
did not keep me out of the common Gaol, nor
save my Library. And must we be punished for
Conforming? Break the Law and Canon, and say
you did it in Mercy and kept it, and try whether
you will pass for a Conformist? Did you not thus
keep the end of the Law when you Preacht at
<hi>Warrington?</hi> and did your Excommunicators call it
Conformity?</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>But you say,</hi> All that are accused are not
Excommunicate, nor laid in Gaols; it is to be hoped
that the Ordinary will do them Iustice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As they did you. 2. They may escape
the Gaol by flying their Country, as you do: But
what shall they do with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
3. But we grant you all this: If 500 in
a great Parish should be accused by the Minister
as uncapable of the Sacrament by gross Ignorance,
Infidelity, Heresie, or Crimes, and as you say, they
be not Excommunicate; when they come home
acquit, the Minister must give them the Sacrament
the next time. 4. But our question is not what
the <hi>Ordinary will do,</hi> but what the Law and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
bind him and you to do?</p>

the Pastor better govern one Parish, than one Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
can many Scores, or Hundreds? 3. Some
give Lay-Elders only a part of the Magistrates
work, and some only to be Delegates for the People
to do but what they may do, who cannot be oft
present, and to be occasional Arbitrators; and some
that give them any use of the Keys, take them not
for Lay-men, but Ministers separated to that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Office?</p>
               <p>§ 2. You tell us of thirteen parts of Discipline
among us: To which I said enough before. 1. No
Atheists, Infidels, or Pagans then must be refused
Baptism, if communicating God-Fathers (how
bad soever) present him who never take him for
their own, and we doubt can neither give or prove
his Title: And that we are disabled to keep the
unworthy from the Communion, I have proved;
and the Excellent, Learned, Pious, Parish Priests
of <hi>London,</hi> tell you by Practice.</p>
               <p>2. Few Communicants are Confirmed, and
Sacramental Capacity is not required to Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And if it be not used, or worse, by Bishops

who only have the power, what satisfaction is that
to the Parish Priest and Church?</p>
               <p>3. There is no sufficient means to Convict, and
keep away scandalous Sinners.</p>
               <p>4. The Sinner hath power to forbid you pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Admonition by refusing to speak with you,
or come near you.</p>
               <p>5. What is Family Power to the Church? We
thank you for nothing. But were not Parents
formerly disabled from keeping Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
from spending much of the Lord's Day in
Dancing? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doth not the Canon yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them from bringing them to hear a Sermon
at the next Parish Church, when they have none
at Home?</p>
               <p>6. The Lawyers that I speak with, take all for
meer Falshood that you say of the Priests power, of
publick admonition of sinners by name, not censured
by the Ordinary. You say, Where is it forbidden?
I ask you, Where is the Priest authorized to do
it? If not, the Man will have his Action against
him, and Ruine him; and the Bishop may suspend
him for Usurpation. And, 2. Of all the worthy
Parish Incumbents in <hi>London,</hi> who did you ever
hear once do it? I never one heard one do it, nor
heard of one that did it in my life, except a Non-conformist,
or a hot Parson point at a Puritan in
the Church for some Non-conformity in a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Reverse then your charge of Hypocrisie,
if you find it must fall on all the worthy <hi>London</hi>
Incumbents: For they <hi>all</hi> speak for Discipline,
though not for more.</p>
               <p>7. If there be half as many bad Ministers as
the Country saith there is, it's a small honour to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60850:45"/>
the Church, to reproach the Fathers that admit
them as sinning against Church, Law, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
and a small relief to Peoples Souls to tell
that some Body had power to have provided bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But the People had no such power, to save
themselves from a bad one; though the Church
for 700, if not more Years, took him to be no
Bishop but an Usurper, that came not in by the
consent of the Flock, and election of the Clergy,
of which more elsewhere.</p>
               <p>8. Do or can Bishops by Visitations know the
People and their Cases of a thousand, or many
hundred Parishes, so as to hear and judge them?
Would they not have ten thousand scandalous
Sinners sometime to try and exhort to Repentance
in one, or few Days?</p>
               <p>9. and 10. We are glad that the old prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Afternoon Sermons and Lectures, are not
yet revived: But how few Parishes have such
Lectures comparatively? and how few have Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing?
And they that have none, may not
go to another: If you think that it will save the
Peoples Souls, that the Priest might have instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them if he could and would, and that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
should have made him do it, I dissent.</p>
               <p>11. I have seen no Visitation Articles of late,
but in the old ones of 1634, 1635, 36, 37, 38,
39. the Church-wardens were to swear to persecute
Men for so many things which they thought their
Duty (as the foresaid going from a Non-preaching
Minister, keeping private Fasts, and such like) that
many Men that feared an Oath and Persecution,
suffered because they durst not be Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:60850:46"/>
12. I confess more manners of Church-censures
are in use among us, than we desire. The Canons
will tell them to you: Else so many hundred Non-Conformists
formerly and lately had not been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to Preach, nor all forbid to admit Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Christians to Communion; nor had they
been <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicate (though <hi>Ant. de
Dom. Spalatensis</hi> say so much to make odious all
excommunicating <hi>ipso facto</hi> (who, they say, first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
the name of a Doctrinal Penitence.) And
Bishop <hi>Ier. Taylor</hi> saith so much against it.</p>
               <p>And I confess that there is the Magistrate's
sword to back all this; by which about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of us were silenced, and you fly out of your
Country from the Writ <hi>de excommunicato capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. My belief of your unfeigned honesty makes
one at last <hi>pity</hi> you, and <hi>wonder</hi> when you add
<hi>[What more would you have?]</hi> what it was that
could tempt you to contract the guilt of defending
things of such publick and sad an Aspect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
against such light, and after such experience
of the effects, and in such a time! 1. Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in your conscience, that the Bishop of <hi>York,
Norwich, Lincoln, London,</hi> or the rest, with a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
and his Officials and Arch-Deacons, can
possibly exercise that Discipline, or the hundredth
part of it, which Christ hath appointed, were
they never so honest? 2. Do you believe that a
Lay-Chancellor, who you confess hath not the
power of the Keys, doth or can well execute them?
3. Do you not know how little of the Parish-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
against scandals is exercised by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
and how almost is done by this Chancellor
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60850:46"/>
and Officials? 4. Do you not know how unlike
their Courts are to fit a sinner for absolution by
true Repetance? 5. Did you ever in your life
know a sinner brought to a repentance seemingly
unfeigned by them? 6. Did you ever hear such
worthy men of greatest honesty and Learning as
Dr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sharp,</hi>
&amp;c. name any in the Pulpit or Church by way
of publick admonition and invitation to repentance,
who was not first censured by the Ordinary?
7. Do you think none of them would do it, if they
thought it a duty, and the lawful and safe way of
Discipline? 8. Do you think their Parishes have
no scores or hundreds of Brutists, Atheists, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Fornicators, or other scandalous sinners?
9. Do you think they can possibly know any
thing of their peoples gross Ignorance, Infidelity,
Atheism, yea, or Scandal, who can know so few
of the persons? (much less can the Bishop.) 10. Do
you think that it is exercise enough of this Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
when about 5000 in a year only commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to leave 20000 or 30000 more, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church in that Parish, that use not to
communicate, or else may come when they will
extraordinarily to save them from the Law, though
utterly unknown to the Minister? (And so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
in Parishes half as big.) And how is
it possible this can be amended <hi>rebus sic stantibus?</hi>
And would not so many good men amend it, were
it possible? Oh draw not the guilt of so many and
such things on your self without cause! Were it
as small a thing as the <hi>Israelites High Places,</hi> if you
cannot amend it, do not become the open defender
of it. <hi>Iudas</hi> himself at last accused the Pharisees
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60850:47"/>
and High Priests, and justified Christ. I do not
think he would have written a Confutation of
Christ's reproofs, recited in <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. and 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
How can you pray for a Reformation of that
which you think needeth none? And hath the
Church and Cause of holy Discipline lost so much
of your prayers too? If you say to God, as you do
to us, <hi>[What more would we have?]</hi> I am glad
that God hath a firmer people that will pray for
more.</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>You say</hi> [As to the Chancellor and his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
it is less matter by whom Excommunication
be done, so it be honestly and soundly done. He is a
Christian, he is a man of Knowledge and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
he is authorized by the Laws of the Kingdom;
his Office is incorporate into the Government of the
Nation. Though he may not bind and loose as a
Pastor, he may as a Christian, authorized by the
King. <hi>See</hi> Matth. 18. 15, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a great business. 1. Why said you
before, that the Power of the Keys belongs to the
Pastors, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> But you meant <hi>[not only to them.]</hi>
2. Is it the same sort of Excommunication and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
which belongs to the Pastor and to a Lay-man?
If not, you say nothing to our business. For
our Laws, Canons and Church pretend here no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
I confess that there are three acts of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
which the Magistrate may do. 1. He, may
command Bishops and Pastors to do their Office
faithfully in excommunicating notorious impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
criminals. 2. When they are excommunicated,
he may forbid them intruding into the Church.
3. He may judge the flagitious to be stigmatized,
or be taken as out-lawed, and forbid men to be
familiar with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60850:47"/>
But the Power of the Church is a power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what individual persons are fit or unfit for
Baptism, the Eucharist, Church Entrance, and
Church Communion, is the Church is the Porch
of Heaven, and as a preparation to the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And it is not another sort, but this sort
which the Lay-Chancellor pretendeth to exercise
in the Bishop's name.</p>
               <p>I have been thought by some to give my self
too much to Magistrates in Church-matters: But I
am far from your mind, for the reasons following.</p>
               <p>1. It is notorious, that in Scripture Christ hath
instituted a special Office to use these Keys, and do
this work, which he would not have done, had he
left it common to any others.</p>
               <p>2. The Power of the Keys is so much of the
essential comprehensive title of that Office, as that
it is nullified when it is made common.</p>
               <p>3. If this part may be done by the Lay-men or
Magistrate, no man can give a reason why any of
the rest may not, even not only to be the stated
Teachers of the Church, and their Guides in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but also Baptizing and administring the
Lord's Supper. As it is more to be the Law-makers
than the Cryers, and the Judge, than the Marshal;
so it is more to decree who shall have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than barely to deliver it them, which the
Deacon may do. And so we shall have not only
Lay-Baptizers, but Lay-Preachers, Lay-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Lord's Supper, or by contradiction,
<hi>Lay-Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. You plead for Conformity, and may easily
know that the Church of <hi>England</hi> abhorreth this
Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60850:48"/>
5. When King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was called
<hi>Head of the Church,</hi> to avoid the Papists calumnies,
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> have published
their disclaiming of that power of Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
called that of the Keys; and if my Ears
deceived me not, I have heard our present King
profess the same.</p>
               <p>6. The judgment and practice of the Churches
of all Ages and places since Christ, is against you; I
think <hi>Helvetia</hi> it self not excepted. And should
this be nothing to you, who call on us to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Old Conformists?</p>
               <p>7. The reason of the Institution fully satisfies
me. It was not meet so great a trust should be
placed in unfit men: As in case of Ordination, it
must be men that are able to try the persons, as to
skill and life, that must be trusted with so weighty
a business; and also such that can have leisure to
attend it; and therefore as an Office are empower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it, and separated to it, lest it miscarry; so
as to Baptism, Absolution, Excommunication, it
must be done by men, 1. That are capable of
full acquaintance with the person, witnesses and
cause. 2. And that can try and judge of it. 3. And
especially of the persons <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance;</hi> (for
it is on these that the sentence must pass:) No Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
without Faith: No Excommunication with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obstinate Impenitence: No Absolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Repentance.) 4. It must be by men fit to
exhort them to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and confute
their Errours, and pray for them that God would
give them Faith and Repentance. 5. And it is so
great a part of the world, and all the Church of
Christ, that this, or much of this must be done for,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60850:48"/>
that reason shewed it needful, that it be made the
work of a great and special Office. And if so,
then those men that do it, 1. Must be tryed as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Ministers be: 2. And Ordained to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of doing it: 3. And profess to do it as such
Officers: 4. And not lacerate that Office, and
change it, by taking a part of it, and leaving the
rest: And so they must be no Lay-men.</p>
               <p>I could with that you had studied and consulted
better, before with such more than <hi>Erastian</hi> singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
you had pleaded for so dangerous a thing
as Church-Levelling, or so much overthrow of the
necessary sacred Office, and set your self against
the judgment and practice of the Christian Church.
But all men have their hour of temptation; and
all do not overcome.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>You say,</hi> The Excommunication is of no
force till published by the Parish-Minister, who hath
power, if he please, to make it his Text, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the nature, use and ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I had rather have a better Text. 2. It
is of force if another publish it. 3. It's part of
the true Charge of the Minister himself, and will,
trusting another with it, discharge him. 4. We
fear being guilty of the Lay-man's Usurpation,
and the Church-Confusion. 5. But worst of all, it
is people fearing God that the Canon excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> and that the Chancellor is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.
Had it been my duty to pronounce
you excommunicate, because the Chancellor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
it? 6. Where you say, <hi>If I know the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to be void, unjust and illegal, I am not to
publish it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Well set together. But if you know it to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60850:49"/>
be <hi>unjust,</hi> and yet <hi>legal,</hi> according to the Canon,
you must publish it, or be a Non-Conformist,
and may be suspended: And are all the Canons
Decrees just?</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Printers Errors indeed are not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
nor the Books as made by them: Did
I instance in any of them. But if Translators
Errors also be excepted, our difficulty of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Imposition still increaseth. Then it
seems as to the Psalms, Epistles and Gospels, we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60850:51"/>
Assent and Consent only to the Original Text,
and so much as we judge well Translated. I
thought it the Book by ill Translation had grosly
contradicted, or depraved the Scripture, it had
been one of the worst sort of Errors. I told you
where it directly contradicteth the Text. What
Heresie may not be brought in by a false Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
We thank God for the worst, as a great
Mercy to the Church; and by them that will not
receive a better in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> we are thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to justifie even that which was worst, lest
they should be thought to have needed any
amendment. And you make your self their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor
without their Authority, and tell us that
the intent of the Book is not to bind us to approve
the Errors of Translators: And I believe you as
the Book is distinguished from the Authors, and
so hath no intent at all. But if the Translaton
hath done, as <hi>Heylin</hi> saith the King's Printer did,
that put <hi>[Thou shalt commit Adultery,]</hi> for <hi>[Thou
shalt not,]</hi> and I were commanded to approve of
<hi>all things contained in the Book;</hi> whatever you
shall say or do, I would have done as <hi>Iohn Fox</hi>
the Martyrologist did, saith <hi>Heylin,</hi> who brought
a <hi>Greek</hi> Testament (supposing the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> old
Testament) and said to them, <hi>[I am ready to
subscribe this: If that will not serve your turn, take
my Prebendship of</hi> Salisbury, <hi>which is all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
that ever I had of you, and much good
may it do you.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. And you tell us without proof, that when
at <hi>Christmas</hi> we are bid say <hi>[As on this day
Christ was born]</hi> for divers Days, it intends not
that we shall use the words <hi>[this Day,]</hi> but on
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60850:51"/>
one Day (and so at <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> &amp;c.) That is,
It expresly imposeth the very words that we shall
read, forbidding us by the Canon to alter or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish,
and yet it meaneth not that we should use
them. May you not then say what you list,
which you think should have been commanded
you, and suppose it the meaning of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
You say, <hi>This is but a favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:</hi>
You should have said truly, <hi>[It was
their oversight, which if they had seen they had
amended.]</hi> And I do not say that they meant
amiss: But if they speak amiss, and our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prelates that are <hi>Servi servorum Dei,</hi> come
after them, and command me on pain of Silence
to <hi>Assent, Consent</hi> to, and <hi>Approve</hi> the <hi>words,</hi>
they shall take my Liberty and Life if they will;
but I will not <hi>Approve</hi> them. It is <hi>all things</hi> in
the <hi>Book</hi> that <hi>we</hi> must <hi>Consent to,</hi> whatever was
in their Minds. If they bid me Approve the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>[Christ's Body and Blood is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
under the forms of Bread and Wine,]</hi> and
mean as well by it as <hi>Cousins, Heylin,</hi> &amp;c. did, I
will not Approve it, though you should. Though
<hi>Luther de Conciliis, &amp; Dav. Derodon</hi> say, that
<hi>Nestorius</hi> meant soundly, yet the Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him for a Heretick, and owned not his
words, whatever he meant.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>But you say,</hi> [It is not that the old Book
was faultless, but that They were fully persuaded in
their judgments that it was so.]</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>You think this but a</hi> [favourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation]
<hi>too. But by your leave,</hi> [If they had
said that we are fully persuaded in our judgment,
that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath nothing contrary to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60850:52"/>
the Word of God,] <hi>and then required me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my</hi> Assent <hi>and</hi> Consent to all things contained
in that Book, <hi>I should not have done it. If you
understand the words so, others will not.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOu next undertake to prove, that the Act
of Uniformity is no part of the Book to
be Consented to. The Contents say it is: You
say it is not. Are these Contents part of the
Book? If so, Then they are false: If not, How
shall we know what is or is not part of the Book?
Your Proofs are no Proofs.</p>
               <p>1. You say, <hi>The Act it self nameth the Book
as distinct from the Law. Ans.</hi> And what then?
No more followeth but that the word <hi>[Book]</hi> is
sometime taken in the full sense, and sometime
more narrowly. So the Body is oft distinguished
from the Head, and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> from the <hi>King:</hi>
Will you therefore infer that the <hi>Head</hi> is no part
of the <hi>Body,</hi> nor the King of the Kingdom, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken? The <hi>Preface</hi> is usually distinguished
from the Book, and so is the <hi>Index,</hi> or <hi>Contents,
Margin, Title,</hi> &amp;c. And yet Preface, Index, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
Title, Margin of the Book, are all parts
of the Book. Your second Proof is of the same sort.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Your third saith, <hi>The Book must rather</hi>
(if either) <hi>be a part of the Act, because it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</hi>
Would you by this rate of Argument
convince us? Is the Book part of the <hi>Preface,</hi> or
<hi>Contents,</hi> or <hi>Index,</hi> if <hi>these go first?</hi> Is the House
part of the Porch, or the Porch part of the House?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60850:52"/>
Is the Body part of the Head? or the Kingdom
part of the King? or the Family part of the
Porter?</p>
               <p>But you say, <hi>It is absurd to say that the thing
to which the Appendix is annexed, is part of the
Appendix.</hi> It is so; therefore say not so your self.
But is not the <hi>Appendix part of the Book?</hi> And
doth the Acts, being placed first, make it no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix?
And were it put in the end, were it
not the same thing?</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Your Fourth is no better,</hi> viz. [<q>The Old
Act of Uniformity is a declared part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
and bound up with the Book; and if this
be part, we must subscribe contradictions, to use
two Common-Prayer-Books.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Is that old Act, the old Book? Is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to that Act, subscribing to the old Book?
Why obtrude you on us such things unproved?
2. Do you not know that the New Act not only
confirmeth the Old, but also altereth the sense of
it, and tells you that henceforth it shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
as meaning this New Book? And as
Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> truly tells you, Laws are not the
Laws of the dead, but of the living, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
give them what sense they please. And yet
shall so sober a man tell us, That subscribing the
Old Act, is subscribing the Old Book? I begin
to be weary answering such reasonings as these.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Your fifth and sixth Reasons are from the
general sense and opinion of all Divines, as for
you: And you say, <hi>Never any to this day did
think that the 36th Canon and Subscription includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You now practice what you plead for.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60850:53"/>
Can you tell what every Subscriber to this day
thought? He is yet living that at the <hi>Savoy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to prove it an Act of Mercy to them to
put all from the Sacrament that did not receive
it kneeling. And you know that All the Bishops
in the Lords House had their part in making that
Act of Uniformity, with all its penalties. And as
certainly they did consent to the making and
imposing of it; so what should make you sure
that they never meant (no not one of them) that
any others should be bound to the same, when
they put it into the Book, and put in the words
<hi>[All things contained]</hi> and when it is so natural
to such men to desire that all men approve of
what they do? I should think it ten to one,
that they that think it their duty to do such a
thing, as the silencing of two thousand Ministers
on those terms (or five thousand if they had not
conformed,) will be very much concerned to
have their act approved: And that they that will
not endure us to speak in the praying Desk, or
at either Sacrament to God in any one word
but what they write down for us to say, are
likely to desire that we may be also bound to
approve of their Sanctions of this Law. But I
am sure you speak that which you know not to
be true.</p>
               <p>§ 5. To your Seventh I answer, What would
have plainer than the express Assertion of the
Contents themselves?</p>
               <p>§ 6. In your Eighth you say, <hi>[<q>Many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
men think Nothing in the Book is to be
assented to, but what is ordinarily to be read,
and the Ceremonies to be used.</q>] Ans.</hi> Put this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60850:53"/>
down then as one point of our Nonconformity,
which deserveth silencing; and ruine that, when we
cannot profess to <hi>[<q>Assent and Consent to all
things contained and prescribed in the Book</q>]</hi>
and mean by <hi>[All things,</hi> only the Ceremonies,
and so much as is ordinarily to be <hi>read.]</hi> But
again, teach not Papists to expound the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy at this rate.</p>
               <p>§ 7. You say, 1. That the Title is no part of
an Act of Parliament. 2. Nor any but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory
is part of a Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But you might have known that we will
not believe you: Why then should you thus put
us off with your bare word? Though the word
<hi>[Law]</hi> (as all words) be equivocally oft used, and
taken for the chief part, yet as properly taken,
and pertinently to our question, we will yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
whatever you say, 1. That the prefatory
Reasons, and the penal and premiant Sanctions,
are parts of the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Law.</hi> 2. Yea, that the
Title is part of the Act, if it be made and prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and promulgate with it by the Legislators.</p>
               <p>But I will tell you how you may know: If
you openly deprave all the rest of the Law or
Book, and some one indict you for it, the Judge
may satisfie you better than I can.</p>
               <p>§ 8. But you are never so confident as where
you are most overseen. You say, <hi>Our strongest
reason from the Contents doth most strongly confute
it self.</hi> This <hi>Title</hi> is not only part of your proof,
but <hi>all</hi> that I can see. For that which you take
for your proof, that <hi>[Then the Old Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and consequently two Books, are consented
to, and our Governours speak non-sense]</hi> is either
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60850:54"/>
worse than <hi>non-sense,</hi> or I understand not sense
from non-sense. I have called before for your
proof, that <hi>[Two Acts are two Common-Prayer-Books]</hi>
when the latter establisheth the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
as binding only to the New Book! The
words are <q>
                     <hi>[Be it enacted—That the several good
Laws and Statutes of this Realm, which have
been formerly made, and are now in force for the
Uniformity of Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall stand in full
force and strength, to all intents and purposes
whatsoever, for the establishing and confirming of
the said Book entitled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>herein before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and shall be applyed, practised, and put in use
for the punishing of all offences contrary to the
said Laws, with relation to the Book aforesaid,
and no other.]</hi>
                  </q> And they have caused the Act of
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to be bound with this Book, as it was
with the Old: And doth this infer <hi>two Books</hi>
from <hi>two Acts,</hi> &amp;c? Alas Brother! that we should
trouble and wrong the world at this rate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised
confidence. This old Canonical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
is also continued; and yet it is here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
that it shall mean only this New Book, and
no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You add,</hi> If the Printer, or any other through
oversight bind up the Apocrypha, and put in the
Contents of the Holy Bible, is it a part of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is not the Printer's act, but the Law-maker's
that we have to do with.</p>
               <p>2. If the Law-maker cause the Printer to put
the Apocrypha in the Bible, and call it a part of
it in the Contents, I will say that he declareth it
to be a part, though I believe him not. And I
will call God's Word his Word, if <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60850:54"/>
be bound with it; and I will subscribe to God's
Word. But if the Law-maker bind other Books
with it, and in the Contents call them part of the
Book, and then bid me declare Assent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to all things in that Book, I will not obey
him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ABout declaring it</hi> unlawful, on any pretence
whatsoever, to take Arms by the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
against any Commissioned by him.</p>
               <p>§ 1. Here you will prove (in your proving
way) that it meaneth only <hi>[against such as be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and legally commissioned in the due pursuance of
their Commission.]</hi> Before I answer you, I will
give you my reasons for the contrary.</p>
               <p>1. The Act of <hi>Militia</hi> seemeth to me to give
another sense of the whole matter: Read it and
judge.</p>
               <p>2. This Subscription, and other like Professions,
were purposely imposed for the renunciation of
the late Parliament Arms. But in your sense what
will it have done to satisfie or oblige any man in
that or the like case, when they profest the same
thing, and said, that it was only <hi>unjust and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Commissions,</hi> and an <hi>unlawful pursuit</hi> that they
resisted? Be their words true or false, this was
their pretence, and they would in the heat of the
War have subscribed to what you say.</p>
               <p>3. This was made and imposed to keep men
from the like for the time to come: But this would
not keep them; for they would take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60850:55"/>
4. Are you ignorant what striving there hath
been in Parliament to have got the word <hi>[Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
or Legally]</hi> commissioned in, and it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be obtained? (save that not long ago it was
carryed once in a Grand Committee of the House
of Lords only, very many years since this Act was
made.) Some say <hi>They had reason not to express it,
though they meant it, lest it should be abused.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Then they had reason to desire not to be
so understood. And then we cannot, nor ought, not
so to understand them against their wills; and the
<hi>non apparere,</hi> and <hi>non esse</hi> of their sense is all one to us.</p>
               <p>5. They knew that it was this that would herein
have satisfied dissenters, and tended to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
which they professed to desire; and yet they
would not yield to any such limitation or exposition.</p>
               <p>6. There were such Reasons brought against
your sense as these in the House. 1. No resisting
Arms are lawful. 2. If Subjects be made Judges
whether the King's Commissions be lawful or not, it
it is no restraint of Rebellion at all. For it's as
easie to say, <hi>They are unlawful,</hi> as to say, <hi>We may
resist them though lawful,</hi> and far more easie. Who
will not pretend it?</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Non est limitandum aut distinguendum de
lege sine lege:</hi> But in so great a business as this,
do you think our Governours will not take it for
a heinous thing, for such as you or I to put in the
word <hi>[Lawful]</hi> into <hi>Subscriptions</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi>
which so many great men did so long and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
study.</p>
               <p>8. A Papist or Jesuit will take it in your words;
for he will say, That no Commission against the
Pope's Countermands, or his Authority, or Canons
are lawful.</p>

§ 2. <hi>Now to your proofs; 1. You say,</hi> [The
Act it self implieth it; for else, what use is there
for Laws and Parliaments? The King may do
what he will: He is free to violate his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Oath, and set up Arbitrary Government by a
Law.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Did you ever read Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> against
Resistance in his <hi>Ductor Dubitant.</hi> who despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of proving any thing in the world, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prove that? Have you read Dr. <hi>Hearne,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Digs, Mich. Hudson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Welden,</hi> Dr. <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
&amp;c? you are answered by many.</p>
               <p>1. That the King may not do any such thing
lawfully.</p>
               <p>2. But if he do it, he is answerable only to
God.</p>
               <p>3. And that the Subject hath no remedy but
prayers and tears. Yet it followeth not, say they,
that Laws or Parliaments are vain: For by them
the King governeth as far as he please, and they
are his instruments.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Your second Reason is,</hi> The calling in the
the King's Indulgence, as contrary to Law, sheweth
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Did they that declared it contrary to Law,
declare that men may resist it by Arms?</p>
               <p>§ 4. 3. <hi>You say,</hi> [The Iudges at <hi>Westminster</hi>
unanimously agree upon this sense and exposition of
the Law, and their common practice no less.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I will give you a Lawyer's Fee if you
will prove it. When, and how did they ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
any such Agreement? What practice is it
that you mean? Do they commonly resist un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
Commissioned Souldiers by Arms? Or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60850:56"/>
declare for it. 2. But if this were true (which
I believe not, whatever their secret judgment
may be) it followeth not the Parliament which
made this Law was of that mind. 3. Your as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
is raw <hi>(<q>That the Iudges are made the
publick Expositors of Laws, made by King and
Parliament.</q>)</hi> There are two sorts of Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Laws: One is but limited to a particular
Case and Person, in order to the applicatory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for or against that Man: And so the Judges
are Expositors. The other is <hi>Universal,</hi> so as to
oblige all the Subjects as the Law it self doth, so
that they must understand the Law, antecedently
to their Obedience. And this is proper to the
Law-giver: For the sense of the Law is its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
And Judges are not the Law-makers.
Common Politicks might have taught you this.</p>
               <p>§ 5. 4. You say <q>
                     <hi>[The Parliament's proceedings
against Chancellor</hi> Hide <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Danby,
<hi>shew their sense.] Ans.</hi>
                  </q> 1. It was not the same
Parliament that prosecuted them both. 2. What
did the Parliament to any such purpose? Is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
a Delinquent, taking Arms against the
King's Commission, if unlawful? You say, <hi>[<q>They
mean not to unhinge the Right of the Subject, the
Priviledge of Parliaments, to make void all
Oaths, Bonds, Engagements of all the legal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
Iudges, Mayor, Magistrates, Constables,
Officers of the Kingdom.</q>] Ans.</hi> You are a bold
Man if you dare say that <hi>all these are made void,</hi>

resisted by Arms. You are for the Bishops resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

here you tell us first how much you can declare,
and then you give us just twenty Reasons against
the making and taking of the Covenant, which
you knew were impertinent to any thing that I
said: And yet many of them are as impertinent

wrongeth the best Cause.</p>
               <p>1. You say, <hi>There was never such an Oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by any Person fearing God. Ans.</hi> How prove
you that? Oh! very easily: You bid us prove the
Affirmative. Pitiful! So you may affirm that
never Man in the World said or did that, which
we cannot prove that some said or did: or affirm
an universal Negation, because we prove not the
contrary. 2. Might not an <hi>Arrian</hi> at <hi>Nice
(Conc. 1.)</hi> say, Never such a Creed was drawn
and imposed before. 3. May not the Pope say to
the first Protestants, Never such a Protestation was
made before? 4. But I pray you read better the

was made in <hi>Scotland</hi> before.</p>
               <p>Your 5th is more pitiful, being a Game at
Equivocation. 1. Did you think that the word
<hi>[Prelacy]</hi> in the <hi>Common,</hi> or the <hi>Imposers</hi> sense,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60850:57"/>
did mean Pastors that excel in Gifts and Grace.
You may next say, it meant Kings, or School-Masters;
when yet they adjoined an expository
Description. And I have told you, 1. That Doctor
<hi>Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> and many more openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that they would not Covenant against the
Primitive Episcopacy, and were ready to enter their
Protestation; and the Assembly to satisfie them,
added the Description, as meaning only the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
concatenated frame. 2. And the House of
Lords took it upon Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s making the same
Exposition.</p>
               <p>2. But the Bishops will give you little thanks
for subjecting them to all Pastors that have better
Gifts and Grace: And they will laugh at you for
talking, as if this were the Prelacy in question.</p>
               <p>In your 6th you tell us, That Bishops <hi>Name</hi>
and <hi>Thing</hi> are Scriptural: And yet <hi>pag.</hi> 6. you
say <hi>[A Bishop and a Presbyter in the Sense and
Language of the Scripture, are the same.]</hi> The
Reader may think that when you <hi>affirm,</hi> and
when you <hi>deny,</hi> it is the same. And you ask how
they would take an <hi>Oath</hi> to <hi>extirpate Presbyters,</hi>
and were told, <hi>They mean not to extirpate them
as Bishops, but as Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Did you think you spake to the Case?</p>
               <p>1. If they thought a <hi>Presbyter</hi> as such, as bad
as a Bishop as such, no doubt they would have
taken that Oath.</p>
               <p>2. But do you take a Bishop here for the <hi>same</hi>
as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or as a <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or as
a <hi>superiour</hi> to <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Which ever it is, it's
nothing to the Case in hand: He that saith, <hi>We
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60850:57"/>
renounce Diocesan Prelacy,</hi> but not <hi>Preeminence
of Gifts,</hi> nor <hi>Parochial Episcopacy,</hi> doth but say
plainly, I renounce not another thing by renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Prelacy in the known and explained Sense:
But he that saith, renounce Presbyters but not
Bishops, as they signifie the same thing, or as
<hi>Presbyters</hi> signifieth the whole <hi>Genus;</hi> or yet as
Bishops are the Governours of Presbyters, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
gross Contradictions.</p>
               <p>And when after you Argue sometimes from the
worth of the Persons to the goodness of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and sometime from the old Episcopacy, to
the English Diocesan Prelacy; you do but lose
your words as to us.</p>
               <p>And I could wish you would have left out
your <hi>medium</hi> of multitudes of Protestants that
would turn Papists, if the Papists could prove
as much for them of Antiquity and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality,
as the <hi>English</hi> Diocesan Prelacy can:
When I consider how in the same Empire they
grew up together, I would not have you be the
Man that should Dispute with a Papist, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
to prove the <hi>Roman Primacy</hi> as ancient
as our Species of Diocesan Prelacy described in
the Covenant, and to be acknowledged then by
as many. I say not that they can prove it: But
I had rather you laid not so much upon it.</p>
               <p>You equivocate when you say, All sides are for
Bishops: You will have few assenters when you
say, <q>That <hi>Episcopacy, Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy,</hi>
are not three forms of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as three is contrary to Unity <hi>(viz.</hi> of
such Form:</q> And when you say, <q>Extirpate one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60850:58"/>
and extirpate all (the Forms) because <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
is the same in all.</q> Are not <hi>Monarchy, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,</hi>
and <hi>Democracy,</hi> three Forms, contrary
to unity of Form; though Humanity, Piety,
and Regiment, be the same in all? Do they that
extirpate <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Democracy,</hi> extirpate all?
But why should I trouble the Reader, or you, by
any further opening of your mistakes in a Case
that I am not concerned in, and is none of our
Controversy?</p>
               <p>When you say that <hi>[The generality of the Non-conformists
are for a well tempered Prelacy,]</hi> you
infer an odious guilt on those Prelatists, who
write vehemently for our Ruine; as intolerable
<hi>because we are against Episcopacy:</hi> I could name
you many such besides Dr. <hi>Saywel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> 
                  <q>The Presbyterians and Independants,
were as bitter against one another, as the Prelates
were against them both, saving Violences, and
Coercive Restraints.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I refer it to your second thoughts,</p>
               <p>1. Whether this be sober Consistency.</p>
               <p>2. Whether it be true.</p>
               <p>1. To be <hi>[as bitter, except Violence, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
Restraint,]</hi> is in <hi>English</hi> to be <hi>[as bitter,
except being far more bitter,] q. d.</hi> [The differing
Protestants in <hi>Ireland</hi> were as bitter against each
other, as the Papists against both, saving Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Murders.] <hi>Bradford</hi>'s School-master,
was as hurtful to him as <hi>Bonner,</hi> except Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Burning him. He that chides me is as
hurtful to me as he that maimeth me, except hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me more. When you have excepted <hi>Silencing,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60850:58"/>
Imprisoning, and taking away all our Maintenance,</hi>
you except much.</p>
               <p>2. But yet <hi>is it true?</hi> Remember it was but
Presbyterians and Independants that you speak of:
Read the Book of their Assembly Debates: Read
all their Writings against each other: I will not
except Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Gangraena,</hi> and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not acknowledg more of God's
Grace in one another, and own more of the duty
of Loving and Forbearing own another, than the
Prelatists do by either. Read the Canons that
<hi>Excommunicate</hi> them <hi>ipso facto</hi> as for <hi>wicked Error;</hi>
and read Doctor <hi>Heylin, Fowlis,</hi> the Book against
Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s Farwel Sermon, the <hi>Counterminer,
L'Estrange,</hi> the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker;</hi>
and a multitude more such; and of old Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Bancroft;</hi> and in a word, the Ordinary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation
Articles, or <hi>Peter Studley,</hi> and a multitude
such, that Preacht and Wrote against them as
Hypocrites, Pharisees, Schismaticks, and such
like, and then consider how far you have here
swerved from known truth. I may say that I knew
all those Times, and the sorts of Persons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
much better than you: Many Sectaries
were very bitter, and some too bitter against
them. The Presbyterians and Independants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with too much intemperance and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
But sure if they had thought as ill of
one another as the Prelates did of both, when
they had power, they would as much have Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and Ejected one another; which they did
not. I remember not ever to have known any
meer Presbyterian or Independant, especially
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60850:59"/>
Ministers, but openly declared that they looked on
both parties as the Servants of Christ, whom they
should love and honour. But this is nothing to
our Cause.</p>
               <p>You say truly, <hi>[<q>An Oath is a sacred thing,
and it is dangerous to use Shifts and Stretches.</q>]</hi>
And if so, it is not without danger to persuade
thousands so to do, or to justifie many hundred
thousand if they will be down-right perjured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>If one may judge of those Times by
these now present, a great many swore Pell-mell
they knew not what, because they knew not what
Presbytery, Independancy, and Episcopacy was.</q>]</p>
               <p>1. No doubt many did so.</p>
               <p>2. But they partly knew what the English Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
was, by long Experience; and they swore not
for Presbytery or Independancy, nor against all
Episcopacy.</p>
               <p>3. But if you think that <hi>they do so in these
Times,</hi> you and I should lament it: For God will
not hold them Guiltless, whether they be Pastors
and Churches, or Cities and Corporations, that
take his Name by Perjury in vain: It's better call
them to Repentance, than justifie them in it. To
contract the guilt of the Perjury of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
is an expeditious way to Misery, and doth
a great deal in a little time.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Having thus proved that which I denied
not, you proceed to add Nineteen Propositions
about the Case in question, in all which it is not
easie to be sure which side you conclude for: You
grant most of my premises, which make against
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60850:59"/>
Perjury. You confess, that <q>
                     <hi>If any one Person be
bound by that Oath to endeavour an alteration of
Church Government, no Man may with a safe
Conscience subscribe this.</hi> And, <hi>If there be evil
in the Government of the Church, which may
well and conveniently be reformed, you do not see
but that all that have taken that Oath, stand
bound in their Places and Calling to endeavour it:
There can be no just Reformation without some
Alteration.</hi>
                  </q> A great deal more than this you
grant, how Rulers are bound to yield in things
confest indifferent, which others account Sin,
were it but to heal our Breaches: And what a Sin
it is to cast out of the Church multitudes of holy
Conscientious Men for a small and tolerable Error,
when all have some, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet instead of a
Conclusion, if you are intelligible, you induce
Men to subscribe, though that which they fear, be
(not accusing any) lest they should be guilty of
many hundred thousand Perjuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> 1. [<q>We must in expounding Laws
regard the meaning of our Governours.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True: But is it their meaning <hi>de ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>
or <hi>de specie,</hi> or <hi>individuo?</hi> Our Governour's
meaning is not to approve <hi>Perjury.</hi> But suppose
yet they had commanded me to swear that no
man is bound by the Oath of Supremacy; is
it no Perjury so to swear. Then we might
swear any thing commanded while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
saith, He is not for Perjury. If Rulers
command men to marry their own Sisters, and
yet say, That they abhor Incest, may one ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
this because they are <hi>against Incest?</hi> If
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60850:60"/>
Rebels rise in Arms against their Rulers, but
yet renounce Rebellion, how are they to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you say,</hi> [<q>If there be any thing in the
Government contrary to the Word of God, The
Laws, Canons, Liturgy, Offices of Iudges and
Ministers do bind all men against it, as null
and void, though not abolished by Parliament.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And what then? Do you infer [There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may subscribe; or therefore we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
nothing in the Law to be against God's
Word; or therefore we must not subscribe it? The
last is the true Conclusion. If <hi>Socinians</hi> renounce
all that is against God's Word, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you to renounce Christ's Godhead, may
you do it?</p>
               <p>2. But I would fain see the words which you
here suppose in the Law, Canons and Liturgy;
and whether they leave us all to be Judges <hi>what
is against God's Word?</hi> And,</p>
               <p>3. I would have you expound to me, 1. The
Canon that requireth us to subscribe, that <hi>There
is nothing in the Liturgy against God's Word.</hi>
2. And that which excommunicateth all that say
there is any thing against it. 3. And the Law
that layeth us in Gaol, and ruineth us, if we
so say and do forbear accordingly. Is it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to say, [The Law renounceth all that is
contrary to the Word of God; and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth,
and Silenceth, and ruineth you, if you
say that there is in the Liturgy any thing against
it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> You may subscribe though there be
somewhat against it, because the Law disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60850:60"/>
it?] I would not think you mean this: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I know not what you mean to infer, unless
it be your next words: <hi>[<q>Therefore what Faults
be in the Government, are rather the Faults of
the Governours.</q>]</hi> Alas, this is it and worse.
Thus you might infer, There is no fault in the
Papal Government, if the Pope in general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all that is against God's Word, and then
bids you swear that Popery is not against it. <hi>Turks</hi>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> renounce in general all <hi>sinning against
God,</hi> and yet I would not say that their Laws may
be owned as sinless.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>If all Governours in Church and
State faithfully did their Duties according to the
Canons, Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would be happy for all
sides.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No Man can tell by these words, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you mean <hi>[If they did all that the Laws and
Canons command them,]</hi> or <hi>[If they did the good
part and left out the bad.]</hi> If the later be your
sense, it is against you: If it have a bad part
which we must not do, it hath a part which we
must not consent, covenant, or promise to do.
If the former, then you have part of your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and may soon enough see more. Your
honest words elsewhere shew that you take it for
no Happiness, to have all professed Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
Excommunicated according to the Canon,
and Silenced and Ruined according to the Law.</p>
               <p>And yet I cannot tell how to agree you with
your self: You say, <hi>[All good and peaceable Men
would be protected, whether Conformists, or Non-conformists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60850:61"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Field,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thompson,</hi> and others
that died in Gaol were; or as Mr. <hi>Hughs,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Ioseph Allen,</hi> and others that died by their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Diseases
were; or as those that must be Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or lie in <hi>Gaol</hi> six Months, and pay forty
pound a Sermon; or as Men Excommunicated <hi>ipso
facto</hi> are protected.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>The words of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do not say, No Man is bound to endeavour
the alteration of the Governours but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is, Of the Laws, Rules, and Canons,
by which they govern, and the several Offices
which be in the Church.—These may be good.—
The office may be Divine, or justly prudential, or
tolerably lawful.—Suppose the Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth not bind to endeavour the alteration of
the Chancellor's Office.—</q> 
                  <hi>Your Conclusion seems
implied in your Challenge.</hi> [<q>Now let any Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist
prove that there is any Office in the
<hi>English</hi> way of Church Government simply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Have you answered the proof that I
pretend to have brought in my <hi>Disput.</hi> of
Church Government? If not, must I write it
again as oft as you will bid me? Or would it be
here meet to write a Treatise to answer this your
Challenge? But get it tolerated, and it shall soon
be done.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>You say,</hi> The Government is the Laws, Rules,
and Canons, by which they Govern: <hi>And if these
need not be altered, why did you before disown
the exercise of them, as a great Sin? And yet this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60850:61"/>
implieth</hi> [The Law and Canon, which Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
Non-conformists, and which deny the Lord's
Supper to those that kneel not, and which silence
Non-subscribers to the <hi>36th</hi> Canon, and which
deny Baptism to those that scruple the <hi>English</hi> use
of the Cross and God-fathers, and which ruine all
that preach when Silenced, need no alteration, as
simply unlawful.]</p>
               <p>But we must prove them unlawful: Come to
me then in private, and let us debate the Case,
and I will prove to you as much as I affirm. In
the mean time, if it will go for any Proof with
you, I crave your answer to these Arguments
which some use, that doubt of the lawfulness which
they dare not deny.</p>
               <p>I. A Church-governing Office for the exercise
of that power of the Church Keys by Lay-men,
which Christ hath appropriated to the Clergy is
sinful: But such is the Office of our Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. A species of Prelacy which is destructive
of, or inconsistent with the form of particular
Churches, and of Bishops and Presbyters, and
the exercise of that Church-Discipline which
Christ and his Spirit in the Apostles did institute
is sinful. But (they fear) such is the English
Diocesan species of Prelacy: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. The Government which is to be the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the foresaid Canons, and Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Expelling, Excommunicating, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing,
Imprisoning, Ruining Non-conformists,
you said before was unlawful—But—<hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here I would, as your real Friend, advise
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60850:62"/>
you to two things more; as well as not needlesly
to contract the guilt of that which you call <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
Sin</hi> in others.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That you will publish your Retractation of
those words</hi> [<q>The words of the Declaration do
not say, No Man is bound to endeavour the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Governours, but only of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>]</p>
               <p>Do you consider what you say?</p>
               <p>1. You know that it is the Government of the
<hi>State</hi> as well as Church, that is here expressed:
And do you think that the King and Parliament
never intended to keep Men from deposing the
King? Or the Lords, and Commons, and Judges,
though they changed not the <hi>Species,</hi> but set up
others in their steads? Or will the Bishops so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it to you, as that it meaneth not that you
are not obliged by the Covenant, to pull down all
the present Bishops if you set up others in their
stead?</p>
               <p>2. That you avoid the commoner answer of
others, who say, That it is only the <hi>Essentials</hi> of
Government that are here meant, and not any
Integrals, or Accidents. For,</p>
               <p>1. The King and State-Government is here
touched. And dare you say that [If any Man
think that the Covenant bindeth him to destroy
all the King's Civil Government, except the bare
essentials of Monarchy, that the Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not here to contradict him?]</p>
               <p>2. And I doubt the Bishops will be angry with
you and call you Schismaticks, if you say that the
Parliament here meant not to contradict them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60850:62"/>
that say, they are bound by the Covenant to turn
our Diocesan Bishops into Parochial ones, or into
one in every Corporation, and to take down their
Court Officers, and their Lordships, Parliament,
Power and Wealth. That which serveth Men
best in Arguing, will not best please the Men that
they plead for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>We grant that there is no one thing
in the Episcopal Government, but what we may
well bear with, and submit to.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We well may and must bear with that
which we cannot help. In <hi>Moscovy</hi> we may fear
that all Preaching is put down, saving reading
Homilies; and a Man may there live Godly: But
do not you therefore tell all Men, that if the same
were done here, we may enter into a solemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
never to endeavour to reform it: No,
were it but the high places in <hi>Iudaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Submitting <hi>is either by</hi> Obedience, <hi>or</hi> meer
Patience. <hi>Under</hi> Papists <hi>and</hi> Turks <hi>Men must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
by Patience: But if you say,</hi> We hold <hi>that we
must obey all that they command, our practice tells
you, It is not true. But the question is,</hi> Whether
there be no one thing, but what we may covenant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to endeavour to alter, and subscribe that no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Man, or any other in <hi>England,</hi> is bound by
that Oath, which they took, to endeavour it? <hi>The
Law forbids me to say,</hi> They are, <hi>and therefore I
say it not: But if you say,</hi> They are not, <hi>Dare
you undertake to answer for them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say, <hi>Their Office binds them to no evil.</hi>
That is, None of the things fore-mentioned are
<hi>evil:</hi> Which you said were so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:60850:63"/>
                  <hi>Again you say,</hi> All the while Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Church Censures are soundly done, it's the
the less matter by whom they are done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Do not say so to the King about King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government: Nor to the Judges if an intruder
invade the Tribunal.</p>
               <p>2. Make the Bishops believe this if you can,
of any that should usurp their Office.</p>
               <p>3. Make the Parish Priests believe it if you
can, who are so angry with us for helping them
at a distance, though we invade not Places.</p>
               <p>4. Make any sober Ministers believe if you
can, that if the Word be well Preacht, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
soundly Administred, it is no matter who
doth it.</p>
               <p>5. Make any <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> or <hi>Husband,</hi>
believe it as to their Offices, that it's no matter
who doth it, so it be soundly done. If the Wife
do believe, it's two to one the Husband will not.</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>Again you say,</hi> [<q>By the Government of
Church and State, whatsoever is absolutely sinful
is forbidden,—the Laws declare it Null, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is before answered. You say, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
and Excommunicating the Non-conformists
here, are sinful.</hi> Instead of this impertinent talk,
go try your Oratory on the Judges and Bishops;
if you can persuade them that the Law forbids
them all to fine, Imprison, or Silence us, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
us: Why did you not use this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Argument for your self?</p>
               <p>2. And do not <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> say, that
No Law against God is in force? And doth their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60850:63"/>
Government therefore contain no evil? Or will
you tell them that swear to amend it, that it's
well enough already?</p>
               <p>You tell us what to say to the Bishops and
Judges for our selves: But if by this Medium, I
would prove that I am conformable to the Law,
and they are the Non-conformists that punish me,
because they break the Law of God; I doubt
they would Laugh at me first, and send me to
Gaol next.</p>
               <p>§ 5. But in answer to, <hi>Where read we in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Chancellor's Office?</hi> You repeat again,
<hi>[If soundly done, no Man may reprove them.]</hi> I
will not repeat my Answer: But I add; If so,
No Man may reprove the Boys if they soundly
Whip their Master when he deserveth it; nor a
Cobler that will send Offenders to Prison as the
Lord Mayor doth: Nor a Justice, yea, or a
Tinker, that will step up in the Chancery, or
King's-Bench, to do Justice.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>But though I will not Laugh at your
Writing; I should hardly forbear if I heard you
do what</hi> page 95, <hi>you say you would do,</hi> viz.
[<q>If a Bishop, or Arch-Bishop, or Chancellor,
live where you are Pastor, and be a Member of
your Congregation, you must needs look on your
self as obliged by the Laws and Canons of the
Church and State, by the Word of God, and by
the Rules of the Common-prayer-Book, publickly
to admonish him, if he grosly misdemean himself,
and do a scandalous crime; and if he shall not by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60850:64"/>
open confession give satisfaction to the Church,
bar him from the Sacrament, and declare him
Disorderly and Contumacious, and that if he do
not repent he shall perish; and warn the People to
beware of such evil Courses, and to have no more
to do with him than they needs must: And this I
maintain to be part of the Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I would I could see this bout. I doubt
he will have something to do with you
Your Chancellor had the wit to begin with you
first. I pray you forget not this Case when you go
to the Bishop for his sense of the Liturgy, and tell
us his answer when you come Home.</p>
               <p>I must profess this is an edifying Passage: As
when I read in <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> that <hi>Christ repented</hi> and
<hi>believed for us,</hi> it let in more Light against Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinism,
than I had before: So doth this Passage
raise up some useful doubts in me about our
Churches, which I thought not on till now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether are the Bishops that dwell in
the <hi>London</hi> Parishes (or others) Members of the
Parish Church where they dwell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. If they are not, Whether dwelling in
the Parish make a Christian a Member of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. If not, what is it that makes a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and how are the Pastors special Flock truly
known to him from others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. If they be Members, to whom shall we
present the Bishop for not coming to Church, or
for his Crimes? Is it to himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60850:64"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Whether is the Bishop, or the Parish
Priest there the higher Power, or Governor? and
which must obey?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 6. Doth the Canon that forbids Men to go
from their own Parish Churches, extend to the
Bishop?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 7. How is the Bishop one of the Parson's
Flock, and the Parson one of the Bishop's Flock,
both at once?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Whether the Bishop that is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
by the Parson out of the Parish Church,
be cast out of the Universal? or other Churches,
may have Communion with him, or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 9. What if the Parson Excommunicate the
Bishop, and the Bishop the Parson both at once,
what a Case are they in? And which shall stand,
one or both, and how far?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 10. How will the Parson practice his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
who consenteth when he putteth any
one from the Sacrament, to certifie the Ordinary
within fourteen Days? will he prosecute the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to himself, or to his Chancellor?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 11. Doth not this Instance prove Mr. <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
to be a mistaking Expositor of the Church-Government,
the Bishops themselves being Judges?
and would not one days practice of any such thing
convince him by Experience, that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> now take not Parish Parsons for Parish
Bishops?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 12. Is he in the right, <hi>page</hi> 96. that this
Course would make Bishops, and Arch-Bishops,
and Chancellors, <hi>stand in awe of the Priests?</hi> why
then did you not thus awe your Bishop and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor?</p>

               <p>YOur 28th Section hath nothing in it that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
many words for Answer: That
Oaths and Laws must be charitably expounded no

we stand to Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Rules, which are

               <head>CHAP. XXX.</head>
               <p>§ 1. YOur 29th Section containeth your unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Opinions, and false Devices, for
stretching Subscriptions, Covenants and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
And first you tell us of the difficulty of
using any words that may not seem doubtful:
But yet if there be not a satisfactory intelligible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in words, Humane Converse is overthrown,
and Oaths of Allegiance, and all Contracts are of
little use unto their ends.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>Though there be in this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
which we call the Common-prayer-Book,
many Matters, Sentences, and Words bound all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60850:65"/>
together, yet do we Assent and Consent to no more
but that which goes under the name of the Service
of the Church, and the Rules and Orders touching
the same, and the Rites and Ceremonies thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If you say <hi>[All things contained in it]</hi> means
not <hi>[all things]</hi> indeed, tell us what difference
there is between the Equivocations of the Jesuits,
and this of yours. So one tells me, that [when
we profess to Assent to all in the Bible,] the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is <hi>[To all the Precepts, Promises, and Words
of God in it,</hi> but not that there is no Humane Errors
in Numbers and Chronologie, Genealogie, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
or Citations.] And so you may say, [I
will swear not to endeavour any alteration of the
Government of the State, but I mean not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Monarchy.] And what may not one thus
say and swear?</p>
               <p>2. But yet I think it is no great number of
<hi>[Matters, Sentences,</hi> and <hi>Words]</hi> which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>(Service, Rules, Orders,</hi> or <hi>Rites.)</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks
and Calendars, and some Prefaces belong
to these. But it is a strange Interpretation which
would exclude Doctrinals, such as the Article of
Faith, of the certain Salvation of all Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
and dying before actual Sin. Your Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
signifie nothing for your purpose, but tell
us what you would have them signifie.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But now I come to <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Hair, the
very strength of all your Book, <hi>page</hi> 115. The
Preface saith, [<q>When Doubts arise in the Use
and Practice of the same, to appease all such
diversity (if any arise) and for the resolution
of all Doubts concerning the manner how to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60850:66"/>
understand, do and execute the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Book, the Parties that so doubt, or
diversly take any thing, shall always resort to
the Bishop of the Diocess, who by his discretion
shall take order for the quieting and appeasing of
the same, so that the same Order be not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to any thing contained in this Book.</q>]
Whence you gather, that the Law makes the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
the common Expositor; and if he gives a
good Exposition, or by silence shew consent, all
is safe, and you may Conform.</p>
               <p>I confess this Reed is the strongest support of
your Cause that I have met with: And I am not
censuring others that lean upon it: I doubt not
but they may be better Men than I: But I will
tell you why I cannot.</p>
               <p>1. It is a help to those that be in doubt: But I
am out of doubt in many of the Reasons of my
Non-conformity; and therefore it is no help to
me.</p>
               <p>2. The words expresly limit the Bishops Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>[so that his order be not contrary to any
thing in the Book.]</hi> If it be not contrary to
the Book, it will give me no satisfaction: If it be
contrary, it is of no force.</p>
               <p>3. It is only about (the <hi>things contained in the
Book)</hi> that the Bishop must resolve us: Now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Acts of Uniformity are part of those
things, or not: If yea, then it is the Acts also
that I must Assent and Consent to; which you as
well as I are far from. And you maintain that
the Act is no part of the Book: If not, then the
Bishop hath no power to expound the Act: And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60850:66"/>
the forms of Assent and Consent, and Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imposed, are parts of the Act.</p>
               <p>4. The words make not the Bishop the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or common Expositor of the Law, or Book,
as Judge; but only as a Teacher, who bindeth
but so far as he tells the truth: The Bishop must
teach his ignorant or divided Clergy, how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what they understand not: And this is
not about their Subscriptions, but matters of <hi>Use</hi>
and <hi>Practice</hi> (as where the Table shall stand, and
such like.) That it maketh not the Bishop the
obliging Judge of the Law, appeareth,</p>
               <p>1. Because here is no such word.</p>
               <p>2. The foresaid limitation speaketh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>3. Else there might be as many Religions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
or Practices as Bishops, or many at least:
I will give you all the little Money in my Purse,
if you will get me under the hand of Bishop
<hi>Morley,</hi> Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> Bishop <hi>Sparrow,</hi> and
Arch-Bishop <hi>Stern,</hi> their approbation of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of the parts of Conformity, written in
your Book. And I suppose you know how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
many write (as well as Doctor <hi>Saywel)</hi>
against tolerating diversity of Forms and Rites,
and Orders of Worship. And this would be to
set up as many Sects, or Ways, as differing Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
pleased. This Case was notably tried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and the Church that
followed him, and <hi>Williams,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
about the Table, or Altar.</p>
               <p>4. Else Bishops would have the Legislative
Power: For the sense of the Law is the Law:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60850:67"/>
And if the Parliament form but the Letter or
Body of it, and the Bishop may give it what
Sense or Soul he pleaseth; it is he that will be the
chief Law-maker.</p>
               <p>5. Else Bishops might corrupt and change our
Religion and Church, under pretence of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
Bishop <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> of <hi>Glocester,</hi>
who was a <hi>Papist,</hi> might have set up Popery in
his Diocess, by putting a Popish sense upon Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
Words, and Practices: And the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
by agreement might set up Popery in the
Land, by the same means. Or a Bishop might
set up Non-conformists, by gratifying them by
his Expositions. The thing meant in those words
is no such dangerous power, but only an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and a Pacifying, informing of the Clergy,
when they ignorantly differ about some dark
Word, or Circumstance, or Practice; the Bishop
must teach them the true sense of the Book, but
do nothing against any thing therein.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Is it not called</hi> An Act for Uniformity, <hi>and
imposeth all the heavy Penalties on purpose to
procure Uniformity? Would they have Silenced
and Ruined two thousand Ministers for Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
if Uniformity had not been thought of
more worth than their Ministerial Labours? And
can you think that after all this, they meant to
leave it to the particular Bishops, whether there
should be any Uniformity or not? You think one
Bishop will say,</hi> [You are Parish Bishops, and may
publickly admonish and reprove the Scandalous, and
Excommunicate them <hi>Excommunicatione minore:</hi>
You may give them the Sacrament, that conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60850:67"/>
scruple Kneeling; you may Baptize them that
conscienciously scruple the dedicating Cross, and the
English sort of God-Fathers; you may refuse to say
the words of Prayer, which imply his Salvation,
over the Dead who were Excommunicable, though
not Excommunicated: You may understand the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which professeth the certainty of Baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
salvation, of those only that are the Children
of faithful Parents, or Pro-parents; you may say
you Assent to all in the Book, and mean not all but
some part, and that not as true, but as usable:
You may profess Consent to use it all, and yet not
mean to use the Calendar, or Rubricks, or to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
the Sacraments otherwise than as aforesaid:
You may Say, or Subscribe, or Swear, that it is, on
any pretence whatsoever, unlawful to take Arms
against any Commissioned by the King, and mean
only such as are <hi>lawfully Commissioned.</hi> You may
subscribe that no one in <hi>England</hi> that sware it, is
bound by the solemn Vow and Oath, to endeavour
any alteration of Government in Church or State,
and mean only that he must not endeavour it by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or Rebellion.] <hi>And so on to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But other Bishops will say the clean contrary:
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Bishop is the only Pastor, and the
Parish Priest hath none of the power here named,
and so of all the rest: And what Uniformity
then will there be? Know you not how they
write against such different Administrations, as
destructive and intolerable?</p>
               <p>7. And know you not that a Bishop hath no
power against the Canons? The Canons are their
own Laws and Judgment, and bind them: And
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60850:68"/>
when the Canon saith, <hi>e. g.</hi> He shall be suspended
that giveth the Sacrament to one that kneeleth
not; or that the Non-conformists are <hi>ipso facto</hi>
Excommunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hath the Bishop authority
to say the contrary?</p>
               <p>8. And you know that I wrote not to accuse
you, or any Man for Conforming, but to tell
them that judge us worthy to be Silenced and
Ruined, what our Non-conformity is: And what
use then is your own Latitude to me, or such as
I, though I went your own way? For I have
askt and heard the Opinion of divers Bishops al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and they have said clean contrary to you.
I have heard him that first forbad me Preaching
in his Diocess, say, that [The Liturgy forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
delivering the Sacrament to any that Kneel
not.] I can shew it you under his Hand, that
the Priest must not be Judge, when to omit the
forementioned words at the burial of the Dead;
nor tolerated in such Liberty as you presume on.
I have been told by a Bishop, That seeing Christ
died for all, the Children of any Parents in the
World have right to Baptism, and any Man hath
as good right to present to it an Infidel's Child, as
to take in an exposed Infidel's Child to his House
in Charity. I told you, that Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi>
publickly before the Bishops, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi>
told me, That I need not question Baptizing any
Infidel's Child, if God-Fathers presented him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Order of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
Are we not then concluded against Conformity
by the Bishop's judgment, by your own Rule?
And must not you be a Non-conformist in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60850:68"/>
Diocess of any such Bishop as these?</p>
               <p>9. And by your Rule, a Man must be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
in one Bishop's Diocess, and a Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
in another's; and change his mode of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
as he Travelleth, or doth change his
Dwelling. I imagine that by your Rule, I might
partly Conform in the Diocess of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,
Hereford,</hi> or <hi>Carlisle;</hi> but I should be as
Non-conformable as I am, in the Diocess of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,
Ely, York, Norwich,</hi> and any other as far
as I yet know.</p>
               <p>I conclude that your <hi>Catholicon</hi> may purge your
self from all Non-conformity, but it is utterly
unprofitable to me: <hi>Facile credimus quod volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
I have had as much reason as you, to be
willing to find Conformity lawful, if it be so:
I have lost many thousand Pounds more by Non-conformity,
than you have got by Conformity.
But I have no such Byas on my Will, as should
set all my Wit on work to find, or buy a Rope
for my Conscience. And I find nothing better that
you offer me herein.</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>When you have told us,</hi> [Where no God-Fathers
can be had, we must Christen without;]
<hi>and such like: You say,</hi> [<q>And this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense put upon the Law, by the Law-makers
themselves, that is, by the Bishops.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What reason did you think we have in
such an Historical Assertion, to believe your bare
word? In what Synod did they declare it? Why
did you neither name the Bishops, nor the Time,
or Place, or Witness, by which it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60850:69"/>
the common sense? But could you think this
should convince me, that know it to be false?</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>You tell us,</hi> pag. 119. [<q>If it were a
part of Assent and Consent, that Ordination
by good and substantial Presbyters were null, it
would be a hard point indeed,—to Unchurch
Churches, and Unbaptize the Baptized, and plead
the cause of Satan, the Pope, and all Malignants
of the Ministry, in the Name of Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Excuse us then for not Conforming. I
before gave you this Proof, that it is the sense of
the Law-makers, or Bishops:</hi> They that abhor
Reordination (or twice ordaining to the Priesthood)
and yet require those to be ordained by Bishops, who
were before ordained by Presbyters, must be judged
to hold the said Ordination by Presbyters to be null.—
<hi>But,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo.</p>
               <p>§ 6. 1. <hi>You say,</hi> 
                  <q>No Man that I know of,
takes the Silenced Ministers, and those ordained
by Presbyters only, for no Ministers at all, unless
one Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> a high-flown Man, whom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
themselves do utterly dissent from in
this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <q>People, Conformists themselves do own them for

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Did you ever read the Conference at

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> How will you prove that they judge all
true Ministers whom they Tolerate?</p>
               <p>§ 9. 4. <hi>You say, the</hi> 
                  <q>Acts against Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
and the Five Mile Act prove it.</q>
               </p>

proveth it.</q>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>7. <q>The allowing four Persons to meet in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

               <p>8. <q>The common sense of Bishops, Divines, and

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> You may next say, That any thing that
you see or hear proveth it. It's liker these prove
the contrary, than this. By this Men may see
how little satisfaction we may expect from your
arguing. You greatly wrong the King, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Bishops, if you think they take all for
Ministers, Men, Women, or Children, whose
meeting they tolerate: You leave out the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Act of Uniformity, which punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all by a hundred Pound a time that Administer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60850:70"/>
the Sacrament, being not ordained by a Bishop.
Doth that prove them Ministers too?</p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>You say,</hi> [<q>As to the Peoples Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
I know no one thing required of them to

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Why then did you pass by the answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of my Book concerning their part? Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
about the Corporation-Declaration? Should
they be in the right that think all the Cities and
Corporations in <hi>England</hi> to be under that—which
I am loth to name; and that Plagues, Flames,
and Poverty, are God's Revenge; Oh! what a
thing would it be for a Servant of Christ, to say
to them in Print, [O <hi>England</hi> repent not!]</p>

               <p>§ 1. YOur Conclusion is also a bundle of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
and Impertinencies.</p>
               <p>1. It is more than three or four points that the
new Conformity addeth to the old.</p>
               <p>2. If the number or goodness of the old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
did prove their Cause good, many things
would have a far stronger Proof of that kind, from
the ancient Churches, which yet you judge to be
unlawful; and in other Countries the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will be turned against you.</p>
               <p>3. Such Men as you call <hi>[The main Body of
the best Divines,]</hi> were very few in comparison of
the Ignorant bad Clergy.</p>
               <p>4. It is not true that Mr. <hi>Knewstubs</hi> was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,
nor Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> neither, unless I be one.
The Petition of the Non-conformists to King
<hi>Iames,</hi> was called <hi>Millenary;</hi> because it had a
thousand Hands in a little compass.</p>
               <p>5. That some then did, and now do scruple
more than others, is impertinent to our Business,
and it were a wonder if it were not so, till Men
are arrived at scrupling nothing.</p>
               <p>6. The 36th <hi>Canon</hi> was the chief point of
the old Non-conformity, and will receive no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by the worth of any Subscribers. I
doubt not but <hi>Bernard, Gerson,</hi> &amp;c. were holy
Men, that subscribed far worse.</p>
               <p>7. Sponsors of an ill sort are never the better,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60850:71"/>
because there was a better sort of old; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these were before the new Liturgy.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Page</hi> 125. You could wish Ministers would
make the Parents to be present chief Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
that is, to be Non-conformists called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
The rest needeth but the repetition of
what is said before, which would rather tire than
edifie the Reader.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII.</head>
               <p>SInce the writing of my Answer to your Book,
you were with me, and when I gave you
two or three Objections which I published not,
you gave me no Reply to them, but went from
me and Printed an Answer to them in a Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Seeing your judgment is most for that
way, I crave your patience while I use the way
you choose. I confess my judgment is, that you
have unavoidably made me a great Temptation
to you: For if you be not a Man of great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
you will</p>
               <p>1. Be offended to find all your Labour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be hurtful, and your Reasoning vain; and
you will think that the disgracing of them by a
just Confutation, falleth on your self.</p>
               <p>2. And you will be tempted to turn your
thoughts too partially, to justifie what once you
have so publickly said, and so to run further into
the Extream. But my persuasion of your great
sincerity, maketh me hope that you will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60850:71"/>
the temptation which you have chosen.</p>
               <p>I. I thought that the word <hi>[Use of all]</hi> did
much aggravate, and not extenuate the burden
of the Declaration, as added to Assent. But to
them that thought otherwise, I thought that
when both Lords and Commons at a Conference
upon Reasons given, had rejected that Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which confineth the sense of the words to
<hi>[Use,]</hi> it had been a more satisfactory notice of
the Law-givers sense, than either your private
Conceit, or any Bishops Exposition could be.
But you tell us, <hi>That this Conference was no
Law, or repeal of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Impertinent! It is an Exposition of the
meaning of the Law-makers only, that we are
enquiring of, and not the repealing or making
of a Law. It is the Law-makers part to be the
publick obliging Interpreters of the Law to the
whole Kingdom. We are enquiring in point
of Conscience, how we must understand them:
And you will not believe them it seems, unless
they make a new Law, to tell you the sense of
the old one.</p>
               <p>II. Every one may know, that it's usual for
the <hi>Means</hi> to have somewhat in it for the <hi>End,</hi>
besides the intending of the End it self; and
that usually Laws and Canons command many
Means for one End. And therefore to make
your full and constant <hi>usage</hi> of Conformity to
be the End, and the Assenting and Consenting
to all things in the Book to be the Means, even
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60850:72"/>
in that form of words, are no contradiction. And
it's usual to be <hi>stricter</hi> in prescribing <hi>forms of
Words,</hi> for Oaths, Covenants, or Confessions,
than in the other integral parts of a Law. And
it is a great wrong to a Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
to say either that, in such a form imposed on the
Learned and Consciencious Tribe, they knew
not how to speak intelligibly according to the
common use of words, or that they were so
mischievously Malignant, as seventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years to refuse to open their sense, for the
healing of so distracted and endangered a Church
and Nation, if they meant not as their words
do signifie according to common use. It's no
vanity to say, I have known the Men, Bishops
and Commons, better than you have done, and
heard more of them and their Debates, than you
have done; and I am satisfied in my Conscience
to conclude, that they meant plainly as they
speak, and no better: Even that no Man's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to use the Liturgy shall be taken for trusty
and satisfactory, that will not declare that he
Assenteth and Consenteth to all things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, and prescribed by it:] And this plainly
<hi>Ex animo,</hi> without uncouth Exposition, Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
or Jesuitical mental Reservations.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>I have not wit enough to find out</hi> sense
<hi>in your Quibble, that</hi> [<q>If the later words <hi>(the
Form)</hi> do import more than the former <hi>(for
the Use)</hi> then there is something added and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
which possibly may inconsist and be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:60850:72"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Is not all prescript of <hi>Means</hi> an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Precept <hi>De fine?</hi> Doth the prescript
of the Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
no more than to be Loyal? Yes: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a particular test of Loyalty. Doth the
Command of subscribing the thirty nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
contain no more, but to be Orthodox?
Yes: It enjoineth us by this <hi>means</hi> to profess
those particulars, in which our Orthodoxness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Assent</hi> when thus distinguished purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from <hi>Consent,</hi> signifieth Assenting to some
Truth, and <hi>Consent</hi> respecteth the Good. So
that when you make <hi>Assent</hi> to be but the same as
<hi>[Consent to Use]</hi> you feign them to speak Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
or to Tautologize. You say, <hi>[You Assent
to all,]</hi> but not that <hi>All is true:</hi> Which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
or Equivocation.</p>
               <p>§ 4. [<q>Prove <hi>(say you)</hi> that there is any
one thing in the Book, which may not in the
course of Conformity be godly used?</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To some Men I will undertake to prove
nothing. If there be no proof in the Book which
you write against, when you have got leave to
Print it, you are likely to have more. Till
then, to call for proof when you have it, and
speak not sense against it, is too easie a way to
satisfie the Just.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>III. I told you by word of Mouth,
that your</hi> Catholicon <hi>of trusting,</hi> to the Bishops
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60850:73"/>
Exposition of the Book <hi>(yea, to his</hi> silence, <hi>so
gentle and tractable are you become) is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to you for expounding the</hi> Assent, Consent.
Subscription <hi>against the</hi> obligation of the Vow, <hi>and</hi>
about Arms, <hi>&amp;c. because these are part of the
Act of Uniformity; and you say, that Act is no
part of the Book. To this you Print your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that you</hi> [<q>Have another string to your
Bow.] <hi>viz.</hi> That the Bishop is by Law the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
to Ordain and take Subscriptions, and
may admit Ministers to subscribe these Tests with
such Explications, Meanings, and Allowances,
as will well stand with the words justly and
fairly construed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Bishop is not made the Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Law, but the Receiver of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
according to the Law.</p>
               <p>2. If you will confound <hi>Indulgent Connivance,</hi>
and <hi>Conformity,</hi> must we do so too? This is Mr.
<hi>Humphrey</hi>'s project, And I freely confess to you,
That if you can meet with an Indulgent Bishop,
it's a fairer way to intromit a Dissenter, than
any that you have named in your Book. All
words are ambiguous: The <hi>sense</hi> is the Soul of
them. If, <hi>e.g.</hi> I were commanded to say that
<hi>[The Scripture is not God's Word,]</hi> and I had
leave to expound it;</p>
               <p>1. [All Scripture, or Writing, is not God's
Word, but the sacred Bible is:] Or <hi>[It is not
God's Eternal Coessential Word, which is Christ;]</hi>
were it not for Scandal, this might be said as true.
And some think the Scandal is sufficiently avoided,
if you give in your sense in Writing, and make
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60850:73"/>
it as publick as is your Subscription. But I think
that the very subscribing such scandalous Words,
will scandalously harden others, and encourage
Tyrannical Imposers more, than your Exposition
can Cure; and therefore I would not use them.</p>
               <p>And if I would, I could cast in such an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Writing, whether the Bishop will or not.</p>
               <p>And if he accept it, I pray better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that, <hi>This is not Conformity, but Indulgence,
Connivance, Toleration, or Prevarication:</hi> You
might as well say, He Conformed, that by the
King's Indulgence, was excused from Subscribing
and Declaring.</p>
               <p>You put a Supposition, that you had gone to
Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and askt <hi>his sense according to
his Rules,</hi> de Juramento.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I doubt your Party will think you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
their Cause by Prevarication.</p>
               <p>1. I told you how publickly in a meeting of
Bishops, Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> gave his judgment about
Baptism against you.</p>
               <p>2. I cited the words of his Rules <hi>de Iuramento,</hi>
in the Book which you answer, as being plainly
against Conformity: And you give no answer to
it, and yet suppose them to be for you. This is
too supine neglect to satisfie us.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>You come over your foresaid sense of the
Declaration again, and</hi> pag. 160. <q>You have better
bethought you, and will take the Debate of the
Lords and Commons as useful to know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>What shall we do then by your</hi> Useful
<hi>Error? Why you now say,</hi> [You know nothing
in the Book but what may be assented to as true.]</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:60850:74"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And why was this so much disclaimed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
When you put us to the trouble of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you, you Confute your self by changing
your Cause, and so we labour in vain.</p>
               <p>Your Repetitions of the same things, with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and unsaying, and bare saying without proof
are so many, that I will not wrong the Reader
with Confuting any more of them, save only to
give you some account why I am sorry: 1. That
you retract your saying that <hi>Oaths</hi> are <hi>stricti juris,</hi>
2. And that while you pretend to own Bishop
<hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Rules <hi>de Iuramento,</hi> you renounce this
which is one of the chief of them. And I will tell
you the reasons of my dissent from that, and most
of your Book.</p>
               <p>IV. By <hi>stricti juris,</hi> is not meant the meer Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Sense as different from the less Proper, which
is more notified; but <hi>strict</hi> is contradistinguished
from <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>stretcht.</hi> I told you the Rule that
we go by in this, and it pleased you not to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it. Thus much I repeat:</p>
               <p>1. <q>We must take Oaths, Covenants, and
Professions imposed by Authority, in the sense
of the Imposers as near as we can know it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. <q>But if they discover their Sense in words
so unmeet, as that in the Vulgar Sense they seem
false or wicked, we must number such with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
words,</hi> unless we can by the publick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the <hi>Exposition</hi> avoid the Scandal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. <q>We are to take the Laws, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
words of Rules, especially in Oaths, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
and Professions, in that sense as those
words are commonly used and understood in
that <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> by Men of that Profession:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60850:74"/>
Unless the said Rulers make known, that they
use them in a different unusual sense.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4. <q>We must not presume that they mean not
as they speak, by an unusual sense, upon dark
and uncertain Conjectures, especially dictated
by our Interest, but only by Cogent Evidence.
These are our Rules.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reasons why we cannot Swear, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
or profess in your <hi>Laxe</hi> and <hi>stretched sense,</hi> nor
call that sense <hi>honest,</hi> as you do, (especially on
pretence of a Bishop's Exposition, contrary to what
I have reason to be fully satisfied our Law-makers
meant) are those which I gave you in the thirty
Aggravations, <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. which it did not please
you to contradict. These few I repeat:</p>
               <p>I. The words of the Third Command are
dreadful, God will not hold him guiltless that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his Name in vain, or falsly.</p>
               <p>II. Such licentious stretching of Oaths and
Professions overthrow that mutual trust which is
necessary to Humane Converse.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>It depriveth the King of his due security
of his Subjects Loyalty, and of his Peace and
Life. I much fear</hi> lest relaxing and stretching the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy but as much
as you relax and stretch the words of the Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Declaration, Liturgie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may untie the
Consciences of Rebels and King-killers so far, as to
make way for, and consist with Rebellion, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the King.</p>
               <p>IV. It seemeth to me most dangerously to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Lives of all the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
to the will of their Enemies, and to be a Vertual
Murdering of many, or any (if not all) Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60850:75"/>
that have Enemies: For while two false
Swearers may take away a Mans Life, if Men
are taught to stretch Oaths and Equivocate, it
will embolden the Consciences of Men so far, as
that few Mens Lives shall have any security, but
be at the mercy of any Rogues. It is a wonder
of God's Merciful Providence, that false Swearers
murder no more than they do: But such a <hi>Laxity</hi>
would make our Case far more dangerous.</p>
               <p>V. I that greatly fear lest God's <hi>late dreadful
Corporation Iudgments, Plague, Flames, Poverty,
and Divisions,</hi> are inflicted for <hi>Corporation Sins,</hi>
and among those Sins, eminently for <hi>Perjury,</hi> am
more inclined to call them in <hi>Bradford</hi>'s words at
the Stake, <hi>Repent, O England,</hi> than to encourage
them in such Sin, and by Printing, to persuade
them <hi>not to repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. When we cry out of the Jesuits for stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oaths and Testimonies, and all words by
Equivocations, and Mental Reservations, to the
endangering of Kings and Kingdoms, and Mens
Lives and Souls, it ill beseemeth us to imitate or
encourage them, or to enable them to say, that
they stretch words no more than we.</p>
               <p>VII. It would be an unexcusable Sin in such a
one as I, who live not in another Age, Land, or
Place, where the Imposers sense could not be
known, but in the same Age, and Place, and
have had so many Personal Treaties with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> who were
the chief promoters of the Impositions, and who
know so many of the Parliament and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that made these Forms, and have had so great
and satisfactory testimony of their Minds and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60850:75"/>
Meanings, and their Speeches and Reasons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
upon these subjects; and am fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in my Conscience, that you satisfie their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is not the sense of any Bishops that came
in since that Act was made, nor of any odd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is to pass for the Law-makers sense.</p>
               <p>VIII. People commonly think that Preachers
should be so much more holy than they, that if
they come but near us they are safe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we stretch Oaths and Covenants, they may
do that, and such as they count lesser Sins than
Perjury; and so we may harden them to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>IX. It is a heinous aggravation of Sin to do it
as for God, and that we may serve him in the
Ministry.</p>
               <p>X. It is a dreadful thing to undertake to justifie
thousands whom we never knew, as well as the old
Parliament Men whom we know, and to prove
that they ought not to Repent, nor to endeavour
Church Reformation, if it should prove that by
a Vow they are bound to such endeavour by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means.</p>
               <p>XI. I dare not provoke God to desert me in my
Ministry, (yea, and in my secret Comforts) nor
tempt Men to think basely of the Ministers as a
Perjured sort of Men, who cry down other Mens
Sins, while they have greater of their own.</p>
               <p>XII. It is a dreadful aggravation to do all this
(not by sudden Surprize, but) upon Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make a Covenant against Duty and
for Sin, and to say I ought to do it, and never to
Repent; yea, and by justifying it to harden mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
against Repentance: Especially if it tend to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60850:76"/>
corrupt the publick state of the Church, and
Worship.</p>
               <p>For these Reasons I cannot use Violence with
imposed Oaths, Covenants, or Professions; but
must expound them in the common sense of Men
of that Profession, till the Law-makers themselves
shall declare that they mean otherwise.</p>
               <p>And all this I speak but as the Reasons of our
own Practice, and not at all to accuse any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists:
Yea, I so far excuse them against the <hi>Non-conforming
Conformist,</hi> that I do take the chief
Men of them whom I have known, to mean plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they speak: I suppose they really Assent and
Consent to all things contained and prescribed in
the Books; and really mean contrary to your
stretching Expositions of Infants Salvation, of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
Communion, Burial, and the rest. And by
Dr. <hi>William Smith</hi>'s Books, and such others, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they take such Conforming Non-conformists
to be (as the late <hi>Westminster</hi> Assembly proved)
the most dangerous underminers of their Church.</p>
               <p>And when we have Confuted such as you, our
Work is all to begin again, with the serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,
who deal plainly and go on other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

            <head>The Second Part.</head>
            <head type="sub">Mr. Cheney's Five Undertakings
Considered.</head>
            <p>§ 1. DEar Brother, you and I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
our selves as Publick
Warnings to Mankind, to take
heed of an overvaluing of their
own Understandings, and of a hasty confidence in
their Erroneous Conceptions, and of rash obtruding
that upon the World as necessary Truth, for want
of Judgment and Time to digest things, which will
prove very dangerous Error; and if received and
practised, alas, what Mischief may it do! Erring Men
know not that they Err: If I think it is you, and
you think it is I, and a third think it is both, the
Reader greatly profiteth by us, who learneth by
our Harms, to have a due suspicion of his own
Understanding; and so it be without unnecessary
Scepticism, to have humble thoughts of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
which have not had time and helps conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to ripen them: Especially if your Friend or
you be Conscious, that you have formerly or late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been as confident in that which you now see
was your Error, you should think that the same
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60850:77"/>
Mind is still in danger of Deceit, and it's as easie
to reel into the other Extreme.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Oh what cause have we to pray, <hi>Lead us
not into temptation!</hi> we little know what is in our
Hearts or others, till just Trial call it up: Nor
what great hurt even good Men may live to do.
And if one Error get in, to how many worse
it may open the Door. And if we begin to roul
down the Hill, how little know we where to stop?
But though Satan desire to have us that he may
sift us, I hope Christ's Intercession will keep our
Faith from failing. But wo, and alas, that we
must, one or both (which ever is in the wrong)
be instruments of Mischief against the Interest of
our dear Lord, and his Truth and Church, and
Mens Souls, whilst both our desires are to live in
the World for no other end, but to build up that,
which by Ignorance, Self-conceitedness, Error,
and Rashness, we are laboriously pulling down.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And if it be I that have by Error wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Church, my Case is made worse by your
strengthening my Temptation, when instead of
convincing Argument, you give me little but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Assertions; and saying <hi>[I conceive,]</hi> and run
into such Singularities as all sober Men are bound
to suspect, and some condemn almost all Christ's
Churches, without one word of Convincing
Proof.</p>
            <p>§ 4. That you Answer only in Print to the
World, the private Talk that I had with you,
whilst you gave me no Vocal Answer, I take but
for a small and modal Irregulatity: Some Men
have Humours and Ways of their own, which
they will follow. Had you done it as judiciously,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60850:77"/>
and truly, with fear of Erring and Seducing, as
you did it publickly, the rest might be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted:
But we must take it as it is.</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>QUESTION. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>WHether it be certain by God's Word, that
Infants Baptized dying before Actual
Sin, be undoubtedly saved?</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 1. I expected your Work had been to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Men of the good of Conformity: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is to save Men from being seduced by my
Directory, you may doubt whether you will not
rather tempt some impartial Men to read the
words: And then your work is spoiled, when they
compare them with your Accusation.</p>
               <p>§ 2. I lookt for some plain Text of Scripture,
to prove this both <hi>certain by God's Word, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted:</hi>
But finding none such, I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you hereafter, when you have mind to shew
your Argumentative strength, leave out the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
pretence of the <hi>Word of God:</hi> Holy things
must be holily used.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>Your first Argument is, that</hi> [A Carnal
Christian hath propriety in his Child, and therefore
may devote him to God, as he may his Goods.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It had been more piously prudent to hear
what could be said to such pretty new Knacks,
before you had tempted the Church by publishing
them.</p>
               <p>1. Your first Proof is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28.
and there are but 25 Verses in the Chapter, and
none to your purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:60850:78"/>
The next is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 28. Did you ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Text? <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> and the Rabbies, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
from the Notation of the word, and from
the express words, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. that it is devoting of
Slaves, or Malefactors to death, that is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of: Others better, That it includeth both the
absolute dedication of acceptable Persons to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and of odious Persons to Death: Therefore
all are not saved that are here called holy as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted:
Neither the <hi>Cursed,</hi> nor the <hi>Levites,</hi> that
by dedication obliged to Service, are hereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
For more than Obligation is necessary to
the reward. The First-born were specially to be
given to God, and yet that implied not their
certain Salvation.</p>
               <p>2. A Dissembler may by his Covenant obtain a
right with Man, that knoweth not his Heart;
and he may be received into the outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church by God's Approbation,
who Commissioneth Ministers who know not mens
Hearts, to receive Men according to their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And these are <hi>holy to the Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi>
were; but not therefore under a promise that they
shall be undoubtedly saved. Were all the <hi>Iews</hi>
saved because they were a <hi>holy Nation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Not only his Child, but the grossest hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
Lyar himself, who is Baptized, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into the Church in Malice to betray, it, is yet
holy as a Visible Member; and hath obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to real Holiness, and yet is far from a state of
Salvation.</p>
               <p>4. Nothing is holy and accepted by the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Act alone, without God's accepting Act: Nor
<hi>any further,</hi> or to any other uses than God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60850:78"/>
it to. Some he accepteth unto Visible
Membership and Communion, and some to the
Sacred Ministry, and some to Magistracy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
who are not accepted to Salvation.</p>
               <p>5. Doth <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. prove, that all Nations in
the World might devote their Children unto God,
with the same assurance of acceptation as the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The Jewish Mosaical Law is abrogated, and
neither bindeth us as such, nor secureth us of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
for obeying it.</p>
               <p>7. All Heathens and Infidels have some proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their Children; and yet if in unbelief they
devote them with the Tongue alone to God, that
will not make their Salvation undoubted.</p>
               <p>8. Few God-Fathers have propriety in them:
How then will their devoting prove their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>9. God hath made no promise of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which you can shew; therefore you cannot
by his Word be certain of it.</p>
               <p>10. God saith, that the <hi>Sacrifice of the wicked
is an abomination to Him;</hi> much more when he
doth it with an evil mind: And he expressly saith,
<hi>[Else were your Children unclean</hi> (if one Parent
were not a Believer) <hi>but now are they holy.]</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when both Parents are Unbelievers, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are not accepted of God as holy.</p>
               <p>11. The question is, <hi>of all Baptized Children:</hi>
For it is <hi>Quatenus Baptizati,</hi> that they are said to be
saved; and <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet consequentia:</hi>
And it's an Indefinite <hi>in re necessariâ:</hi> But we
have too many scorners at Christianity, followers
of <hi>Hobbes, Spinosa, Pomponatius,</hi> and <hi>Vaninus,</hi> who
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60850:79"/>
for fashion sake, will bring their Children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:
And certainly such are far worse than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
If one believeth not in Christ, tell a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lye, and say he believeth, can any Man think
that his Child shall be ever the more saved for his
Wickedness and Hypocrisie?</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>You gather Christ's acceptance from</hi> Mat.
10. 13. &amp;c. It is not said of the Infants of the
Godly only, is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Nor is it said that</hi> of all Infants, <hi>or of</hi>
all Baptized Infants, <hi>is the</hi> Kingdom of Heaven.
<hi>The Text will prove indeed, that the</hi> Infant state
is capable of Christ's acceptance into the Kingdom of
Grace, and of Glory. <hi>But not that nothing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
thereto, but that</hi> they be Infants.</p>
               <p>If <hi>all</hi> Infants be saved, bringing them to Christ
was not necessary to their Salvation. If all only
that were brought to Christ were saved, it seems
they were very few.</p>
               <p>2. Is it like that any would bring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Christ to be Blessed, who did not believe
in him? And what reason have we to surmise that
they were not sound Believers?</p>
               <p>3. As Christ healed some blind Men, and not
all, and some Lepers, Sick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so if as a <hi>Specimen,</hi>
to shew that Infant state is capable of Grace, he
took up some Infants of Hypocrites, or Infidels,
or impious Parents, (which can never be proved)
it will not follow that all such shall be received,
and that to Salvation.</p>
               <p>4. If by verbal profession Parents and their
Children are taken into the outward Covenant and
Church, and by Water Men are born into the
Visible Kingdom of God, it followeth not they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60850:79"/>
need not to be born of the Spirit for admission into
the <hi>Invisible</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Kingdom;</hi> or that the
Spirit always goeth with the Water; and that the
Parents <hi>answer of a good Conscience to God,</hi> is not
necessary to his Child's Covenant-right to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well as to his own.</p>
               <p>5. I deny that <hi>any wicked Man</hi> (much more
<hi>every one) doth,</hi> yea, or <hi>can,</hi> univocally and
truly, devote his Child to God according to the
sense of the Baptismal Covenant. Though I grant
that the love of his Childs Lust do not hold him
so strongly as the love of his own; yet he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so knew God in Christ, and so believed in
Christ, and so believed in him as to perceive
him practically to be better for himself than
all the World and sinful Pleasures, cannot with
a true and practical Affiance, so take him for his
Child.</p>
               <p>6. And God no where commandeth, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
the devoting of our Infants to him prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
or as seperated from our selves; but only as
<hi>Appendices,</hi> or Conjunct with us; that is, that we
<hi>devote our selves and ours:</hi> And so not without us,
but with us doth he accept them.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Your great pretended Proof is, That all
the Males of <hi>Israel were Circumcised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If you had proved that they were all
<hi>saved,</hi> you had said more to the matter.</p>
               <p>2. To open here the nature of the <hi>Iews</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Peculiarity, as one select Nation of whom
Christ should come, as distinct from, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
with the common antecedent Covenant of
Grace, and to shew the reasons of the Institution
of Circumcision of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s peculiar Seed, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60850:80"/>
not for all that from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the common Law of Crace, would be a work
which such a light occasion would not warrant me
here to stand upon.</p>
               <p>3. The sign of Circumcision, was but the
seal anexed to the Covenant: And the meer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Act (as Water in Baptism) entered them
but into the External Church-state.</p>
               <p>4. Almost all the gross Sinners at least, if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
and impenitent, were to be put to death
by that Law; And dead Men beget not Children.
But I have so largely handled this in my 3d <hi>Disp.</hi>
of Right to Sacraments, that while you leave it
unanswered, I will not repeat it on so slight a
Cause.</p>
               <p>§ 6. And what if you had proved the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all wicked Christians Baptized Infants?
what's that to our Question, which extendeth to
<hi>all,</hi> not excepting the Children of profest Atheists,
Infidels, Sadduces, or Heathens, that have but
God-Fathers?</p>
               <p>§ 7. <hi>But</hi> pag. 8, 9. <hi>you tell us, that</hi> [<q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
by reason of their innocent harmless state,
seem to be Christ's Off-spring, and to be a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Root and Bottom to themselves, and to stand
by their own innocency under Christ, and by his
Divine Grace.—Look what Regeneration is to
the Adult, that in some sort the Infant-state may
be to Infants; that is, All Infants are in a New
and Second state by Christ: So the word Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
doth properly import.—<hi>Pag.</hi> 10. Christ
alone without Parents Godliness, is able to the
Salvation of all the Infant World.—I am not
able to prove that bare having of Circumcision and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60850:80"/>
Baptism doth save any; nor that the bare want
thereof doth bar any from Salvation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But what is this to Conformity? Did
you think that this was the meaning of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
that <hi>all Infants</hi> are saved, when it saith
<hi>All the Baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It doth not follow that Christ <hi>saveth all,
because he is able</hi> to save them.</p>
               <p>3. I have said so much to prove Original Sin,
and some participation of Guilt from our Parents
Sins, and to prove God's Promises to the Faithful
and their Seed, which are not made to the Infidels
and Wicked, in two Disputations of Original
Sin; that I refer you thither for your Answer to
this unproved Fiction, of the Salvation of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and their Regenerate Innocency.</p>
               <p>4. Woful experience tells us, as soon as they
can but speak and go, how far their Natures are
from an innocent disposition: And to be void of
holy Dispositions is not to be innocent.</p>
               <p>5. If they be conceived and born Innocent,
what need have they of Baptism for Remission of
Sin? If you say that Christ Regenerateth all as
he is the Giver of their Nature, the Church hath
condemned this in the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that make Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as from Christ, to be the same with Grace.</p>
               <p>6. If all be Pardoned, all have the Holy Ghost
(for Baptism giveth right to both.) But that's
not so.</p>
               <p>§ 8. <hi>Page</hi> 11. Did you satisfie your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in expounding, <hi>[But now are they holy,</hi>
1 Cor. 14.] after what we have said of it to Mr.
<hi>Tombes?</hi> Is it <hi>[Your Children are pure to you, as
your Meat is?]</hi>

§ 9. When you ask me <hi>[Why I say notoriously
ungodly.]</hi> You consulted not the credit of your
knowledg, to tell Men in Print, that you know
not what <hi>Notorious</hi> signifieth; no not in Notation,
or common use: As if it signified <hi>[more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.]</hi>
Notorious, is that which is certainly,
openly, easily, <hi>Knowable.</hi> I have told you of
some of my own Parishioners, that live in the
open opposition to Christianity, seeking in their
Converse to persuade Men, that the Scripture is
a Book of Lyes, and Christianity a meer Deceit,
and they will bring their Children to Baptism for
<hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi>-sake; and say all the Creed, and
words required (it was in the time when I had
leave to admit the Parent to enter his own Child
in the Covenant with God.) We know now
abundance of the followers of <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosa,</hi>
and many that deride Scripture, and the
hopes of Heaven, and the fears of a Hell, and
think Man is but a subtle sort of Beast: Yet these
will all have their Children Baptized, and to avoid
the penalty of the Law, will receive the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.
And there are others who are common scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Serious Religiousness, and persecutors of
it to their power; and hate him that will tell
them of the evil of the common Drunkenness and
Whoredom which they live in, and glory in their
Shame. We look for better proof than your
Wrigling-nothings, to make us undoubtedly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from God's Word, that the Baptized Infants
of all these are saved: The Rubrick meaneth,
<hi>[Quia &amp; qua, Baptized;]</hi> and you mean <hi>[Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
innocent, and Christ died for them, and all
the Unbaptized, are saved.]</hi> But as I see none
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60850:81"/>
of your proof of the latter, so I will not crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
crawl into Conformity by the fallacious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
And you that were, in your last Book,
uncertain your self of what you can now prove
certain, do so quickly Change, and so quickly
publish your Change, that your judgment hath
the less power by any reverence of it to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of mine.</p>

should after this be convinced that our Cause is
wrong, by one that neither will be at the labour
distinctly to state the Controversy, nor to reply to
my Answers already given to all his Reasonings and
much more, nor to answer the many Arguments
which I and others urge, but saith little more of
any moment than <hi>[I am induced to think thus,
though I once thought otherwise:]</hi> Yea, when you
neither answer our Reasons, nor give us the tenth
part so much for your Cause as we answered, yet
we must not think that it <hi>[is on slight grounds]</hi>
that you have taken up your Opinion, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. when
what you say is so slight, that as I will not write
over again what you vouchsafe not to answer; so,
if your Reader have read my Book cited by you,
I will not so reproach his judgment as to think,
that he needeth any farther answer to this of
yours. But if he have not read mine, nor will
read it, he is in no danger of being seduced by it,
and so your labour is in vain.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But, Reader, lest so small a word as his
oft <hi>[I conceive,]</hi> should prove to the unwary
Synonimal to <hi>[I deceive,]</hi> I shall advertise thee
briefly.</p>
               <p>I. That my way was to distinguish of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>1. As from Heathenism, or Infidelity, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanism,
or Heresie.</p>
               <p>2. From gross Hypocrisie manifested by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
wicked Life.</p>
               <p>3. From close Hypocrisie not proved.</p>
               <p>4. From a particular fall of a sincere Christian,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60850:82"/>
to his integrity; or from some tolerable Error and
Mistake.</p>
               <p>II. I use to distinguish between <hi>Being sincere</hi>
in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and knowing that we are
Sincere.</p>
               <p>III. I use to define what the <hi>Conversion</hi> is that
I speak of, in such Controversie.</p>
               <p>IV. And I never confound the Case <hi>[Whether
it may be demanded,]</hi> with the Case <hi>[whether it
may be delivered.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. And I still distinguish between <hi>[A means
which an Unconverted self-knowing Man, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God to use for his Conversion,]</hi> and [a
means which God can use, or consequently the
Sinner should in the review make use of hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
supposing that he hath unlawfully intruded.]
As if a Man unlawfully invade the sacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Office, when he is in it, there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that may become a means of his Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Or if one that hath vowed Celibate, Marry
a godly Person unlawfully, it may become a
means of their Conversion.</p>
               <p>Now to make this Controversie intelligible to
the unstudied, I would here perform all these
parts, and distinctly by Propositions open the
Matter: But it is done in the <hi>Disputations of Right
to Sacraments,</hi> which he opposeth: And if every
Nibbling of one that refuseth the rational task of
a sober Confuter, shall call a Man to write new
Books, there will be no end of tiring Readers.
I doubt I have Erred already, in not letting some
talk on, and shew their Mistakes and false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
without any Confutation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60850:83"/>
§ 3. He doth indeed limit the Case to <hi>[the
Unconverted within the Church,]</hi> and you would
think that by this he excluded Heathens, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
Infidels, and Hereticks. But remember,</p>
               <p>1. That the Baptized not Excommunicate,
are in the Universal Church.</p>
               <p>2. And that a <hi>particular Church</hi> with him, seems
to be nothing but a <hi>worshipping Assembly;</hi> and
all that are there are in the Church, and when
the Meeting breaks up, the Church is no Church.</p>
               <p>3. And yet sometimes you would that think he
took a Parish of such Assemblers for a Church.</p>
               <p>4. And it is matter of Fact past all dispute, that
not only all the Papists, the first ten Years of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> came to our Churches, and some
do so still; but that abundance such as aforesaid,
come to the Parish Churches, who in Coffee-Houses
talk against Christianity, or the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soul, or the Scriptures, and such as
write Books to the same purposes; and these are
not converted from Sadducism, Beastiality, or
Infidelity.</p>
               <p>5. And then mark whether any of this Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Arguments do prove, that the Sacrament of
the Lord's Supper, was ordained for such Men to
use for their Conversion.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Remember that the <hi>full Conversion to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing-Sincerity,</hi>
is nothing else but <hi>[sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Baptismal Covenant.]</hi> And every such
<hi>Consenter,</hi> and only such (Adult) are savingly
converted. And that it is not <hi>that Covenant,</hi>
when any <hi>essential part</hi> is omitted: To believe in
the <hi>Father</hi> and not the <hi>Son,</hi> or not in the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> is not that Covenant: Now the Person in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60850:83"/>
question, <hi>To receive the Sacrament as the Sacrament,</hi>
(Baptism, or the Eucharist) and not to <hi>profess
Consent</hi> to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> is a contradiction; no
Man can do it: <hi>Covenanting</hi> is <hi>essential</hi> to it. And
it is essential to it to be by God's Commission a
<hi>Solemn actual investing Delivery, with application
to the just receiver of a saving Right to God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and actual present
pardon of Sin, and right to Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. And the Person in question is either,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>One that</hi> Consenteth not, and knoweth that
he consenteth not.</p>
               <p>2. Or that <hi>Consenteth not and thinks he doth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he consenteth to some part.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Or one that</hi> consenteth not, and knoweth not
whether he do or not.</p>
               <p>(4. For, as for all true Consenters that know
not that they do it sincerely, they are Converted
Persons, and not those in Question: And a true
Consenter that doubteth of his truth, but upon his
best self-trial, thinks that he truly consenteth to
have God for his God, and Christ for his Saviour,
and the Holy Ghost for his Sanctifier, must go
without certainty upon the best judgment that he
make of himself.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. Now for the Person that</hi> consenteth not, and
knoweth it, <hi>to come and demand the Sacrament
for his Conversion, is all one as to say, that</hi> [It is
God's Ordinance, that he is not willing after all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions,
to give up himself to God, as his Father,
Saviour, and Sanctifier, and therefore hath no right
to Pardon and Life, shall solemnly profess that he
doth consent to the Covenant when he doth not, and
that he doth presently by Vow give up himselfe to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60850:84"/>
God, as his God and Father, Saviour and Sanctifier,
when he doth not; that this may convert them to do
that which lyingly he saith he doth: <hi>And he shall
take the investing pardoning Sign and Act, when
he hath no right to Pardon.] Deceive not your
self, or others:</hi> Giving and Taking, Eating and
Drinking, <hi>are as</hi> Speaking <hi>(significant Actions)
essentially to the Sacrament: And he never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Sacrament essentially as that Sacrament,
that did not thereby interpretatively solemnly
profess,</hi> q. d. [I now consent to the Covenant of
Christ, and take God in Christ for my Father, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and Sanctifier, and here give up my self to
him in these Relations.] <hi>And therefore all the
Ancients taught, that the</hi> Baptized <hi>were all</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
presently pardoned; <hi>supposing that they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consented to the Baptismal Covenant, as every
adult Baptized Person did, and must profess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And can you believe that this was Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
q. d. [Come and solemnly be Perjured,
and Lye, and say, Thou consentest to the Covenant
when thou dost not, that this may convert thee to
Consent. <hi>All your mistaken row of words, will
never make this soul Cause fair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But what if it be a Man that consenteth
not but thinketh he doth, or yet doth not know?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is his Sin not to know that he consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not; and that will not make it lawful for him
to Lye, and Vow falsly. But the harder it is for
him to know his own Mind, the more excusable
he is: And a false entrance is not a Sin that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable,
nor is the Sinner uncurable, but may
be converted in the Church, though he came in
unlawfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:60850:84"/>
§ 6. While preposterously you tell us who
you think hath right to Baptism, and the Lord's
Supper, you pass over the Fundamental Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
as if you <hi>knew</hi> it not; which is, <hi>What
Baptism and the Lord's Supper are.</hi> This is it that
we are mostly disagreed about: End this, and end
all. I suppose you take Baptism to be the first Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and that less is not necessary to the
Lord's Supper than to it. And I presume to tell
you, that Christ never ordained, nor the Church
ever used any other Baptism of the Adult, than
1. That which delivered the present Remission
of Sin, and right to Life, to the just receiver of
Baptism; 2. and that which contained on the
part of the Receiver, his present profession of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith and Repentance, that is, his true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Covenant.</p>
               <p>§ 7. <hi>The Scripture telleth us, that</hi> Baptism
saveth, <hi>as containing the</hi> answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God: <hi>And that as</hi> many as are Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, have put on Christ, and have professed
that they are buried with him by Baptism into his
Death, and raised with him to newness of Life,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 8. God in great Mercy hath delivered down
to us from the Apostles, the form of Baptism by
a fuller Tradition than the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any things else of our Religion are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
All Ages and Churches to this Day, have
retained the same form as to all the Essential parts:
The very words of the Baptizer and the Baptized,
the <hi>Credo, Abrenuncio,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> professed full shew
that all used this one Baptism, which was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Vow and Covenanting with God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60850:85"/>
of the Flesh, the World, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
for present (delivered) pardon and right to
Christ and Life. See the long List in <hi>Gataker</hi>
against <hi>Davenant,</hi> of the Ancients that took all
the Baptized for justified.</p>
               <p>In a word, If you make another Species of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
which hath lower Conditions and Gifts only
than these, I am past doubt;</p>
               <p>1. That you introduce a new sort of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>2. That you hereby would change the very
Essence of the Church, and wofully corrupt it:
A worse thing than to impose new Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>3. That by denying the truth of so universal
concurrent Tradition, as the form of Baptism hath;
you will shake Mens Faith by weakning the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of that Tradition, by which we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Bible: It being a harder matter to keep
all the words of such a Book, than the Form of
Baptism, used on every Christian in the World.</p>
               <p>4. That you will too grosly reproach all the
Christian Churches, as if they had in all Ages
and Places been ignorant what Christening and
Christianity is, and had used a false Baptism, till
of late.</p>
               <p>5. You will contradict the Church of <hi>England</hi>
which you Conform to, and all the Churches now
in the World, which in their form of Baptizing, and
their Catechisms and Confessions tell us, of no
Baptism, but what is a <hi>present Covenanting with God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> as consenters to
his Covenant, giving up our selves to him in the
foresaid Relations, for present Pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See
Dr. <hi>Hammona</hi>'s <hi>Pract. Cat.</hi> of the Baptismal Vow.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60850:85"/>
And is all this fit Work for two or three singular
Men? To deny the said History, is to be grosly
Ignorant, or Immodest.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> § 1. 1. What's this to the Primitive
Churches that were not Parishes? Or to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
that yet are not settled into Parish Churches?
Or to such Churches as are but tolerated among
Papists Parishes?</p>
               <p>2. And all that is here mentioned, the Papists
did for the first ten Years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And remember that we have in our Parishes,
many that are open Atheists, Infidels, Sadduces,
Persecutors, Scorners of the Scripture and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
open boasting impenitent Whore-mongers,
Blasphemers, Drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many that
openly deny the Ministry, and Sacraments; and
yet to avoid Penalty, and for Custom, will do
all that is here named, though they deride it:
And that all these are to be received (though also
you suppose that they never so much as professed
consent to the Baptismal Covenant) you take on
you to prove.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because it is the Will of Christ.</hi> [Oh! Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
dread such additions to Christ's Words.]
And how is that proved? Why, <hi>[None but Dogs

But,</p>
               <p>1. Did you think that a <hi>credible profession of

Conversion? Are not true Christians saved? What
else are Men to be Converted to?</p>
               <p>2. Do all such as are afore <hi>described,</hi> make such
a credible profession of true Christianity?</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi>You tell us that the Standard that Christ
hath set is that,</hi> [<q>If now thou be sincerely Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
thy Sin is pardoned, and thou hast right to
Salvation, and mayst come to the Lord's Table.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And doth not this imply, that else he
should not come? And is such a Man Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted?</p>
               <p>It is too irksome to rake up the rest of your
Contradictions, and examine your slight words
of the Parable of the Tares: But that rooting up
the Tares forbidden is <hi>Excommunicating,</hi> or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sacramental Communion</hi> to any Parishioner
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60850:87"/>
of your Description, who will believe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?</p>
               <p>1. What Christ saith, <hi>Mat. 18. 15. &amp;c.</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. and 2 <hi>Thess. 3. Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Or he that knoweth that the Universal
Church of Christ in all Ages, hath been of
another mind; and indeed went at last too far
against it, having no punishment for Christians,
but Suspension and Excommunication.</p>
               <p>3. And that the Christian World at this day is
of another mind, though the <hi>Helvetians</hi> are too
remiss in the Principles, and most in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>4. And that the Canons of this Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Minister to deny the Sacrament to some
such as you describe: And in your former Book,
you pleaded this as for Conformity: And are you
changed already? And shall any Wise Man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such quick Changes?</p>
               <p>5. The Church of <hi>England</hi> forbids us to give
the Sacrament to any that are not Confirmed, and
desire it not, or are not ready: But such are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Description.</p>

a thousand, or many hundred Churches be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Bishop and the Chancellor, or Officials,
and so all the Parish Ministers denied it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
all these Churches must be Prophaned and
Confounded at the will of one Man, or because
he cannot do an Impossibility. And the reasons why
Christ would have his Church to be visibly Holy,
and a Communion of Saints, and openly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
from the <hi>notoriously ungodly,</hi> are so many
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60850:87"/>
and so great, that I will not here attempt the

In some ignorant Persons that know not the
Essentials of Christianity, nor will learn, or let
the Minister instruct them any where but in the

Extortioner, with such a one, no not to eat. Do
not ye judg them that are within,</hi> 2 Thess. 3. It
is the <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>disorderly:</hi> And these are ordinary
in some places.</p>
               <p>But we easily grant that <hi>Excommunications</hi> are
not to be used Tyranically, or when they do more
hurt than good. And if the Body of a Church
turn, <hi>e. g. Socinians,</hi> or professedly ungodly, and
will not be Reformed, the Excommunication
which we plead for is, but withdrawing from them
and renouncing their Communion, declaredly.</p>
               <p>§ 2. I have oft said, that <hi>Perfidious Covenant-breakers
who live in gross Sin, and still tell the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
they repent, and will not be persuaded to leave
their Sin,</hi> (e. g. <hi>Whoredom, Drunkenness, Stealing,
Perjury, Blasphemy,) have so far forfeited the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of their bare word, that the Pastor should see
their actual amendment before he Absolve them.</hi>
And now your Hand is in, the World must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from this Doctrine too. But because it is a
common principle in Nature, and in all Church
Canons, and the common judgment of Divines, I
will not stay to dispute it with you. But when
you are a Master of a Family, if you think Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Discipline a Duty, Experience will cure your
credulity: If your Servant or Son beat you, or
spit in your Face, or Rob you once a Day, or
Week, but for one Year together, and say still
after it, <hi>I repent.</hi> But what will not Men talk
for?</p>

               <p>WHether Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Doctrine and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
concerning particular Churches be
sound and good? <hi>And you confute them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Those that read them are in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by them. And those that do, may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by so slight a confutation (as I said.)</p>
               <p>2. As for my Book of <hi>[Universal Concord of
all Christian Churches,]</hi> I know that the Devil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it so much, that I expect some far more subtile
Assault than yours; or else I shall think that the
Devil wanteth wit or power, more than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
believed. But I am sorry that he hath drawn
so good a Man to be his instrument.</p>
               <p>§ 1. <hi>My first mentioned Error is</hi> [That a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church is a regular part of the Universal
Church, as a City is of a Kingdom.] <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
is</hi> [In this I conceive he is out: A parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church is to the Church Universal with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Town, consisting of a Magistrate Governing,
and People governed, according to the general
Rules and Principles of Society, is to all the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The proof is <hi>[I conceive he is out,]</hi> and
an Assertion in other words of the same that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
and so we are <hi>out both</hi> (or neither.)</p>
               <p>1. I used the <hi>Name,</hi> and he the <hi>Definition:</hi> It
may be he thought that by <hi>[City]</hi> I had meant
only such Towns as are so called in <hi>England:</hi>
But methinks he should know that the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth all such Towns as he defineth, and
that it is the common definition of <hi>Civitas</hi> which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60850:89"/>
he giveth us, as all Politicks speak <hi>de Civitate:</hi>
It is therefore the same subject in the Similitude,
which we both speak of.</p>
               <p>2. The difference then must be between the
words [Kingdom] and [World.] I say, <hi>A
Church is such a part of the Universal, as a City is
of a Kingdom:</hi> He saith, no, but <hi>[as a City is
of the World.]</hi> What a dangerous Error hath he
detected? But, <hi>All the World is God's Kingdom:</hi>
And as <hi>it hath</hi> but <hi>one King,</hi> so I thought I might
liken it to a <hi>Kingdom</hi> that hath one <hi>King,</hi> but a
multitude of Corporations; without stretching the
Similitude to intend that <hi>[This Kingdom is not a
part of the World.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>My second Error is,</hi> [<q>He that will be a
Member of a particular Church, must cohabit, or
dwell near.</q>] <hi>The confutation is,</hi> [<q>I conceive
he is out.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What, is he against Parish Churches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this? No: He only denieth it of a <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
Member <hi>pro tempore</hi> as a Traveller, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it as to a <hi>stated</hi> Member. And yet I am out.
Many and many a time have I written of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and use to distinguish first of the Equivocal
Name, saying, That an occasional meeting of
Christians for Worship, may be called a Church,
and a transient Christian <hi>pro tempore</hi> a Member:
I have written more this way than ever he did.
But declared that it is a <hi>settled Political Society</hi> that
I defined, when I speak of what he now accuseth.
And why should a wise and good Man thus hastily
trouble the World and make discord by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because he cannot have leisure to know, what
he speaks against?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:60850:89"/>
§ 3. <hi>My third Error is,</hi> [<q>That to the being of
a particular Church there is necessary a mutual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or exprest consent between Pastor and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
even every Member, and the more express the
better: And I define a Church to be a Society of
Christians consisting of Pastor and People associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by consent.</q>]</p>
               <p>The force of the Confutation is, <hi>[I conceive he
is out.]</hi> But wherein is it? We have here such
work as I never met with before.</p>
               <p>1. He granteth that none are to each other, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
and People against their Wills.</hi> Good still. And
yet do I err? <q>
                     <hi>[But</hi> (saith he) <hi>as Christ is Christ,
and a Saviour by Office whether Sinners will or
not: So faithful Ministers are Pastors by Office,
whether the People accept them or no.]</hi>
                  </q> Reader,
it is not the least blemish of my Writings, that on
divers occasions I oft repeat the same things: And
many a time have I distinctly said, 1. That the
<hi>Ordainers</hi> judge who shall be a Minister of Christ
in general. 2. The Magistrate is judge whom he
will Countenance, Maintain, or Tolerate. 3. And
the People must be <hi>consenting judges</hi> to whom they
will trust the conduct of their Souls: As it's one
thing to be a Licensed Physician, and another to be
Physician to this Hospital, or Person. If this Brother
mean otherwise, what meant he by saying, that
<hi>No Man can be a Pastor to a People against their
will?</hi> Doth he say, and unsay in the next Lines? Is
Christ any Man's actual Saviour whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him, and accept him or not? I have oft
said, that in divers Cases, the People may be <hi>bound
in duty to Consent,</hi> as all are <hi>bound to be Christians:</hi>
But they are no <hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Church-members,</hi> till
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60850:90"/>
they <hi>do Consent:</hi> What then is it that he meaneth
as our Difference?</p>
               <p>§ 4. <hi>Yes: He saith,</hi> [<q>No more is necessary to
the being, or well-being of a particular Church
than this; A company of Christians met together in
publick for the Solemn Worship of God by Iesus
Christ, having a Pastor or Minister with them to
guide and govern the Congregation, and edifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and them by the Word and Sacraments; where
there is no Assembly of Pastor and People there is no
Church, and no longer than the Assembly lasteth
are they a Church.</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Did the World ever here this Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
When the Church at <hi>Ierusalem, Corinth,
Cenchrea, Colosse, Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. and the Churches
in <hi>Iudea, Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. are mentioned, when the
Apostles ordained them Elders in every Church,
<hi>Acts 14. 23. Tit. 1. 3, 5. &amp;c.</hi> Is the word <hi>Church</hi>
here taken for no Christians longer than they are
Assembled? Doth not Scripture, Canons, Fathers,
and all Writers speak of Churches as <hi>Associated
Christians,</hi> remaining Churches all the Day, and
Year, and not only while Assembled? If the word
Church may be taken for a Transient Assembly,
doth it follow that there is <hi>no other?</hi> Have we so
many Books of Ecclesiastical Policie, if there be
no Political Society that is a particular Church?
What an unpleasing <hi>talk</hi> is it to be put on a defence
against such an Opponent?</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi>Saith he</hi> [<q>I would but ask Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
what is it that you mean <hi>by</hi> Associated by consent?</q>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Have I in the Books, cited by you, so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told you what I mean, and must you print the
Question before you will take an Answer? Saith
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60850:90"/>
he <hi>[<q>Either you mean bare Assembling, or some
other thing.</q>] Ans.</hi> Will you better understand
me if I write it again than you did before? When
I told you at large, in what Cases express consent
by words, or other signs is meet, and that where
the Laws settle Parish Churches, ordinary attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and submission to the Pastor's Office must be
taken for express Consent? But then I do hold that
there is such a Church as I describe, and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
is not Unchurcht when the Assembly is dismist.</p>
               <p>§ 6. He saith, <hi>[<q>When the Assembly breaks up,
the Church for that time ceaseth till the Meeting be
renewed, till which time they remain Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
Neighbours, Families, Parishioners, or
Sojourners, the Pastor of the place dwelling among
them.</q>] Ans.</hi> In your Equivocal sense of a
Church, this is true. In the Political sense they
are a Church still; as the Parliament, Citizens,
Souldiers, are a Parliament, City, Army, when
they Assemble not. If your wrangle be <hi>de re,</hi> do
you deny their <hi>continued Relation?</hi> If it be <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
let the Scripture and all Nations judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the name <hi>Church</hi> belong to them no longer
than they are Assembled.</p>
               <p>1. Then all that stay at Home, or are Sick,
are no Church-members.</p>
               <p>2. Then the Bishop or Pastor, hath no Church
but while Assembled: And he hath no Duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
for his Church, but while Assembled.</p>
               <p>3. This is quite contrary to our Diocesans, who
say (as honest Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> himself) that a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
is the first particular Church, and that it is no
matter how many Assemblies it consist of, and that
there is no Church without a Bishop, and so that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60850:91"/>
we have no more Churches than Bishops.</p>
               <p>4. If a Bishop build a Temple on <hi>London</hi> Road,
where Travellers shall be his ordinary Hearers,
whom he shall never see again, this is a Temporary
Transient Church; but verily it is another sort
Church that is described in Scripture, and
by <hi>Ignatius, Cyprian,</hi> and all Church-writers.
And when the Bishop was to visit the Sick, and take
care of the Poor, and to exhort from House to
House, it was as for a <hi>Church,</hi> and not meerly as
for Christian Neighbours: And do you think no
more consent was necessary to his special Duty to
these more than to others, and theirs to him, than
bare Assembling? Atheists, Infidels, Hereticks,
may Assemble with the rest; and Catechumens or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
did so, and were never made themselves
the judges, whether and when they should be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
and admitted to Communion; but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
were the judges.</p>
               <p>§ 7. As to your oft mentioning the words
<hi>[Covenants and Oaths]</hi> for such Church Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as if I had written for <hi>Oaths,</hi> or had not
written against all <hi>needless Covenants,</hi> which though
you say not, your words would make the Reader
believe, whilst over and over it is but <hi>Consent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently
expressed,</hi> which I require; those that know
not your Honesty as I do, I doubt will judge it to
savour of some worse Cause than I am willing to
name. If Consent be not expressed, how shall it
be known? And I still say <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> the
plainest Expressions are fittest to attain their End,
as the plainest Language is counted the best for
Communication: Oh! how much did <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and
all the old Churches differ from you about consent!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60850:91"/>
§ 8. Another of my Errors is to say, <hi>[He is
an Invader, that without consent intrudeth into their
Priviledges.] Ans.</hi> 1. But it is not he that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siently
cometh into the Temple; 2. But he that
will make himself one of my special Charge, and
oblige me to all the duty which I owe to my
Charge and cannot pay to all Men, and he that
will claim a Vote in choosing the Bishop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
if of old one of your mind had said, That every
Traveller or Stranger, that cometh within the
Room, may claim the Sacrament without any <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terae
Communicatoriae,</hi> upon his bare word, the
Bishops or Churches would not have believed you;
so singular are you in all this.</p>
               <p>You tell us, <hi>God hath made no such Corporations,
and every Christian is a Freeman,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> But how
shall I know whether every Stranger that cometh
in be a Christian, or was ever Baptized? Or be
not a Heretick Excommunicate by other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
Or if I am able to do the Office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
but for 500, and thousands more will come
and claim it?</p>
               <p>§ 9. Another of my Errors is, that <hi>Parish Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
and Oratories, are no true Churches. Ans.</hi> You
should not thus become an Incendiary, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
things that you will not first understand:
Where do I say what you affirm? I say, That there
may be several Chappels that are but parts of one
Church. 2. And I say, That if a Bishop be Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to a Church, then none below a Diocess is
a Church; and therefore that they that so affirm,
do put down all Parish Churches and turn them
into meer Chappels and Oratories, which are but
parts of a Church. 3. I never said, That if a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60850:92"/>
place called in <hi>English</hi> a Chappel (yea, if a Barn,
or Field, or Ship,) have such a Pastor and People
meeting, as a Church must be Constituted of, that
they are no true Church. 4. But if such Pastors
and People related as one Church, are by Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
forced to meet in several Houses, or the
Sick, Weak, or Distant, to meet sometime at a
Chappel, or without a true Pastor; if a Deacon
pray with some of them in a House, or Oratory,
this maketh not a Church Political, in the sense
that I told you I used that word in; but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(Equivocal) sense it may be called a Church,
and so a Family may be.</p>
               <p>If this be false you should have confuted it, and
not wrangle in the Dark.</p>
               <p>§ 10. You say that I blame the Bishops for
putting down <hi>all the Parish Bishops and Churches—
when I my self do no less by putting down all the
Chapple Ministers, Chappel Meetings and Oratories,
and denying them to be proper Pastors and Churches.
Ans.</hi> All false, or a meer Game at Equivocal words:
The word <hi>Chappel</hi> usually signifieth a place for the
Assembling of some small part of a Church, with
a Curate, or Houshold Chaplain, who hath only
power to Preach and Pray, (and sometimes to give
the Sacrament) but not to Govern: Sometime a
Chappel may have a Governing Pastor, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
subject to him in that relation, and differeth
but in name from the Parish Church. It is a meer
Chappel or Oratory, in the common sense, which
I say is not a Political Church.</p>
               <p>The falshood of your pretended parity of the
Cases I prove: Those Congregations which are
Constituted of Ministers of different Species, are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60850:92"/>
not of the same Species and Definition: But meer
Oratories, or Chappels, which have no Pastors that
have the power of the Keys for Government, and
Parish Churches which have such Pastors according
to the Divine Institution, are constituted of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of different Species: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are not of the
same Species and Definition (as you affirm.)</p>
               <p>2. Those Assemblies which intentionally meet
but as parts of the lowest Political Church, and those
that intentionally meet as the whole or main Body
of that Political Church, are not of the same Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Definition. (No more than a Squadron,
and a Captain's Company, or Troop; or a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and a Village or Town.) But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Bishops deny all the Lord's Chaplains to have
the governing power of the Keys, and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Chappels
to be true Political Churches of the
same Species and Definition with a Diocesan Church,
or a Parochial; do you confute them if you can,
I cannot. But if I prove that every Parochial, or
other proper Political Church <hi>infimae Speciei,</hi>
should by Divine Order have a Pastor that hath the
governing power of the Keys, and the Bishops de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
them any such, and will have but one such in
a Diocess; do you defend them if you can, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:
Nor are these Cases the same.</p>
               <p>§ 11. <hi>My next Error,</hi> 
                  <q>He cannot tell whether I
hold or no: But it seems I do; against compelling
Men to take whom the Magistrate please for their
Pastors: <hi>For I make</hi> Covenanting Essential, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Husband and Wife; likening the Church
Universal to a Kingdom, and particular Churches
to Cities and Corporations.</q>] <hi>And here he talks
of the</hi> Corporation Oath, <hi>and exclaimeth</hi> [<q>Is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60850:93"/>
this the way of curing Church Divisions? And is
this the true and only way of Concord?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Had you published and proved to us a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way, I hope we should have been thankful;
and so will I, if you will truly shew me the Errors
of the way that I commended. 1. He that hath
read my Books which plead for no Oaths, nor for
any Covenanting, but <hi>exprest consent to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Offices,</hi> will perhaps think that here you
were tempted to Injustice at the least.</p>
               <p>2. Is not the Church Universal Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
I rather liken it to a Kingdom, than to the
World, because (whatever you think) I think it
is not by Christ subdivided into many particular
Kingdoms as the World is, but only into many
particular Churches, keeping necessary Concord,
(and Obedience to Magistrates.) It is not one sort
only that militate against the Cure of <hi>Divisions,</hi> by
<hi>true Concord;</hi> but I am sorry that you are become
one. <hi>Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest
he fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 12. He saith, <hi>[It is Qualification that maketh
Christians.] Ans.</hi> No Qualifications without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and Covenanting with Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> [<q>It is Qualification and just Ordination,
which makes Christian Pastors and Ministers at
large.</q>] Ans. <hi>Do you confute me by repeating
my one words? And (saith he)</hi> [<q>It is their
being placed by the Magistrate in the several
Parishes, which makes them Pastors by Office,
and relation to all the Christian Souls in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
respectively.</q>—If Iesus Christ shall by the
Hand of the Magistrate set a faithful Minister in
the Parish, he becomes as to Office and Right a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60850:93"/>
a Guide, a Minister, and Teacher to their
Souls. If they receive him not, they are Rebels
and Traytors against Christ, and are no longer
Christian People, save as an Adulterous Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas, where can we say a Man will stop
when he is once tumbling down the Hill!</p>
               <p>1. Why, did you think your bare word should
serve for this? That it is Jesus Christ that made this
the Office of the Magistrate?</p>
               <p>2. Is it all Magistrates, or some only that have
this Power, and Jesus Christ chooseth us Pastors
by? If but some, what the better are we for your
Discourse, if you tell us not how to know them?</p>
               <p>And, 3. Will you not then put the People up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a harder and more perilous Task, to judge of
all Magistrates fitness for this Trust, than it would
be to judge of their Pastor.</p>
               <p>4. If it be all, then Heathens and Turks must
choose Christians their Pastors. If you say, It is all
Christian Magistrates, then the Protestants in <hi>France</hi>
are Rebels and not Christians, for refusing Papists
Priests: If it be not Papists, who are they? Must
all receive <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
or such like Pastors that live under Imposing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of those minds?</p>
               <p>5. Why do you limit it to <hi>[faithful Ministers]</hi>
who must judge of their <hi>Faithfulness</hi> and <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations?</hi>
If the Magistrate, Papists, Socinians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Magistrates, or Heretical, will judge as they
are. If the People, we are wheeled about to that
which is resisted: And then, <hi>When is it that they
must judge,</hi> before they receive him, or after? If
before, then must they have <hi>trial</hi> of him, or take all
for <hi>(Faithful)</hi> that are ordained by a Bishop? or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60850:94"/>
that Being Strangers, they know no harm by him?
or all the Patrons present? If so, we come to the
forementioned Misery. If they must receive them
first, and try them after, and depart from them
when they shew themselves unfaithful; then the
People must either depose their Pastors, or separate:
And most that separate from the Parish Churches, do
it as thinking the Ministers unfaithful: And is this
<hi>your Cure</hi> of Church-divisions? And if <hi>never
Preaching</hi> be a proof of the Unqualified, the Canon
forbids us to go from such. And in some Countrys
there are none within reach to go to from them:
And if there be, the Canon suspendeth them if they
receive one to their Communion, that goeth from
a <hi>Non-preaching</hi> Minister.</p>
               <p>6. Did any one Church on Earth receive a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
by the Magistrates imposition for the first 300
Years? Or had not the Churches then rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Pastors?</p>
               <p>7. Did not the Orthodox Churches commonly
refuse Bishops, which <hi>Valens,</hi> and such Erroneous
Emperors set over them?</p>
               <p>8. Were not Parish Ministers chosen by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and People, and not by Magistrates for 1400
Years in all known Churches in the World? It was
but the Patriarchs at first that were imposed on the
People by the Emperors; and afterwards when
the <hi>Henrys</hi> contended with the Pope, it was not for
choice of Priests, but for the Investiture of <hi>Bishops
and Abhots</hi> only; and in this they left the <hi>choice</hi> to
the <hi>People and Clergie,</hi> and pleaded but for <hi>Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
per baculum &amp; annulum;</hi> so that for ought I
know, Magistrates never imposed Priests on Parish
Churches till the Reformation: And since then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60850:94"/>
                  <hi>Helvetia</hi> and <hi>Belgia,</hi> it is but few that do it.
And even in <hi>England,</hi> it is not done by Magistracy,
but by <hi>Patrons presenting,</hi> and <hi>Diocesan Prelates In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting.</hi>
So that if this be Christ's <hi>Way</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Pastors to particular Churches, there were no
true Pastors or Churches for 300 Years, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
none, or next none for 1400 Years in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes:
And if this Doctrine be true, the Catholick
Christians in many Princes Reigns that rejected im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Bishops (if that were as bad as rejecting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Priests) were <hi>Rebels and Traytors against Christ,
and no Christians.</hi> And whether he so Stigmatize
not the <hi>Universal Church</hi> for want of such Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Priests, in almost all Ages, I wish him to
consider. And whether that be like to be a better
way of Concord, which he and few such in the end
of the World devise, to the condemning of the
Churches of all the former Ages, that never had
any such Concord?</p>
               <p>9. Hereby also he leaveth the Tolerated Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and all the <hi>Greek</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and <hi>Copties,</hi> and <hi>Syrians,</hi> &amp;c. that are under
adverse Princes, to be without Pastors sent in the
way of Christ's Appointment. (And yet vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth
not to name one Text where Christ ever Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it.)</p>
               <p>10. And when he maketh <hi>all in a Parish</hi> to be
the Pastors <hi>Flock, or Charge,</hi> that are <hi>Christians,</hi> he
condemneth those Canons that ordained, that if
<hi>Any Bishop convert not the Hereticks in his City, they
shall be his Flock who doth convert them;</hi> and all
that have had <hi>two Churches</hi> in one Parish. Or else
he maketh Parish Priests to be Pluralists, and
if there be many Chappels and Churches in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60850:95"/>
he is the Pastor to them all: And yet he never
tells us whether the Chappel Priest be also Pastor
of the <hi>rest of the Parish:</hi> And if so, whether each
be to Govern distinctly, or one subordinately as
Governed by the other; Or whether both must
<hi>agree,</hi> each being but part of the Governing power.</p>
               <p>11. The same Man saith, <hi>That multitudes of
Parishioners are Rebels, Traytors, and no Christians,</hi> &amp;c.
and yet that we must give them all the Sacrament
if demanded. For multitudes demand the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to satisfie Law and Custom, who declare that
they take not the Priest for their Pastor, nor as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by Christ; and multitudes that know not
what Christianity or a Sacrament is, and will not
speak with the Minister about it.</p>
               <p>12. Did not he say before, that the Man cannot
be their Pastor without his own and the Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
And yet the Magistrate may make me a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
to the Parish? What? Whether I will or not?
Am I also a Rebel, Traytor, and no Christian, if
I refuse? What if the Parish have 60000, or
40000 Souls, and I am not able to do a Pastor's
Office for 500? What if I think it is a Sin to be
obtruded on dissenting unwilling People? And
if my Dissent do not <hi>Unchristen me,</hi> why doth
the People's <hi>Unchristen them?</hi> The Lord pity us,
we need no Enemies but our selves to seduce us and
destroy; nor any to make the most odious Schisms
than the decryers of Schism. What Schismatick
doth condemn so many Christians and Churches, as
this Censure? I can scarce except Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi>
whom in his last Book he called an <hi>odd disowned
Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 13. He tells us after of the Pastor's Duty to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60850:95"/>
teach Publickly, and from House to House: And
yet it's no Church but when Assembled; and he
hath equal charge of all Christians (though Papists)
in the Parish.</p>
               <p>§ 14. <hi>He saith,</hi> [No thing cuts off from a Church
particular, but what cuts off from Christ, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and the Church Universal.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. What if a Man disown only the Pastor
of that Church? 2. What if he will not joyn with
them in the Liturgy, or Mode of Worship there
used? 3. What if that Church be <hi>Nestorians,</hi> or
<hi>Eutychians,</hi> or Papists, and he separates from them,
or they cast him out? 4. What if he remove his
Dwelling?</p>
               <p>§ 15. Next I am censured for <hi>demanding the
People of</hi> Kederminster'<hi>s consent to my Ministry, and
their Church Relation.</hi> And he will now be distinct,
and maketh Answers to `distinct Questions for them:
But never tells us whether such Answers had been
<hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> if they had given them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His first Question is,</hi> [Do we take you to have
the just qualifications of a Pastor?] <hi>And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is,</hi> [Learning is one qualification of which the
Ignorant are incompetent Iudges: And for Wisdom,
Holiness, and Ministerial skill of Fidelity, you are to
make proof of them: This is to be answered some
Years after, and not ask before-hand.]</p>
               <p>And so under Papists, Socinians, prophane Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
you are to take all as Wise, Holy, Faithful, till
some Years after you find them otherwise. Here he
expoundeth his former words, for rejecting the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified</hi>
and <hi>unfaithful.</hi> But who shall be judge
at some Years after?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His second Question is,</hi> [Do we take you to be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60850:96"/>
duly ordained?] <hi>And the Answer is,</hi> [We are bound to
judge those to be justly Ordained which are so reputed, and
we have no reason to suspect.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. But <hi>whose</hi> reputation is it that you rest on?
Half the Parish say, you are not justly ordained but by
a Bishop: The other half say, you are justly ordained
by Presbyters: You falsifie, if you feign them all of a
mind. 2. And who knows how to define and bound
your <hi>[Reasons of Suspicion?]</hi> 3. The Canons and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
say, you <hi>have sorfeited your License</hi> if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not; and without a License you may not Preach.
4. And if you will question no mens orders, you will
have many Lay-Pastors.</p>
               <p>To his 3d Quest. he answereth, <hi>[We question not
your presentation.] Ans.</hi> And yet it is the Magistrate
that must impose Ministers, and in times of Usurpation
he feigneth them to be unquestioned. The sum hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
is, <hi>We must take any Man for our Pastor, that is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and presented.</hi> But what if I knew that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
do not so, doth it make them of that Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they <hi>should consent</hi> and do not? Of 1800, or 2000
only 600 would come to the Sacrament, (though
they usually heard) unless all the rest would receive it
kneeling and administred by the Liturgy, though they
were left free to use that Gesture themselves; and
withal they were told that we had not a <hi>Bishops license.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 4th Quest. is, <hi>[If we take you alone for our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor?]</hi>
And it's answered, <hi>[We know of no other in view
but you.] Ans.</hi> All these are Fictions. 1. I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
nor consented to be their Pastor, but to be one
of three. 2. I agreed with them in the <hi>Town-Hall
publickly in writing, to undertake only a Lecture which I
had before the War, in conjunction with another that
should have the Presentation or Sequestration.</hi> And yet
honest Mr. <hi>Durel</hi> tells the World that it was a rich Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
given me for my Service under <hi>Cromwel,</hi> (who
would never endure me to speak to him.) 3. There
were three Competitors: One an old Vicar, that
(somehow) preacht once a Quarter, that had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
and was Sequestred. (1. I will not tell you
here for what.) 2. His Curate sequestred and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
3. An old Chappel Curate, grosly ignorant and
vicious, that lived by unlawful Marrying.</p>
               <p>4. And by all this you determine that of <hi>three of us,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:60850:96"/>
none was Pastor but only that <hi>one</hi> that had the <hi>Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
and so you depose all <hi>other Curates</hi> not presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And yet the Chappels that have such Curates put
in only by the Parsons are true Churches; such are
your frequent Contradictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. Next as a meek Questioner, he askt me,
<hi>Why I will not baptize their Infants, if I take them for
Christians and Parishioners?</hi> He saith after, <hi>[If they
make not a tolerable profession of Christianity in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assembly, they produce no valid claim, we are not to
admit them.] Ans.</hi> I suppose there are in the three next
Parishes here, 80000 Persons whom the Pastors ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any other account of, as to their knowledg, but
by their coming to Church (and half of them that rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come.) And those of us that have talkt with almost
all our Parishioners, find that multitudes know not
what Christianity or a Sacrament is: A man about 80
years old in <hi>Kederminster</hi> said, <hi>Christ was the Sun,</hi> and
<hi>the Holy Ghost the Moon:</hi> Is standing up at the Creed
then, or sitting in the Church a tolerable profession?
<hi>Hobbes</hi> and his followers would do the same. 2. But
what obligation is on me to baptize all the Children
of those that take me for none of their Pastor? The
Parish may have 20000 more than I am able to do the
Pastoral Office for: I cannot tell whether they come
to Church or not: If they do, they are strangers to
me; some come into the Parish and others go out, and
many are Lodgers: And he that as a Pastor is to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,
is also to do abundance more, to Catechize, visit
the Sick, the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Am I bound to <hi>impossibilities</hi>
for every stranger that I never knew? Nor <hi>can I know</hi>
so much as whether he be <hi>Christened,</hi> or be indeed
a <hi>Parishioner?</hi> Yea, a <hi>Church</hi> with you is only a <hi>present
Assembly:</hi> What if these persons assemble not, or but
twice or thrice a Year? What if Travellers be that
day of the Church? Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> saith <hi>(Pref. of Repen.)
No one can give account of those that he knoweth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. His talk of the Tares again deserveth no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but <hi>[read Expositors.]</hi> His repeated insinuation
by the word <hi>[Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Covenants]</hi> tell us that a
good man may become un insinuater of Calumnies.</p>
               <p>His two Conclusions, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. from my words are,
<hi>1. That they are no Churches that want this cementing
Covenant. Ans.</hi> They are none that are not so <hi>related
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60850:97"/>
by consent expressed,</hi> by one way or other: If you turn
this into <hi>[cementing Covenant]</hi> when you had newly
cited my express denial, that <hi>express Covenanting was
necessary,</hi> ad esse, it's worse than Ceremony, which
you are already come to think lawful.</p>
               <p>The 2d Concl. is, <hi>[The Churches that have it not in the
most plain obliging way are defective, spotted, and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,]</hi>
because I said that the more express way is
laudable <hi>ad bene esse:</hi> As if all were called <hi>spotted and
ill-favoured,</hi> that want any thing laudable <hi>ad bene esse,</hi>
(And will Christ take away his Churches <hi>spots</hi> and
<hi>wrinkles, Ephes.</hi> 6. when there were none?)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he saith,</hi> [This he calls the true and only way of
the Churches Concord.] <hi>As if every word in the Book
were called</hi> [the true and onely Way.] [<q>It rather tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>(saith he)</hi> to Discord, and to make every single Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
a Pope, or Church-tyrant, and to make Churches
Schismatical and traiterous Combinations, dividing
themselves from all other Churches and Christians,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. And yet he before said himself, that the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
cannot be Pastor and Flock:</hi> And is not this the
same? 2. Thus all Christ's Churches that ever I read
of for 300, yea, a 1000 Years, are Stigmatized, who
still made <hi>expressed consent</hi> necessary. 3. A Pope is one
that claimeth Soveraignty over all the Church on
Earth: Doth he do so that taketh none for his Flock,
but <hi>Consenters?</hi> 4. Which is <hi>liker Tyranny,</hi> not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Government over any but Volunteers, or to
say, <hi>I will Govern you whether you will or not?</hi> 5. Is it
Dividing and Schism, to know my Flock as Consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and not to take other Mens Flocks <hi>Sine literis
Communicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>riis,</hi> as oft as they will dwell or lodg in
my Parish? The words <hi>[Oaths,]</hi> and <hi>[Covenants]</hi>
are oft again so mentioned by him, and his profession;
that he hath the <hi>Episcopal and Presbyterian on his side,</hi>
and other untruths so rashly uttered, that I am hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grieved for the success of his Temptation: And
whether he or I be Schismatical, and differ from the
Ancient Churches, I refer the Reader to my <hi>Abridg.
of Church History,</hi> and to my Citations in my Book of
<hi>Right to Sacraments:</hi> My Preface to Mr. <hi>Rawlet's Book
of the Sacrament,</hi> confutes some of his Intimations. I
thank God that I am going to a more peaceable
World.</p>
