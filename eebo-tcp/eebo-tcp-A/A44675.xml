            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Can be at no loss for inducements to prefix Your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Name to this Discourse. I know the <hi>Subject</hi> is grateful to You: And if I only give you the occasion hereby, of revolving in Your mind this <hi>sublime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi> You will entertain Your self from it, with more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and exalted thoughts, than this Discourse, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confined within so narrow Limits, can suggest.</p>
            <p>And Your Ladyship <hi>knows</hi> so much of the <hi>incomparable Queen,</hi> that You can the more easily <hi>believe</hi> the rest. I reckon You, Madam, a great Frequenter of <hi>that Assembly</hi> above, to which <hi>She</hi> is now adjoyn'd. You have, besides the greater <hi>Attractives</hi> that are common to all serious Christians, a <hi>very peculiar One,</hi> to draw Your Mind often thither. A Joint-Root with You is there by Transplantation: And a <hi>Noble Branch,</hi> from You both, and in whom <hi>Two Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families</hi> meet, is, under Your Care, shooting upwards
<pb facs="tcp:101535:3"/>
also. All indeed that have true honour for Him, will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly covet He may be long Serviceable to the most valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purposes, in this world; and that, by the Blessing of Heaven upon his approaching Nuptials, (with One from whom may be expected, all that so sweet and tender a Bud now beginning to open, can promise) He may, in due time, spread forth many Branches, that may flourish <hi>here:</hi> But it is to be hoped He will be found to have a <hi>Greater Mind,</hi> than can be confined to so low, and little a thing, <hi>as this Earth is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thought may much the better be digested, that <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Nuptials,</hi> will some time end in <hi>Funerals;</hi> if once, by God's prescribed methods, it can be made certain to us also, that those <hi>Funerals</hi> shall end in <hi>Celestial Triumphs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Ladyship's Eyes (which better serve for Heaven than Earth) being, observably, much directed upward, will give aim and direction to <hi>theirs,</hi> who depend upon you, to look the same way; and withal, draw down from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Blessings upon Your self and them. Which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> of,</p>

            <p>LET me invite back your Eye to the foregoing Words that are in nearer Connection with these.</p>
            <p>Vers. 22. <hi>But ye are come unto Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and to an innumerable Company of Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 23. <hi>To the general Assembly, and Church of the First-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judg of all, and to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have had this last Week a <hi>publick Solemnity,</hi> that was becomingly Great and Magnificent, upon a sad and mournful Occasion, the <hi>last Act</hi> of a <hi>doleful Scene</hi> that hath lasted many Weeks. You know I have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <hi>to you (my usual Hearers)</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> and saddest, the <hi>leading part</hi> in this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> once and again: Nor would I have <hi>this last</hi> to pass us, without some instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Observation and Remark. It will the more <hi>instruct</hi> us the less it <hi>detains</hi> us; or if only taking a <hi>due</hi> (not, I mean, a slight and too hasty, but yet a <hi>transient)</hi> notice of it, we be prompted by it to look forward, from what was <hi>in its own kind</hi> most deservedly Great, to what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably Greater <hi>in a more excellent kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101535:4"/>
In such a <hi>Funeral Solemnity,</hi> for so Great and Excellent a Personage, there is what may most fitly <hi>entertain a while,</hi> there is not that which ought <hi>finally to terminate,</hi> a <hi>Wise</hi> and a <hi>Judicious Eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Honours done to the Memory of Great Persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, have by the Wisdom of all Nations been counted <hi>Decencies,</hi> and even <hi>Debts;</hi> when especially the deceased have been sometime, and might have been much longer, <hi>publick Blessings:</hi> Then indeed it is that such <hi>Rites</hi> are most fitly (as they are usually) called <hi>Justa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are too prone to be taken only with the <hi>meer Pomp</hi> of such <hi>Spectacles,</hi> and which is the Infirmity of our too-degenerate Spirits, to be <hi>wholly</hi> possess'd with Phanciful Ideas; as those were intimated to be which <note place="margin">Acts 25. 23.</note> were from a Spectacle of the same <hi>common kind,</hi> tho on a very <hi>diverse Occasion,</hi> by that <hi>elegant Expression,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as do but amuse our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a while, but must of course vanish, and cannot stay long with us. But we need that somewhat greater, and too latent to strike <hi>our Eye,</hi> should <hi>another way</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and teach <hi>our Mind;</hi> making such Impressions there, as may <hi>claim</hi> an abode, and that <hi>ought</hi> to remain, and dwell with us.</p>
            <p>You read of a very <hi>solemn Funeral,</hi> Gen. 50. The whole Countrey into which the March was made, was amus'd at the State and Greatness of that mournful <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade,</hi> wherein' is said, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>there were Chariots and Horsemen,</hi> even <hi>a very great Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> which you have many of you so lately seen, and no doubt all of you heard of, was a <hi>most august Funeral Solemnity;</hi> such as whereof <hi>less concerned, foreign Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> might say, as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by mistake did of <hi>that,</hi> v. 11. <hi>This is a grievous Mourning to the</hi> Egyptians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101535:4"/>
They were indeed antiently the most celebrated Mourners for such as died from amongst them, in all the World, in respect of their <hi>Funeral Rites,</hi> and of their <hi>Monuments for the Dead,</hi> of which they are said to <note place="margin">Diod. Sic. l. 1.</note> have taken more care than of the Habitations of the Living; accounting <hi>these</hi> they were to inhabit only a short time, but <hi>those</hi> they reckon'd their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their eternal Habitations. An Imagination, which how wild soever it were of the Habitations of <hi>Souls,</hi> (which only could be supposed capable of being pleased with them) yet imply'd <hi>their Belief of their Immortality,</hi> whereof some have (groundlesly) thought them the <note place="margin">Herod. Euterp.</note> 
               <hi>first Assertors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were, as was intimated, mistaken in apprehending that to be <hi>chiefly</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>true Israelites (those</hi> that were such <hi>indeed)</hi> were the <hi>true, concerned</hi> Mourners. The <hi>Father of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was dead: As <hi>now with us,</hi> the <hi>Mother.</hi> A <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> tho not a <hi>Natural,</hi> nor merely an <hi>Oeconomical</hi> one. A <hi>Mother,</hi> not in the narrower and more minute, but in the larger and most noble Sense, not of a <hi>single Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> only, but of <hi>Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> assisted to make up the Shew in <hi>that</hi> Mourning, but were probably <hi>the prepared</hi> (as their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity were the <hi>active)</hi> Instruments of the <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> of that People, with whom they were now seeming Sharers in Lamentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ours</hi> was a <hi>Mourning</hi> not <hi>less grievous</hi> than <hi>theirs:</hi> Nor <hi>more grievous</hi> than <hi>just</hi> to the <hi>English Nation,</hi> i. e. to whom the <hi>Soil</hi> and the <hi>Genius</hi> are <hi>together</hi> native; that are not of an <hi>Egyptian Spirit.</hi> Unto <hi>which,</hi> as things happen, (to its <hi>Power,</hi> or to its <hi>Impotency)</hi> there is a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical, innate</hi> Disposition, either to <hi>make Slaves,</hi> or to <hi>be</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101535:5"/>
               <hi>such.</hi> There is a sort of People (as was once said) <hi>born to Slavery,</hi> to whom it is a <hi>Birthright.</hi> They <hi>have it in their Natures,</hi> and no other State, as <hi>he</hi> most aptly spake, is agreeable (or <hi>becoming)</hi> to them. <hi>Quos non decet esse</hi>

               <hi>nisi servos.</hi> They know not what to do with <hi>Liberty,</hi> any more than that silly Creature that us'd to haunt the Dunghil, with the <hi>Pearl.</hi> Therefore they can but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably value the <hi>Restorers</hi> and <hi>Assertors</hi> of it. No <hi>Irons</hi> can be heavier, or less tolerable to them, than a <hi>generous</hi> and a <hi>Christian</hi> State of <hi>Freedom.</hi> Therefore if none else will do them the <hi>kind Office,</hi> to put them into <hi>gentler Shackles,</hi> they grow so <hi>unnaturally</hi> cruel, as to shackle themselves in the ignoblest sort of Bondage: <hi>They are held in the Cords of their own Sins,</hi> and <hi>make the Chain</hi>

            <p>Brutish Appetites and Inclinations are to them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer <hi>Taskmasters</hi> than it can ever be in their Power to become <hi>to others.

            <p>To <hi>them</hi> this Season of Sorrow is a time of <hi>Festivity</hi> and <hi>Laughter;</hi> who, when they have suffered a more monstrous Transformation themselves, can easily turn the <hi>House of Mourning</hi> into that <hi>of Mirth.</hi> The wise <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 4.</note> Man tells us what sort of People they are whose <hi>Heart</hi> is in this <hi>latter House;</hi> and what is to be thought of such Mirth and Laughter.

            <p>We had upon the late sad Occasion a <hi>Panegyris.</hi> We find <hi>that Word</hi> in the introductive Part of the Text; and tho it is more commonly apply'd to a Multitude ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on other Occasions, it disagrees not to that order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great Concourse on that mournful Occasion, <hi>a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly,</hi> that is <hi>a National</hi> One, met, <hi>then, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to mourn: a Nation</hi> assembled, and mourning <hi>in their Representative.</hi> It was decent it should be so.

            <p>It must be confess'd, our just Tribute to the Memory of <hi>our admirable Queen</hi> can never be said to be fully paid; nor can this Discourse leave out occasional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that may be of this Import.

Not to entertain you with <hi>her Character</hi> and <hi>Praises,</hi> (for it is the same thing to characterize and to praise her) <hi>that Part</hi> is performed in divers excellent Discourses, which I have read, as I believe many of you have, and I hope with <hi>Fruit</hi> as well as Approbation, and (as there is Cause) with great Admiration of the Divine Goodness, that so illustriously shone forth in her, and that vouchsafed, so long, to entrust the People of <hi>England</hi> with so <hi>rare a Jewel,</hi> whose <hi>Lustre</hi> was yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by its <hi>real Vertues.</hi> By which also we may make our Estimate of the Displeasure wherewith it is so soon withdrawn, and caught away from us, so as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Age (as our Divine <hi>Herbert)</hi> with</p>

            <p>We have had a mournful sad Solemnity and Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, tho decently pompous and great: <hi>England'</hi>s Glory clad in Sables, and glittering in a Cloud.

            <p>Funeral Solemnities, even for pious and holy Persons, and that were of greatest Use in the World, are dull and gloomy Spectacles, if they are only considered in their <hi>Retrospection,</hi> without Prospect, or if they only solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize their <hi>Exit, out of this World</hi> of ours, but be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to have no reference to their Ascent and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Regions of Immortality and Bliss above.

and Sufferings shall have at last. <hi>Whither</hi> they shall be gathered at the finishing of their Course, and how <hi>God like,</hi> how worthy of Himself the <hi>End</hi> shall be, into which he will run up all Things, when the <hi>State of Probation</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> is over with his intelligent Creatures, and the <hi>stable, permanent, eternal State</hi> comes to take place, which, because it is <hi>final,</hi> can <hi>admit no more Changes,</hi> and because it is <hi>perfect,</hi> can <hi>no more need any.

            <p n="1">I. For the <hi>former</hi> of these, we may easily admit <hi>this being made perfect</hi> to be an <hi>Agonistical Phrase,</hi> as some <hi>of great Note and Worth</hi> have expounded it; and unto which <hi>that</hi> in the Beginning of this Chapter, of <hi>running the Race set before us (q. d.</hi> the Way laid out between the Lines on each Hand) doth plainly lead us. But it should hereupon be remote from us to think, that a meer <hi>relative Dignity,</hi> or any <hi>external Honours,</hi> are the <hi>Things</hi> we must principally understand to be conferr'd, or which these <hi>Adepti</hi> must be <hi>now</hi> thought to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> At the lowest, <hi>Sincerity;</hi> as when our Saviour proposes to that Querist, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21. <hi>if he would be perfect,</hi> to sell all he had, and give to the Poor, <hi>following him,</hi> with the Expectation of no other Recompence but of a <hi>Treasure in Heaven.</hi> If a Man's Soul be not in a Disposition to comport with <hi>such Terms,</hi> upon a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Signification of our Lord's Pleasure, that he shall <hi>now</hi> do so; or if at any Time this be the Case, that he must either forgo all this World, and even Life it self, or else renounce <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> he is not yet in a right Posture towards <hi>his last End.</hi> He hath not taken the Lord for his God and best Good, his Heart more strongly adheres to <hi>this present World.</hi> But if he have arrived <hi>hither,</hi> which is his first Step, <hi>resolving upon his true and right End,</hi> which he will supremely pursue, against whatsoever Competition of less valuable Things, he is now, <hi>in the lowest Sense, perfect,</hi> i. e. a <hi>resolved thorough Christian.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly, An eminent Improvement; greater Maturity in Divine Knowledg and all other Christian Vertues.</hi> As when <hi>the Apostle</hi> blaming the slower Progress of the <hi>Christian Hebrews,</hi> chap. 5. 13, 14. that they were yet <hi>so unskilful in the Word of Righteousness,</hi> and only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>of Milk, not the strong Meat</hi> fit for Persons come to a more grown Age, nor had <hi>their Senses as yet well exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> &amp;c. he exhorts them, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 1. leaving the first Principles of the Christian Doctrine, <hi>to go on to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>

The <hi>Third</hi> is the <hi>consummate State</hi> of a <hi>Christian;</hi> so is a <hi>perfect Man</hi> expounded by being <hi>come to the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ: That State</hi> to which all Gifts given by our ascended, conquering, crowned Redeemer; the <hi>whole Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Apostolate,</hi> the entire <hi>Ministry, the whole Frame and Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> all Evangelical <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> with whatsoever <hi>Illuminations</hi> and <hi>Influences</hi> we can suppose superadded to <hi>all these,</hi> have <hi>ultimate</hi> and <hi>final Reference:</hi> and the State to which <hi>all shall come, Eph.</hi> 4. 8,—12, 13. is this most perfect State, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof <hi>the Apostle</hi> says of himself that he had not yet attained, <hi>nor was already perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 12.</p>
            <p>I do not reckon the <hi>meer natural Perfection,</hi> either of the <hi>Inner</hi> or <hi>Outer Man,</hi> to be here necessarily excluded; but that the <hi>moral</hi> is chiefly intended, and <hi>of that</hi> the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, consummative Degrees, still reserving room for such Additions as will follow the <hi>final Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I doubt 'tis not enough considered how much the <hi>Felicity</hi> of the future State depends upon <hi>such Perfection of the Subject of it.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Object of Felicity,</hi> we are agreed it can be no other than the <hi>blessed God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> the all-comprehending Good, fully adequate to the highest and most enlarged reasonable Desires. But the Contemperation of our <hi>Faculties</hi> to the <hi>holy, blissful</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is so necessary to our satisfying Fruition, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>that</hi> we are no more capable thereof, than a Brute of the Festivities of a quaint Oration, or a Stone of the Relishes of the most pleasant Meats and Drinks. That <hi>Meetness</hi> which <hi>the Apostle</hi> speaks of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>To be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> is of no small Importance to our <hi>Participation, it self.</hi>

We are too apt to fill our Minds with <hi>Idea's</hi> of an Heaven made up of <hi>external, out-side Glories,</hi> forgetting we must have the <hi>Kingdom of God within us,</hi> hereafter, in its <hi>perfect,</hi> as well as <hi>here</hi> in its <hi>initial State.</hi> A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that consists in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> first, an universal holy Rectitude of all our <hi>Powers,</hi> then consequently in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>perfect Cure</hi> of all the <hi>Distempers</hi> of our Spirits, and a confirmed most <hi>perfectly</hi> happy <hi>Temper,</hi> is of most absolute Necessity to the Blessedness of the heavenly State; and without it any imagined external Glory will signify no more to our Satisfaction, than rich and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apparel can give the desired Content and Ease to an ulcerous diseased Body; or (as the <hi>Moralist</hi> speaks) <note place="margin">Plutar.</note> a Diadem to an a king Head, a gay Slipper to a pained Foot, or a Gold Ring to a sore Finger.</p>
            <p>Let a Soul be supposed actually adjoined to that <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Assembly,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> above, that is yet unacquainted with God, strange, and disaffected to him, <hi>alienated from the divine Life,</hi> still carnally minded, loving most, and looking back with a lingring Eye towards this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World</hi> and State of things; full of Pride, Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and self-magnifying Thoughts; of Envy, Wrath, Hatred, Contentiousness; of Deceit, Guilefulness and Dissimulation, fill'd with ravenous Lusts, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, insatiable Desires after impossible Things: Such a Soul will only seem to have mistaken its <hi>Way, Place, State</hi> and <hi>Company,</hi> and can only be a <hi>sit Associate for Devils</hi> and infernal Spirits. Its Condition would be equally uneasy to it self, and all about it; the Outrage of its own Lusts and Passions would create to it <hi>an Hell</hi> in the midst of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and be to it as a thousand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, both for <hi>Wickedness</hi> and for <hi>Torment.</hi>

But to give you a <hi>Summary</hi> of this <hi>internal Perfection of the Spirits of just Men,</hi> in their <hi>most perfect State,</hi> I cannot give you a <hi>fuller</hi> and more <hi>comprehensive one</hi> than is express'd in those few Words, <hi>We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is:</hi> Where are two things conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 3.</note> that <hi>together</hi> express the perfect State of these blessed Spirits;</p>
            <list>
               <item>Likeness to God; and the</item>
               <item>Vision of him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And <hi>these two</hi> are so connected, as to admit of a twofold Reference each to other: <hi>Either</hi> that this <hi>Likeness to God</hi> be considered as a <hi>Preparative</hi> for the Vision of him, and so that the <hi>latter Words</hi> be considered as an <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>former, viz.</hi> that because it is designed we shall live in the perpetual <hi>Vision of God,</hi> it is therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary we should <hi>be like him,</hi> without which we can be no way capable of <hi>such a Sight,</hi> or of beholding so <hi>bright a Glory. Or else,</hi> that the <hi>Vision of God</hi> be perpetually <hi>productive</hi> of this <hi>Likeness to him;</hi> and so that the <hi>latter Words</hi> be understood not only to contain an <hi>Argument,</hi> whence we may conclude <hi>this Likeness must be,</hi> but also to express the <hi>immediate Cause</hi> by which <hi>it is.</hi> As the <hi>Form of Expression</hi> will admit <hi>either of these References,</hi> so I doubt not the <hi>Nature of the Thing</hi> will require that we take them in <hi>both.</hi> There could be no <hi>such Vision</hi> of God as is here meant, if there were not <hi>some previous Likeness to him, in our former State.</hi> And when, <hi>in our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State,</hi> we are <hi>first</hi> admitted to that <hi>beatifick glorious Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by that means,</hi> we may reasonably understand will ensue the <hi>Perfection of that Likeness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereof</hi> also it is to be considered, that <hi>Vision</hi> (which spoken of the Mind is <hi>Knowledg)</hi> must not only be taken
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101535:11"/>
for a <hi>Cause,</hi> but <hi>a Part;</hi> for the <hi>Image of God</hi> is at first <hi>renewed</hi> (and with equal Reason must be supposed at <note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> last perfected) <hi>in Knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Image or Likeness of God</hi> therefore, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>natural Order</hi> of working upon an <hi>intelligent Subject,</hi> must, <hi>as to that Part of it</hi> which hath its Seat in the <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>understanding Faculty,</hi> be <hi>caused</hi> by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Irradiation of the Divine Light and Glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>be the Cause</hi> of the rest.</p>
            <p>But <hi>both together</hi> are the <hi>inherent subjective Perfection</hi> of these blessed <hi>Spirits of the Just,</hi> and comprehend all that belongs to this their <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self also <hi>virtually</hi> comprehended in the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Vision of God</hi> therefore, or their perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of him, with whom they must <hi>ever have</hi> most of all <hi>to do,</hi> as the <hi>principal Object</hi> of their <hi>Fruition and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,</hi> must be the <hi>primary</hi> and the <hi>leading thing</hi> in <hi>this their Perfection:</hi> For no doubt it is that <hi>Perfection</hi> which directly concerns their ultimate Satisfaction and Blessedness, which is here intended; with which their <hi>eternal Employment</hi> is most conjunct and complicated, as we shall after see: They <hi>enjoy</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the same blessed Object <hi>at once,</hi> and <hi>in doing the one,</hi> do <hi>the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And besides the Knowledg of him, there must be by his Beams, and <hi>in his Light,</hi> (Ps. 36. 9.) <hi>the perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> of all that it is needful or requisite they should know, without which, since all their Enjoyments in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly State must be in their <hi>first Rise</hi> intellectual, 'twould be impossible they should ever perfectly enjoy any thing at all. And that <hi>this Perfection</hi> of just Mens <hi>Spirits</hi> is intended to be summarily comprehended in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Knowledg,</hi> is more than intimated by that Series of Discourse which we find, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9—12.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101535:12"/>
The <hi>Apostle</hi> comparing the Imperfection of our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> with the <hi>Perfection</hi> of our <hi>future State,</hi> sums up all in this, that <hi>we know now but in part,</hi> and that then <hi>we shall know as we are known:</hi> But the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>this Knowledg</hi> he seems more to state in the <hi>manner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> than in the extent and compass of the <hi>things known.</hi> That in this latter Respect it may admit of Increase they cannot doubt, who consider the <hi>sinite Capacity</hi> of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mind, and the <hi>mighty Advantages</hi> we shall have for continual Improvement, both from the <hi>clear Discovery of things,</hi> in that bright and glorious Light, and from the <hi>Receptiveness</hi> of our enlarged and most apprehensive Minds. But that State can admit of no <hi>culpable Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> nor of any that shall more <hi>infer</hi> Infelicity, than <hi>include</hi> Sin.</p>
            <p>Therefore now to speak more distinctly;</p>
            <p>We take this Perfection of the Spirits of the Just to be principally meant of their <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>all Sin</hi> and <hi>all Misery;</hi> as <hi>Morality</hi> comprehends and connects together <hi>Sanctity,</hi> the <hi>Goodness of the Means,</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> the <hi>Goodness of the End:</hi> the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> most <hi>directly,</hi> but most <hi>certainly,</hi> inferring the <hi>latter.</hi> If therefore we say this is their <hi>sinless Perfection,</hi> we say all that the Case requires.</p>
            <p>In that it is said to be the <hi>Perfection of Spirits,</hi> it must indeed <hi>suppose</hi> all that <hi>natural Perfection</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>such a sort of Creatures,</hi> as such, <hi>in their own kind.</hi> But inasmuch as the Specification is added [of the Just], 'tis their <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> or most <hi>perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rectitude,</hi> from which their Blessedness is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that seems ultimately intended.</p>
            <p>But now whereas this their <hi>ultimate Perfection</hi> hath been said to be virtually contained and summ'd up <hi>in</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101535:12"/>
               <hi>Knowledg,</hi> we are hereupon to consider how <hi>this</hi> may appear to be a <hi>compleat Summary</hi> of all <hi>such</hi> Perfection: And nothing can more evidently appear if you join to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</p>

            <p n="1">1. The true and proper Object of it must be, not <hi>omne scibile,</hi> but whatsoever they can be <hi>obliged</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> to know, or that is requisite to their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity;</hi> all that lies within their Compass, as they are Creatures, that in such a <hi>distinct Sphere,</hi> or in their <hi>own proper Order,</hi> are to correspond to the <hi>Ends of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> i. e. to <hi>glorify the Author of their Beings,</hi> and be <hi>happy in him.

Whatsoever Knowledg is <hi>requisite</hi> to these Ends, will be included in this their <hi>final Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is, by the way, to be observ'd how this Matter is express'd, <hi>made perfect,</hi> which signifies our arriving to <hi>this Perfection</hi> out of <hi>an imperfect State.</hi> We were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an original Perfection, sufficient to a <hi>State of Probation.</hi> By our Apostacy we became <hi>sinfully imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: All have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God, Rom.</hi> 3. 23.

They are <hi>now,</hi> their Trial being over, set in a <hi>consummate Rectitude</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Ends of their Creation, and <hi>herein</hi> are endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Knowledg they need, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>such things</hi> as in reference to those Ends they can any way be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101535:13"/>
With the blessed God himself they are most of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: For him they are eternally to <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>enjoy:</hi> Therefore that their Perfection should be virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Divine Knowledg, is congruous to the State of their Case, and to the Language of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which expresses their most perfect State by the <hi>Vision of God,</hi> in the mention'd 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>Phrase</hi> is not borrowed from the <hi>Sight of the Eye,</hi> and transferr'd to <hi>that of the Mind,</hi> at random, or without (most probable) Design. It most aptly signifies the <hi>great Facility of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;</hi> that it is not toilsom, there is little Labour in it; 'tis not such as requires great Pains: It is but <hi>Intuition,</hi> not a cautious, wary <hi>Ratiocination,</hi> wherein we use to be very solicitous, lest we draw any <hi>irregular</hi> or <hi>untrue</hi> Consequences. We do <hi>very easily,</hi> and <hi>on the sudden,</hi> without Suspicion, or Fear of Error, <hi>only behold</hi> what is offer'd to our View. This is a great <hi>Perfection of Mind</hi> with these blessed <hi>Spirits,</hi> to be capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatest things so <hi>easily,</hi> and so <hi>soon, to know,</hi> by <hi>seeing.</hi> And their Aptness hereto is a moral Perfection; for the Clearness of the Discovery infers their <hi>greater Obligation</hi> to attend, and not to divert from what shall cost them so little. The blessed God's Manifestation of himself in that <hi>brightest and most glorious Light,</hi> is not only evidently supposed; <hi>for in his Light only can we see Light,</hi> Psal. 36. 9. but it is emphatically express'd in the <hi>before-mention'd Text,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. of <hi>seeing Face to Face;</hi> which signifies, <hi>on his part, gracious Vouchsafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> his <hi>offering</hi> his blessed Face to view; that he hides it not, nor turns it away, as <hi>here</hi> sometimes he doth, in just Displeasure. And his Face means even his <hi>most conspicuous Glory;</hi> such as, in this State of Mortality,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101535:13"/>
'twould be mortal to us to behold: For <hi>no Man,</hi> not so divine a Man as <hi>Moses</hi> himself, <hi>could see his Face and live.</hi> And it signifies, <hi>on their part,</hi> who are thus made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, their applying and turning <hi>their</hi> Face towards <hi>his, viz.</hi> that they see not <hi>casually,</hi> or by <hi>fortuitous</hi> Glances, but <hi>Eye</hi> to <hi>Eye,</hi> by direct and most voluntary Intuition; which therefore, on their part, implies <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> directing and commanding <hi>the Eye,</hi> and upon unexpressible Relishes of Joy and Pleasure forbidding its Diversion, holds it steady and intent. <hi>Here</hi> our <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God</hi> is <hi>culpable,</hi> being voluntary, <hi>not liking to retain him in our Knowledg,</hi> Rom. 1. 28. <hi>There</hi> our <hi>Knowledg</hi> is inculpable and sinless, being chosen, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and always, principally, for its <hi>most proper Ends,</hi> the perfect <hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> of the <hi>blessed Object,</hi> we so fixedly behold, and so earnestly covet to know.</p>
            <p>'Tis also fit to be noted, that the very <hi>Fruition</hi> of the blessed God it self, which the holy Scripture includes in our Vision of him, is not only <hi>our very Blessedness</hi> it self, but it is <hi>our Duty</hi> too. It is a thing enjoin'd us, and comprehended in that <hi>first and great Commandment; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and Soul, and Might, and Mind;</hi> which, who can perfectly do, without a <hi>complacential Acquiescence,</hi> and <hi>final Rest</hi> of <hi>their Will</hi> in him, as the <hi>best,</hi> the most perfect, and all-comprehending <hi>Good?</hi> And hereupon, tho we are wont to distinguish our <hi>glorifying</hi> God, and <hi>enjoying</hi> him, they are most manifestly coincident, and but <hi>notionally distinct.</hi> For in this our <hi>fruitive Acquiescence</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> in him, stands our <hi>highest Veneration,</hi> our most <hi>practical,</hi> most <hi>significant Acknowledgment</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as the highest, the most compleat, and most <hi>absolutely perfect Good;</hi> in that we seek no further, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101535:14"/>
take up our <hi>final Rest</hi> in him. This is to give him the proper Glory of his Godhead, <hi>to glorify him as God.</hi> And therefore this being the fullest Sense of that great and summary Command, it is only <hi>a commanding us to be happy.</hi> As, on the other hand, the <hi>Misery</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Creature is his greatest, and most injurious Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>an Aversion of Will</hi> from the blessed God, a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony against him, as none of the best Good, and the greatest Indignity which created Nature can put upon him, who is <hi>Goodness it self.</hi> Thus then is the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> or <hi>Vision of God,</hi> even <hi>as it is fruitive,</hi> a moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But the <hi>divine Knowledg,</hi> more at large of these Holy Spirits, though it be principally conversant about God, as its noblest Object, excludes not their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their Minds to <hi>other Objects too,</hi> according to their Concernment with them. And yet,</p>
            <p n="2">2. How aptly <hi>this Perfection</hi> is included in <hi>such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> will further appear, if you consider <hi>the manner of knowing,</hi> or the special nature and kind of <hi>this Vision or Knowledg, viz.</hi> that it is not that <hi>slight, ineffectual, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notional, insipid Knowledg,</hi> which <hi>unregenerate Minds</hi> are now wont to have of the most evident Truths, <hi>viz. that,</hi> for instance, that <hi>God is the most excellent, the most perfect, the most desirable, as well as the most adorable Good;</hi> which <hi>Knowledg,</hi> because it answers not the <hi>true End</hi> of <hi>divine Knowledg,</hi> is called Ignorance: Whereupon they are said to be <hi>alienated from the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them,</hi> Eph. 4. 18. But that <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is paraphras'd by <hi>Blindness of Heart,</hi> i. e. a most perfectly voluntary and chosen Ignorance, founded in Aversion of Will. And elsewhere, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—6. by <hi>a refusing to know God, a saying to him, Depart from us, we desire not the Knowledg of thy Ways,</hi> Job 21. 14. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101535:14"/>
               <hi>the Light that is in such is said to be very Darkness,</hi> and then <hi>how great is that Darkness!</hi> Mat. 6. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Knowledg,</hi> or Vision, <hi>now in Perfection,</hi> is most deeply and inwardly penetrative, efficacious, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, admits a Light, which spreads and transfuses it self through the whole Soul. So it is, at first, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truly regenerate Spirit; whereby such an one is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten into the Divine Likeness;</hi> his Image is impress'd upon it, which, as hath been noted, is said to be <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Knowledg,</hi> Col. 3. 10. So that, as by <hi>solemn Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi> to the Sons of Men, God is declared to be <hi>pure Light,</hi> 1 John 1. 5. <hi>(This then is the Message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is Light, and with him is no Darkness at all.)</hi> And as he is the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> the <hi>paternal</hi> Light, <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. so they that are born of him are said to <hi>be Light it self,</hi> and the Children of Light. <hi>Ye were Darkness, but now are you Light in the Lord, walk as Children of Light, Eph.</hi> 5. 8. And they are therefore said, <hi>as the Sons of God, to shine as Lights,</hi> Phil. 2. 15. (or required to do so; for the Words bear either Form.) This so <hi>energe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, efficacious Light,</hi> is, in the mentioned <hi>Texts,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly intended to connote Holiness, as it doth also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. which the <hi>Antithesis</hi> there shews, <hi>Works of Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Armour of Light;</hi> and in many other Places.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the whole, even of <hi>Practical Religion</hi> and <hi>Godliness,</hi> is in the holy Scriptures express'd by <hi>the Knowledg of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 22. 'Tis signified to be in its own Nature <hi>sanctifying,</hi> and inconsistent with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 34. <hi>in which</hi> they that live are therefore said to be <hi>destitute of it,</hi> who are also upon the same Account said not to have had any Sight of God;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101535:15"/>
3 <hi>John v.</hi> 11. <hi>He that sinneth</hi> (the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Doer,</hi> or <hi>Worker of Sin) hath not seen God.</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> which <hi>this Vision</hi> of God receives, must, much more <hi>in the perfected Spirits of the Just,</hi> be supposed so prevalent and victorious, as quite to have chas'd away and expell'd all Remainders of this impure Darkness. Every <hi>such Spirit</hi> is, therefore, become, as it were, an <hi>Orb</hi> of purest, most operative, and lively Light, an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual,</hi> and a <hi>self-actuating Sun,</hi> full of <hi>Fervour</hi> and <hi>motive Power,</hi> besides <hi>mere Light.</hi> Whereupon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this Light and Knowledg discovers <hi>it is fit</hi> for such a Soul <hi>to be, it is,</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> for it to do, it can <hi>never fail to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>making of such Spirits perfect,</hi> must be understood, in greatest part, to consist <hi>in restoring the Order of their Faculties towards each other;</hi> which was broken by <hi>the Apostacy</hi> to that degree, and they so debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated, and become so languid, so impotent, and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that neither could the <hi>one Faculty lead,</hi> nor the <hi>other follow.</hi> Whence <hi>Light,</hi> even about the most pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, and the most important Matters imaginable, <hi>true Notions, right Sentiments,</hi> signified no more to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to govern, to form and direct the Inclinations and Motions of the Soul, than if, as to all its Sentiments about these Matters, you did put <hi>false</hi> instead of <hi>true, wrong</hi> instead of <hi>right,</hi> most absurd, most impossible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of most congruous, most necessary. Take, for instance, the <hi>Idea of God.</hi> Let it be supposed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend (as every one grants it doth, whether he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg <hi>his Existence</hi> or no) all conceivable, all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Excellencies; that it means an <hi>infinite, eternal, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living, self-subsisting Being, most perfectly intelligent, wise, true, holy, righteous, powerful, and blessed; the Original</hi>

               <hi>of Life, Being, and Blessedness to the Creation, according to the several Kinds, Natures, and Capacities of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Supreme and Sovereign Lord of all, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to govern and dispose of what he hath made; of most immense and abounding Goodness and Benignity, most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the indigent, compassionate to the miserable, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable to the guilty, propitious to the penitent, most compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centially kind, with highest delight, to the holy and the good, severe only to the obstinately impenitent and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that will by no means or methods be reclaimed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take we, again, from hence <hi>the Measures</hi> by which we are to judge what ought to be the dispositions and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his reasonable Creatures towards him, <hi>That they be entirely compos'd, and made up of Love, Reverence, Humility, Dependance, Devotedness, Subjection, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Adoration.</hi> And suppose we that, <hi>in the Theory,</hi> this be, as it generally is, admitted and acknowledg'd as the <hi>just</hi> and most <hi>regular Consequence</hi> of the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let us again suppose, That we being made after his Image, which <hi>in the Natural Part remains,</hi> and is still common to Mankind; and as to the <hi>Moral Part</hi> is <hi>restor'd</hi> in all that are regenerate and born of God. And that therefore we ought to love <hi>universally</hi> all <hi>mankind,</hi> to wish and do well to them, as to our selves; and no more to injure any man, than we would destroy, pull in pieces, or offer violence to our own Life and Being. And that we ought, with a more peculiar delectation, to embrace and love all holy and good men, without other distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than as any appear more to <hi>excel in goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Light</hi> about <hi>these things</hi> is so clear, <hi>they</hi> are so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disputable, and so difficult it is to form any argument to the contrary, that <hi>few</hi> ever set themselves, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite or formed thoughts, to oppose or contend against
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101535:16"/>
them. It is not (at least, not generally) so much as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to <hi>disprove them,</hi> or assert <hi>contrary Principles</hi> in opposition to them. Therefore that the dispositions and common Practice of men do so little agree with <hi>these Principles,</hi> is not that their Notions are herein <hi>doubtful,</hi> but <hi>spiritless;</hi> their Light is not <hi>uncertain,</hi> but <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>impotent.</hi> And hereupon their <hi>Knowledge</hi> signifies as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to its <hi>proper End,</hi> as if their apprehensions touching these things were <hi>none at all,</hi> or quite <hi>contrary</hi> to what they are.</p>
            <p>They as much neglect and slight the <hi>Blessed God,</hi> or decline to be concern'd with him, as if they <hi>denied</hi> all the things of him which his <hi>Idea</hi> contains; or as if they <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> all the things of him which it most directly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes.</hi> They <hi>shun,</hi> they <hi>fly</hi> from him, as if they thought him <hi>the Worst of Beings,</hi> while they acknowledge him the <hi>Best</hi> and most <hi>Excellent Good: Disobey</hi> and <hi>affront</hi> him, as if they thought he had <hi>no Right to rule them;</hi> while they confess him the Sovereign Lord of all the World. And steer their course both towards <hi>him</hi> and <hi>one another,</hi> in as direct repugnancy to <hi>his Rules,</hi> as if they thought them all <hi>ranvers'd,</hi> and that the <hi>most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site</hi> System of <hi>Laws and Precepts</hi> were given them by some undoubted Authority, to regulate all their Practice.</p>
            <p>It would amaze a <hi>Thinking Man</hi> that all this should be so! That <hi>Intelligent Creatures,</hi> that the <hi>Reasonable, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Immortal Spirits</hi> of men, should be sunk to so low a Pitch of Degeneracy and Vileness! But much more, that it being so <hi>apparently thus,</hi> it should be so seldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on! that men are not afraid of themselves! that they appear not as so many frightful Monsters, each in their own eyes! That they consider not, What are these Faculties for? Why have I such Notions of Truth in my
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101535:16"/>
mind? Why have I a <hi>Will</hi> whereby to <hi>chuse, resolve, act,</hi> and <hi>be</hi> accordingly? What a distorted, mishapen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>this Soul</hi> of mine? Every thing in me running counter to <hi>right and fit!</hi> Whatever hath thus fatally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all their Powers, hath stupify'd them too; so as not only not to find fault, but to applaud and be well pleased with themselves for all this.</p>
            <p>But now shall we not take our <hi>advantage</hi> from hence, to conceive and be enamour'd of the Rectitude, the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of this most excellent State of the <hi>Perfected Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Just!</hi> Now doth <hi>Comely Order</hi> succeed instead of the most Horrid Deformity; distorted Limbs are set right; the Ligaments and Connection of the <hi>dis-jointed Faculties</hi> to each other are <hi>restored;</hi> and whatsoever the <hi>enlightened Mind</hi> suggests as <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>due,</hi> presently <hi>obtains.</hi> No Complaint remains of <hi>seeing what is better,</hi> and <hi>doing what is worse;</hi> or that when <hi>good should be done, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> There is nothing but perfect Regularity, Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Agreement. All things move smoothly, and with constant Equability and <hi>Decorum. Right Dictates</hi> of the <hi>leading Faculty,</hi> and <hi>ready Compliance</hi> of such as <hi>are to follow,</hi> make with them a perpetual, even, and uninterrupted Course.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Likeness to God,</hi> therefore, in every other just respect, certainly ensues, upon <hi>such</hi> preceding <hi>knowledge of him;</hi> For the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>knowledge</hi> being, as it ought to be, <hi>powerful, vigorous, transforming</hi> of the whole Soul, and the <hi>Will ductile</hi> and compliant; agreeable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions do most certainly take place. As <hi>now, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—we are chang'd,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. Much more in that State where the <hi>injected divine beams</hi> are so strong, and vivid, and the <hi>receptive disposition</hi> so prompt, free, apt and facile.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101535:17"/>
Therefore to be made <hi>like God,</hi> is to be <hi>made perfect,</hi> according to the <hi>ultimate intendment</hi> of these words. The <hi>vision,</hi> or <hi>knowledge of God</hi> in the <hi>heavenly state,</hi> being never intended for idle, ineffectual speculation; as this <hi>perfection</hi> is not otherwise to be understood, than with reference to <hi>the ends</hi> we were made for; that we may be immediately capable of, and apt for everlasting <hi>adoration</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of the blessed God, in a <hi>joint,</hi> and <hi>most full</hi> consent, and communion, with the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> the whole <hi>Community</hi> of all the <hi>blessed Spirits</hi> besides, whose eternal <hi>work</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> this will be.</p>
            <p>This <hi>likeness to God</hi> must yet be understood with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the <hi>Divine Peculiarities,</hi> as hath been elsewhere shewn, <note n="*" place="margin">Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Righteous <hi>p.</hi> 69<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> (whither we now refer, only to save the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of transcribing.) In respect of which <hi>Peculiarities</hi> also, there must be on our part, a <hi>correspondency,</hi> i. e. a likeness <hi>with allowance</hi> for necessary disagreement, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>Seal</hi> and the <hi>impression,</hi> where what is <hi>convex</hi> in the one, is <hi>hollow</hi> in the other, and yet <hi>otherwise</hi> like, <hi>i. e.</hi> correspondent to each other too. So the case is between the blessed God's <hi>All-sufficient fulness,</hi> and our <hi>receptive emptiness,</hi> between his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and our <hi>Subjection.</hi> In respect to other things common to him and us, with the rest of those happy Spirits that inhabit the Regions of light and bliss, <hi>Spirituality it self, Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Wisdom, Holiness, Love, Serenity, Benignity, Mercy, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> there is a <hi>nearer resemblance;</hi> these things passing under the <hi>same name</hi> with him, and with us, but with the <hi>infinite inequality</hi> still, of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if here we give our selves leave to pause a while, and contemplate those innumerable multitudes of pure and happy Creatures, perfected, or ever perfect Spirits,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101535:17"/>
that inhabit and replenish those ample spacious Regions above, the vast (and to us, or to any thought of ours) immense and endless <hi>Tracts</hi> of Light and Glory. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them every one composed, and made up of lively <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> as we are told <hi>God is light,</hi> 1 John 1. 5. and <hi>God is love,</hi> chap. 4. vers. 16. Consider them all as <hi>most intelligent,</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> Creatures, even of the most <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> and <hi>hidden Mysteries,</hi> that <hi>here</hi> were wont to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and puzzle the most inquisitive mind; ignorant of nothing, or apt to comprehend any thing, needful, and pleasant to be known, or lawful to be enquir'd into; curious to know nothing useless, or unlawful; most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wise Creatures, prudent Sages, endowed with a self-governing wisdom; so as easily, without a vexatious solicitude, and anxiety, but with a noble freedom, to order and command all their Thoughts, Appetitions, Actions, and Deportments towards <hi>God, themselves,</hi> and <hi>one another,</hi> so as never to be guilty of <hi>mistake</hi> or <hi>error</hi> in any motion of <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>will.</hi> Never to omit any thing <hi>in its season,</hi> or do any thing <hi>out of season.</hi> Consider them whether <hi>in solemn Assembly</hi> (which <hi>may</hi> be stated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual by successively appointed numbers for ought we know) or diverting and retiring, or faring to and fro, as inclination, with allowance, or command, may direct. Yet <hi>all</hi> every where <hi>full of God,</hi> continually receiving the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, satisfying, glorious Communications of the every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where present, self-manifesting Deity, all full of reverence, and most dutiful love to the Eternal Father of Spirits, his Eternal Son, and Spirit, all form'd into perpetual, lowliest, and most grateful adoration, with highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure, all apprehensive of their depending state, and that they owe their all to that Fulness which filleth all in all. Every one in his own eyes a <hi>self-nothing,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101535:18"/>
having no separate, divided Interest, Sentiment, Will, or Inclination. Every one continually self-consistent, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himself; ever free of all self-displeasure, never finding any cause, or shadow of a cause, for any angry self-reflection upon any undue <hi>thought</hi> or <hi>wish</hi> in that their <hi>present, perfect state,</hi> though not unmindful what they were, or might have been, and ascribing their present <hi>state,</hi> and <hi>stability,</hi> to the Grace of God, and dedicating their All to the praise and glory of that most Free and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Grace; all well assured, and unsuspiciously conscious, with unexpressible satisfaction, of their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God; and placing with the fullest sense and relish their very life in his favour. All full of the most complacential benignity towards one another, counting each one's felicity his own, and every one's enjoyments being accordingly multiply'd so many thousand-fold, as he apprehends every one as perfectly pleased and happy as himself.</p>
            <p>Let but any one recount these things with himself, as he easily may with far greater enlargement of thoughts, many more such things as these, and he needs not be at a loss for a notion of <hi>this perfect state</hi> of the <hi>Spirits of the Just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for further confirmation, as well as for a some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more distinct and explicite conception hereof, let it be moreover considered,</p>
            <p>What was the undertaking and design of <hi>our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> to whom the next words directs our eye; <hi>and to Jesus the Mediator of the new testament, and to the blood of sprinkling,</hi> &amp;c. He was to be the <hi>Restorer</hi> of these (once) lost Apostate Spirits; and besides reconciling them to God by his <hi>blood, that speaks better things than that of Abel,</hi> was to impart his own Spirit to them; and by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101535:18"/>
the Tenour of that <hi>New Testament,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereof he was Mediator, was not only to procure that their sins and iniquities should be remembred no more, but that the <hi>Divine Laws</hi> should be <hi>put in their minds,</hi> and <hi>written in their hearts,</hi> Chap 8. 10, 12. They are therefore, <hi>by the blood of the everlasting covenant to be made perfect,</hi> Chap. 13. 20, 21. <hi>in every good work to do his will,</hi> having <hi>all that wrought in them which is well-pleasing in his sight through Christ Jesus.</hi> Now <hi>when</hi> shall he be said to have accomplish'd his design? Not till <hi>every one be presented perfect</hi> (Col. 1. 28.) <hi>and faultless in the presence of the divine glory</hi> (Jude 24.) Do but consider what was a design worthy of so great an Undertaker, the <hi>Son of</hi> God; and of his being engaged so deeply, of his being so earnestly intent upon it, as to become first a <hi>Man,</hi> then a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to effect it.</p>
            <p>Consider his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection;</hi> wherein he will have all that belong to him have a <hi>(Consortium)</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation with him, and conformity to him; as is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoursed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and hence we are to make our estimate what is the mark and <hi>price of the high calling of God in Christ,</hi> 12, 14. This can be no other than <hi>final consummate Christianity;</hi> the Christians high calling <hi>in termino;</hi> and which they that are <hi>inchoatively perfect</hi> (or sincere) must be <hi>so minded</hi> as to design it for themselves, <hi>verse</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me but tell any man, so that he can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me, what <hi>true Christianity,</hi> now, is, and he can tell me what <hi>Heaven</hi> is. Let me tell him, what it is to be a <hi>sincere Christian</hi> in <hi>this present state,</hi> and he can tell me what it is to be perfect in the <hi>Heavenly state.</hi> The writing God's Law in the heart truly, and perfectly, goes far towards both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:101535:19"/>
The two great Commandments impress'd, that are both <hi>fulsill'd in Love,</hi> are of vast compass to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and with the <hi>certain connexa,</hi> comprehend all; <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. And<hi>—thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> &amp;c. What an Heaven upon Earth, would these two create, reduc'd to practice! And when the impression is perfect, What needs there more?</p>
            <p>But God knows, men too commonly measure their <hi>Heaven</hi> by their <hi>Christianity,</hi> on the wrong hand; a <hi>Christianity</hi> and an <hi>Heaven, both external</hi> and <hi>foreign</hi> to them. God deliver me from this so palpable and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive a delusion of a <hi>Christianity,</hi> and an <hi>Heaven</hi> foreign <hi>to my Soul!</hi> A <hi>Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Felicity</hi> that touch not our Minds, that never <hi>impress</hi> our Inner Man; What can we be the better for them? What to be impos'd upon by so absurd a misconceit, and so repugnant to Scripture? Which so expresly tells us <hi>that</hi> Glory we are finally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, is a Glory whereby we are to <hi>be glorified, made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> and to be <hi>revealed in us,</hi> and wherein we are to partake with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17, 18. Or did the Son of God <hi>put on</hi> Man, and suffer so deeply for us, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon us, less than this?</p>
            <p>But now my work is done (nor do my limits allow me to enlarge) in reference to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Head of Discourse proposed, In what sense sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christians may be said to be <hi>already</hi> come to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Just made perfect. Enough may be collected from what hath been said.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be understood</p>

            <p>And now, if <hi>that</hi> were the <hi>thing design'd,</hi> there is a <hi>most Adequate</hi> groundwork laid for a true, and the most ample <hi>Encomium</hi> of that <hi>rare Person,</hi> our never too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lamented, nor too highly Renowned <hi>Queen,</hi> whose <hi>Funerals</hi> drew my thoughts to <hi>this Theme.</hi> View the <hi>Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Spirits of the Just</hi> as they were grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more eminently grown towards their highest pitch; and <hi>here is our Ground.</hi> Do not wonder it is laid as high as <hi>Heaven;</hi> for <hi>thence</hi> they <hi>begin,</hi> as well as <hi>end there.</hi> By most benign influences <hi>from thence,</hi> tho the plant was set <hi>on Earth,</hi> they had an <hi>early bud,</hi> in <hi>conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but we have seen them <hi>blossom</hi> in <hi>open view,</hi> still aspiring <hi>thitherward;</hi> as <hi>there</hi> they are <hi>fully blown.</hi> Her, <hi>otherwise,</hi> Royal Parentage was, <hi>thus,</hi> incomparably <hi>more</hi> Royal.

Multitudes went to see it, and Her Highness being inform'd of it, said She was willing to see it too, but thought She should not, for it was then too late for that Evening, and She reckoned by <hi>Monday</hi> it would be shiver'd to Pieces, (tho it remaining entire till then, She was pleas'd to view it that day) but She <hi>resolved,</hi> She added, <hi>She would not give so ill an Example, as to go see it on the Lord's-Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next</hi> to her exemplary <hi>Piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> shone with a <hi>second</hi> Lustre her most amiable <hi>Benignity</hi> towards <hi>men;</hi> and peculiarly towards them whom she judg'd <hi>Pious,</hi> of whatsoever Persuasion in respect of the Circumstances of Religion. <hi>She opened not her mouth, but with Wisdom,</hi> and in her Tongue was the <hi>Law of Kindness.</hi> She hath divers times express'd her Acceptance, Value, and Desire of their Prayers, whom she knew in some <hi>Modes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to differ from her; as one that well understood, that <hi>the kingdom of God stands</hi> not in lesser things, but <hi>in righteousness, peace,</hi> &amp;c and <hi>that they who in these things serve Christ, are acceptable to God,</hi> and are to be <hi>approved of men.</hi> She was not inaccessible to such of Her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whose dissentient Judgments in some such things, put them into lower Circumstances. Great She was in all valuable Excellencies, nor Greater in any, than in Her most Condescending Goodness. Her <hi>singular Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> adorn'd all the rest. Speaking once of a good thing which She intended, She added, <hi>But of myself I can do nothing;</hi> and somewhat being by one (of two more on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) then present, interposed, She answered, <hi>She hoped God would help Her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101535:21"/>
She is, as the <hi>Text</hi> speaks, gone to <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> in the highest Sense of that Phrase.</p>
            <p>And to sum up all, he that will read the Character, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15, and 24. of an <hi>Inhabitant</hi> of that <hi>Holy Hill,</hi> will there read Her <hi>True</hi> and <hi>most Just Character.</hi> Wherein I cannot omit to take notice, how Sacred She reckoned Her Word. I know with whom She hath sometimes conferr'd, Whether, having given a Promise of such a <hi>seeming</hi> Import, She could consistently therewith do so or so, saying, That <hi>whatever Prejudice it were to Her, She would never depart from Her Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Rich Endowments every way accomplish'd Her for all the Duties that belong'd to Her, whether in Her <hi>Christian, Conjugal,</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> Capacity. Which if we consider together, the World cannot give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for many By-past Ages, of so much lost out of it in <hi>One Person.</hi> When did <hi>Christianity</hi> lose so conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Ornament? A <hi>King</hi> so Delectable and Helpful a <hi>Consort?</hi> A <hi>Kingdom</hi> so Venerable and Belov'd a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign?</hi> For <hi>our King,</hi> how are we concern'd to pray, Lord, <hi>remember David, and all his Afflictions?</hi> And we are to hope he hath some such sincere <hi>Purposes</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> deeply infix'd in his heart, as those subjoin'd in <hi>that Psalm;</hi> which will engage the Divine Presence with <note place="margin">Psal. 132.</note> him; by which, neither shall his <hi>Pressures</hi> be intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor his <hi>Difficulties</hi> insuperable; but <hi>his how shall abide in strength, and the arms of his hands be made strong, by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> 
               <hi>the hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>England, England!</hi> How deplorable is thy case! In what Agonies should every concern'd heart be for thee, <hi>O England! In the latter days</hi> (and God grant they be not too late!) thou may'st consider, That after many former, defeated Methods, thou hadst a <hi>Prince</hi> (yea,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101535:22"/>
Princes) studiously intent upon making thee a <hi>Reformed, Happy</hi> People. Is there now no Cause to fear, lest it be determined, <hi>Let him that is filthy be filthy still, and him that is unjust be unjust still.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few can be ignorant of the Endeavours of our <hi>most Gracious Queen</hi> to that purpose. And I am persuaded, nothing did more recommend our deceased, excellent Archbishop to Her Majesty, than that She knew <hi>His Heart</hi> to be <hi>as Hers,</hi> in that Design, <hi>viz. Of a General Reformation of Manners,</hi> that must have concern'd <hi>all Parties;</hi> and without which, (leading and preparing us thereto) <hi>Union,</hi> and the <hi>Cessation of Parties,</hi> was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to have been hoped for. And so far as I could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, the Attempt of it was as little intended; being otherwise not likely to meet with either a <hi>Blessing from God,</hi> or any sufficient <hi>Disposition</hi> to it <hi>with Men.</hi> Great <hi>Dispositions</hi> must, with much Gratitude to God, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd in those who hold that <hi>Supreme,</hi> and <hi>this Subordinate</hi> Station. But such a Work is not likely to succeed, till (by whatsoever Means) Minds be brought <hi>to that Temper,</hi> that it will <hi>even do it self.</hi> And that <hi>Two such Persons</hi> should be remov'd <hi>out of them,</hi> within not much more than a <hi>Month's time,</hi> is an <hi>Awful Umbrage</hi> to us of a <hi>Divine determination,</hi> That <hi>less gentle Methods are fitter for us.</hi> And God's Holy Will be done!</p>
            <p>It is now obvious to any considering Person, That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very useful Reflections might be made upon the Text, and the Occasion together. I shall shut up this present Discourse with these that follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ought to be most remote from us to confine in our narrow thoughts, sincere <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi> to a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101535:22"/>
               <hi>Party</hi> distinguisht by <hi>little things;</hi> and most <hi>extra-essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> thereto. Take we that great Apostles Document, <hi>I perceive God is not respecter of persons;</hi> and what he said of Nations, may not we as aptly say that of <hi>all such Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> They <hi>that fear God, and work righteousness, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him,</hi> Act. 10.</p>
            <p>Let us once learn to reckon substantial Godliness a greater thing, than <hi>the using,</hi> or <hi>not using this</hi> or <hi>that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.</hi> And account, that <hi>Faith, Mercy, Judgment, and the love of God,</hi> are not to be <hi>past over</hi> for as little things, as the <hi>tything of mint, annise, and cummin.</hi> I believe there are few in the World, if they cast their Eyes about them, but might truly say (what I thank God, I have often thought) that of <hi>all our Parties that hold the Substantials of Religion, I have known some of far greater value than my self.</hi> Let <hi>the being a good Christian,</hi> signify more with us, than <hi>to belong to a so—or so—shap'd, or—figured Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Noted Writer</hi> among the Ancients brings in one, saying, by way of exprobration to <hi>Christians,</hi> There is <note place="margin">Min. Fel.</note> 
               <hi>Socrates the Prince of Wisdom, if any among you be so great, let them imitate him, if they can.</hi> What <hi>Persuasion</hi> among us, can produce a <hi>greater Example</hi> than we have been now considering, or more worthy the imitation <hi>even of Private Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirits of the Just on Earth are in a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity, and have a near alliance to Heaven. They are not <hi>there</hi> to have the <hi>first foundations</hi> laid of their <hi>blessed state,</hi> but are only to be <hi>made perfect.</hi> They have in them <hi>here</hi> the first Principles, the Elements of their <hi>final blessedness.</hi> Heaven in <hi>little.</hi> As the <hi>Acorn</hi> contains the <hi>Tree,</hi> or the <hi>Embrio</hi> the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:101535:23"/>
3. The Just in this World are of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They <hi>are come</hi> to the General Assembly, the Church of the First-born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All sincere Christians, whether in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> (as hath been noted) make but one Family, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 15. Good God! Can our <hi>little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> here, set us at greater distance than <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth!</hi> The Observation is worth considering of that <note place="margin">Lord Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul.</hi> Adv. of Learn. <hi>lib.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Noble</hi> Person. <hi>It will be found a matter of great moment and use, to define what, and of what latitude those points are, which discorporate men from the body of the Church—And if any think this hath been done, now, long ago, let them seriously consider with what sincerity, and moderation the same hath been performed—</hi>&amp;c. And if it had not been done with <hi>due</hi> sincerity, and <hi>moderation</hi> in <hi>his days,</hi> it's much to be doubted whether it have, <hi>since.</hi> In the mean time it is to be consider'd, that what <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth</hi> any thing, <hi>constitutes</hi> it. And if a Church (of whatsoever denomination) be constituted <hi>in its superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> (though its <hi>foundation</hi> be good) of <hi>Hay and Stubble,</hi> of things that can belong to no Church, <hi>as a Church,</hi> it <hi>must</hi> some time or other <hi>suffer loss.</hi> And though the <hi>Builders be saved,</hi> it must be by a more penetrative, than an <hi>imagined, Purgatory-fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Angels must have kind propensions towards men, especially <hi>good men,</hi> in this World, knowing <hi>these</hi> are of the <hi>same Society</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> with them, though the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom</hi> hath not judg'd it suitable to our <hi>present state of probation,</hi> there should be an open, and common, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between them and us. 'Tis however, a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity, we should have strange, uncouth, shy, fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or unfrequent thoughts of them, in the mean time.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:101535:23"/>
5. When we find any <hi>excellent Persons</hi> in our World, attain far, and high towards the perfection of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly State, it ought to be a great encouragement to us, and is an obligation, to aspire to <hi>some like pitch.</hi> We see, it is not an <hi>impossible,</hi> or an <hi>unpracticable</hi> thing; and should disdain to crawl, now, as Worms, when we are to soar as Angels.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We ought hereupon to <hi>acknowledge</hi> and <hi>adore,</hi> the <hi>Munificence,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> that it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the making of such <hi>Abjects</hi> as we, fit to be associated with <hi>such an Assembly, the innumerable company of Angels, and the spirits of the just made perfect;</hi> and will not fail to effect it, if we comply with the apt methods, appointed for that blessed purpose.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When such <hi>ascend,</hi> and are taken up from us, that God had eminently prepared <hi>for translation,</hi> we should take great care lest we <hi>unduly</hi> regret it. That we do not envy <hi>Heaven its own.</hi> To which they are <hi>more a-kin,</hi> than to <hi>our Earth.</hi> And which had a greater right in them than we could pretend.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We should look upon <hi>Funeral Solemnities</hi> for <hi>such,</hi> with more <hi>prospect</hi> than <hi>retrospect,</hi> and consider them as directing our Eye less downward to our own <hi>forsaken World,</hi> than upwards to the <hi>Celestial Regions</hi> and <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi> To such, to <hi>dye,</hi> is to be <hi>born.</hi> They dye only out of our mean World, and are born into a most glorious one. <hi>Their Funerals</hi> should be celebrations of their <hi>ascent;</hi> and an exulting Joy should, therefore, <hi>in that case,</hi> not be quite banisht from <hi>Funeral Sorrows,</hi> but be allow'd to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle therewith, as Sun-beams glittering in a Cloud. When the <hi>greatest Person</hi> was leaving this world, that even lived in it, He says, <hi>If you loved me, you would rejoice that I say, I go to the Father.</hi> We should bear our part <hi>in the joys of</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101535:24"/>
               <hi>heaven,</hi> upon this Occasion, if we <hi>relate to it.</hi> And when we are told, there is <hi>joy there,</hi> among the Angels of God for the <hi>conversion</hi> of such, who are thereby but prepared to <hi>come to their Assembly,</hi> we may conclude there is much more, for <hi>their glorification,</hi> when they are fully come, and joined to it. <hi>Funeral Solemnities</hi> are very dull, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, <hi>shews,</hi> without <hi>such</hi> references <hi>forwards,</hi> and <hi>upwards.</hi> With how different a temper of mind would <hi>two Persons</hi> have been the Spectators of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, The one of whom should have lookt no further than the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians</hi> did, who would only say <hi>some great Person is dead.</hi> But the other, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination is enabled to apprehend, <hi>This dust</hi> here mingles with <hi>the earth of this Land,</hi> to presignify this People, of whom he was the <hi>Head,</hi> must possess it. Yea, moreover, here the <hi>Great God</hi> will fix his Residence and Throne. Upon <hi>such a Mount</hi> shall be the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Supream King. Here,</hi> after great Mutations and Revolutions, and great Destructions, both of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> shall <hi>this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> have a long succession of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> that shall be <hi>of themselves.</hi> And all this but as represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> that shall <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> over all the Earth, and reach up, at length into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Canaan</hi> shall be an <hi>Holy Land.</hi> Unto <hi>Sion's King</hi> shall Tributary Princes bring their Gifts out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> stretch out her hands; and all Nations serve him. His Empire shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine with the <hi>Universe,</hi> and <hi>all Power</hi> be given him, both in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> With what a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>raised</hi> mind, would <hi>such a One</hi> have beheld <hi>this Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral!</hi> What better <hi>Canaan</hi> than we now behold, <hi>we</hi> shall have <hi>in this world</hi> God knows! And we should be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101535:24"/>
the less solicitous to know <hi>intermediate things,</hi> when we are so fully ascertain'd of the <hi>glorious end of all things.</hi> And let us reflect upon the <hi>solemn Pomp</hi> of that late <hi>Mournful Assembly</hi> that lamented <hi>our Queen</hi>'s departure <hi>out of our world,</hi> comparing it with the <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent Magnificence</hi> of that <hi>Triumphant Assembly</hi> into which she is received above.</p>
