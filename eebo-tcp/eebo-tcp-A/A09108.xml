            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="11">11.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5406:11"/>
moueth more doubts then he can aunsvvere or dissolue. And this happeneth not only in vnlearned people, vvhich by no meanes can descerne vvhich party hath the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vvhen both parts are learned &amp; alleage arguments for themselues, in matters aboue their capacity, but euen the most learned also, yf they haue no other meanes of resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then arguing to and fro by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, are brought many-times to be more doubtfull therby then before, &amp; this euen in matters both naturall and morall of this life. The reason vvherof is, that mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge being limited, and the light of knovvledge imparted vnto him from God, being but a little particle or sparkle of his infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knovvledge: yt cometh to passe, that the more this sparkle is exercised, &amp; inkendled in searching
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5406:11"/>
out Gods vvorks and secrets in this life, the more yt seeth her ovvne vveaknes, and beginneth to doubt more, &amp; to be more ambiguous in herselfe, vvhether that vvhich shee apprehendeth be truly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or no, or vvhether by further search shee shall not find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise, and see herselfe deceaued in this apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as she hath found in many other apprehensions that vvent before, vvhen she had lesse knovvledge.</p>
            <p n="12">12.

                  <hi>into wine, or remaine togeather with the wine?</hi> In which cases yow see first, that this manner of dealinge were preposterous and impertinent wrangling, but especially, yf the wrangler did deny expressely that there was any gold at all in the purse, or wine in the vessell, for then yt were too too much folly for him to dispute the secondary questions whether the said gold were there alone, or with other mettalles; or whether the wine had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it selfe or no; for yf neither gold nor wine be really there prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then is there no place for the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dispute at all. And so fareth it in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy of the <hi>reall presence</hi> of Christs body.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5406:21"/>
as in this first disputation at <hi>Oxford, Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> begon with Transubstantiation, and was much longer therein, then in the controuersie of the reall presence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And in the second disputation of <hi>B. Ridley</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> two only questions being propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; the first was by preposterous order of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and the second of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but the <hi>reall presence</hi> was wholy omytted, and the like in the rourth disputation vnder <hi>Maister</hi>

                  <hi>Pearne</hi> for the Protestants, as after yow shall see. And when lastly <hi>Maister Ridley</hi> came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vpon all three disputations, held vnder him in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the questions handled therin, he quite passeth ouer the controuersie of <hi>reall presence.</hi> And so yow shall obserue the like tricke in most of the other disputations, and yet (as I say) yf there be no reall presence, the question of Transubstantiation hath no place at all, no nor the sacrifice neyther, as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dley</hi> confesseth in his said resolution, and this for the first shift of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> &amp; his fellowes in this disputation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The second shifte is, that he putteth downe fraudulently the second question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 1249.</note> the <hi>reall presence,</hi> whether the body of Christ be there <hi>carnally or corporally,</hi> for albeit we do hold that both <hi>Caro &amp; Corpus,</hi> which is <note place="margin">2. fraud.</note> the flesh and body of Christ our Sauiour, be there truly and really, yet not after a fleshely and corporall manner, as these words seeme to import, but rather Sacramentally, that is to say though <hi>truly,</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> yet <hi>after a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5406:21"/>
and spirituall manner,</hi> euen as our soule is in our body, and an Angell in a corporall place. And albeit some authors and Fathers do vse sometymes the word <hi>Corporaliter,</hi> speakinge of the reall presence, yet do <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously euery where call <hi>yt a carnall and corporall presence,</hi> therby to deceaue the simple reader, <note place="margin">See after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> as though yt were there with locall dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, after the manner of other bodyes, and not after a spirituall manner of being.</p>

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of noble men, &amp; all other degrees was great, and scaffolds made for the place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, that the multitude might the better heare: but all that were indifferent, did see matters to be handled with great inequality; for that whosoeuer spake for the Catholike side presently his speach was eyther interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or for breuity shifted of to another tyme, and <hi>Ridley</hi> that was the Captayne of all step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge

               <p n="22">22. <hi>Ridley</hi> then began the assembly with these words: <hi>There hath byn an ancient custome amonge you, that after disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had in your common schooles,</hi>

                  <hi>vvhat I do thinke and beleeue my selfe, and what all other ought to thinke of the same, vvhich I vvould that afterward ye did with diligence weigh and ponder, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man at home seuerally by himselfe, &amp;c.</hi> This is his preface, wherin yow may note first, what a different assurance it is for a man, to repose the saluation of his soule vpon this new beleefe and thinkinge of <hi>Maister Ridley,</hi> which was not yet as yt seemeth full three or foure yeares old with him (for vntill <hi>K. Henryes</hi> death he was euer held of another opinion) or vpon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall determination, learninge, iudgement, piety, &amp; consent of the worthiest in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, assembled togeather in councells, wheroften, (as in our preface we haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and shall againe afterward) had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined for the <hi>reall presence</hi> in the space of the <note place="margin">Diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s about the vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants beliefe.</note> last 500. yeares, before this contrary determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Ridley,</hi> to witt after the question was once moued by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> vntill yt was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:5406:29"/>
againe by <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius;</hi> lett euery discreet man, I say, consider what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce this is, for a man to aduenture his soule and euerlastinge inheritance theron. For yf a man had demaunded of <hi>Ridley</hi> himselfe 4. or 5. yeares before this day, what a man <hi>was bound to thinke and beleeue</hi> in this point for sauinge his soule, he would haue said the quite contrary to that he determineth now.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Secondly yow may consider another difference in this priuate determination, of <hi>Ridley</hi> &amp; his associates from that of Catholike Councells, for that Councells after enquiry and disputations made for the truth, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne by generall consent of the Bishopps assembled, with assured assistance of the holy ghost; wheras <hi>Maister Ridley</hi> remytteth all to the priuate iudgement <hi>of euery one at home, seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by himselfe;</hi> which is as much to say, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the disputation, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, yet must euery man and woman follow their owne fancy <hi>at home,</hi> and be iudge of all that hath byn disputed, or determyned: &amp; this is the certainty that Protestants haue for common people to rely vpon.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Thirdly yt is to be noted, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Fox calleth this decision, <hi>the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Doctor Nicolas Ridley B. of Rochester, vpon the conclusions aboue prefixed,</hi> yet handleth he only two questions in this his determination vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet; <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> but the first much more amply and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, pretermitting the very cheefe &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5406:29"/>
question in deed, wherof all the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, which is of the <hi>reall presence,</hi> which maketh the very essence of <hi>Caluinian</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glain</hi> sect, wherby they do differ from both <hi>Lutherans</hi> and vs: of which absurd imposture we haue spoken sufficiently before, and seing so much had byn said in the former disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about that point, though greatly against the Protestants inclination, me thinketh he ought not to haue left out wholy that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in this his determination. But as I haue often said, their principall shift in those dayes was to stepp from the mayne point, whether Christ were really in the Sacrament or no; &amp; to leape vnto a quiddity of the manner of his being there, to witt by Transubstantiation. <note place="margin">Fiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended heades of Ridleyes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> About which notwithstandinge, <hi>B. Ridley</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth his resolution with great oftentation of words sayinge; that he had fiue principall grounds or head springs for the same: <hi>First</hi> (to vse his words) <hi>the authority, Maiestie, and verity of the scriptures: secondly the most certayne testimonyes of ancient Catholike Fathers: thirdly the definition of a Sacrament: fourthly the abhominable heresie of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches, that may ensue of Transubstantiation: fifthly, the most sure beleefe of the article of our faith;</hi> he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. These be <hi>Maister Ridleyes</hi> fiue bulwarks or castles of defence builded in the ayre, which he handleth so fondly and childishely, as after yow shall see in the particular examinations of his arguments. Only heere I will say in generall, that the reader shall find his <hi>authority,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5406:30"/>
maiestie,</hi> and <hi>verity</hi> of scriptures against Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, to be a meere vaunt and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for he hath no one cleere or substantiall place at all. And as for his certayne testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of the ancient Fathers, they will proue so vncertaine for his purpose, as yow shall see them most certaynely against him. His third castle of the definition of a Sacrament, vvill proue a cottage of no strength at all, for that the true nature of a Sacrament standeth well vvith Transubstantiation. His fourth head springe about the heresie of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> will proue a puddle, and himselfe puzzeled therin, for that the heresie of <hi>Eutiches</hi> confoundinge two distinct natures in Christ, hath no more cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vvith <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> then <hi>Rochester</hi> with <hi>Rome.</hi> And finally his last ground about the article of Christs ascendinge into heauen, hath no ground to rest on, but is a meere ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination in the ayre, to witt, that for so much as Christ ascended into heauen, <hi>ergo</hi> there is no Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Wherefore to leaue this first question of Transubstantiation, and passe to the second of <note place="margin">Ridleyes resolution about the sacrifice of the masse.</note> sacrifice, vow must vnderstand, that when <hi>Maister Ridley</hi> had spent most of the time about <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> he had little left concerning <hi>the sacrifice of the masse,</hi> but concluded his said determination in very few words thus: <hi>Now for the better conclusion</hi> (saith he) <hi>concerning the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, because yt dependeth vpon the first, I will in few</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 1262.</note> 
                  <hi>vvords declare what I thinke. Two things do persuade me, that this conclusion</hi> (against the sacrifice of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5406:30"/>
masse) <hi>is true, that is certayne places of scripture, and certayne testimonyes of the Fathers.</hi> Lo heere the graue and weighty motiues that <hi>Ridley</hi> had, to aduenture vpon so great a change in beleefe as this was, after so many yeares, being a Priest and Catholike Bishopp, and offeringe sacrifice after the manner of the Catholike Church, from the first day of our contreyes conuersion, vnto th'end of K. Henryes raigne. His motiues were, as yow heare, <hi>certayne places of the scripture,</hi> which were only taken out of the Epistle to the Hebrues, talkinge of Christs bloudy sacrifice on the crosse, which was but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> one, &amp; certayne places of the Fathers, to witt, two or three misvnderstood out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <hi>Ridley.</hi>
                  </note> and one out of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge proue nothinge for his purpose, as after yow shall see declared in their place, and turne. And the selfe same Fathers haue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cleere places to the contrary, as we will desire no better iudges for proofe of our Catholike cause, then yf <hi>Ridley</hi> would remitt himselfe to these two Fathers iudgements, by him cyted against vs; for that both of them do professe themselues to be Priests, and to offer externall sacrifice, vpon the Altar as our Priests do now.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Consider then how wise and constant a man <hi>Ridley</hi> was, to leaue his ancient faith so generally receaued throughout all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in his dayes, and so many yeares practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by himselfe, vpon two such motiues, as are <hi>certayne places of scripture misvnderstood by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5406:31"/>
and certayne testimonyes of Fathers,</hi> that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him to haue some difficulty. Which Ieuity vvas so displeasaunt vnto almighty God, as by the effects we see, that wheras at the beginning he seemed to doubt vpon these two motiues, leauinge other men to iudge therof, he became by little and little to be so obstinately blinded at length therin, as albeit some foure or fiue yeares after, he were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuicted in disputations at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as by his answers yow shall afterwards see, yet was he content to burne for the same, which was the highest degree of calamity that could fall vpon him, in body and soule. And thus much of him and his determination for the present.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 1262 &amp; 1263.</note> 
                  <hi>disputations aboue mentioned, other disputations vvere holden in Cambridge shortly after by</hi> Martyn Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, <hi>vpon these conclusions followinge:</hi> First, <hi>that the canonicall bookes of scripture alone, do sufficiently teach the regenerate all things necessary belonginge to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Secondly, <hi>there is no Church on earth that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, as well in faith, as in manners.</hi> Thirdly <hi>we are so iustified freely of God, that before our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

well I may call paradoxes, for that euen in the common sense &amp; iudgement of euery meane capacity, the falsity and absurdity therof is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant.

And finally, the conclusion of all this conference with <hi>Philpott</hi> was, that the prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor in the end, seing him out of all reason to trouble the house, layed two comaundements vpon him; the first that he should not come thither any more, vnlesse he came in gowne and typpett, as the others came: the second, that he should not speake but in order, and with licence as the rest did; whose aunswere <hi>Fox</hi> relateth in these words: <hi>then quoth Philpott</hi>

examine what arguments <hi>Cranmer</hi> could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage against the <hi>reall presence,</hi> vpon the fourth day of disputation, to witt the next day after <hi>Latymer</hi> had ended.

like controuersies: and the punishments were no other then such, as auncient Ecclesiasticall Cannons did prescribe, and were vsed only towards them, that eyther had byn cheefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the innouations, or stood so obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely in defence therof, as by no meanes they could be recalled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now then yt is to be considered, which of these two sorts of people had more ground or reason, either those, that withstood the first change in <hi>K.

For as for the first sort, to witt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, the historicall state of their controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <note place="margin">The state of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie in three questions.</note> is manifest, concerninge these three que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions about the Sacrament; for that no man can deny, but that the doctrine of the first, and third, which is the <hi>reall presence,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> had byn receaued and held for true through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out England, (wherein concurred also the vvhole Christian vvorld abroad) from the tyme before by me prefixed of our first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, and more, euen from the Apostles dayes: neyther could any tyme be appointed, or memory brought forth, when, how, or by whome, the said doctrines had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in England, or els where, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to <hi>S.

            <p n="4">4. And as for the second question of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> though yt be but a certayne appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the first, about the manner how Christ is really in the Sacrament, as <note n="*" place="margin">Sup. cap. praeced.</note> before hath byn shewed, &amp; was not so particularly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and defined by the Church in this very tearme of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> vntill some 400. <note place="margin">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5406:49"/>
both the Greeke and Latyn Church agreed; and after great and longe searche by readinge, disputinge, prayinge, conferringe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and Fathers, and other such meanes, concluded this doctrine to be truth: Yf there had byn (I say) nothinge els for English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks to rest vpon in this point, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent, and agreement of so learned, holy, and venerable an assembly; yt might iustly seeme sufficient in the sight of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent or reasonable man to weygh, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weygh, against the particular iudgements of all the innouators of any age to the contrary; and so no maruayle, though they stood so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest against that innouation, this being the state of the controuersie on their part.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But now for the Protestants, the state of their question was farre different.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5406:49"/>
and sound of words: yt seemed good to our English Protestants at that tyme, or the more part therof, to choose the last and newest opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all, and to establish yt by parlament, banishinge ther vpon the ould faith, that euer vntill that day had byn held and beleeued in our countrey, as well by themselues as others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And thus came in the first new Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But yet before we come to that, two other points seeme expedient to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for better direction of the readers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandinge in these high misteryes of our faith: the first to see what sure grounds the Catholiks had, and haue at this day to stand firme, and immoueable in their old beleefe about these articles, notwithstandinge any plausible or deceytfull arguments of sense and reason, that may be brought against them; &amp; secondly certayne obseruations, wherby the force or rather fraud of hereticall obiections may be discouered, which so beguyled many simple people in <hi>Q.

               <p n="8">8. The first ground that Catholike men haue of these, and all other misteryes of Christian

And this is such a ground, as we see by experience, that the most part of people of what Religion soeuer, being yonge or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, can yeld no other reason in effect, why they beleeue this or that article of theire faith, but for that they receaued the same from their Church and teachers therof, being not able themselues to searche out any other grounde therof: yea the most learned of all from their infancy, tooke all vpon this assurance only of their Church, which Church yf they held to be of infallible authority, so as she can neither be deceaued nor deceaue (as we do of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike) then should they rest firme &amp; sure in their opinion vpon this ground; but yf they hould that all Churches may erre, and bringe into error both in doctrine, and manners, as yow haue heard <hi>Martyn Bucer</hi> hold before in his <hi>Cambridge</hi> conclusions, and most sectaryes <note place="margin">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5406:51"/>
consequently they must needs be said both to liue and dye, vvithout any ground of their faith at all, but proper opinion, and so perish euerlastingely.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The famous Doctor <hi>S. Augustine</hi> handleth this matter in a speciall booke to his frend <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus</hi> deceaued by the Manichies, as himselfe also sometymes had byn, and he intituleth his booke <hi>De vtilitate credendi:</hi> of the profitt that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. tom.</hi> 6.</note> commeth to a man by beleeuing the Church, and points of faith therin taught, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundinge reason or proofe therof, which the Manichies derided, and said that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired nothinge to be beleeued of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but that which first should be proued to them by good proofe and reason, and not depend only of mens creditt: but the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scorneth this hereticall bragg and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theirs, and commendeth highly the contrary custome of simple beleeuinge vpon the creditt of the Catholike Church, for that otherwise infinite people should haue no faith at all, and exhorteth his frend <hi>Honoratus</hi> to take the same course; first to beleeue, and after to seeke the reason. His discourse is this: <hi>Fac nos nunc primum quaerere, cuinam Religioni, animas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stras,</hi>

                  <q>Suppose that we now first of all did seeke, vnto what Religion we should commit our soules to be purged and rectified; without all doubt we must begin with the Catholike Church, for that she is the most eminent now in the world, there being more Christians in her, at this day, then in any other Church of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5406:51"/>
Iewes, and Gentills put togeather: And albeit amongst these Christians, there may be sects and heresies, and all of them would seeme to be Catholiks, and do call others besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues heretiks: yet all graunt, that yf we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the whole body of the world, there is one Church amongst the rest more eminent then all other, &amp; more plentifull in number, &amp; (as they which know her do affirme) more sincere also in truth; but as concerninge truth, we shall dispute more afterward; now yt is sufficient for them that desire to learne, that there is a Catholike Church, which is one in yt selfe, whervnto diuers heretiks do feigne, and diuise diuers names, wheras they, (and their sects) are called by peculiar names, which themselues cannot deny, wherby all men that are indifferent, &amp; not letted by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, may vnderstand vnto what Church, the name Catholike, which all parts desire &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is to be giuen.</q>

               <p n="10">10. Thus <hi>S.

And as for knowing and discerning her from all other Churches, that may pretend to be Catholike, we heare his marks, that she is more eminent, vniuersall, greater in number, and in possession of the name Catholike. The second that she may be beleeued securely, and cannot deceaue nor be deceaued in matters of faith, he proueth elswhere, concluding finally

in this place: <hi>Si iam satis tibi iactatus videris, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. This then is the iudgement and direction of <hi>S.

Which rule of direction, yf we will follow about these three articles of faith now proposed, the <hi>reall presence, Transubstantiation,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice of the masse,</hi> yt is easily seene what ground we haue for their beleefe, in this kind of proofe, so highly esteemed by <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> which is the authority of the vniuersall Cath. Church. For that when <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers began to oppose themselues in our dayes, no man can deny, but that our beleefe in these articles was generally receaued ouer all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as well <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where so euer Christians be, as <hi>Europe,</hi> and so vpward tyme

out of mynd; neither can any beginning be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to these doctrines in the Cath. Church, but only a certayne definition and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Councells, about the name of Transubstantiation, as after shalbe declared.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now then, hauinge found out this first <note place="margin">Groundes about the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note> ground which <hi>S.

For that out of the ould Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they shew how yt was prefigured and prophesied, and in the new both promised againe, exhibited, and confirmed, and this not by exposition of their owne heads only, as sectaryes do, but by intendement, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, of the grauest and most ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that haue liued in the Church of God from age to age, who vnderstood so the said figures and foreshewinges of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p n="32">32. The third question proposed to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the foresaid disputations, was about the <hi>sacrifice of the masse,</hi> to witt, whether the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same body of our Lord, whose reall presence is proued in the first question, be not only a Sacrament in the Christian Church, as yt is receaued vnder a signe of bread and wyne by the Priest and communicants, but a sacrifice also, as yt is offered to God the Father by the Priest vpon the Altar; and whether this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and visible sacrifice be appointed by Christ, to be iterated and dayly frequented in the Church vnto the worlds end, and this both for an externall worshipp peculiar to <note place="margin">The state of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> Christians, whereby they are distinguished from all other people, as also for propitiation of sinnes, by applyinge the meritt and vertue of the other bloudy sacrifice of our Sauiour on the Crosse once offered for all, and euer auayleable (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> at large declareth in his epistle to the Hebrewes) for sanctifyinge the redeemed: this then being the question, and this being a doctrine so generally receaued throughout the Christian world, both in the <hi>Greeke, Latin, AEthiopian, Armenian,</hi> and other Christian Churches, as there was no doubt or question therof, when <hi>Luther</hi> and his ofspring

began; yt fell out in England, that vnder the child <hi>King Edward</hi> his raigne, name &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the <hi>L.

At which chaunge and suddayne innouation, neuer seene in England before, from the first day that Christian Religion entred vnder the Apostles, as all the realiues and contreyes round about remayned astonished: so diuers notwithstanding of the lighter sort, enclyned to noueltyes, applauded to them, &amp; followed their diuise; others more prudent and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue to their owne saluation, consideringe that there went more in this matter then the pleasure and fancyes of a few particular men, stood constant in that, which before they had receaued, and that which generally they saw, and knew to be in vse throughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, which could not be by <hi>S.

                  <q>We shall heare or <note place="margin">Aug. ibid.</note> this matter more in the lesson which is to be read vnto vs at masse.</q> These speaches I say, &amp; this practise of so ould learned &amp; holy Priests, as these and their fellowes were, did preuayle more with the grauer sort of English people, then the lightnesse &amp; inconstancy of <hi>Cranmer Ridley,</hi> and such other licentious Priests, as for liberty fell to Apostasie.</p>
               <p n="34">34. And this for the name of the <hi>masse.</hi> But for the nature and substance therof, which conteyneth the externall true and proper sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Christian Church, they found such store of euident proofes, and most graue authorityes, as might stay, confirme and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any mans mynd, that were not willfully bent to the contrary. And wheras I do vse the words of <hi>externall, true and proper</hi> sacrifise, yow must remember therby the fraud of these new heretiks, who, as before about the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, did go about to delude all the sayings of holy Fathers, and other testimonyes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that spake of Christs reall being in the Sacrament, by running to the words <hi>spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sacramentaly, by faith,</hi> and the like: so heere fyndinge the whole torrent and streame of Christian antiquity to stand for this Christian sacrifice, &amp; to mention, reuerence, &amp; auouch the same; these fellowes for auoydinge their authorityes do runne from the proper exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sacrifice, wherof we treate, vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5406:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and inuisible sacrifice of the mynd, wherof <hi>K. Dauid</hi> saith, that a contrite spiritt is a sacrifice to God. And when this cannot serue, they run also to improper and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall externe sacrifices, such as are, <hi>mortification of the body Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>sacrifice of thankesgeuinge. Psalm.</hi> 49. <hi>Sacrifice of almes deedes. Hebr.</hi> 13. and other such good works, which by a certayne analogy or proportion with the nature of proper sacrifices, are called also <hi>sacrifice</hi> in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures &amp; by the Fathers, but improperly. To these then do our Protestants runne, when they are pressed with the authorityes of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, that name the vse of Christian sacrifice in the Church, and will needs make vs beleeue, that the Fathers ment not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any true visible or externall sacrifice, but eyther of inward or inuisible sacrifice of the hart, mynd, and good desire; or els of outward metaphoricall sacrifice of pious and vertuous workes.</p>
               <p n="35">35. But all these are fraudulent shifts to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw one truth by another. For as we do not deny, but that there is an inward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible sacrifice of our mynd, in dedicatinge of our selues to God, and to the subiection of his Maiestie, without which the externall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is little worth to him that offereth the same: And as we graunt that all good works be sacrifices in a certayne sort, by some simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude they haue with true &amp; proper sacrifices, for that they are offered vp to God in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; yet do we say, that this is from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5406:65"/>
in this place, who talke of a true proper externall sacrifice offered vp to God, after a <note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a true externall and visible sacrifice.</note> peculiar sacred rite, or ceremonyes, by pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar men deputed to this office in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of Gods diuine power, maiestie, and dominion ouer vs, &amp; protestation of our due subiection vnto him, such as were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sacrifices in the law of nature, offered vp by patriarks and heads of familyes, and by Priests of Aarons order vnder the law of Moyses, and by Christ and his Priests accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the order of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> in the new law; and for so much as both the internall, &amp; metaphoricall sacrifices before mentioned of good affection, desires, and holy works, are not peculiar to any law, but were lawfull and needfull vnder all lawes, and in all tymes, and require no particular kind of men or ministers to offer them, but may be offered vp by any man or woman whatsoeuer: therfore do we exclude all these from the name of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which heere is meant by our description, and comprehendeth as yow see an externall visible oblation, made by him or them, who are peculiarly deputed by God to this office, which are Priests: So as when soeuer our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaryes do slipp from this proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a sacrifice to the other, eyther internall or metaphoricall, which may be offeted by all sorts of people, and therevpon do say that all men are Priests, they runne, as vow see, quite from the purpose, as they do also for examples sake, when to auoyd the necessity of externall
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5406:66"/>
fastinge, they runne to the internall fastinge <note place="margin">An exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall fraude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge.</note> of the mynd, sayinge that true fastinge, is to fast from sinne, which as we deny not in that sense of spirituall fastinge; so is it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge a plaine shift, and runninge from the purpose, and cannot stand with many places of the scripture, which must needs be vnderstood of the externall fast; as when Christ is said by the Euangelists to haue fasted 40. dayes togeather; and <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmeth that he and his fellow Apostles fasted frequently; It cannot be vnderstood (I say) of fastinge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those tymes from sinne; for that Christ fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted alwayes from sinne without exception; and so do all good men both fast and facrisice also, by offeringe vp good desires and pious actions to almighty God, dayly and hourely without distinction of men or tymes.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But this is not the proper, visible, &amp; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sacrifice which heere we meane, which was instituted by God, as peculiar to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people vnder the law of the ghospell, for an externall worshipp vnto him (besides the internall) and testification of their inward subiection, loue, and piety towards him; which sacrifice comming in place of all others that went before, both in the law of nature and of Moyses that prefigured and foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the same; and being but one and singular <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and externall sacrifice.</note> insteed of them all, and their great variety, is to be esteemed so much more excellent then they all, as the law of the ghospell is more excellent then those lawes, and truth aboue

shaddowes, &amp; the sacred body of Christ God and man himselfe, to be preferred before the bodyes of beasts, byrds and other such crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vvhich vvere but signes and figures of this.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And in this sense do both scriptures, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, councells, and all holy Christian anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity speake and treat of this most diuine, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and dreadfull sacrifice, wherof, as of the highest and most principall mystery and treasure, left by our Sauiour in his Church, there are so many testimonyes, as before hath byn signifyed, that yt shall not be possible for me in this place, and with the breuity which is necessary, to alleage the least part therof; yet some few generall heads shall I touch, which the learned reader may see more dilated, by diuers Catholike wryters of our dayes, and he that hath not commodity or tyme to do that, may geue a ghesse by that which heere I shall sett downe.</p>
               <p n="38">38. First then, for that this holy sacrifice of the Christian Church was so principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by almighty God for the new law, as hath byn said, many things were sett downe by the holy Ghost in the old Testament, both prefiguringe and prophecyinge the same, as first the sacrifice of the King and Priest <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedech</hi> in bread and wyne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. which all the auncient Fathers, by generall consent, do apply to the sacrifice vsed now in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, and yt were ouerlong to alleage their particular authorityes, lett. <hi>S.

               <p n="39">39. After these prefigurations there follow the predictions of Prophetts as that of <hi>Esay</hi> 19. and 66. where is forteold the reiection of the Aaronicall priesthood and sacrifice, and a new promised vnder the Christians. The prophesy of <hi>Daniell</hi> also, where it is foretould, that in the last age of the law of grace, by the comminge of Antichrist, <hi>iuge sacrificium,</hi> that is the dayly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</note> sacrifice shall cease. Of this (I say) is inferred by the ancient Fathers, that vntill Antichrists comminge there shalbe a perpetuall and dayly sacrifice amonge Christians; which is most of all confirmed by the prophesie of <hi>Malachias</hi> in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.</note>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:5406:67"/>
these words: <hi>Ad vos ò sacerdotes, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>To yow ò priests, that despise my name, and do offer vpon my Altar polluted bread, and do sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the beasts that are blind, lame and weake, I haue no more likinge of yow, saith the lord of hosts, and I will not receaue at your hands any gifts, for that from the east to the west my name is great amonge the gentills, and they do sacrifice vnto me in euery place, and do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto my name a pure oblation, for that my name is great amonge the gentills, saith the lord of hostes.</q> Out of which place the Fathers do shew first, that heere the priesthood and sacrifice of Aaron was to be reiected, &amp; a new priesthood and sacrifice, accordinge to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> erected amongst the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills, wherby ordinarily are vnderstood the Christian people conuerted chiefly (from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility) who were to succeed in their place, and that with such certainty, as the present tense <note place="margin">The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of Malachie.</note> is put for the future, accordinge to the manner of prophesies; and the Antithesis or opposition betweene the two sacrifices, the one reiected, the other promised, doth make the matter more plaine; for that as the Iewes sacrifice could not be offered but in one place, to witt, in the Temple of Hierusalem: so shall the Christian sacrifice be offered vp <hi>in omni loco,</hi> that is euery where without respect of places from the east to the west. The Iewish sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were many and of diuers sorts, but the Christian sacrifice that should succeed in place therof was to be but one. The Iewish sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5406:68"/>
were polluted, not so much in respect of great quantity of beasts bloud powred out therin, and for that they offered defectuous beasts, as for the wickednesse of them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the same; but the Christian sacrifice was to be cleane &amp; vnspotted, not only in respect of the vnbloudy manner, wherin yt was to be offered vnder the formes of bread and wyne, but especially for the excellency of the thinge yt selfe offered, being the most pretious body of Christ himselfe, and for that the demeritt of the offerer cannot take away the worth of the offeringe.</p>
               <p n="40">40. These circumstances then considered, and that the heretikes heere cannot runne to their shift of inward, and inuisible sacrifices, (for that these could not be vnderstood by the Prophett as new sacrifices, that should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the ould, for that these were alwayes in vse with good men, duringe the tyme of the old sacrifice also, and were lawfull, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <note place="margin">Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that proue the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the masse to haue byn fore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied.</note> in all tymes, to witt, to haue inward piety and deuotion, giue almes, and the like) these things I say considered, togeather with the expositions of holy Fathers, as well vpon these as vpon other places of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there can be no probable doubt, but that this externall sacrifice of the Christian was prophesyed by the holy Ghost longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comminge of Christ.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Secondly, the same is proued out of di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers places of the new Testament: And first out of S. Iohns ghospell, where as our Sauiour
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5406:68"/>
promised in mysterious words the institution of this blessed sacrifice, as before hath byn seene; so also did he signifie that this sacrifice should succeed in steed of all sacrifices that went before. For wheras the <hi>Samaritan</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">

And therfore as Christs one sacrifice then to come, was no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, why their dayly sacrifices, which tooke their valour from this one of Christ, should not be dayly offered amonge them: so the same sacrifice of Christ vpon the Crosse, being now past, should not take away our dayly sacrifices offered in remembrance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and for the applying of the infinite valour of that one sacrifice vnto vs, from which this other dayly sacrifice taketh his sufficiency.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5406:77"/>
wherby great light will grow to the reader, for discouering whatsoeuer shall after be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about this matter. But yet before I enter <note place="margin">Tvvo things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be noted.</note> into the obseruations themselues, I would haue the reader consider two things; first the inequality betweene our aduersaryes and vs in this case, for that their arguments against these mysteryes, being founded almost all in the appearance of comon sense (as hath byn said) the vnlearned reader is capable of the obiection, but not of the solution, which must be taken from matters aboue sense, as presently yow shall see.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second point is, that yf any of the old heretiks, or heathen philosophers should rise againe at this day, and bringe forth their arguments of sense &amp; humaine reason against such articles of our faith, as in ould tyme they did impugne, for both improbable and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in nature; as namely the creation of the world out of nothinge; three distinct persons of the blessed Trinity in one, &amp; the selfe same substance; two distinct natures in one person conioyned by the incarnation of Christ; the resurrection of our putrifyed bodyes, the selfe same substance, qualityes, quantityes, &amp; other accidents, &amp; such like points: Against which, I say, yf ould philosophers, &amp; heretiks should come forth againe in our dayes, and propose such arguments as in their dayes they did, which seeme inuincible and vnanswerable to common sense and humaine reason; do yow not thinke that they should haue infinite

people both men and weomen to follow them, especially yf they were countenanced out with the authority of a potent Prince and Kingdome, and suffered to speake their will, as our men were, that first impugned the <hi>reall presence,</hi> and sacrifice in England; and yet as the auncient Fathers in their tymes, did not abandone these articles of faith for those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes, or appearance of impossibilityes; no nor the common Cacholike people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that could not reach to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge therof; so must not we do now, though we could not aunswere in reason the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes arguments, which yet by the ensuinge obseruations, yow will easily be able to do, And this for an entrance; now to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations themselues.</p>

And after the same manner, is an Angell also in a place defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiuely, and not circumscriptiuely, that is to say wholy in the whole place, which he occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth, &amp; wholy in euery part therof, without multiplication or diuision in himselfe, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension

vnto the parts of the place wherin yt is. But for that the example of the soule, is more familiar and euident to our sense and reason, it doth better expresse the matter. And yt is to be noted, that yt doth somewhat imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the being of God himselfe wholy, and without diuision in all parts of the world, and in all creatures therof without limitation, change, or multiplication, but only yt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this, that the soule, or an Angell, being both creatures, cannot be euery where, as the creatour naturally is, and he cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; but yet by his diuine power, the said creatures may be in diuers places at once, as after shalbe shewed.</p>
               <p n="17">17. These two wayes then of being in a place, as I haue said, are naturall; the first cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscriptiuely, the second definitiuely. But besides these two, there is a third supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and possible to Gods diuine omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and not repugnant to reason yt selfe, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shalbe shewed; which is, that one and the selfe-same thing, may by Gods diuine power, be placed in two different places at once, that is to say, that the selfe-same soule, as yt is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, wholy, and entyrely in the head, for example, and in the foote; so yt repugneth not to the same nature or essence of the soule, to be putt in two different bodyes at once. The like of an Angell in diuers places, and the same also may be held of a naturall body, ys God will haue yt so, as in the next obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shalbe proued. And this way or manner
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5406:85"/>
of being in place, for that the Cath. Church doth hould yt to be in the body of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Sacrament, is called by diuines a sacramentall being in place, nor for that the true body is not really there, as some hearinge the word <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> vsed sometymes by the Fathers and Doctors, do fondly apprehend, but for that it is there after this speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as we haue declared, that is to say, so as yt is also in other places at the same tyme.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Now then, these three wayes or manners of being in place declared, yt remayneth, that we shew how yt is possible to Gods power, and not repugnant to naturall reason, that a true body, which of his owne nature is in <note place="margin">Hovv a body may be defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely in place.</note> place, only after the first manner of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription and commensuration, or extension, may, by Gods power, be in place also after the second and third way, that is difinitiuely and Sacramentally, without the first way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration and extension to a place. And first heere we shall shew the said possibility in the second way, and then of the third in the ensuinge obseruation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The only cheefe ground, or reason obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the heretiks, why it may seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne or imply contradiction, that a true or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall body togeather with his quantity, such as Christs is in the Sacrament, should be definitiuely without extension in place, is, for that yt appeareth contrary to the nature of quantity to be without such extension; but this ground Cath. Philosophers and diuines
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5406:86"/>
do easily ouerthrow, shewinge that three things do agree to quantity or magnitude, wherof the first is to be extended in yt selfe, and to haue distinct partes one from the other among themselues, though not euer visible, or perceptible by our sense; and this first point is so essentiall to quantity and magnitude, as yt cannot be imagined separable, so as it remaine quantity. And therfore this is graunted to be in the body of our Sauiour in the Sacrament, though our sense doth not comprehend yt. The second property of quantity or magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, proceedinge from this first, is; not only to haue partes distinct in themselues, but to haue them extended also in place, accordinge to the commensuration therof, as in the first way of being in place we haue declared.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And for that this second condition, or propriety, is later then the former, &amp; ensueth therof, yt is not so intrinsecall to the nature &amp; essence of quantity, but that by Gods diuine power yt may be separated, without destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the said nature, which our diuines do shew by examples of other thinges, where God hath separated such secondary proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, without dissoluinge the natures, as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, for example, from fyre in the fornace of Babylon, which heatinge notwithstandinge is as naturall to fyre, as yt is to quantity to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy place. Christ also in <hi>S. Mathewes</hi> ghospell, hauinge said to his disciples, <q>that yt was easier <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 19.</note> for a Camell to passe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich-man to enter into the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5406:86"/>
Kingedome of heauen,</q> and the Apostles wondringe therat, and sayinge: <hi>vvho then can be saued?</hi> our Sauiour answered, that, <hi>that vvhich vvas impossible to men, vvas possible to God,</hi> which yet could not be possible, but by separatinge from the camell all his naturall extension, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration of place. Wherfore all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers vpon this place attributing this to myracle, do affirme, that by Gods diuine power yt may be done, to witt, that a camell remayninge in the nature of a camell, may passe through a needles eye: <hi>quid prohibet</hi> (saith S. Gregory Nazianzen) <hi>quo minus hoc siat, si vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas it a tulerit?</hi> What letteth but that this (of <note place="margin">

                  </note> the camell) may be done, yf Gods will be to haue yt so? Some Protestant will stepp forth, and say that yt cannot be done, for that the Camell should not in that case haue quantity and be organicall (for so they say of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours body in the Sacrament), but <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was of another opinion: And so may yow read <hi>Origen, S. Hierome, S. Augustine, S. Hilary,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Luc.</hi> 18. <hi>Marc.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> and other Fathers in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaryes, and expositions vpon this place of <hi>S. Mathewes</hi> ghospell.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The third naturall condition or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of quantity (proceedinge of this second) is, that for so much as by the forsaid second pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priety, <note place="margin">The third condition or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of quantity.</note> the thinge placed doth fill vp the place which yt occupyeth, euery part therof answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe to euery part of the said place only, and one place conteyne one body; so as naturally yt is no lesse impossible for two bodyes to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:5406:87"/>
in one place, then for one body to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Yet notwithstanding supernaturally, and by Gods omnipotent power, both the one &amp; the other may be without implication, or contradiction of the essence, or nature of a true body. The reason wherof is this: for that this third propriety in quantity or magnitude, flowinge of the second, as hath byn said, may much more easily be separated from the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the said quantity and body, then the second, and consequently the former being separable, this is much more, wherof our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines do giue diuers most euident instances, out of scripture yt selfe. As for example out of S. Iohns Ghospell, where twise yt is said, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> he came in to his disciples, when the gates were shutt. And in <hi>S. Mathew,</hi> and <hi>S. Marke,</hi>

               <p n="22">22. Besides this our diuines do alleage the examples of the damned spirits, miraculously

               <p n="26">26. But our diuines do go yet further, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that this is not impossible, euen in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yt selfe, for God to performe, as yow may perceaue by that we haue declared in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obseruation: For yf yt were repugnant and contradictory to the nature of a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to be in diuers places at once, this must be eyther in respect of the vnity therof, for that <note place="margin">Tvvo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultyes solued.</note> yt should therby be diuided from yt selfe, or multiplyed in yt selfe, and so not be one but many bodyes; or els secondly yt should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be in diuers places, in respect of the quantity, which a true body hath, wherby yt should be limyted to some certayne space or place; but neyther of these two difficultyes do impossibilitate the matter, as now we shall declare.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Not the first about vnity, for that God <note place="margin">The first difficulty about vnity.</note> being a substance indiuisible, is euery where wholy, and in euery one of his creatures, and yet remayneth one still, nor can be diuided or multiplyed: which is so wonderfull a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as <hi>S.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:5406:89"/>
within any compasse or circuite, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in a house or Church, yt is wholy in all that space, and wholy in euery part therof, &amp; yet remayneth one and simple without diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in himselfe: which example is more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent also in our soule; as before we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, for that the selfe-same soule in a body, when yt is an infant, and when yt is at his full grouth, is wholy in the whole body, &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in euery part therof, and yet is yt not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed therby, nor diuided. Whereby is made manifest, that yt repugneth not to the essence or vnity of any one substance, to be in diuers places at once, and this naturally, but much more supernaturallye, by the omnipotent power of God.</p>
               <p n="28">28. There remayneth then the second diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d difficulty about quantity.</note> about quantity, or a body indued with quantity, how yt is not letted therby to be in two places at once, wherof we haue treated in the former obseruation, shewinge how actuall locality by circumscription, being but a secondary propriety, following and flowing from the nature of quantity, may, by Gods power, be separated from the same, so as the said quantity may remayne with her true es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, of hauinge distinct parts in yt selfe, and yet no extensiue location, or commensuration of place, in which case yt repugneth no more for the selfe-same quantity to be in many places at once, then yt doth vnto a spirituall substance without quantity, such as is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, or the soule of man, and consequently
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:5406:90"/>
the substance of Christs body, togeather with the quantity in this manner, may by Gods power be put in many places at once, as we see by course of nature it selfe, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of mans soule without quantity, is put in many particular places of a mans body, without diuision or multiplication, remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge still but one only soule, as hath byn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And this shall suffice for explication of this possibility, how yt doth not imply contradiction, and therefore is not impossible to God.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Neyther do our diuines shew only, that <note place="margin">Diuers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are more hard then this.</note> this is not impossible in our Sauiours body, but further also, that we do beleeue diuers other mysteryes of our faith as hard or harder then this, yea much more impossible to sense and reason, yf we consider well the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes therof, as the creation of the world of nothinge, the mystery of the blessed Trinity, the beleefe of Christs incarnation, our resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the like, for yt is much harder by humayne reason and naturall philosophy, to conceaue how the world could be created of nothinge, and how one and the selfe-same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can be wholy in three reall distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, without diuision or multiplication in yt selfe, and how one person can be in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers distinct natures, as yt is in our Sauiour, and how one, and the selfe-same thing being perished and corrupted, may be raised againe with the selfe-same accidents that perished before. These points I say, and diuers others
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:5406:90"/>
which both we and Protestants do confesse to be true, are more harde, and impossible in naturall reason, then yt is to be beleeue that one body is in diuers places at once.</p>

               <p n="32">32. By this also which is said may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, how the sacred body of our Sauiour, in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder the accidents of bread, is sometymes in a greater visible quantity, and sometymes in a lesse, accordinge to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall formes and accidents vnder which yt is, yea and in the least part &amp; parcell of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated host, that is perceptible to our sense, for that the said body being remoued by Gods omnipotent power from all locall extension, it may be vnder a greater or smaller externall quantity, without alteration of the body yt selfe, as we see in the soule of man, which is the selfe-same in the least part of the body wherin it is, as in the greatest, or in the whole body, yea when the said body is changed, or groweth from a lesser to a greater quantity, as in an infant, who after commeth to be a great man, the selfe-same soule replenisheth the one and the other without grouth or diminution in yt selfe, and so the body of Christ in a great host or a little, or in any least part therof, when yt is broken, is wholy, and the selfe-same body, with the selfe-same internall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall quantity, which yt had vnder a great host. And this point that the quantity of a

substance may be increased or diminished ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, in respect of place, without alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">Note this example.</note> of the inward quantity, or substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is euident by many examples, which we see dayly of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction and condensation. As for example when a gallon of water is put in a great vessell ouer the fire, yt cometh by boylinge to fill the whole vessell, that is capable of many gallons, and yet as the inward substance is not increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so neyther the quantity in yt selfe; and contrary wise, when the said water is againe cooled, it returneth to occupy as small a place, as yt did at the beginninge, and yet retayneth allwayes the selfe same both quantity and substance.</p>
               <p n="33">33. By which example, &amp; many other that may be alleaged, some kind of notice may be gathered vnto our common sense and reason, how the substance of Christs body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, togeather with his internall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, may by his omnipotent power, be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes vnder a great externall quantity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension in place, &amp; sometymes vnder a lesser; yea the least, that by our senses may be percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and yet is Christs body wholy and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely there, accordinge (in some proportion) to the lookinge-glasse before mentioned, which being broken into diuers small peeces, each one representeth the whole visage seuerally, which before was exhibited by the whole: And so, when any consecrated host is broken into many parts, that which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the whole host, is now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:5406:92"/>
vnder euery particular parcell therof, as yt was also before. And to this effect, are those words of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> before alleaged, against them that said: <hi>Videmus quod est aequale, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="35">35. And the reason of this, concerninge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, is, that albeit the intrinsecall nature of an accident is to be vnperfect, and to depend of another, and therby to haue an aptitude to be in another, yet the act therof may be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by Gods power, from the said nature, as a thinge posterior, and followinge from the said nature, as we haue she wed before in the naturall propriety of quantity, to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration of place; and this to be, true that

               <p n="36">36. This then being so, that these accidents of bread &amp; wyne may remaine, by the power of God, in the Sacrament, without their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subiects, yt followeth to consider, what actions they can haue: And first yt is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Of the actiuity of accidents being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from their substance.</note> that whatsoeuer actions, or operations are proper to them, as accidents, when they were in their proper subiects of bread and wyne, before consecration, the same they may haue afterwards, when they conteyne the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Christ, without inherence therein, for that God supplyeth all by his power, which their said subiects or substances
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:5406:94"/>
did performe, when they were present. So as the effects, for example, that the accidents of wine &amp; bread did worke in our senses before, by mouinge our sight by their colours to see, our tast by their sauour, and other like effects: the same do they performe also afterwards: So as, for example sake, by drinkinge much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated wyne, though there be no substance of wyne therin, but only the proper accidents of wyne, as heat, smell, and other qualityes and proprietyes of wyne; may a man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, or distempered, as much as yf the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of wyne were there in deed, for these are the proper actions and operations of the said accidents themselues; but where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of substance is necessary to any action, as in nutrition, generation, or corruption of one substance into another, there doth God supply the matter, that is necessary to that action, when the body of Christ doth cease to be there, which is, when those accidents of bread and wyne are corrupted and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: As for example, in the resurrection of our bodyes, where euery body is to receaue his owne proper flesh againe, which yt had in this life, yf some one body hauinge eaten ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, or parcell therof in this world, and conuerted the same into his proper substance; in this case (I say) almighty God must needs supply otherwise, by his omnipotent power, that part and matter of substance, that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in one of these two bodyes, for that els one of them should be vnperfect, and want
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:5406:94"/>
part of his substance in the resurrection. And after the like manner we say, that when a consecrated hoast is eaten, and afterward is turned into the naturall norishment of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which norishment requireth a materiall substance, God doth supply that substance in that instant, when the formes of bread and wyne perishinge, the body of Christ ceaseth to be there.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And this appertayneth to the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of almighty God, for supplying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of particular naturall causes, when any thinge fayleth, that is necessary for their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall operations. The very same also is to be obserued in generation, and corruption, as for example, when the accidents of the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted host perishinge, and some other substance should happen to be engendred thereof, as wormes, or the like, there the body of Christ ceaseth to be, when the said accidents do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and for the new generation insuinge thereof, God supplyeth fitt matter, as in the example before alleaged of the resurrection of our bodyes, wherof the one had eaten part of the other. By which obseruation yt wilbe easy afterward to dissolue many cauillations, proceedinge eyther of ignorance, heresie, or both, and obiected by Sacramentaryes against this mystery.</p>

               <p n="38">38. For so much as the Sacramentaryes of our tyme, did forsee that they should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to oppose themselues, for defending their hereticall noueltye, sagainst the whole streame of scriptures, expositors, fathers, councells, reasons, practise, antiquity, and vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the vnhole Christian vvorld, they thought best to diuise certayne tearmes and distinctions, which should serue them for eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or gappes to runne out at, when-soeuer they should be pressed by our arguments: and these their shifts do consist principally, in the fraudulent vse of these tearmes of <hi>Sacrament, signe, figure, type, commemoration, memory, sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, spiritually</hi> and the like. Wherfore we thinke yt needfull to explane and declare in this place, the natures, vses and abuses of these words.</p>
               <p n="39">39. First then a Sacrament, according to the common definition asscribed to <hi>S. Augustine, is a visible signe of an inuisible grace,</hi> as in baptisme, <note place="margin">The vvord Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> the externall washinge by water, is the signe of the internall washing of the soule by grace: So heere also in this Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, the externall &amp; visible signe are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated formes of bread and wyne, as they conteyne the body of Christ; the internall or
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:5406:95"/>
inuisible grace signified, is the inward nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishinge and seedinge of our soule: And this is the first and cheefe manner how this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>a signe,</hi> that is to say <hi>a signe of grace,</hi> and not of Christs body absent, as Protestants are wont most fondly and fraudulently to inferre.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Secondly these externall formes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bread and wyne, are also a signe of Christs body conteyned vnder them. And in this sense is the Eucharist called sometymes by the Fathers, the signe of Christs body, but of Christs body present, as hath byn said, and not absent. Thirdly this Sacrament is a signe of Christ his death and passion, and of the vnion of his mysticall body the Church with him: For that as bread and wyne represented by these formes, are made of many grains and many grapes; so is Christs mysticall body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistinge of many members vnited to him; so as by all these wayes may this Sacrament be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a signe,</hi> to witt, a signe of the inward grace, and norishment of the soule obtayned therby, a signe of Christs true body present, a signe of Christ his death, and mysticall body, and yet do none of all these figures exclude the true reall being of his body in the Sacrament, but do rather suppose the same.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And the like may be said to the other words, or tearmes of <hi>figure, type, commemoration,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The other vvords of tipe figure &amp;c. expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> or <hi>memory,</hi> all which, when they occurre, are to be vnderstood in some of these senses, without preiudice of the reality, or truth of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours being in this Sacrament, as for example,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:5406:96"/>
this Sacrament is <hi>a forme, type, commemoration</hi> &amp; memory of Christs death on the Crosse, and yet this excludeth not his <hi>reall-presence</hi> from hence. As for example, if a Prince hauing gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in proper person a great &amp; singular victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, should institute a sollemne triumph, to be made euery yeare in memory therof, &amp; some times should go in that triumph himselfe also, yt might be truly said, that this triumph is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <note place="margin">Note this example.</note> type, commemoration, and memory of the other victory, &amp; of the Prince, yet is the Prince truly also in yt himselfe, and so may be said in like manner of this matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, wherin Christ in differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t manner, is a figure or type of himselfe. And the like may be said of the dayly sacrifice also, which sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is a commemoration or memory of the other bloudy sacrifice, once offered on the crosse, and yet conteyneth the same reall body of our Sauiour, which the other did, after another manner. And by this will the reader easily discouer diuers poore shifts &amp; fallacyes of our moderne heretiks, especially of <hi>Ridley</hi> before named, who as yow haue heard him professe, was moued to leaue his ancient faith of the masse, &amp; his practice therin, for that in some certaine places (for sooth) of the Fathers, he found <hi>that this sacrifice</hi> (of the masse) <hi>is called a commemoration of Christs passion;</hi> a stronge argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no doubt, to moue him to so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. And so much of this.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Now then are to be examined the other words, <hi>sacramentally, really,</hi> and <hi>spiritually:</hi> and as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:5406:96"/>
for the first, the common sense, and meaninge <note place="margin">Tvvo si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the vvord <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally</hi> and both against the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryes.</note> of schoole diuines is, that diuised this word, to signifie therby a peculiar manner of Christs supernaturall being in the Sacrament, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from his naturall and circumscriptiue being in heauen, and from the naturall being of an Angell definitiuely in a place, wherof we haue spoken before. So as, when they say that Christ is sacramentally vnder the formes <note place="margin">1.</note> of bread and wyne, they do not deny his true and reall being there in flesh, the very selfe-same that is in heauen; but he is there in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner. And this is the chiefe proper si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification of the word <hi>sacramentally</hi> amongest schoole-men, for which the word was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
               <p n="43">43. But in the common vse, and sense of our speach, <hi>sacramentally</hi> signifieth, that Christs <note place="margin">2.</note> body is there vnder a Sacrament or signe, which are the formes of bread and wyne, and not in his owne proper shape, euen as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, when he appeareth in a body, he may be said to appeare bodyly, for that the body is the figure or forme, vnder which he appeareth; and conforme to this sense, we are said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue Christ <hi>sacramentally,</hi> when we receaue him truly and really, but yet not in his proper forme, but vnder another forme, that is to say of bread and wyne, wherby the fraudulent dealing of our moderne Sacramentaryes may appeare, who deceauing the people with this word <hi>sacramentally,</hi> do oppose yt to <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> as though when any author saith, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:5406:97"/>
we receaue Christ sacramentally in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, yt were to be vnderstood, that we did not receaue Christs body in deed and really, but only a signe therof, and by this they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to delude all the places, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so euident, of holy Fathers affirminge, that Christs true flesh and body, the very same that was borne of the virgin Mary and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for vs, is receaued in the Sacrament, these good fellowes aunswere that yt is true, <hi>sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,</hi> which we also graunt, yf <hi>sacramentally,</hi> do not exclude really, accordinge to the true signification of the word: But yf by sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, they meane as they do, that only a signe is receaued of Christs body in the Sacrament, then is their deceyt manifest as yow see; for that sacramentally, hath no such signification at all amonge diuines, but only is diuised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them for a shift.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The like fraud they vse about the word <note place="margin">VVhat the vvord spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</note> 
                  <hi>spiritually,</hi> which in the sense of holy Fathers, being opposite to carnally and corporally, in their ordinary materiall signification, is by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaryes also wrested, as though yt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word <hi>really,</hi> so as whensoeuer they are forced to graunt Christs body to be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in the Sacrament (by which phrase the said ancient Fathers do meane only, that he is not there after a carnall, or common manner, as he liued vpon earth) they will haue yt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that he is there only by faith, and not in deed really and substantially. They abuse also the signification of the foresaid wordes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:5406:97"/>
carnally &amp; corporally, which hauing a double sense, the one that Christs body is naturally and really in the Sacrament, the other that he is there after the externall being of other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, they deceytfully do take them now in one sense, and now in another, and alwayes oppose them to the word <hi>spiritually,</hi> which in the former sense are not incompatible, but may stand togeather, though not in the later. And for auoydinge of this equiuocation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines do wish those two words, carnally and corporally, though true in the foresaid sense, yet to be more sparingly vsed, then the other words really and substantially, that are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent in sense, and lesse subiect to equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mistaking.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Wherfore to conclude this obseruation, all these words are to be noted, and their true vse and signification remembred by him, that will not be deluded by hereticall sleights and impostures in this high mystery, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to be obserued these three, wherby our Sacramentaryes do most of all deceyue the vulgar people, in their assertions and answers to our arguments, to witt, <hi>sacramentally, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> and <hi>by faith,</hi> as though they did exclude the reall presence of Christs body in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; which is most false, for that in the true sense we admitt them all. For example, we graunt that Christ is sacramentally in this Sacrament, both as sacramentally signifieth a distinct manner of Christs being there, from that in heauen, and as yt signifieth his being
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:5406:98"/>
there vnder a Sacrament or signe, but yet really, we graunt also that he is there spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that is to say, after a spirituall, and not corporall circumscriptiue manner, yet truly and really. We graunt further, that he is in the Sacrament by faith, for that we do not see him, but apprehend him present by faith, but yet truly and really, and not in faith and beleefe only. And by this yow may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue our Sacramentaryes manner of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, <note place="margin">Our here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks cauill like to that of the Arrians.</note> iust like the Arrians of old tyme, and of our dayes, who seeke to enacuate all places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged for the vnity and equality of Christ with his Father, by one only distinction of will and nature: So as when Christ said for example <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6. <hi>my Father and I are one,</hi> yt is true said they, they are one in will &amp; loue, but not in nature; &amp; thus they deluded all that could be brought for naturall vnity, except only the authority, and contrary beleefe of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church, wherby at last they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And the very same course held the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaryes of our dayes; for whatsoeuer plaine and perspicuous places you bring them out of antiquity, affirminge the true naturall substantiall body of our Sauiour, to be in the Sacrament, they will shift of all presently, by one of these three words; yt is true, <hi>sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally,</hi> yt is true <hi>spiritually,</hi> and yt is true <hi>by faith only,</hi> as though these could not stand with <hi>really</hi> or <hi>truly;</hi> and heere of shall yow haue store of examples afterward in the aunswerings of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:5406:98"/>
                  <hi>Doctor Perne, Cranmer, Ridley</hi> and <hi>Latymer</hi> for the Sacramentary party to our arguments, taken out of the ancient Fathers. For when the said Fathers do auouch, that Christ our Sauiours true naturall body is in the Sacrament, they answere, <hi>yt is true sacramentally,</hi> and thinke they haue defended themselues manfully therby, and when in other places the same Fathers do professe, that the very same flesh that was borne of the virgin Mary and cruicified for vs, is there, they aunswere, <hi>yt is true spiritually</hi> and by faith, but not really. And thus they do euacuate and delude all that can be alleaged: But yf they cannot shew (as they cannot) any one Father that tooke or vsed the words <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, spiritually,</hi> or <hi>by faith,</hi> in this sense, as opposite to <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> in this mystery, then is it euident, this to be but a shift of their owne inuention, to escape therby. And so much of this obseruation.</p>

               <p n="48">48.

               <p n="49">49.

               <p n="53">53. Wherfore to conclude this obseruation, two points are to be noted in this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: First that many things that seeme to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Christ in these cases, do not touch him indeed, but only the externall formes of bread and wyne, as when they are burned for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, do putrifie, or the like, Christs body is not burned, or putrified, but ceaseth to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, when the said formes or accidents are corrupted, for that the substance of Christs body, supplyinge the substance of bread, is no longer there then the substance of bread would haue byn there, yf yt had not ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into Christs body, but yf bread had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned, yt would haue ceased by any kind of corruption, as burninge, putrifyinge, or the like, and so doth Christs body, though in a different sort, so that the substance of bread might, by the said corruption, be chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some other substance, which Christs body cannot be, but only ceasseth to be there, God
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:5406:102"/>
supplyinge some other matter for production of that, which is brought forth of new, as in the former obseruation hath byn declared.</p>
               <p n="54">54. The other point, that those other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which by reason of the formes are asscribed vnto Christ his body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to moue from place to place, when the formes are moued, to be seene, touched, eaten with our teeth and the like, which are frequent phrases among the Fathers, haue no <note place="margin">Notethese tvvo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> inconuenience amonge them at all, no more for example, then when our soule is said to be moued with the motion of the body, which soule notwithstandinge of his owne nature is not moueable: so as an Angell being a spiritt, may be handled, seene, or stroken in the body which he taketh to appeare in, as is euident by the whole story of <hi>Tobias</hi> and other places of scripture, which Angell of himselfe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge, is not capable of such thinges; and finally Gods eternall diuinity and maiesty is present in all places &amp; things, the most basest and horrible that can be diuised, and yet suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no inconuenience therby: For though he be for example in the dunghill, yet he cannot be said to haue any euill smell therby, neyther to be burned in the fire, though the formes of bread and wyne be burned therin, nor to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, though he be actually present in those things that rott and putrifie.

               <p n="55">55. The eleuenth and last obseruation shalbe peculiarly about the last of the three questions proposed, which is sacrifice of the masse, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge therin two ends, offices, or effects to be considered: First that yt is ordayned <hi>ad cultum externum,</hi> to an externall worshipp of God pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himselfe, in the highest degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, called by the Gretians <hi>Latria:</hi> secondly <hi>ad propitiationem pro peccatis,</hi> for pacifyinge of Gods wrath for sinnes, and albeit both these effects may be in one and the selfe-same sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (and so we hould them to be in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the masse, for that yt was ordayned by Christ, as well for a perpetuall outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; worshipp to be exhibited vnto God in the Christian Church vnto the worlds end, as also for remission of sinnes by application of the meritt of Christs bloudy sacrifice on the Crosse) yet may they be separated of their owne natures, so as a sacrifice may be orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only <hi>ad cultum,</hi> that is to say, for an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worshipp only, without power to remitt sinnes: And so in a manner were the sacrifices of the ould law, which little or nothing auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for sinnes. And againe, sacrifice may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined only or principally to satisfy for sinnes,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:5406:103"/>
without relation therof <hi>ad cultum,</hi> to perseuere in any state of men, to be often offered by them, and such was Christs on the Crosse, which is not reiterated againe in the same bloudy and passible manner, as then yt was, but in another farre different sort in the masse, which is capable of both these effects, as hath byn said.</p>
               <p n="56">56, Now then in the first sense, as a sacrifice is ordayned <hi>ad cultum,</hi> to an externall worship <note place="margin">The first effect of sacrifice.</note> of God, yt conteyneth an outward protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our knowledge of Gods supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, power, and absolute dominion ouer vs, and in our subiection thervnto, which is the highest honour that can be giuen by a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto the creator, and is so particular to God alone, as hath byn said, as yt cannot be imparted to any creature, without the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sinne of Idolatry, and is so conioyned with the nature of Religion yt selfe, as no true Religion hath euer byn without this degree of externall honour, exhibited vnto God by his people; and so we see that all good men in the law of nature, by Gods instinct, did sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto him, as <hi>Adam, Abell, Noe, Melchisedecke,</hi> and others, as afterwards also in the law of Moyses, the same was expressely ordayned by Gods owne commandement; &amp; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills did the same, though not to one true God, but to many idolls, by suggestion of the diuell, that therin emulated Gods honour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited vnto him by sacrifice.

The second degree is quite opposite to this for excellency of perfection, power and meritt, being in yt selfe of so infinite valour, as yt is sufficient not only fully to satisfie for the sinnes of all the world; but also to giue vigour to all other sacrifices, both internall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall; And this was the sacrifice of Christ our Sauiour on the Crosse; &amp; betweene these two sacrifices, to witt the weaknesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, multitude and variety of the one vnder the old law, and the singularity, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, force and infinite power of the other, is the large <hi>antithesis</hi> &amp; opposition, vsed by <hi>S. Paul</hi> in his 9. and 10. Chapters of his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> shewing, that as the Iewes sacrifices were many in number, and of diuers sorts and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:5406:104"/>
infirme of themselues, &amp; therfore offered vp in great multitudes and often; so the sacrifice of Christ for the excellency therof, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite force and valour, was single, &amp; but one, and once offered for all, and not iterable for acquiringe the price of mans redemption, and perfect sufficiency for the sanctifyinge of all, though yet he affirmeth not, that yt may not be iterated in another manner, &amp; to another effect, to witt for applyinge the sufficiency &amp; meritt of this one sacrifice offered for all, to the vtility of particular people: For albeit Christ hath satisfied for all <hi>quoad sufficientiam</hi> (to vse the termes of schoole) yet not <hi>quoad effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciam,</hi> which is as much to say, as albeit Christ hath redeemed all and paid the price for all, yet all are not saued therby, nor do receaue the efficacy or benefitt therof, for that they apply not to their owne vtility that which is gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for all.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Now then for applyinge this treasure vnto people in particular, our aduersaryes do confesse, that some things are necessary of our parts, as faith &amp; baptisme, but we do ad more meanes, as ordayned by Christ himselfe, and amonge other the sacrifice of the masse, not for acquiringe any new price or sufficiency of our saluation, but for applyinge the effect or efficacy of that, which already is gotten by Christ our Sauiour, through his passion on the Crosse, &amp; heerof resulteth a third degree of propitiatory sacrifice, that is neyther so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme as the sacrifices of the ould law were,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:5406:104"/>
that remytted not sinnes, nor yet in a manner of so potent effect, as to acquire the price of our saluation, for that yt is not offered vp to that end, but only to apply the vertue of the other sacrifice already gotten, and so may be iterated, not for any defect in it selfe, but for that sinnes dayly growinge haue need of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly application of the said sacrifice, as hath byn said.</p>
               <p n="60">60. And in this sense do all the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in the places before alleaged, call this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the masse <hi>iuge sacrificium,</hi> a dayly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and iterable, notwithstandinge that the other on the Crosse could be offered but once, as <hi>S.

8. To the first we say, concerning the minor <note place="margin">To the first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> proposition, that a true naturall body, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and by ordinary course of nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at one tyme, but in one place, and that meaneth <hi>S. Augustine ad Dardanum,</hi> but super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally, and by Gods ommpotent power, that exceedeth nature, yt repugneth not to be in diuers places at once, yf God will haue yt so: as in our fifth obseruation is proued. To <note place="margin">To the second.</note> the second argument we say, that euery true naturall body requireth one certaine place by ordinary course of nature, and not otherwise. To the third, that soules and spiritts by their <note place="margin">To the third.</note> naturall course haue but one totall place, wherin they may be said to be, as one soule in one body, and one Angell in the place, that it pleaseth to occupye, or to haue operation therin: albeit yf we respect partiall places of the same body, as head, foote, fingar and the like, the selfe-same soule is wholy in diuers places at once, which is no lesse wonderfull and incredible to our sense, then for a bodily substance, to be in two distinct places at once. And the like is in the Angell, who may occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for example, a whole house or towne for his totall place, and yet be in euery particular and partiall place therof wholy and entyrely, which is graunted both by all philosophers and diuynes, though vulgar sense cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend yt.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To the fourth may be answered the very <note place="margin">To the fourth.</note> same, as to the former, that the being of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells in place definitiuely, is like in all respects
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:5406:110"/>
to that of the soule. Read our fourth obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the precedent Chapter. To the fifth <note place="margin">To the fifth.</note> argument the aunswere is easy, for we deny that whatsoeuer is in diuers places at once, is God, for that by his omnipotent power a creature may be: yt is Gods priuiledge that he is euery where wholy and entyrely, <hi>ex vi natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae diuinae,</hi> by force of his diuine nature, that is to say, he is so euery-where, as he cannot be but euery where, which is not true eyther in a spiritt, or in Christs body, or in any other creature whatsoeuer; for that all creatures, as they haue limited natures, so are they limited also in place, and restrayned from vbiquity, or being euery where, which is proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to almighty God alone: &amp; so to speake of the body of Christ in particular, yt is not euery-where; and we detest both the <hi>Eutichian</hi> vbiquitaryes, that held Christs body to be euery-where, as confounded with his diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and no lesse the Lutheran vbiquitaryes of our dayes, that hold Christs body to be euery where, by reason of the coniunction with Christs diuinity; the Catholike faith affirming only, that Christs body, though naturally it be but in one place, yet by Gods omnipotency it may be in more.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. To the sixt argument we deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To the sixt.</note> to witt, that we destroy Christs humanity by grauntinge, that yt may be in diuers places at once; for that yt repugneth not to a humayne creature, to be in more places then one by Gods omnipotency: this we haue shewed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:5406:110"/>
more largely in our fifth obseruation. To the <note place="margin">To the seauenth.</note> seauenth we deny also the <hi>Minor;</hi> that Christs body in the Sacrament is to be circumscribed, or circumscriptiuely there, as yt is in heauen. The differences betweene three manners of being, to witt, circumscriptiuely, definitiuely, and sacramentally, yow may see more at large declared in our fourth and fifth obseruations. To the eight and last, we say that the maior is <note place="margin">To the eyght.</note> to be vnderstood naturally, and not superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally by diuine power: to the <hi>Minor,</hi> we aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that Christs body hath not externall dimensions in the Sacrament, though yt haue in heauen: and in the Sacrament yt hath only internall and inuisible quantity, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension to place; wherof yow may read more in the fourth and fifth obseruations. And this shalbe sufficient for this first ground of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall arguments. Now will we passe to the second.</p>

The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point is, that <hi>S.

And when <hi>Doctor Cranmer</hi> sought many holes to runne out at, <hi>VVeston</hi> presseth him againe with other words of <hi>S.

Lo heere yt is accoumpted a point of Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme by <hi>S.

                  </note> yt is to dispute with these people, that seeke after nothinge but shifts &amp; holes to runne out at, or stipp away? Consider how many they be vpon this only place. For first when <hi>Ridley</hi> was pressed with <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> authority, as yow haue heard, prouinge euidently, that Christ could be at one tyme in diuers places, his first shift was, that yt maketh nothinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and then, that albeit Christ be in many places, yet his body cannot be in many places, as though Christ were in any place without his body: And then againe yt being shewed, that <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> speaketh expressely of Christs body, the next shift was, that his body is not there after the ordinary manner of bodily presence, to witt, by circumscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of place, which is quite from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for that we hould this also, as before you haue heard in the fifth &amp; sixt obseruations, to witt, that Christ is not circumscriptiuely in the Sacrament. And further yt is another ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd shift, or rather ignorance in <hi>Ridley</hi> (and may be the fift or sixt about this matter) to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme as heere he doth, that Christs body is not by circumscription euery-where, or in all places: for we hould also, not only, that which he saith, by circumscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that no wayes, either circumscriptiuely, or definitiuely, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally is Christs body euery-where, but only in many distinct places, by Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent will.

And lastly to follow <hi>Ridley</hi> and his riddles no further about this matter, the words of <hi>S, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> are foolishely alleaged by him; <hi>that the Lord is aboue, but the truth of the Lord is in all places:</hi> For as <hi>Doctor VVeston</hi> well noteth and telleth him, <hi>vve talke not heere, how the Lords truth is euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhere,</hi> but whether Christs body be in diuers places or noe: for Christs truth is euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where his faith grace or power is, but not his body.

                  <hi>tooke the more to heart, for that he had allwayes taken him to be his frend.</hi> And albeit Fox doth not sett downe the same preface, yet by <hi>Doctor Glyns</hi> entrance to his argument, a man may see, that the cheefe point was in reprehendinge him, for deludinge and shiftinge of both scriptures and fathers so shamfully, as he had heard him do, for he saith: <hi>I see that yow euade or shift away</hi>

And finally <hi>Doctor Glyn</hi> endeauored to draw him to yeld to the Catholike Church, which being the piller of truth, could not be thought to haue fallen to such Idolatry, as for many ages to haue worshipped erroneously bread and wyne, for the flesh and bloud of Christ in the Eucharist, and for proofe therof he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> against <hi>Faustin</hi> the <hi>Manichec,</hi> where he saith, that this vse of adoring Christs body in the Sacrament, was so auncient and publike, as some pagans did thinke that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <note place="margin">

To which two authorityes I find nothinge aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered particularly; (as neyther to <hi>Erasmus)</hi> but to the thing it selfe <hi>Ridley</hi> aunswered: <hi>VVe do handle the signes reuerently, &amp;c.</hi> And againe: <hi>There is a deceyt in this word Adoramus,</hi> we adore, <hi>for vve vvorshipp the symbolls, vvhen reuerently vve handle them: vve vvorshipp vvhersoeuer vve perccaue benefitts.</hi> Whervnto <hi>Doctor Glyn</hi> aunswered: <hi>So I might fall downe before the bench heere, and worshipp Christ therin, &amp;c.</hi> For a bench also is a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall creature to them that sitt on yt. But for all this no further satisfaction could be had,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:5406:160"/>
but that all the adoe which the Fathers do make, <hi>about the highest honour in earth to be giuen to the Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> comes to no more by these mens interpretations; <hi>but that the signes of bread and vvyne must be reuerently handled, &amp; Christ absent must be vvorshipped therein, as in other thinges, vvherin vve perceaue or receaue his benefitts:</hi> vvhich indeed are all his creatures made &amp; ordayned for our profitt, for by them all, we perceaue &amp; receaue Christs benefitts: So as all these great admirations of the Fathers, about the honour, worshipp &amp; adoration due to this Sacrament, come to no more in effect, <hi>but that vve must reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Christ therin, as in other his beneficiall creatures, and vvorshipp the symboll of bread and wyne, as much as you do the water in baptisme:</hi> vvhich yet neuer any of the Fathers said was to be adored by vs (as they do of the Eucharist) though Baptisme be a most necessary and profitable Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Then disputed one <hi>Doctor Curtopp,</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge <note place="margin">

                  <hi>from the side of Christ,</hi> wherof he inferred, that true and naturall bloud did flow from the side of Christ, <hi>ergò</hi> true and naturall bloud was in the chalice. To this <hi>Ridley</hi> answered in effect <note place="margin">Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 1319.</note> after his ould fashion, that yt was true bloud, that is to say, <hi>the Sacrament of his bloud.</hi> Curtopp. <hi>The Sacrament of the bloud is not the bloud.</hi> Ridley. <hi>The Sacrament of the bloud, is the bloud, and that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Sacrament, vvhich is spoken of the thing

of the Sacrament.</hi> At which aunswere <hi>D.

               <p n="58">58. There rose vp after this <hi>Doctor VVatson,</hi>

was really vnited to his person, so are we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in flesh, by eatinge the same in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which is another manner of vnion then by faith and generall only.

               <p n="65">65. And will yow consider the grauity and verity of this note; first he saith that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell did not so much dissuade him from say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge masse, as to bringe him to desperation: then somewhat he did dissuade him, though <note place="margin">Iohn Fox excuseth the diuell and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> not so much as to the other; which I beleeue, for that the one was his damnation, and his leauinge of masse was but the way to yt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly yf the diuell did endeauour to bringe Luther to desperation for sayinge of masse, he must needs persuade him first, that the masse was naught, as yf he would draw a man to desperation for vsing almes deeds, he must first persuade him, that almes-deeds are naught and wicked, and as wise a man as he should shew himselfe, that at the diuells per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion will beleeue that almes-deeds were naught, and leaue the same; so were <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Latymer</hi> as wise to beleeue this suggestion of the diuell against the masse.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:5406:166"/>
his impugnation is, the better must we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the thing to be, and consequently when he would make the masse to seeme so hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a thinge to Luther, as that he should be damned for sayinge the same, yt is a good proofe that the masse is an excellent thing, &amp; displeaseth the diuell, and that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers leauing to say masse, do please much the diuell in followinge his suggestion therin, as good and obedient children, to so holy a ghostly Father, and so to him we leaue them.</p>
               <p n="66">66. There followeth, that albeit <hi>Latymer</hi> was loath to dispute, yet some few arguments were cast forth against him, but all in English, for so he would haue yt.

must yt needs be really and truly bloud; for this is the thinge or matter wherof the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, for that otherwayes we know that the bloud forbidden in the old Testament, is meant the bloud of beasts, and the bloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the new, is meant of the bloud of Christ; So as in this, <hi>Latymer</hi> cannot graunt them to be one thinge, but only in the realli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth of bloud, that is, as the one is true and reall bloud of beasts: so is the other true and reall bloud of Christ; which yf he graunt (as heere in words he doth) then cannot the different manner of drinkinge the same alter the substance of the thinge yt selfe; or yf yt do, then is yt false, that yt is the same thinge; and so euery way is ould <hi>Latymer</hi> taken, but lett vs passe foreward.</p>

One thinge also more is greatly in my opinion to be weighed in this matter, which is, that the said auncient Fathers hauinge to persuade so high and hard a mystery as this is, that Christs true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall flesh and bloud, are really vnder the formes of bread and wyne, by vertue of the Priests consecration, they were forced to vse all the manner of most significant speaches, which they could diuise to expresse the same, and to beate yt into the peoples heads and mynds, though contrary to their senses and common reason, and therby to fly from the opposite heresie and infidelity of our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaryes; lurkinge naturally in the harts of flesh and bloud, and of sensuall people; but synce that tyme by Sathans incytation, broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and brought forth publikely into the world.

exaggerations the better to explane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, such as they are wont to do in other controuersies also, when they would vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppose themselues against any error or heresie, as by the examples of <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in behalfe of <hi>Grace,</hi> and against the Manichees in the defence of <hi>Free-will.</hi> And of <hi>S.

Wherfore let vs see his third ground. The third ground (saith he) is the nature of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ridleyes</hi> 3. ground. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> the Sacrament, which consisteth in three things: <hi>vnity, nutrition</hi> and <hi>conuersion.</hi> And then he explaneth himselfe thus: <hi>that as in bread one loafe is made of many graynes, so signifieth this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we are all one mysticall body in Christ.</hi> And againe. <hi>As bread nourisheth our body; so doth the body of Christ nourish our soule.</hi> And thirdly. <hi>As bread is turned into our substance, so are vve turned into Christs substance. All vvhich three effects cannot be signified</hi> (saith he) <hi>by this Sacrament, yf there be Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, and no nature of bread left, and therfore there can be no Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This is <hi>Maister Ridleyes</hi> deepe diuinity about the nature of this Sacrament: but yf yow reade that which we haue noted before in our eyght obseruation, concerninge the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sap. cap.</hi> 3. §. 8.</note> and nature of a Sacrament in deed; yow will see that this was great simplicity in him (though accordinge to his hereticall grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doe not giue grace) to leaue out the principall effect signified in the Sacrament, which is grace, for that a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is defined: <hi>A visible signe of inuisible grace receaued therby.</hi> This Sacrament also is a signe of Christs body there present vnder the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:5406:183"/>
formes of bread and wyne: yet deny we not but that these other three effects also of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nutrition and conuersion may be signified therby, as in like manner the death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Sauiour, wherof this Sacrament is a memoriall and commemoration: neyther doth the <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of the bread into the body of Christ, lett or take away these signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, for so much as to make this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is taken bread and wyne, which naturally doth signifie these effects of vnion, nutrition, and conuersion, which <hi>Ridley</hi> heere mentioneth, though yt be not necessary, that the substance of the said bread and wyne should still remayne, but only there formes and accidents, which do signifie and are signes to our senses, as much as yf the substances themselues of bread and wyne were present. As for example the brasen serpent, did as <note place="margin">Fox <hi>pag.</hi> 1261.</note> much represent, and was a signe of Christ in respect of the analogie betwene Christ and a true serpent, as yf he had had the substance of à true serpent, whereof he had but only the forme and shape; and so are the outward <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.</note> formes of bread and wyne, after the words of consecration, sufficient to represent vnto vs the Analogy that is betweene feedinge the body, and feedinge the soule, vnity of graines, and vnity of Christs mysticall body which is his Church.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And thus much of <hi>Ridleyes</hi> third ground which impugneth <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> which ground (as yow see) is so weake and feeble,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:5406:184"/>
as he that shall build theron, is like to come to a miserable ruyne of his owne saluation. But much more ridiculous is his fourth ground, vttered in these words: <hi>The fourth</hi>

               <hi>ground</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the abhominable heresie of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches, that may ensue of Transubstantiation.</hi> Thus he saith in his position, but lett vs heare him afterward in his probation, which is not much larger then his proposition, for thus he wryteth: <hi>They vvhich say that Christ is carnally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Eucharist, do take from him the verity of mans nature. Eutiches graunted the diuyne nature in Christ, but his humayne nature he denyed.</hi> And is not this a goodly proofe of so great a charge? Nay is not this a goodly ground and head-springe of proofes? Consider I pray yow how these matters do hange togeather. <hi>Eutiches</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy was, as yow may see in the letters of <hi>Saint Leo</hi> the first, and in the Councell of <hi>Calcedon;</hi>

And how doth this heresie I pray yow, follow of our doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suostantiation! <hi>Eutiches</hi> said that the diuine and humayne natures in Christ were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded togeather, and of two made but one: we say that they remayne distinct, and do condemne <hi>Eutiches</hi> for his opinion, and by our Church he was first accursed and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for the same: <hi>Eutiches</hi> said, Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne nature was turned into his diuine; we say only that bread and wyne is turned into
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:5406:184"/>
Christs flesh and bloud: what likenesse hath this with <hi>Eutiches</hi> heresie? <hi>But</hi> (saith <hi>Ridley) vve do take from Christ the verity of mans nature.</hi> This is a fiction and foolish calumniation, as before yow haue heard, and consequently deserueth no further refutation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The fifth ground, <hi>is</hi> (saith he) <hi>the most sure beleefe of the article of our faith: He ascended into</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

Ridley</hi> aunswered: <hi>Nay I do not bynd Christ in heauen so straitly.</hi> By which aunsweres yow see, that this whole principall ground and head-springe of Ridleyes arguments against <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> is quite ouerthrowne. For yf Christ in flesh after his ascension may be also on earth when he will, as <hi>Ridley</hi> heere graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, then is it not against the article of our <hi>Creed (He ascended into heauen,)</hi> to beleeue, that not withstandinge his ascension, he may be also on earth in the Sacrament. And albeit <hi>Ridley</hi> do cyte heere certayne places of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that do seeme to say: that Christ after
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:5406:185"/>
his ascension is no more conuersant amonge vs vpon earth; yet that is not to be vnderstood of his being in the Sacrament, which is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall manner of being, but of his corporall manner of conuersation, as he liued visibly among his disciples before his ascension. And this is sufficient for discussion of this fifth ground, wherof the cheefe particulars haue byn handled in diuers places before.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Now then will we returne to his second <note place="margin">The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorityes alleaged by <hi>Ridley. Dionys. Areop. in Eccles. Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi>
