            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This man doth betoken vnto vs the heretickes / and that for. iiij. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions aboue rehersed in this gospell. And here my bretherne / ye that nowe be abiured take hede.</p>
            <p>Fyrst here I say that this man was singular by hym selfe: and so the heretikes studie to be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in theyr opinions. Singularite and pride is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

falleth he into heresies.</p>
            <p>Seconde. this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was blynde / and had lost his sight. And the heretikes / by the errour of false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and of ꝑuersed heresies / be blyded in theyr hartes / and haue nat the clere light of faithe.</p>
            <p>Thyrde. this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sate out of the right way / and walked nat: And so lyke wise these heretikes sytte out of the right waye / and walke nat in the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towarde heuen.</p>
            <p>Fourth. this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was deuided from this people / amonge whom Christe Jesu was: And so be the heretikes like wise: they be deuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche of Christe / with whom our sauiour Christe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth vnto the worldes ende. Thus ye ꝑceyue I suppose / that this man (whiche was singular / <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶ In the thyrde place we may by this easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue / what great diuersite is betwene the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che catholike and the heretikes.</p>
            <p>Fyrste / they that be of this multitude / and of the churche catholike / they be of one mynde and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion / co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our faith / to agre to gether in one doctrine. The heretikes be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar / and haue opinions by them selfe: and they be repugnant nat onely with the churche / but with them selfe amonge them selfe / as we shall shewe here after. It is a very trouth that one wise man hath sayde: Omne verum omni vero consonat / falsum autem tam a se ipso quam ab ipsa veritate discrepat: Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trouth agreeth with other: but falshod is both
<pb facs="tcp:10241:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
repugnant ageynst hym selfe &amp; ageynst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouth. Secunde. The churche is in the clere brightnes of faith. The heretikes be blynded by theyr false &amp; erronious opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For as trouthe gyueth a light and a brightnes / so falsehode blyndeth / and bryngeth in to derkenes.</p>
            <p>Thyrde. The churche is in the right way. The heretikes be out of the right way.</p>
            <p>Forthe. The churche walketh and profiteth in their iourney towarde the countre of heuen. The heretikes sitte in Cathedra pestisentie / in the seate of pestilence / and profete nothynge in this iourney / but rather synkethe depper and depper towarde the pytte of hell.</p>
            <p>Fyfte. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche hath in it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of Chrste / and shal haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually vnto the worldes ende: The heretikes be deuided frome Christe in this present tyme / and so finally shalbe excluded from the sight of his face for euer. All these fyue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces be so manifest in this gospell / that we nede nat moche decleration for the same.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe in the fourth place let vs discusse / howe this blynde man was restored vnto his sight: to thentent that we maye perceyue howe an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike<note place="margin">Howe an hereticke may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the true faythe.</note> may be restored to the true faithe of Christis churche. This blynde man by. iiij. maner of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes was brought vnto his sight.</p>
            <p>Fyrst he hering and inquiryng the very trouth of that multitude / whiche passed forby: Audiuit turbam pretereuntem / et interrogauit / quid hoc esset: He herde the people whiche was in passage / and of
<pb facs="tcp:10241:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them he lerned what Jesus of Nazareth was. So must heretikes do / if he wyll be restored vnto the true faith. For no where the true doctryne of Jesu can be lerned / but in the churche. Here must the worde of god be lerned. And this is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expressed in this gospell by mistery. It is certayne that the people of the Jewes / whan y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Manhu was sent vnto them from aboue / &amp; they sawe it in the lykenes of the corriander sede / they made this same question / whiche this blynde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe dothe aske: Quid hoc? what is that. And of this question that sede toke this name / and was called Manhu. Nowe Manhu betokeneth in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the worde of god. Who therfore so euer wyll lerne the trewe doctryne of the worde of god / he muste enquire it of this multitude / that walketh in the right waye: that is to say / of the churche catholike. Doutles out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche this trouth can nat be lerned.</p>
            <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. this bly<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cried for mercy: so muste y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretike do: he must beseche our sauiour Christ to enlighten his harte by clere faith / &amp; to remoue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hart y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blyndnes of all errours &amp; heresye.</p>
            <p>Thyrde. our sauiour dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this blynde man shulde be brought vnto hym: And so must y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretikes be reduced vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wayes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche. But by whom commaundeth our sauiour / that thus they shall be reduced? truely by them that be set in spiritual auctorite: as nowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fader i god my lorde Legate / hauy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this most souerayne auctorite / hath endeuored hym selfe for
<pb facs="tcp:10241:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these men here present / &amp; other / whiche were out of the way / to reduce them in to the wayes of the churche. The heretikes contende / that it shal nat belefull thus to do: but they wold haue euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lefte vnto theyr libertie. But doutles it may nat be so: For the nature of man is more prone to all noughtynes / rather than to any goodnes. And therfore many muste be compelled / accordyng as the gospel sayth in an other place: Compellite eos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare. If euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld haue libertie to say what he wolde / we shuld haue a meruelous worlde. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shulde stere any where for heresies. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saynt Paule consideryng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pronytie of mans harte to be infected with heresies / gyueth often warnynge / that we shall in any wyse eschewe the perillous infections of these heretikes. And the same saynt Paule often pronunceth exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ageynst them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sowe this puersed doctrines amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the Christen people. Wherfore it is nat le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any man shall haue libertie to speke in these matters concernyng our fayth / what so euer that he liste: but he must be compelled to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme hym vnto the holsome doctryne of the churche.</p>
            <p>Fourth this blynde man / whan he was brought vnto our sauiour / yet had he nat his syght vnto than he dyd fully assent with his holle wyl vnto the same. And to that purpose our sauiour asked hym what he wolde: Quid vis vt faciam tibi? And so made hym to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse his full assent. Thus must the heretike do that wyl haue his spirituall sight: he muste fully assent vnto the doctrine of Christis
<pb facs="tcp:10241:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
churche. He may be compelled to come bodily / but if he come nat also with the feete of his soule / and fully assent vnto the churche: he can nat haue this trewe faith. The faith of the churche is nat made our faith / but by our assent: whiche assent cometh of vs / and is the wombe of our soule. And therfore it is nat absolutely saide / fides but fides tua: That is to say / thy faith. The faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by thyne assent is made thy faith) doth make the safe.</p>
            <p>In the fyfte and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last place / as touchyng Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn Luthers opinion of faith / nowe wyll I speks some what. To reherse his reasons / and so w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But where he boulteth and discusseth this matter vnto the very triall / there he maketh it an harde matter. For in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the. vi. psalme he sayth these wordes: Hoc certu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est / nemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peruenturum ad dei misericordiam / nisi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tissime esuriat / et sitiat: cum isso qui ait: Que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But if only faith doth iustifie vs / we can nat be repelled from this mercy / whan we be fully iustified.</p>
            <p>Seconde. why dothe Luther deny that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes do nat iustify vs? His reason is this. He saith bycause they be our workes: and what so euer reyseth from vs / it is but synne. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let hym ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these wordis: Fides tua.

               <p>The thyrde consideration / why the sede of the<note place="margin">The thyrd consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> worde of god is but one / is this. Though there be many bokes of scripture / bothe in the olde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in the newe also / yet all these bokes be so fully agreed by the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the holy doctours / that they make but one boke / and one body of scripture: and haue in them all but one spirite of lyfe: that is to saye / the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christe Jesu. Euen as in the body of man there be many partes and many membres / yet for as moche as in euery of them is but one lyfe and one soule: therfore the body is but one. This thynge was figured in a vision / shewed vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:10241:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prophet Ezechiell: he sawe one roundell and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny roundels / and eche of them in the myddis of other: but in all these roundels was but one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of lyfe. So euery parte of scripture is lyke a roundel: For it hath no corners. Trouth is rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and hath none angles. The psalter of Dauid is a roundell of trouthe / and eche of the gospels is a roundell of trouthe: The gospelles be in the psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and the psalter is in the gospelles: and the spirite of Christe maketh one roundell of them all. The newe testament is a roundell / and the olde testament is a roundell / and either of them is in the other: but there is but one spirite of lyfe in them bothe: and so in euery roundell of scripture: and this spirite maketh one roundell of all. And with these also the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the fathers / whiche were inspired by the same spirite / make one roundell with the same.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of Luther can nat be thus / nor yet partiner of this spirite of lyfe / bicause it is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant and deuyded frome the holle corps of the doctryne of the churche. Wherfore we maye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Luther is nat one with the doctrine of Christe.</note> conclude / that the doctryne of Luther is nat one with the doctryne of Christe / nor hath in it the spirite of lyfe: For as moche as it is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant and contradyctorily dyuerse from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne of the churche. Whiche thynge we maye proue by. iij. reasons. The fyrst is this. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the churche / wherin all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers agree / 
<pb facs="tcp:10241:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is spoken by Christe / and inspired by the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Christe / as it doth appere of the fyrste col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. But Christe and his holy spirite can nat teache and inspire two doctrynes / the whiche be clene contrary. Wherfore the doctryne of Luther is nat the doctrine of Christe / and of his most holy spirite.</p>
               <p>Seconde. Christe Jesu sayth of hym selfe / that he is the veray trouth: Ego sum veritas. But one trouth can nat be deuided at ones to two contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. And why? If that one of them haue the trouth / that other muste nedes want it: For one trouth can nat be commune vnto them bothe.</p>
               <p>Thyrde. the holy goste is the spirite of lyfe vnto the doctryne of the churche. But the sprite of lyfe can nat be deuided: but it must go holle: As we se that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mannes arme is cutte from his body / the lyfe is nat deuided / parte vnto the arme / and parte vnto the body: but the holle lyfe gothe with the body / and the arme hath no parte therof. So for bicause that Luther by his intricate expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons maketh one parte of scripture to be repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t agaynst an other / as he confesseth hym selfe / that he can nat frame his other expositions with the Epistole of saynt James / and with the gospell of Luke.
