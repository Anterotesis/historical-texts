         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from his naturall and lofty ſtyle, to our corrupt and baſe,

vnnaturall killing of his Father <hi>LAIVS,</hi> the inceſtuous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

when thou shalt apparantly ſe my witles lacke of learning,

places verye harde and doubtfull, and the worke much
corrupt by the default of euil printed Bookes) and alſo how
farre aboue my power to keepe that Grace and maieſtye of

hath paſt the reach of all imitation, and alſo this our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
toung (as many thinke, and I here fynd) is farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to compare with the Latten: but thou (good Reader)
if I in any place haue ſwerued from the true ſence, or not
kept the roialty of ſpeach, meete for a Tragedie, impute the
one to my youth and lacke of iudgement: the other to my
lacke of Eloquence. Now as concerninge ſondrye places
augmented and ſome altered in this my tranſlation. Firſt
for aſmuch as this worke ſeemed vnto mee in ſome places
vnperfite, whether left ſo of the Author, or parte of it
loſte, as tyme deuoureth all thinges, I wot not, I haue
(where I thought good) with addition of myne owne
Penne ſupplied the wante of ſome thynges, as the firste
Chorus, after the first acte begynninge thus. O ye to whom
&amp;c. Alſo in the ſeconde Acte I haue added the ſpeache
of Achilles Spright, ryſyng from Hell to require the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce

now. &amp;c. Agayne the three laste ſtaues of the Chorus
after the ſame Acte: and as for the thyrde Chorus
which in Seneca beginneth thus, QVE VOCAT SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DES?
For asmuch as nothing is therein but a heaped

with my ſelfe, that the names of ſo manye vnknowen

ſhoulde haue no grace in the Engliſhe tounge, but bee a

I should expound the Historyes of each one, which would
be farre to tedious,) I haue in the place therof made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beginninge, in this manner. O Ioue that leadst. &amp;c.
VVhich alteration may be borne withall, ſeynge that Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
is no part of the ſubſtaunce of the matter. In the reſt
I haue for my ſlender learninge endeuored to keepe touch
with the Latten, not worde for woorde or verſe for verſe,
as to expounde it, but neglectynge the placinge of the
wordes, obſerued their ſence. Take Gentle Reader this
