            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <div type="introduction">
                     <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p>WE have been long in Expectation of
some extraordinary <hi>Productions</hi> of the
Eminent Convert of <hi>Oxford.</hi> His Age,
his Learning, and the present Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
hath raised that Expectation ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high; and tho the ill success of his Discourses concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Presence in the Sacrament, and the Adoration
of it, hath sunk his Reputation to a great Degree; it
having appeared that he neither writes exactly, nor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
which hath lessened him much in the Opinion of
those, who expected great things from him. Yet it was
thought that matters of History would succeed better in
his hand; for it hath been long believed, that he had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60978:3"/>
those Transactions very critically; so that when I
heard that he had undertaken this Subject, I expected
great Discoveries from him, and fancied that instead of
<hi>Extracts</hi> out of <hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Heylin,</hi> we should have found
<hi>Records, Originals, Papers,</hi> and the <hi>Cotton-Library,</hi> often
cited. So it may be easily apprehended how much I
was surprised, when I found a Book of such a Volume, in
which there was not the least Discovery of any new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact; and that there was nothing in it, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Repetition (very ill expressed in rough English) of
Arguments that have been over and over again, both
made and refuted; together with a Representation of the
state of Affairs in the last Age, that was partly defective,
and partly false. It seemed strange to me at first view,
to see so large a Book writ and printed eight years after
that Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the Reformation had appeared,
without its taking the least notice of that Work, which
hath been so well received, so much read, and which seems
to be so well confirmed by the Proofs that accompany it,
that few Books of History have gained a more general
Reputation than it hath done; and as none of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Communion
have been able hitherto, to say any thing
for the Disparagement of that Work, except Mr. <hi>Varil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi>
so he hath been so severely exposed by the Dr. that
this attempt hath raised its Credit, instead of lessening
of it.</p>
                     <p>It is true, This Book seems to be a part of a great Work,
and to have been writ many years ago. For as this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in many Parts of it, so more remarkably in one
Passage,<note place="margin">P. 82. ad finem.</note> that shews it was written in the Interval between
His <hi>Late Majesties being re-established in his Throne, and
the Restauration of Bishops;</hi> and therefore, when this
Book was writ, the Author could not vouch other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
than such as had then appeared: Yet, since the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60978:3"/>
printing of it was delayed so long; and since it is believed,
that the Author and the Publisher is the same Person, he
might have given himself the trouble to have reviewed his
Work, or at least to have added some Appendix relating
to that more copious and authentical Account which Dr.
<hi>Burnet</hi> hath given us of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> For if the <hi>Dr.</hi>
hath deceived the World by a false Representation of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
yet it must be confessed, that he hath done it with
so good a Grace, and with such appearances of Sincerity,
and of proving what he relates, and that both our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
and Forreigners have read that Work so much (as
appears by the several Impressions at home, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Translations that have been printed beyond Sea) that
it was too great an Omission in the Author of this Recital,
if he be still alive, that he hath never mentioned that
History, nor said any thing to ruin the Reputation it hath
gained.</p>
                     <p>I am, I confess, much inclined to believe, that he who
hath published this Book, could not have writ it. For as
there is nothing in it that answers the Reputation he hath
in the World; so the time of writing it, seems a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
that he cannot be the Author of it. For what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
can we have of a mans Conscience, of his Probity, or
his Honour, that could write such a Book against the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the year 1660.
and yet could continue in the Communion of our Church,
concurring not only in the <hi>Acts</hi> of our <hi>daily Worship,</hi> but
mixing with us in the Holy Sacrament twenty five years
after this! Such a Criminal Compliance hath so many foul
Characters upon it, that after all the Charity to which a
man can carry his thoughts, he can scarce know how to
have one good thought of a person capable of so black and
such a long continued dissimulation, both towards God and
Man. Whether Oaths and Subscriptions have not come in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60978:4"/>
wise to enhance the guilt of so horrid a Dissimulation, I
do not know; but even tho that hath not been in the case,
God and Man hath been sufficiently mocked. This is that
which makes me very unwilling to believe that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this Book could continue in all the Acts of visible
Communion with this Church, so many years after he
writ it; tho I confess he speaks so softly, and with so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Detestation of the compliance of the Popish Clergy in
<hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">From p. 140.</note> that this looks too like a man that
was resolved to venture on the same guilt; for he tells us
in his harsh Stile, That the <hi>perpetual outward compliance of
some other Bishops contrarily affected, since there preceded
before it penalties and Fears, and the seeing of the prime Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to be imprisoned and ejected for standing out, is far
from an authentical Consent, and unjustly reckoned as such.
For tho none can know mens Hearts, but by their outward
appearances, yet where mens Votes are asked, after Penalties,
Imprisonments of others, Threats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are so strong
motives of Dissimulation. Now all that conform in these, are
to be presumed Compliers, and none free Voters.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
without expressing any horror at it, he owns, <hi>That
many of the inferior Clergy remained still of the old Religion;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 141.</note>
which he goes about to prove by several Reasons. And
yet after all this, there was nothing to be apprehended in
K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, by such of the Clergy as would not
receive the Reformation, but the loss of their Benefices;
which (if we are not mistaken in the Man) our Author
felt to be such a <hi>strong motive of Dissimulation,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be overcome by it. If a single Act of impious
Worship against a mans Conscience, was thought so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a crime by the Primitive Church, that it could not
be expiated, but by a Penitence of many years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
then certainly, the same Sin repeated in the course
of so many years, against such clear Convictions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60978:4"/>
must be confessed to be so heinous a Transgression,
that according to the Spirit of the Primitive Times, such
an Offender could have expected no other Grace, but to
obtain the Peace of the Church in his last agonies. To
see a man change, is natural, especially where a present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is the motive; but it is a degree of impiety, of
which one would hope there are few men capable to lye so
long, and so solemnly both to God and man. But I come
now to look a little more narrowly into the matter of
this Treatise.</p>
                     <p>I will not at all engage my self to examine a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Passages that are cited in it, out of some of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and in particular out of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike:</hi>
When we object to those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
some things out of <hi>Erasmus</hi> or <hi>Cassander;</hi> or for Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Matters, when we cite <hi>P. Paul</hi> or <hi>Thuanus;</hi> we know
with how much neglect they put by these Authorities, as
if they were not concerned in them; tho these <hi>Persons</hi>
lived and dyed in the Visible Communion of their <hi>Church.</hi>
And I do not see why we may not take the same liberty
with such Writers, that tho they have been in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with our <hi>Church,</hi> yet have it seems continued in it
with some difficulty. And it will not appear very strange
if at the end of our <hi>civil Wars</hi> those Persons, who saw the
ill effects of some ill Principles very apparently were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by the impressions which those Confusions made
upon them, to oppose those disorders by an over-bending
of their notions to the other Extream. For this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to which the humane nature is so liable, that it were
a wonder if all Writers, especially men of warm Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that had been sower'd by ill usage, had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from it; so that I will wholly wave all that he
cites from these or any others of our Authors, and will
come to the matters themselves.</p>

                     <head type="sub">Of the Importance of those Matters Objected
to the Reformation, supposing them all true.</head>
                     <p>THE Disputes that we had with the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> were at first managed with more sincerity by
our Adversaries, than they have been of late; They ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
their Church in those Points for which we accused
her, and objected the strongest things they could to ours;
but when they felt their Cause too weak to be maintained
by fair methods, then they betook themselves to others
that were indeed less sincere, but yet were more apt to
make impressions on weak minds. In <hi>France,</hi> and among
us, Three new Methods have appeared of late Years. The
First was to take off men from entring into the merits of
the Cause, and to prepossess them with such prejudices
against the Reformation, as might lead them to condemn
it without examining: To a discerning mind this method
furnishes the strongest of all prejudices against those who
use it; this shews such a distrust of the Cause it self, and it
discovers it self so plainly to be a trick, that it gives every
man a just ground of indignation against those who fly to
it: Besides, that it affords a good Plea to all men to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the Religion in which they were born and bred,
without hearkning to any new discoveries; for if the
Grounds upon which the Reformation was made, were
good, it signifies little to an Enquirer into Truth, whether
this Work was set on foot, and managed with all the
exactness and regularity that might have been desired, or
not. Truth is always Truth, from what hand soever it
comes; and the right way to find it out, is to free our
minds from all prejudices, that so we may examine mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
with unprepossessed understandings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60978:5"/>
A Second Method is to perswade the World that we
have not yet understood one another; that <hi>Popery</hi> hath
only appeared odious, because it was <hi>Misrepresented</hi> to
the world in false colours, but that it will be found to be
quite another thing if it is truly <hi>represented.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Meaux</hi> had the honour to begin this piece of <hi>Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain;</hi>
our men of the <hi>Mission</hi> here have too slender a
stock of their own, and therefore they give us the <hi>French
Mode</hi> in Controversie, as well as our Gallants do it in
Cloaths; so they have thought to do wondrous feats with
this method of <hi>Representing;</hi> but the want of sincerity of
that Prelate, in this as well as in other things, hath been
so evidently made out, that if some men had not a secret
that makes them proof against all discoveries, he would
be a little out of Countenance; and our <hi>Representers</hi> here
are so exposed, that nothing is wanting for their convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but a sense of that shame with which they have been
covered; it is indeed a strange piece of confidence in
men, to come and offer to convince the World, That after
Disputes of 150 years continuance, neither side hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the state of the Controversie: and tho the same
Decrees of Councils, and the same Forms of Worship are
still received; yet all these things must of a sudden so
change their nature, that in defiance of all that, which
upon other occasions, they say in behalf of <hi>Tradition,</hi> a
new discovery should be made, giving us new senses of
all those things; but whatsoever success that Book may
have had, where a plundering Army managed the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet it is become now as ridiculous here, as it is
pretended to have been successful beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>A Third Method is the setting up the Credit of <hi>Oral
Tradition,</hi> not upon the Authority of some passages of
Scripture, but upon this general Topic, that one Age must
needs have delivered the same Faith to the succeeding
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60978:6"/>
Age, that it had received from that which went before
it; and by consequence, that we must have in the present
Age, the same Doctrine which the Apostles delivered at
first, 17 Ages ago. It was found, That the Authority of
the Church could not well be founded on passages of
Scripture, for then we must be allowed first to believe the
Scripture, and its Authority and Genuineness, and then to
inquire into the meaning of those Passages, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to which of all the different Churches that are in
the world, they do belong: Now it was apparent, That if
it were once allowed, that we may carry our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
so far as to be able to settle our selves in these points,
then this Infallible Authority is not so necessary to us, as
they would make us believe, since we are supposed to
have found good Proofs for believing the Scriptures, and
for discovering the true meaning of the hardest passages
in them, without its help. Now this would spoil all, and
throw out those Arguments that perswade us of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of an infallible Judg, both for our finding out, and
for our expounding the Scriptures; they are now sensible
of all this, and see that it is a very false Method of arguing
to prove the Scriptures by the Church, when the Church
must be first proved by the Scriptures; and therefore
they do betake themselves to the Infallibility of Oral
Tradition, founding it upon this General Topic, That all
the men of one Age must needs have instructed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Age in the same Faith that they had received
from the former Age, and upon this a great many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Impossibilities are reckoned up to shew, that this
could not fail, and so they infer the certainty of this
method of conveyance. Now this is so extravagantly
ridiculous, and so contrary to the common experience of
all mankind, that all that can possibly be said to support
it, signifies no more but to shew how many fine things a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60978:6"/>
man of wit can say to prove the impossibility of a thing
which yet every man of sense knows is not only possible,
but is so certain an effect of such an Oral Conveyance,
that it is rather impossible it should not fail. How was the
first Oral Tradition of the Religion delivered to <hi>Adam,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted?
Tho the long lives of the first Patriarchs is a much
stronger Argument for proving the impossibility of such a
corruption, than any that these Gentlemen can alledg.
How was the Jewish Religion corrupted in our Saviour's
time, tho the only Scene of their Solemn Worship being
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the assembling of their whole Nation in
their Temple, three times a year, are much stronger induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to make us conclude that it was impossible for an
Oral Conveyance to miscarry among them, than any that
can be pretended to amongst Christians. Do we not see
that the most common Transactions are so diversified after
they have passed through a few hands, that Truth is very
soon lost, when it hath no better Standard than Fame and
Chat? Do not all Languages change so much in a course
of some ages, that those who lived here 500 years ago,
would be no more understood, if they were now among
us; and yet it were easie to point out the Infallibility of
the conveyance of a Language with much livelier colours
than these men can lay on here. If Oral Tradition hath
any pretension to certainty, it must be chiefly with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to such things as are sensible and visible, and that fall
under the observation of all men; for in matters that are
speculative, it is natural for every man to dress them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to those explications with which he cloaths them;
and if his Reputation either for Piety, Learming, or a true
understanding of matters is established, it is so probable,
that these will be so well received, that what was believed
in one age in some general words, will be believed in
another, with the addition of those new explications, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60978:7"/>
it were indeed a wonder if it were otherwise, especially in
Ages of Ignorance and Superstition: If it is found that in
things which are sensible, this Oral Tradition is so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changed, that we are as sure of it as we ean possibly be
of any matter of History; then it is a vain thing to go
about to perswade us, that this is an infallible conveyance
in matters of Doctrine, since it is plain, that the one is
much more like to be sure, than the other can ever be
supposed to be. if in the Worship of God the Adoration
of Images and Saints, and an infinity of new Rites are
brought in; if in the Sacrament, the Adoration of it, the
denying the Cup to all except the Priest, the <hi>denying the
Sacrament</hi> to Infants; if in the Government of the Church
the Popes have not only brought the other Bishops to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
subject to them, but have broke through the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Metropolitans, and the Equality that was setled
between themselves and the other Patriarchs, tho these
things were enacted by the first General Councils; if
Popes have got possession of an Authority over Princes,
when they were either Hereticks, or were favourers of
Hereticks, and have maintained this Possession these last
600 years; if, I say, all these things, which are not only
sensible, but are very contrary to those Inclinations and
Interests, that are the powerful Springs of human nature,
have yet been brought into the world so manifestly, is it
any wonder, if in dark ages (in which a blind Obedience,
and an unreserved Submission to Church-men were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as the chief Branches of Catholick Religion) a
great many new Doctrines, that were infinitely for the
advantage of a corrupt and designing Clergy were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and received: Instead of wondring at the success of
all these Innovations, we should have had much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to wonder if they had not prevailed.</p>
                     <p>But upon the whole matter, all these new Methods
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60978:7"/>
shew us, that those who manage them, see the weakness
of the old ones, and that their Cause cannot be maintained
on that bottom, on which the Writers of Controversy had
at first put it; and that therefore they must a little change
their way; and this being an age, in which Wit and fine
Thoughts are highly valued, those who fancied they were
Masters in those, hoped to raise a sunk Cause; which how
successful soever it may be, when it is managed by <hi>Dragoons,</hi>
yet hath never appeared more naked and despicable, than
it hath done of late years. Therefore they have given
this new <hi>Air</hi> and Turn to the common Subjects of the
Authority of the Church, and of Tradition, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
themselves to the certainty of Oral Tradition,
as their last retrenchment; and after all those Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that have been made of late, against those who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to carry the assurance of our Religion beyond a
moral certainty, they now fly to a Plea, which if it were
true, is but at most a moral certainty; but is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, that we have as much certainty as we can have
for a negative Proposition, that it is and ever must be false.</p>
                     <p>The Author of this Treatise offers us a new Essay of one
of these late Methods; for instead of attacking our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in any of its essential Parts, he goes about only to
prove that it was not Canonical; and all this, when it were
granted to be true, amounts to no more than this, that the
Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having been extreamly
advantageous to the Clergy, the greater part of them were
too much locked up in Ignorance, and too much addicted
to their Interests to admit of any change; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the lesser part was forced to make use of the Civil-power
to support them in reforming those Abuses. But
this must be acknowledged to be lawful; otherwise all
National-Reformations from received Errors, are no more
to be thought on. For, suppose an Error hath overspread
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60978:8"/>
a National Church, which is a Supposition that none can
deny, since how infallible soever the Catholick Church
may be supposed to be, it is past dispute, that every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church may be so over-run with Errors, that the
greater part may be infected; and if this falls to be in a
Conjuncture, in which a General Council cannot be called;
and if the Heresy is new, such, as for instance the <hi>Pelagian</hi>
was, when it first appeared; so that it had spread far before
it had been condemned by a General Council; what must
be done in such a case, if the Prince may not support the
Sounder, tho the Lesser Part? So that according to this
Supposition, if those Doctrines and Forms of Worship that
were reformed in the last Age, were Erroneous or Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
than any supposed Irregularities that might be in
the way of managing it, can never blemish that Work. It
is certain, that all Rules are only for quiet times; in the
days of Peace and Order, the transgressing of established
Rules, is without doubt a very censurable thing; but this
must not be applied to all times. For, tho in a setled time
we know how much respect we owe to Judges and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State; yet if these very Persons will go to set on a
Rebellion, and authorize it, all that respect ought presently
to be thrown off.</p>

                     <p>IT hath a very ill Grace to see a man of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion talk so highly of the Obligation to obey
the Canons of the Church, so as almost to <hi>Vnchurch us,</hi> upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60978:8"/>
some supposed Irregularities in our <hi>Reformation.</hi> For what
is the whole Constitution of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> but one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Contradiction to all the <hi>Ancient Cannons?</hi> And what
is the whole modern <hi>Canon Law,</hi> but the Exaltation of
the Papal Authority, above all the Canons of the Church?
Is there any thing clearer in the Primitive times, than the
establishing the Authority of Metropolitans, that was
confirmed by the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> the equalling the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was
done by the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>4th</hi> General Council; the establishing
the <hi>Independency</hi> of those Churches that were in Possession
of it, and so freeing them from all Subordination to other
Sees, which was done by the <hi>3d General Council?</hi> And yet,
tho here we see the four first General Councils, all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to establish this form of Government, the Papal-power
is no other than a breaking in upon all these Canons. What
is more uncanonical than the establishing <hi>Legatine Courts,</hi>
the receiving of <hi>Appeals,</hi> the obliging of Bishops to sue
for their <hi>Bulls</hi> in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> the dispensing with
all the Canons of the Church, the exempting all the
Regulars from Obedience to their Bishops, which is not
only contrary to the express Canon of the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
but is plainly contrary to that Authority that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
derive from Christ to govern the Flocks committed
to their care. In short, the whole System of the Church
and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> is so direct a revolt from all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Canons, that it is a degree of Confidence, which I
do not envy in our Author, for him to talk of uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Canons are Rules established, either by Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
or more General Councils, which import no more
but that they ought to be commonly observed; for it is
plain, that there is no Church in the World, that hath
looked on the Canons of the former times, as things so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60978:9"/>
and unalterable, that they could never be dispensed
with. The Schism of the two Popes at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Avignon,</hi>
and all that was done in consequence of it, was uncanonical
with a Witness; and yet how was all that buried by the
Council of <hi>Constan<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>?</hi> And tho one of the two Obediences
was certainly in a state of Schism, yet all that was passed
over, and without any Submission of either side, all was
healed up.</p>
                     <p>The whole Constiution of Metropolitans with their
Provincial Synods, which was the ancientest and clearest
of all the Primitive Rules, arises only out of the several
Divisions of the Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; when
then the Civil Constitution of all <hi>Europe</hi> is so much altered
from what it was then; all that Fabrick subsists now rather
upon a respect to ancient Rules, than from the Authority
of those Canons, which can no more remain, the ground
upon which they were built, being now removed. And
one may as well pretend that we are bound to obey the old
<hi>Roman</hi> Law, or the Feudal Law, because those Laws were
once received amongst us; as to tell us, that we are bound
to obey all the ancient Canons, especially those that had a
visible Relation to the Constitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.
Therefore the Subordination of Churches, of Synods, and
Metropolitans, and Patriarchs, that was only the knitting
into one Body, and under several degrees of Subordination,
a Church that was all under one Civil Society and Empire,
hath sunk with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. So that the tearing that
Empire in pieces, hath quite put an end to all that Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Subordination. And if there is any thing of that
yet kept up amongst us, it is rather for the preserving of
Order, than that we are under any Obligation of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to submit to such Constitutions. And therefore, as oft
as a great Conjuncture of Affairs carries along with it
considerations that are of more weight, than the adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60978:9"/>
to ancient Forms, then all these may be well superseded.
For all Rules are temporary things, and made according to
several Emergences and Occasions, which altering fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it were a very unreasonable thing to expect that
every Church should at all times conform it self to them.
And tho we condemn that Dissolution of all the Canons
which the Church and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath brought into
the World, yet on the other hand we cannot acknowledg
any such binding Authority in them, that they can never
be dispensed with.</p>
                     <p>The methods of those men with whom we deal, are
wonderful. Now they reproach our Church with a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ancient Canons; and yet when we lay to their
charge some of the Canons that their Councils have made
in these later Ages, such as those of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> for the
<hi>Extirpation</hi> of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and for the Pope's power of <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Heretical Princes;</hi> they tell us, that great difference is
to be made between the Decisions of the Church in the
Points of Faith, and the Decrees that are made in matter of
Discipline; since, tho they assert an Infallibility in the one,
yet the other are transient things, in which we ought not to
admit of so absolute an Authority. This is false with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Decrees, that declare a Christians Duty, or a Rule of
Morality: For Decrees in such matter do import an Article
of Faith or Doctrine upon which they are founded. And
therefore a Church may indeed, even in the Opinion of
those who believe her Infallible, err in a particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against such or such a Heretical Prince; for that being
founded on a matter of Fact, she may be Infallible still,
even tho she were surprised in matters of Fact. But she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Infallible, if in declaring the Duty of Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heretical Princes, or of the Popes Authority in
those cases, she hath set Rules contrary to the Word of
God. In such matters as these are, I do acknowledg the
Decrees of the Church are for ever Obligatory upon all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60978:10"/>
those who believe her Infallible. Therefore, since our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
urges so much the Authority of the Canons, I would
gladly know what he thinks of these, which are not,
I confess, <hi>Ancient,</hi> yet they were enacted by the Supream
Authority of that Body which they account Infallible. It
is true, some have thought they could get out of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
by denying these to be the Acts of that Council. But
if our Author be the same Person with him that writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Adoration of the Eucharist, he is of another
mind, and doth acknowledg,<note place="margin">Adorat of the Euchar. p. 28.</note> that <hi>those Canons are the true
Acts of that great Assembly, and not only the Designs of the
Pope.</hi> It is true, he saith, the sense of the Canon concerning
the secular Powers, is by Protestants mistaken. But he hath
not yet given himself the trouble of laying before us the
true sense of that Canon; and one would think that he
who writ the Treatise that is now under Examination, had
very favourable thoughts of the Doctrine of Subjects sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
off an heretical Prince; for he reckons up the <hi>many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
that were in K.</hi> Edwards <hi>days,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 139.</note> 
                        <hi>chiefly for matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
as a proof that the Body of the Clergy went not into
that change. <hi>Which rising</hi> (saith he) <hi>of the Laity in such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
for their former way of Religion, would not have been, had
not their Clergy justified it unto them. Rising</hi> is a soft word for
<hi>Rebellion,</hi> and one would think, that it would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no small matter of reproach against us, if we brought in
a company of Rebels to make up a Muster of our Religion.
But to own that <hi>the Clergy justified it to them,</hi> without
adding the least Word expressing our Author's dislike of
this, shews plainly enough, that how good a Subject soever
our Author may be to a Prince of his own Religion, yet
he thinks a Catholick <hi>Clergy may be able to justifie to the
Laity, a Rising</hi> against a Heretical Prince upon the account
of Religion. And it seems our Author had a great
mind to make a huge appearance of his Catholick Rebels
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60978:10"/>
in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> days. For, besides that he speaks of Risings
in many more Counties then are mentioned by the Books
of that time; he also represents all those Risings to have been
upon the account of Religion; tho the History makes it
clear that the Risings over <hi>England,</hi> were chiefly occasioned
by Parks and Enclosures, and that it was a rage of the
Peasants against the Gentry in most places; chiefly in the
<hi>Northfolk</hi>-Rebellion, where Religion was not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
nor doth it appear that any pretended Religion,
except those of <hi>Devonshire;</hi> so that our Author would make
his Party and the Clergy more Rebellious than indeed
they were. In this whole Period he seems to have been
forsaken of common Sense.</p>

that was raised so high at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</head>
                     <p>OUR Author hath brought together many Acts of
Parliament with their pompous Preambles, that
seem to carry the Kings Power in Ecclesiastical Matters to
a very Indefinite degree, and upon all this he triumphs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as if this was so improper, that it alone is enough to
blast the whole Reformation.</p>
                     <p>Our Author is much more concerned to justifie all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Bulls, than we can be to justifie all the Words of our
Laws; especially, the Rhetorick that is in their Preambles.
If he believes the Pope infallible, the general Parts of Bulls
that set forth the Doctrine of the Church, are such solemn
Declarations, that he must be determined by them. But at
lowest he believes the Popes to be the Centers of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60978:11"/>
Unity, and all Bishops are bound by Oath to obey
all their Decrees and Ordinances. Now, when our Author
will undertake to justifie all the Preambles of Bulls that are
in the <hi>Bullarium,</hi> then we may undertake to justifie all the
flourishes that may be in any Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>When any Authority is asserted in general and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Terms, these are always to be understood with those
Restrictions and Limitations that the nature of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
to be supposed even when they are not expressed. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> expresses the Obedience of Wives to their Husbands
in terms so extreamly extended, that as <hi>the Church is subject
unto Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>so ought the Wives be to their own Husbands in
every thing.</hi> He expresses also the Duty of Children in as
comprehensive terms.<note place="margin">Col. 3. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Children obey your Parents in all things.</hi>
Now if one would draw Inferences from the extent of these
words, he might, taking the liberty that our Author takes
upon some of the Expressions that are in our Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
represent the Authority that St. <hi>Paul</hi> vests both in
Husbands and Parents, as a very boundless, and a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
thing. This is enough to shew that in all those
large Phrases of Obedience, there are some necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
and Exceptions to be understood; and if this Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is necessary, even in writings that were inspired,
it is no wonder if some of the Rhetorick of our Acts of
Parliament wants a little of this Correction.</p>
                     <p>It is a very unreasonable thing to urge some general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
or some stretches of the Royal Supremacy, and
not to consider that more strict Explanation that was
made of it, both in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th's</hi> time, and under Q.
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> That were so clear, that if we had to do with
Men that had not resolved before-hand not to be satisfied,
one would think there could be no room for any further
cavilling. In K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s time, the extent of the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
was defined in the <hi>necessary Erudition of a Christian
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60978:11"/>
man,</hi> that was set forth as the Standard of the Doctrine of
that time; and it was upon this that all people were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to take their measures, and not upon some Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
either in Acts of Parliament, or Acts of the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
nor upon some stretches of the Kings Jurisdiction.
In this then it is plainly said, That with relation to the
Clergy, the King is <hi>to oversee them, and to cause that they
execute their Pastoral Office truly and faithfully, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in those Points, which by Christ and his Apostles was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them:</hi> And to this it is added, <hi>That Bishops and
Priests are bound to obey all the Kings Laws, not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of God.</hi> So that here is expressed that
necessary Reserve upon their Obedience, it being provided,
that they were only bound to obey, <hi>when the Laws were
not contrary to the Laws of God.</hi> The other Reserve is also
made of <hi>all that Authority which was committed by Christ
and his Apostles, to the Bishops and Priests;</hi> and we are
not ashamed to own it freely, that we see no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
upon our obedience to the King besides these: So
that these being here specified, there was an unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Declaration made of the Extent of the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;
yet because the term, <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that seemed harsh, there was yet a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Declaration made of this matter, under Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
of which indeed our Author hath taken notice; tho I do not
find he takes notice of the former, which he ought to have
done, if he had intended to have represented this matter
sincerely to the world, (which I confess seems not to have
troubled him much.) The Explanation made by Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
is so express, that even our Author cannot find any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against the Words themselves, but acknowledges
that they are such general Terms,<note place="margin">Page 87, 88.</note> that the Article it self
may be subscribed by all sides. Since then the declared
Sense of those general and extended expressions that are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60978:12"/>
in some Acts of Parliament, is such, that there lies no just
Exception against it; and since this Sense was not only
given by Q <hi>Eliz.</hi> who allowed such as took the Oath to
declare that they took it in that sense; but it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
enacted both in Convocation and in Parliament,
and put into the Body of our Confession of Faith. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
must be considered as the true measure of the
Kings Supremacy; and the wide expressions in the former
Laws must be understood to be restrained by this; since
posterior Laws derogate from those that were at first made.
So that according to all this, the Kings Supremacy doth
not <hi>give to our Princes the ministring either of Gods Word,
or of the Sacraments.—But that only Prerogative, which
we see to have been given always to all Godly Princes in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures by God himself; that is, That they should rule
all Estates and Degrees committed to their Charge by God,
whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with
the Civil Sword the stubborn and the evil-doers.</hi> This is all
that Supremacy which we are bound in conscience to own;
and if the Letter of the Law, or the stretches of that in
the Administration of it, have carried this further, we are
not at all concerned in it: But in case any such thing
were made out, it could amount to no more than this,
That the Civil Power had made some Encroachments on
Ecclesiastical Authority; but the submitting to an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the bearing it till some better times may deliver
us from it, is no Argument against our Church; on the
contrary, it is a proof of our Temper and Patience, and
of that Respect we pay to that Civil Authority which God
hath set over us, even when we think that it passeth its
bounds. But all that we are bound to acknowledg in the
Kings Supremacy, is so well limited, that our Author hath
nothing to object to it.</p>
                     <p>Our men of the <hi>Mission</hi> have always made a great noise
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60978:12"/>
of the Kings Supremacy, as if it were the most absurd
thing that can be imagined; without considering, that as
the Supremacy is explained by the Article of our Church,
it is practiced by almost all the States and Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi>
It hath been clearly made out by many of our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation,
were in possession of his Supremacy, and that they really
exercised it, even before they pretended so formally to it.
I will not enter into this Enquiry, which is so well laid open
by Sir <hi>Roger Twisden,</hi> that a man must have a great stock
of Confidence to deny it, after he hath read him. In <hi>France</hi>
all Ecclesiastical Causes are carried before the Courts of
Parliament by Appeals from the Ecclesiastical Courts, and
are finally judged there: Now the Supremacy is always
where the last Appeal lies, and we may see both in <hi>Godeau,</hi>
and many other modern Writers, how much they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of this as a servitude under which their Church is
brought, and as an infraction of all the Ancient Canons.
The Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris</hi> examines all the Bulls
that come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and condemns and tears them as oft
as they see cause: So that tho all the Bishops of <hi>France</hi>
are bound by Oath to obey all the Popes Decrees and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
yet this can take no effect till the Parliament hath
confirmed them. How easie were it to carry this matter
far, and to shew that by this, the Popes Power, either as
he is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successor, and thereby vested with a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Authority over the Flock of Christ, or as he is the
Patriarch of the <hi>West,</hi> and the Center of the Catholick
Unity, is subjected to the Judgment of a Secular Court,
who will not suffer the Sheep to hear his voice, till they
have first examined it. And what is the whole <hi>Concordat,</hi>
but a bargain made between the Popes, and the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> to divide the spoils of that Church and its Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between them; for whereas the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60978:13"/>
had established the Clergy in the Possession of its Ancient
Rites, <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> and after him <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>1st,</hi> saw
well how much this lessened that unbounded degree, to
which they intended to carry their Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they consented to give the Popes their share, so they
would warrant their enslaving that Church. It is known
what Complaints, and what opposition the <hi>French</hi> Clergy
have made upon this matter; yet at last they bear it, and
submit to it; so that here the last Appeal, the Check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Papal Authority, and the nomination of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Abbots of <hi>France,</hi> are wholly in the Civil Courts
and in the King. If it is said, that in some particulars the
Supremacy of our Kings goes further; tho that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be true, yet since the <hi>more</hi> or the <hi>less</hi> does
not alter the nature of things, it must be confessed, that
according to our Author's Principles, the whole <hi>Gallican</hi>
Church is in an Uncanonical State as well as we are: But
tho they do not stick to confess, that they are in a state
of oppression by reason of the <hi>Concordat,</hi> and of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
Authority of their Parliaments, yet they do not
think that this makes them irregular or uncanonical as to
the Constitution of their Church.</p>
                     <p>I might upon this likewise shew how not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> but even the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all its Bigotry, exercises still so great a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Ecclesiastical Matters, that there is only some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of degrees between that which belongs to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> by Law, and that which is practiced elsewhere.
The Court of the Monarchy in <hi>Cicily</hi> is well known, in
which by virtue of a forged Bull (which is made out to
be a Forgery beyond all contradiction) that declares the
Kings of <hi>Cicily</hi> the Popes Vicars; there is a Lay-man that
is the Kings Vicar-General, who is the Judg of that Court,
and to whom all Spiritual Causes are brought, and who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60978:13"/>
judges them all, as a spiritual Person, and that hath the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and outward Respect that is given to the Pope, likewise
paid to him. This is the carrying an Imposture very far;
yet, since it is done in the Virtue of a pretended Bull, which
the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> will still maintain to be a true one;
none hath ever opposed this to such a degree, as to pretend
that the whole Clergy of <hi>Sicily</hi> are become irregular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they submit to this Court, and appear before it. So that
upon the whole matter, If the great and unmeasured Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Papal Authority, made our Princes judg it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to secure themselves from those Invasions, by stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Jurisdiction a little too much; on the other hand,
those who have submitted so tamely to the one, have no
reason to reproach us for bearing the other Servitude; even,
supposing that we granted that to be the Case. And if in
the time of our Reformation, some of our Bishops, or other
Writers have carried the Royal Supremacy too far, either
in Acts of Convocation, or in their Writings, as those
things are personal Matters, in which we are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
who do not pretend to assert an Infallibility in our
Church; so their excess in this, was a thing so natural, that
we have all possible reason to excuse it, or at least to censure
it very gently. For as all Parties and Persons are carried by
a Bias very common to Mankind, to magnify that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which favours and supports them; so the extreams of
the Papal Tyranny, and the Ecclesiastical Power that had
formerly prevailed, might have carried them a little too
far into the opposite Extream, of raising the Civil Power
too high.</p>
                     <p>But after all we find, that when <hi>Theodosius</hi> came to the
Empire, he saw the <hi>Eastern</hi> half of it over-run with <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism;</hi>
and as the <hi>Arrians</hi> were in Possession, and were the
more numerous; so they had Synods of Bishops that had
met oft, and in vast numbers, and had judged in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60978:14"/>
Their Synods were both more numerous than that
of <hi>Nice,</hi> and were a more just Representative of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, since there were very few of the <hi>Western</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in that which was held at <hi>Nice.</hi> And as for the Frauds
and Violences that were put in practice to carry Matters
in those Synods, it is very like the <hi>Arrians</hi> both denied them,
and were not wanting to recriminate on the Orthodox. So
when there was a pretence of General Councils on both
hands; here was a very perplexed Case. But <hi>Theodosius</hi>
found a short way to get out of it; and therefore, instead
of calling a new General Council, or of examining the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the several pretended Councils, which ought to
have been done according to our Authors System; he pass'd
a Law, which is the first Law in <hi>Iustinians Code,</hi> by which
he required all Persons to profess that Faith which was
profess'd by <hi>Damasus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Alexandria;</hi> and yet this Law which was a higher Invasion
on the Ecclesiastical Authority, than any that was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our Reformation, was never so much as censured;
on the contrary, <hi>Theodosius</hi> was highly magnified for it.
There is no reason to imagine, that he paid any particular
Respect to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in this; for his joining <hi>Peter</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> with <hi>Damasus,</hi> shews that he made the <hi>Faith</hi> of
these Bishops the measures of that Doctrine which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to protect, not because of the Authority of their <hi>Sees,</hi>
but because he believed their <hi>Faith</hi> was Orthodox. The
Case was almost the same in <hi>England,</hi> in which it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that the Independent Authority of our Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
ought to be asserted, which was established by the
Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and that many Corruptions in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as for instance, the Worship of Images that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by two very numerous General Councils, one in
the <hi>East</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and another in the <hi>West</hi> at <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
ought to be reformed. If upon all this the Supreme
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60978:14"/>
Civil Authority of this Nation, had enacted such a Law as
<hi>Theodosius</hi> had done, commanding all to follow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
profess'd by the two Arch-Bishops of this Church, it
had been no other, but a copying after that Pattern, which
<hi>Theodosius</hi> had set us with the Approbation of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and yet it cannot be pretended, that our Kings and
Parliament acted in so summary a way; For they went
much more slowly and maturely to Work.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole matter, the Civil Authority hath a
Power to command every thing that is just and lawful;
and in that Case, the Laws that flow from it ought to be
obeyed. And if the matter of the Laws is sinful, we must
not indeed obey in that case, but we must submit and bear
what we do not like, and suffer where we cannot obey. So
that lawful or unlawful seem to be the only measures that
ought to govern our Obedience. And as in the matters of
natural Religion and Morality, no Body can deny that the
Civil Authority hath a full Scope, tho that is still limitted
by this, that there ought to be no Injustice, Immorality, or
Turpitude in the Actions that are commanded; but where
this is not, we are bound to obey all the Laws that relate to
those matters; and where it is, we are bound to submit and
to bear our burden, without giving our selves the trouble
to enquire, how far the Civil Authority ought to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in such matters. We set the same measures to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in matters of revealed Religion. If the King passes
Laws contrary to Scripture, we cannot indeed obey them,
because of that higher Authority to which we are subject,
and in Obedience to which we pay all Submission to those
who God hath set over us; but if they are lawful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Scripture, we ought to obey them without
examining, whether the King hath proceeded in the passing
such Laws by the Rules that become quiet and regular
Times. And if a <hi>Hezekiah</hi> or a <hi>Iosias</hi> should rise up, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60978:15"/>
finding the greater part of his Subjects, the Priests as well
as the People, engaged in Idolatry; if he should reform them,
and suppress that corrupt way of Worship, we ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of examining critically the method or steps by which
he had brought about that change, rather to rejoyce in the
goodness of God for blessing us with such a Prince. So that
let men men write and dispute as long as they will on these
matters, the whole Cause must be brought to this short Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
Either the things that our Princes and Legislators en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
at the Reformation were in themselves just and good,
and necessary, or not; if they were, then they having an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over us in all lawful things, as they did well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
these Laws, so we do well to obey them. But if they
were neither just nor good, nor necessary, then we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that as it was a Sin in them to enact them, so
it were a Sin in us to obey them: And all other reasonings
upon this Subject are but Illusions, by which weak minds
may perhaps be wrought upon; but they will appear to be
such evident Fallacies to men of Sense, that without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a strict enquiry of what may be alledged for
them, they will easily shake them off.</p>
                     <p>In short, if the Reformation appears to be a good thing
in it self, then all arguing against the manner of it, is but
meer trifling; and looks like men, who lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and to mislead People by false Colours of Truth.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Reflection on the eight Theses, laid down by our Author.</head>
                     <p>UPon the Grounds that have hitherto been opened, it
will not be hard to make a very clear Judgment of
all these positions which are laid down as the Foundation
of this Work.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60978:15"/>
                        <hi>The First is, That</hi> the two principal Offices, which the
Clergy have received from Christ, are, (1.) To determine
Controversies in pure matters of Religion, and to judg what
is Truth, and what are Errors, in Faith and Worship. (2.) To
teach and promulgate this Truth, and to execute Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
on those who receive it not.</p>
                     <p>All this is true; but since our Author doth not prove
that the Clergy are infallible in their Decisions, which is
not so much as pretended by any, with relation to Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Churches, this only proves, that it is the duty of the
Clergy to declare and publish the truth; but as the Body
of a National Clergy may err, so in case it should actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
err, can it be supposed that the People and the Prince
are bound to err with it? Synods are of great use for the
Unity of the Church, and a vast respect is due to their
Decisions; but since our Author names the Synods of the
<hi>Arrians,</hi> the many Synods that they had, which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
numerous, and were gathered from all parts, gave them
all the advantages from this Authority that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired;
so that if the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had not had truth
of its side, I do not see why the Visible Authority should
not rather be thought to lye on the <hi>Arrian</hi> side. The
Princes Authorizing a Synod, or his Opposing it, is to be
justified or condemned from the Decisions that are made
by it; if they are good, he ought to support them; and
if they are bad, he ought to oppose them; and in this he
must judg for himself, as every other man must do, the best
he can, as knowing that he must be judged by God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Second is,</hi> That the Clergy cannot make over this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to the Secular Governour, being charged by Christ to
execute it to the end of the World. <hi>Upon which he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
Two things;</hi> (1.) The Clergies binding themselves
never to make any Decisions in matters of Faith or Worship,
till they had first obtained the consent of the Secular Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60978:16"/>
(2.) The Clergies Authorizing the Secular Governour, or
those whom he should nominate to determine those matters in
their stead.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, no Clergy in the World can make any such
Deputation; and if any have done it, it was a Personal
Act of theirs, which was null of it self, and did not indeed
bind those who made it, it being of its own nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
but much less can it bind their Successors; but if
the Church of <hi>England</hi> never did neither the one nor the
other, what a Prevaricator and False Accuser is he, who
as he <hi>lied</hi> long to God and Man, when he pretended to
be of this Church, so resolves now to lye concerning this
Church as much as ever he did to it? The submission of
the Clergy related only to New Canons and Constitutions,
as the other Act empowering a select number to be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the King to form a Body of a Canon-Law, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only to the matters of the Government of the Church;
the Religion and Worship had no relation to it; so a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise
as to matters of Government is very unjustly
stretched, when this is made a surrender of the Authority
of determining and declaring matters relating to Doctrine
and Worship, which no Church-man without breach of
the most sacred of all Trusts can deliver up; but in the
matters of Ecclesiastical Policy, all States in the World
have felt enough from the Yoke of the Papacy to give
them just reason to assure themselves against any more of
such Ecclesiastical Tyranny; besides, that in all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
tho made in Terms that are general, such as are
all Oaths of Obedience; and in particular, those that are
made by Prelates to the Popes, exceptions are still under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
even when they are not expressed: As long then as
the Church enjoys a Protection from the Civil Authority,
she is bound to make returns of all engagements, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Submission, but of Obedience: But tho the one is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60978:16"/>
perpetual, the other has its limits; and when the Church
finds its oppressions from the Civil Power really to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the Protection that she receives from it, in that
case she must resolve to fall into a state of Persecution;
and all the engagements that any body of the Clergy
have made, relating only to the maintaining a peacable
Correspondence with the Civil Powers, they do not at all
bind up Church-men from doing their Duty, in case the
Civil Authority sets it self to overthrow Religion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
when both Religion, and the Worship, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of a Church is once established, the adding new
Canons may perhaps be of great use to a Church; but yet
it cannot be supposed to be so indispensably necessary,
but that rather than give any distaste to the Soveraign,
they may content themselves with what they have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
asking new Canons; and a Church under a Body of
Canons may likewise resign up the compiling of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a new System, and the leaving out such as are found
inconsistent with the Publick Peace, to such persons as
shall be nominated by the Prince; but all this, how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
soever the words may be, hath still a tacit exception
in it, which all that know the Principles of Law will
grant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Third</hi> Thesis is, That the Prince cannot depose any
of his Clergy, without the consent of the major part of the
Clergy, or their Ecclesiastical Superiors, and in particular of
the Patriarch.</p>
                     <p>In this the matter must still be reduced to the former
Point; Either the Grounds of such a Deposition are in
themselves just, or not; if they are just, the Prince may as
lawfully hinder any Church-man from corrupting his
Subjects, while he is supported by a Publick Authority, or
a setled Revenue, as he may hinder a man that hath the
Plague on him, from going about to infect his People;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60978:17"/>
for his deposing such a one is only the taking the Civil
Encouragement from him; but when this is done unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is without doubt an act of high Oppression in the
Prince; and as for the Person Deposed, and those over
whom he was set, they are to consider according to the
Rules of Prudence, whether the present Case is of such
importance, that it will ballance the inconveniences of
their throwing themselves into a state of Persecution; for
it is to be confessed that Church-men have by their office
an indefinite Authority of feeding the Flock, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be dissolved by any act of the Princes; but the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
this to such a Precinct, and the supporting it
by Civil Encouragements, is a humane thing, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
subject to the Soveraign Power. The Princes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
notwithstanding an express Law of God which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
the Priesthood, and the High-Priesthood, to
such a Family and Race of men, did turn them oft out;
and <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> sent to his Princes <hi>to teach in the cities of
Iudah;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 17. 7.</note> and with them he sent about also <hi>Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
who went about and <hi>taught the People:</hi> He did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
set up in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Court made up of <hi>Levites, Priests,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chron 9. 5, 8.</note>
                        <hi>and the chief of the Fathers of Israel, for the iudgment of
the Lord, and for the controversies among the people;</hi> and
appointed <hi>Amariah</hi> the Chief-Priest, to <hi>be over them in the
matters of the Lord:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he came to Reign,
commanded the Priests and the <hi>Levites to sanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
in order to the reforming the Worship,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29. 5.</note> in which he
went on, tho a great many of the Priests were not very
forward in doing it,<note place="margin">V. 34.</note> but he made use of those who had
sanctified themselves; and as he bore with those that
did this slowly, so no doubt he would have turned out
any that had been refractory; and finding that the
Priests could not be ready to keep the Passover in
the first Month,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 23.</note> he with his <hi>Princes, and the whole
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60978:17"/>
Congregation,</hi> put off the Feast from the <hi>1st</hi> to the <hi>2d</hi> Month.
Now the distinction of days, and the observance of those
Festivities, being so great a part of that Religion, and it
having been so expresly regulated by the Law of God, that
it should be kept on the first Month, a Provision being
made only for such as were <hi>unclean,</hi> or such as were on a
<hi>Iourney,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 9. 10.</note> that they might keep it on the <hi>2d Month;</hi> yet
here the Civil Authority makes a Law, appointing the
Passover to be entirely cast over to the <hi>2d Month,</hi> because
of the Uncleanness of some of the Priests. <hi>Ezra</hi> took a
Commission from <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> impowering him to set up
<hi>Magistrates and Iudges, who might judg them that knew the
Laws of his God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>and teach them who knew them not;</hi> and
one of the Punishments on the Disobedient, is <hi>Separation
from the Congregation;</hi> to which our Excommunication an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.
And we see what a Reformation <hi>Ezra</hi> made in the
virtue of this Commission. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> by virtue of such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commission, turned out a Priest for having married a
<hi>strange Woman.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nehem. 13. 28.</note> These were all as high stretches of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Power, as any that can be objected to our Reformation.
But in the next place, it ought to be consider'd, that, suppose
this turning out of the Clergy had been an illegal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
thing, yet that doth not strike at the Constitution
of our Church. The High-Priesthood among the <hi>Iews</hi> by
the Law of God, was setled on the eldest Branch of the
Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and it went so during the first Temple,
and likewise for some considerable time under the second
Temple; and yet, tho afterwards this sacred Function came
to be set to Sale, so that Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> hath reckoned up
fifty three that purchased it for Money, by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Merchandize one might infer, that those Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
High-Priests were no more to be acknowledged; yet
our Saviour, and after him St. <hi>Paul,</hi> owned them to be
High-Priests. Our Saviour answered to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> when he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60978:18"/>
adjured him upon Oath; and it is said by St <hi>Iohn,</hi> that
<hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as High-Priest for that year, prophesied: From all
which it is clear, that tho these wretched men were guilty
of the highest Profanation and Sacrilege possible, yet
that was a personal Sin in them; but since they were in
Possession of the Dignity, and adhered still to the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and performed the Offices of their Function accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Institution, the solemn yearly Expiation was still
made by them, which was the highest Act of the whose
Jewish Worship; and they were to be submitted to, and
acknowledged as High Priests by the People, for which our
Saviour's practice is an undisputed warrant. Now, if all
this was lawful under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> in which all the
smallest parts of that Religion were marked and enacted,
much more expresly than they are under the <hi>New,</hi> then
it will be a hard performance for any to perswade us, that
the Civil Authority may not make such Reformations in
the Christian Church, as the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> did in the
Jewish. In this matter, I have not so much as mentioned the
Orders and Regulations made by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> tho
they are very clear Precedents for justifying all that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
to which our Kings have pretended. But, since I
know some have endeavoured to set all this aside, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they being assisted by immediate Inspirations, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in those matters not as Kings, but as Prophets. Tho it
were easy to shew the falshood of this Allegation; yet,
since I would shorten matters all I can, I will not digress in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a controverted Point. Under the Protection that the
Christian Church received from the Emperors that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Christians, we see that they appointed <hi>Triers</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Matters that were objected to Bishops; and
these under <hi>Constantine</hi> judged in <hi>Cicilian</hi>'s Matter upon an
Appeal made by the <hi>Donatists,</hi> after it had been already
judged in several Synods. <hi>Constantine</hi> did likewise by his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60978:18"/>
own Authority put <hi>Eustathius</hi> out of <hi>Antioch, Athanasius</hi>
out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> It is
true, these Matters were much complained of, as unjust, and
as flowing from the false Suggestions of the <hi>Arrians:</hi> But
it is as true, that it was not so much as pretended, that the
Emperor had no just Authority to do it. For the disputing
the Justice of the Exercise of an Authority, is very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from their disputing the Authority it self. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a common Practice of the Christian Emperors
to have a Court of some selected Bishops, who waited on
them, and to whose Cognizance most Causes relating to
Bishops were left, who acted only by Commission from the
Emperor. I have enlarged a little upon this Point, because
it seemed necessary to dissipate many of those Prejudices,
which arise out of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> 4th <hi>Thesis is,</hi> That a Provincial or National Synod
cannot lawfully make Definitions in Matters of Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Heresies or Abuses in Gods Service, contrary to the
Decrees of former superior Synods, or to the Iudgment of the
Vniversal Church in the present Age, shewed in her publick
Liturgies.</p>
                     <p>This is founded on the Supposion of the Infallibility of
the Church; so if that is not true, then this falls to the ground,
and that is not pretended to be proved by our Author,
who seems only to proceed upon the Subordination that
is in the Ecclesiastical Body. But if the majority of this
Body is not Infallible, then that Obligation to submit to
it, must be only a matter of Order; and by consequence,
it hath its limits. If this had been the Rule of the Church
in <hi>Theodosius</hi>'s time, how could the several Provinces have
reformed themselves from <hi>Arrianism,</hi> after so many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils had declared for it, or at least had reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the word <hi>Consubstantial?</hi> but in our condemning the
Papal Authority over us, we had both the Council of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60978:19"/>
                        <hi>Nice</hi> for us, that had established the Independent
Authority of the Metropolitans, with the Bishops
of their Province, for all Matters relating to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and the Decree of the Council of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which
appointed all Churches to continue in the Possession of
that Independence upon any other superior Sees, which
was past Prescription. We had likewise superior Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
justifying us in many of the Branches of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>If we must seek the Sense of the Universal Church in her
publick Liturgies, then we have the Liturgies of the <hi>Greek
Church</hi> for us in many other Points; and the Corruptions
of the Liturgies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were so gross, that
they themselves have been ashamed of a great many of
them, and have thrown them out, tho a great many
more remain still to be reformed: And if the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
are to be considered as the Standards of the Sense
of the present Church, as no doubt they are, then all
those <hi>Expositions</hi> and <hi>Representings</hi> that are now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
on us, are to be thrown out of Doors, and we must
seek the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her publick
Liturgies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> 5th <hi>Thesis,</hi> That a Synod wanting part of a National
Clergy unjustly deposed or restrained, and consisting partly of
Persons unjustly introduced, and partly of Persons who have
been first threatned with Fines, Imprisonments and Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
in case of their Non-conformity to the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
in matters merely Spiritual; is not to be accounted
a lawful National Synod, nor the Acts thereof free and valid.</p>
                     <p>All this falls to the ground, if the Reasons upon which
such Persons were turned out, were just. And in that
case, such Vacancies may be justly filled. But it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
thing to found much on this, when the number
of those who were turned out, was so very inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60978:19"/>
as it was in K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s, and K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s time; and if
such a small terror as the loss of a Benefice is thought by
our Author so dreadful a thing, as it may be well judged by
the operation it had upon himself for 25 years, so that
this derogates from the freedom of an Assembly; then
there never was any free, even that at <hi>Nice</hi> not excepted.
For it is the same fear whether one is threatned with it
before such a decision is made, or if they knew that it
must follow upon it: Now this formidable business of
losing a Benefice, and a banishment upon the back of it,
was really the case of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> since this was
the condition of those who refused to subscribe their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition:
So the Principle laid down by our Author, taken
from fear, must either be false, or this will annul all the
Ecclesiastical Meetings that ever were.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sixth</hi> Thesis is, That the Iudgment of the smaller
part of the Clergy, even tho the Metropolitan were of that
number, cannot be called the Iudgment of the Clergy of that
Province; and a Prince that follows the Directions of a few
of his Clergy, cannot be said to be guided by his Clergy, but
to go against it.</p>
                     <p>This is very true; but yet <hi>Theodosius</hi> thought fit to give
his Sanction to the Faith of two Bishops, upon which all
the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party might have as justly said that he acted
against his Clergy, for they were then by far the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous:
The Civil Power is bound to follow those whom
they think are in the right; and tho in common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and in setled times, it is fit to leave things to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority;
yet if it is visible, that the greater number is both
ignorant and corrupt, and that the matters under dispute
are chiefly such things that are of great advantage to the
Clergy, both for encreasing their Wealth, and for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their credit, then the Secular Power hath just reason
to be jealous of the greater number of the Clergy, since
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60978:20"/>
Interest gives a mighty byass, and their following the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
number in such a case is very justifiable; for humanely
speaking, it were impossible to find the greater number
willing to go into such a change.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Seventh</hi> Thesis is, That tho Secular Princes had a
decisive Power in such matters of Faith as are no ways for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
determined, yet in such Points as have been formerly
determined, no Secular Prince can define any such things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to those Councils, or contrary to a National Synod.</p>
                     <p>It is not so much as pretended, that a Secular Prince
hath any Power to decide in matters of Faith, whether
they are already determined or not; but as for the giving
the Sanction of a Law, and all secular encouragements, a
Prince must have a Judgment of Discretion, by which he
ought to determine himself; for when he hath given his
Sanction, he hath made no sort of Decision in the matter,
which is neither more nor less to be believed than it was
before; but it is now become legal; and all Princes must
proceed in this matter according to the conviction of
their Consciences: It is not long since some of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Friends thought to have carried the King of the
<hi>Abyssens</hi> to change the Doctrines and Rites of that Church
upon the private suggestion of a few Missionaries,<note place="margin">Ludolph.</note> against
the whole Body of his Clergy, upon which that Kingdom
became a Scene of Rebellion and Bloodshed, till the King
himself grew to conceive a horror against those who had
push'd him on so violently to overthrow the Laws and
Establish'd Customs of that Church: So that a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
effected by the King's Authority, tho managed with
ever so much fury and violence, is yet driven on by these
men, when it is on their side, and for their advantage.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Eighth</hi> Thesis is, That neither National Synod nor
Secular Power can make any new Canons concerning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, contrary to the Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60978:20"/>
of former superior Councils, nor reverse those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made by them.</p>
                     <p>This is such a crude Assertion, that one would think
that he who made it, knew neither the History of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
nor the nature of Canons and Constitutions, which
are all variable, and are made upon such particular
occasions as required them to be put in practice;
and another Scene of Affairs may make it as necessary to
reverse them, as ever it was to establish them: The main
subject of the Ancient Canons are, Penitentiary Rules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Censure of Offenders, the Subordination of
Churches founded on the division of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
and the Duty and Behaviour of Church-men: Of these,
the first is quite laid aside in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by
their means we were so accustomed to be without that
Yoke, that we have not been able to bring the World to
it. But we have never repealed these, only we let them
sleep too long. The Second, relating to the Constitution
and the Subordination of Churches, is quite sunk with the
fall of the Empire; for if a Town that was the Center of a
Province, to which it was easie to have recourse by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and to which the Road and Carriages were regularly
laid, and where the Civil Government was also exercised,
should after many ages either be separated from the rest of
the Province, falling under another Master, or should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a poor and neglected Town, it is a needless adhering
to Ancient Custom, to affert still the Priviledges of such
a See, when all those Reasons which at first procured to it
those Priviledges, come to cease: As for the Third, which
are more perpetual, we pay them all respect, and have
never changed them; but the Dispensations of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath so destroyed them all, that it is a peculiar
degree of Confidence for any that are in Communion
with that Church, to assert such an immutability in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60978:21"/>
Ancient Canons, that a National Synod may not be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to alter any of them; and yet that one single Bishop,
whom all Antiquity considered but as a Collegue, and
Fellow-Bishop to all the rest of the Order, should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweed
an Authority to break and dissolve them all.</p>
                     <p>This may serve to shew how weak all those Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are upon which our Author builds. I come in the
next place to examine his Defective and False Account
of the Matters of Fact, which will engage me into a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
opening of many Particulars that will be little for
our Author's Honour; but no Discoveries will affect a
Man that could stifle his Conscience for 25 Years, and
that now hath the Impudence to own it.</p>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Oxford Theses,
Relating to the
ENGLISH REFORMATION.</head>
                  <p>IN the former part of these <hi>Reflections,</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
grounds on which our Reformation was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
were examined; the matters of Fact come
now to be considered; but before I enter upon
these alledged by our <hi>Author,</hi> I thought it fitting
to begin with an Enquiry into a very important matter,
relating to that time, that hath been lately objected to
our Church, by one of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which as
it is New, so it is likewise of great Consequence.</p>
                  <p>A Sheet has appeared that was well and decently writ,
and with a very specious appearance of Reason, to prove
that Q <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Bastard, not upon the common
pretence of the Nullity of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Marriage
with her Mother, because his former Marriage with Q.
<hi>Katherine,</hi> was still in force; but upon a Precontract,
in which <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was engaged before her Marriage
to K. <hi>Henry,</hi> which being confessed by her self, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60978:23"/>
was null of it self, and was judged to be so by Arch-Bishop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> whose Sentence was confirmed by the
Subsequent Parliament. So that here is a Nullity, and by
consequence a Bastardy. It is true, this Assertion is new;
so, tho it may raise the Credit of him that hath discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it since it must be confessed, that it looks very like
good reasoning; yet on the other hand, it is some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against it, that it doth not appear it was ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to us before now; and no mention being made of
it while the whole matter was fresh in Mens memories,
and while that Queen reigned, whose Title this seems to
weaken, much more than all the other things that were
alledged to shake it, is a great Presumption, that the
Men of that time knew there was no force in it. So that,
tho the Novelty of it may please, yet it is really a strong
prejudice against it. But after all, it must be confessed,
the thing is specious, and it is of great consequence, not
only with Relation to the Credit of our Church, and of
its first Reformation, but with Relation to our present
Establishment. For tho the Writer of that <hi>Sheet</hi> makes
no other use of it, but to blemish our Church, as guilty
of Sedition and Disloyalty, for owning a Bastard against
the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who was the next lawful Heir; yet
it will bear another Consequence that is more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in our present Circumstances. For as a Precontract
infers a Nullity of the Marriage, and disables all the
issue of it; so an ill Title in a Queen infers a Nullity
upon all her Laws, all her Acts of Government, as flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from an Usurper; and therefore this strikes not only
at the Honour of our Church in the last Age, but at its
Settlement in the present; and I believe this last is
chiefly aimed at. For, as to the former, it may serve in
a great measure to justifie our Church, that Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
was put in Possession of the Crown by the Nation, while
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60978:23"/>
it was yet Popish, and by the Body of the Clergy that
were of that Religion; so that all that those of our
Church did, was to maintain her in that Possession, in
which we found her, and in which our Enemies had put
Her. And it must be acknowledged, that an anxious
weighing of Titles, is not so necessary, after one is in
a legal and peaceable Possession, acknowledged by all
Parties within the Kingdom, as well as by all Princes
without it.</p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to say, That a Possession will justify
a bad Title, tho there is older Law relating to the
Possession of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> passed by King <hi>Henry</hi>
the VII. but an undisputed Possession does certainly very
much excuse those who acknowledge and submit to one
that is <hi>bonoe fidei Possessor.</hi> Which was plainly Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s
Case. But because it may be with great colour of
Reason alledged, that Right is Right still, and that Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
or Prescription are only pretences of Law, which
may have perhaps weight before a Judg; yet these are
not sufficient to extinguish a just Title, when matters
are examined in themselves, and abstracted from those
Pleadings that may perhaps be legal, yet as some will
alledg, are scarce rational. So I will examine this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as fairly, as, I must confess, it is stated by that
Gentleman, and will first propose the matter of Fact, as
Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath put it, who is the only <hi>Author</hi> that is
cited, and therefore he must be supposed to have some
Credit here.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Ann Bullen</hi> was attainted of Treason upon some
pretended Proofs of Adultery, and so Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
That she should be <hi>either Burnt</hi> (which is the Death
that the Law prescribes for the Traitors of that Sex) or
<hi>Beheaded.</hi> Two days after the Sentence, she is prevail'd
on to confess a Precontract before Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60978:24"/>
and so her Marriage with the <hi>King</hi> is declared void
and null, and in consequence of that the Issue is illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated;
yet this was so secretly carried, that one of the
<hi>Iudges</hi> of that time writes of it as a thing that was only
reported; and in the subsequent Act of Parliament, no
mention is made of a Precontract, tho no doubt she had
confessed it with the circumstances of Time and Person.
Yet in the Act of Parliament, it is only said, that she
had confessed some just and lawful Impediments, by
which it was evident, that her Marriage with the King
was not valid. It cannot be now known, how this
matter was expressed in the Sentence given by <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
all these Records being burnt. But it is most probable,
that the matter was more distinctly specified. Now the
only Reason we can give of those general Words in the
Act of Parliament, is, that this pretended Precontract,
being with the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> he had by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oath, and by his receiving the Sacrament upon it, in
the Presence of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and some others of
the Privy Council, denied any such Precontract. Of which
Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> assures us he saw the <hi>Original Attestation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>Earl</hi>'s own hand. This had so far invalidated
the <hi>Queens</hi> Confesssion, that it seems the Parliament
would not descend into the specifying of her Confession.
Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> hath also given several Evidences of her being
at that time so much disordered by Vapours, that this doth
in a great measure weaken the Credit of her Testimony,
even against her self.</p>
                  <p>Upon this whole matter then, there are three impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Considerations, which arises out of the Fact, and
any one of these seems, strong enough to overthrow all
the Inferences that can be drawn from that part of our
Story.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60978:24"/>
1. She was a Person condemned; now all the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Persons condemned, are by the Laws of all
Nations, only Presumptions, but not Proofs; the Terrors
of Death, and the Hardiships of a Prison, are such just
abatements, that Confessions so made, can never have
that Credit given them, as to found any Sentence upon
them; but in that Queens Case, there are two things
which give this General Consideration yet more force as
to her particular: The one is, That it being in the King's
Power to order her either to be <hi>Burnt</hi> or <hi>Beheaded,</hi> the
Terror of the former might carry her to say any thing,
that might procure her the softer Death: But the other
was yet stronger, it was a natural-enough Temptation to
her, to lead her to confess a Pre-contract, since by that
Confession she might hope so far to extinguish the Crime
for which she was condemned, as to obtain her Life by
that means: She was condemned for Adultery; now
the Confession of a Pre-contract might be drawn from
her, as a thing that dissolved the Marriage, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
acquitted her of the Adultery for which she was
condemned, since if she was never the Kings true Wife,
she could not be guilty towards him: So that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was perhaps represented to her, as that which must
certainly save her Life. And thus this Confession being
grounded on the fears of Death, and carrying in it the
hopes of Life, can be of no force in Law.</p>
                  <p>2. The bare Confession of a Pre-contract without any
other Adminiele or Evidence to confirm it, cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a just ground to dissolve a Marriage; otherwise Married
Persons when they grow weary of one another, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
their Marriage by taking a false Oath. It's true, in other
cases the Parties own Confession is strong enough in Law
against themselves, but in this case both the married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
being equally concerned in the Tie that follows upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60978:25"/>
it, the Confession of the one cannot dissolve the
Right that accrued to the other upon the Marriage; and
since two Witnesses are necessary in all such Cases, the
Confession of one of the Parties is, at most, but the
single Evidence of one Witness; and therefore <hi>Ann Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi>
Confession could not make the Marriage void: This
is further confirmed by the Denial of the Person with
whom the Pre-contract was preteneded to be made; if
her Confession gave such a Credit to the matter, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
her subsequent Marriage with the King, it ought
likewise to have annulled the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s
Marriage; therefore it could not be received in Law.
The other circumstances of it do also concur to weaken
its credit; it was so secretly carried, that one of the Judges
of that time, tells us only that it was reported, that she
had confessed a Pre-contract; so that it was not mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the necessary Forms of Justice; and it being
probable that some General Promise of Marriage had
passed between her and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> it is
not likely that she understood the difference between a
Promise and a Contract; so she might, especially in such
a Hurry, and under so much disorder, mistake the one
for the other.</p>
                  <p>3. But in the last place it is to be considered, that here
was an Innocent Child in the case, whose Legitimacy and
Right could not be cut off by her Mothers extorted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
Infants are more particularly under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law, and therefore Acts passed against them in
that state of Feebleness have such flaws in them, that they
have always a right to reverse them; so a single Witness
in such Circumstances as her Mothers were, could not be
sufficient to disgrace and disinherit her, and the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Act of Parliament that followed afterwards
might have been a forcible bar in Law to her, but could be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60978:25"/>
no just one; for as a Bastard is still a Bastard, even tho
he were Legitimated by <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament; so a lawful
Child is still what 'tis, notwithstanding a Sentence of
Bastardy confirmed in Parliament; and this is so true,
and was so evidently the Practice of that time, that even
King <hi>Henry</hi> in his suit of Divorce with Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi>
was willing to have his Daughter <hi>Mary</hi> declared Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
because Children begat in a Marriage, are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>bona fide,</hi> and so they ought not to suffer, because of
the secret fault of their Parents. And if this was yielded
in a Marriage where both Parents were according to the
Kings Pretensions guilty of Incest, it was much more
just in this Case of <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> even supposing her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contract
true; for her secret fault ought not to blemish,
nor ruin her innocent Child. Another Instance that fell
out at this time in the Royal Family, is very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and because it is little known, I fancy the Reader will
not be displeased to have it particularly opened to him;
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's <hi>Sister</hi> that was <hi>Queen of Scotland,</hi> did
after her Husband King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>4th</hi>'s Death, marry the
Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and by that Marriage she had a Daughter
Lady <hi>Margaret Douglas.</hi> Some time after her Marriage
she fell to be in ill terms with her Husband, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a Pre-contract he had given to another; and upon
this she sued him in the Spiritual Court; and it being
proved, the Marriage was annulled; but her Daughter
was still held to be Legitimated, and was entertained by
King <hi>Henry,</hi> as his Niece, and given by him in Marriage
to the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> of whom descended the Lord <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that was King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s Father; and
since he was considered to be the Second Person in the
Succession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> after the Queen of
<hi>Scots;</hi> this shews that by the Practice of that Time, a
Pre-contract even legally proved, yet did not illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60978:26"/>
the Issue that were begotten <hi>bona Fide</hi> by one of
the Parents.</p>
                  <p>And thus I hope enough is said to overthrow the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
that is made to the first Constitution of our Church
under Q <hi>Eliz;</hi> it was strangely put, and decently and
weightily writ, and therefore I have answered it with the
like Decency of Stile; so that if I treat the Author that I
am a going to examine, a little more familiarly, I hope
the Reader will not impute it to any roughness of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in me; for the examining of Matters of Fact or
Arguments from Reason, calmly and softly, without any
mixture of Sharpness, is a thing so becoming a man and
a Christian, that it is not without some Pain to my self,
that I find I must sometimes say things that seem too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere:
But on the other hand, when one finds he hath to
do with much unjust malice, he is carried to an Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that even forces him to a Style that would appear
too flat, if it were not a little sharpned, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
is so just: Yet I am so sensible that this Smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Expression is a thing that is rather to be excused
than justified, that I shall watch over my self, lest I be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
too far towards it; for I see there is occasion enough
given me by my Author to tempt me to it.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon the matters of Fact, I will take
the liberty to set down a <hi>Period</hi> of our Author's, which
shews him as great an Apostate from Loyalty to the
King, as he is from the other Doctors of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> He states the matter indeed as doubtful; but
the bringing of our Allegiance to the King to be disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
will be according to our Law, a matter of <hi>Premunire</hi>
at least:<note place="margin">P. 20. lin. 12.</note> His Words are, <hi>Whether in case that a Prince
use his Coactive Iurisdiction in Spiritual Matters, against
the Definitions of the Church, then the Pope hath not also
virtually some temporal Coactive Power against the Prince,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60978:26"/>
namely, to dissolve the Princes Coactive Power, or to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
others to use a Coactive Power against such a Prince
in order to the good of the Church. This they bring in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
but then as this last is affirmed by some of the</hi> Roman
<hi>Doctors, so it is opposed by others of them.</hi> This is in plain
English, that it is disputable, Whether a Pope may not
Depose an Heretical Prince, and give his Dominions to
another; some Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holding
the Affirmative, and others the Negative; so that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine of Probability, every man may
follow the Affirmative with a good Conscience; and this
being so invidious a matter, our Author's proposing it as
doubtful, without declaring himself against it, is a strong,
and even a violent presumption, that he himself is for it.
And yet these men boast of their Loyalty.</p>
                  <p>Our Author insinuates the Nullity of <hi>Ann Bullens</hi>
Marriage,<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> to which I have already given a full Answer:
But he supports it by two Arguments of his own making.
(1.) He says the <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament <hi>(28. Hen. 8.)</hi> says, that the
King was conscious of some Impediments why he could
not lawfully marry her. From which he seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
That the Reports of the Kings Familiarity with her
Sister, were true: But the Act of Parliament mentions
only the Queens Confession, and doth not say a word of
the King's knowing any such Reasons. (2.) He cites a
Clause of a Dispensation pretended to be granted by
<hi>P. Clement</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> giving him leave to marry again to
any Person, tho in the first Degree of Affinity, and tho
she were unlawfully begot; and to make this gain the
more Credit, he cites the Words in <hi>Latin.</hi> But there was
no such Dispensation either asked or granted, and this
pretended Dispensation was afterwards forged by Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi>
Enemies to defame her.<note place="margin">Hist. Reform. P. 1. Re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Bo. 2. n. 10.</note> The Bull of Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the King asked, is set down by Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60978:27"/>
among the Records that he gives us, in which there is no
such Clause; and it is plain, that whatever the King's se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
intentions might be with relation to <hi>Ann Bullen,</hi> that
yet he had not declared them, much less moved to
have any such extravagant Clause put in the Bull: For
in the Letter that the two Legates writ to the Pope, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him to grant the Bull, they reject that Imputation
that was cast on the King, as if he proceeded in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of an aversion to the Queen,<note place="margin">Ibid n. 24.</note> or that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in it by the Charms of the Person that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to marry,<note place="margin">Nam qui Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginae odio vel speratae, sec dum forsan notae, futurae conjugis ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cib<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>who, perhaps, was not yet known to him.</hi> This
way of Writing shews, at least, that it is false, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time the King had owned his Design for <hi>Ann
Bullen,</hi> much less that he had confessed Acts of Leudness
with her Sister; otherwise it had been too impudent a
thing for the Legates to have writ in this strain: So that
I had reason to say, That these were Arguments of our
Author's making; and in matters of Fact, this is the
softest Word I can find for them.</p>
                  <p>II. Our Author falls into the Common Error of Card.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Woolsey</hi>'s concurring with the King at first, in his Suit of
Divorce, and becoming afterwards averse to it, when he
discovered his Inclinations to <hi>Ann Bullen;</hi> but her two
Letters to the Cardinal, printed by Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> shew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
the Falshood of this Imagination.</p>
                  <p>III. He says a 100000 pounds Charges was demanded
by the King from the Clergy,<note place="margin">P. 22.</note> for the expence he had
been at in obtaining so many Instruments from the
foreign Universities, that had decided this matter; and
for the Sums that were given, he cites no better Authors,
than some Testimonies produced by <hi>Sanders.</hi> But the
falshood of this Imputation is so manifest, that it appears
by Dr. <hi>Crooks</hi> Letters and Accounts,<note place="margin">Cott. Lib. Vit. B. 13.</note> that are yet extant,
that he had scarce Money enough allowed him for his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60978:27"/>
own Subsistence; and as the small presents he made were
inconsiderable, being oft a Crown or two; so in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the King, he writes in these Words, <hi>Vpon pain of
my Head, if the contrary be proved, I never gave any
man one half penny, before I had his Conclusion to your
Highness, without former prayer or promise of Reward for
the same.</hi> By this way of Writing it is plain, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of his being instructed and furnished with Money
to corrupt Divines, he had positive Orders to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
nor is there any mention in the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that contains the Grant of the Subsidy of any
Expence that the King had been at, how boldly soever
it is asserted by our Author. But the citing of an Act of
Parliament had an Air of Truth in it, which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an unwary Reader.</p>
                  <p>IV. He pretends to lessen the Credit of the Decisions
of the Universities,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> since they had supposed that the
first Marriage with <hi>P. Arthur</hi> was consumated; of
which he doubts, and proposes the common Objections
against it, of <hi>P. Arthur</hi>'s Age, and of his dying soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Marriage. He also saith, That tho the first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
had been consummated, many Learned Men (of
whom he names only <hi>Fisher</hi> and <hi>Tonstal,</hi> and takes the
rest on <hi>Sander</hi>'s Words) thought the Pope might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
with it; and in Conclusion, he cites the Act of
Parliament passed in the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries</hi>
Reign, condemning her Mothers Divorce, in which
mention is made of the Corruption of the Foreign Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It is true, all the World believed that the first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was consummated, as appears by what <hi>Cajetan</hi> saies
upon it: But (2.) since our Author cites Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s
History of King <hi>Henry 8th,</hi> he must needs have seen in
him, as clear Proofs of a Consummation, as a thing of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60978:28"/>
that nature is capable of. (3.) Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s early
Death was generally imputed to his too early Marriage;
and the care that was had of the Princess after his Death,
the delay of giving the Title of Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to the
younger Brother, and the mention made of the Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of that Marriage, dubiously indeed in the Bull
for the second Marriage, but more positively in the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Brief, are all as strong Presumptions, as could be
brought, for proving a thing of that nature. (4.) <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal</hi>
concurred with the King in the Divorce, and in all
that followed upon it; so that our Author had need find
better Proofs of this, than <hi>Sander</hi>'s Word, otherwise he'l
hardly gain Credit. (5.) The Learned Men he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
come within a very small compass. For as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi>
was the first Author of that Opinion, so he had
very few followers in that Age; tho the consequences
of this Dispute hath drawn the current of the Authors
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion since that time, to follow
his Opinion. (6.) An Act of Parliament made by
<hi>Gardner</hi> and others, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Maries</hi>
Reign, who were the chief managers of the Suit against
her Mother, and who by this Act intended to make
their Peace, and their Court with her, is indeed a very
venerable Authority, and may very fitly come into the
same Paragraph with <hi>Sanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>V. He pretends that <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> were the
Authors of the Advice of the King's obliging the Clergy<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 25.</note>
in their Submission to own him for the <hi>Supreme Head
of the Church.</hi> It is true, he cites <hi>Antiqui Britt.</hi> for
this, and for another thing, that whereas the Clergy
desired to have qualified that Title with these Words,
<hi>In so far, as it is lawful by the Law of Christ;</hi> the King
refused this, and the Clergy granted it without that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction.
Here an Author is pretended; but if the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60978:28"/>
of this Treatise had examined these matters exactly,
he would have found by a Letter of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s to the
Convocation of <hi>York,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Printed in the <hi>Cabala.</hi>
                     </note> that the King had accepted of this
Limitation; and indeed the nature of things puts it in,
whether it had been set down in so many express Words
or not; and as for what is said here of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> it is
without ground, for he was then beyond Sea, imployed
in disputing concerning the Divorce.</p>
                  <p>VI. He says,<note place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Warham</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was a
favourer of Queen <hi>Katherines</hi> Cause. This agrees ill
with his owning that he saw the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s History,
in which he might have found <hi>Warham</hi>'s Deposition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath, in which he acknowledges, that he thought
the Marriage was neither <hi>honourable, nor well-pleasing to
God,</hi> that therefore he had opposed it much. And <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did set forward the Divorce with so much zeal,
that he procured a Writing to be signed by all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of his Province, declaring that they thought that
the Kings Marriage was <hi>Vnlawful;</hi> and in this he was so
earnest, that when <hi>Fisher</hi> refused to Sign it, he pressed
him vehemently unto it; but the other said still, that
it was against his Conscience, so he made another Person
subscribe in <hi>Fisher</hi>'s name, and set to his Seal to the Paper,
and pretended that he had <hi>Fisher</hi>'s leave to do it; which
he affirmed before the Legates, when the matter came to
be examined. So false is it, that <hi>Warham</hi> favoured the
Marriage.</p>
                  <p>VII. He pretends,<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> that the next step of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was the Submission of the Clergy, by which they
bound themselves not to <hi>Assemble without the Kings
Writ, nor to make or execute any Canons, unless the King
should by his Royal Grant Command them to make or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
them.</hi> But the Proof he cites for this, discovers his
Prevarication evidently. It seems he thought a careless
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60978:29"/>
Reader, seeing an Assertion and a Citation following
after it, would without reading the long Citation take
it for granted, that it agreed with the Assertion, and
without being at the pains to read it, would run on to
new matter. The Clergy did not bind themselves never
to meet without the Kings Writ. They only said, <hi>That
the Convocation had ever been, and ought always to be
assembled by the Kings Writ,</hi> which only shews what is
the regular Method of their Assembling themselves.
But tho this obliges them to meet always, when they
are required to do it by the Kings Writ; yet it doth
not bind them up from meeting, in ease the necessities
of the Church do require it, and that the King refuses
his Writ; for then they are reduced to these prudential
Considerations in the managing of their matters in a
case of Persecution. Nor did they bind themselves up
from executing the old Canons, but only from the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of new ones; which is very different from the view
that our Author gives of it, as was made out in the first
Part of these Reflections.</p>
                  <p>VIII. He fastens a very strange Inference on some
Words of an Act of Parliament,<note place="margin">P. 39.</note> as if they had amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this, That no Laws of the Land, nor the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
assumed by the King, had any thing of <hi>Heresy</hi> in
them. If by this is only meant, that the Laws then in
being were not Heretical, there is nothing extraordinary
in such a Pretention. For a Body in which the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power resides, will very naturally after its own
Orthodoxy; and the bare asserting it, will hardly be
thought a Criminal Attempt: But if our Author meant,
as probably he did, that by this a Declaration was made
for all time coming, that the Laws of the Land should
be for ever the Standard of <hi>Heresy,</hi> or sound Doctrine;
then this Conclusion will hardly be found in the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60978:29"/>
that he gives us for it; which is an Act, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
That the speaking against those <hi>Laws made
by the Authority of the See of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">25 Henry <hi>8th</hi> n. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>by the Policy of
Man, which were repugnant to the Laws of the Realm,
or the King's Prerogative, should not be judged Heresy.</hi>
This is an Inference worthy of the Sincerity of its
Author. In the Body of the Canon-Law, there are
many Laws made that destroy all Civil-Government
whatsoever, and that subject Princes wholly to the
Pope. There are also many Laws made relating to
Civil matters, <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia;</hi> but all to
be sure for advancing the Interests of that Court
from which they came. Now the Civil Courts in
<hi>England,</hi> were already in Possession of giving a
check to the Spiritual Courts, and of granting
Prohibitions upon their Judgments, even in Cases
of Heresy, when the Spiritual Courts had judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men Hereticks for <hi>Articles</hi> that were not Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy;
as <hi>Appeals</hi> lie for the like cases in <hi>France;</hi> so
that the Parliament made only a Regulation in this
matter, which is at this day practiced in most of all the
States of <hi>Christendom.</hi> Otherwise Civil Government
were a very feeble thing, if it could not preserve its
Members from the arbitrary Proceedings of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Courts. And indeed, if the Canons and Rules made
by the Popes, and such Synods as were absolutely
at their disposal, were the measures of Heresy, so that
Judgments ought to pass upon them, and that States
might not cover themselves from them by Laws;
we know where this must carry us, and how many
Bonfires must be quickly made in <hi>England.</hi> But
God be thanked, it is not come to that. I must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
add one thing, That if the Judgment of Heresy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60978:30"/>
had carried with it nothing but the Ecclesiastical
Censures of Excommunications and Anathema's, the
Church might have pretended that the State ought
not to meddle too much in it. But since Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
not only drew after it an Infamy in Law, but
likewise a Writ <hi>de Heretico Comburendo,</hi> according
to another <hi>Canon</hi> acknowledged to be in force by
our Author; then a State ought to have made
such Regulations in this matter, as were necessary
to protect its Members from such a Butchery. For
since the Civil Government is bound to secure the
Subjects, while they continue Innocent and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
from the Rage of all their Enemies; our
Legislators had betrayed their Trust, if they had
not put an effectual Stop to the Tyranny of the
Clergy. And thus it is plain, That this Declaration
made by the Parliament, was nothing but a securing
to the Subjects their <hi>Lives</hi> and Fortunes, to which
they had formerly a very doubtful Tenure, since they
held them only at the Discretion and Mercy of the
Clergy.</p>
                  <p>IX. But because our Writers have often alledged
the Laws made in former times,<note place="margin">P. 41.</note> Chiefly the <hi>Statute</hi>
of <hi>Premunire</hi> made by <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> against all
Bulls and Provisions from the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> Our
Author answers this very weightily, as he thinks,
by shewing us, That those Laws related only to some
special matters that were temporal Things; such as
the <hi>Titles</hi> to <hi>Benefices,</hi> or the <hi>Translation of Bishops
out of</hi> England, without <hi>the Kings consent;</hi> by which,
both the King might be deprived of their Counsel,
and the Treasure of the Kingdom carried away out
of it. But all this is trifling. For a Contest being
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60978:30"/>
raised concerning the extent of the Popes Power,
the Pope claims a degree of Authority to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to him by Christ, and that the whole Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Work belonged to him. Upon this the King
and Parliament set bounds to it. Now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
arises out of this, Whether the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that warranted them to determine against
the Pretensions of that Court in that one Point, did
not warrant them likewise to do it in other Points.
To a man of a clear understanding, the Matter will
appear to be past dispute. For if in one Point a
Parliament may contradict the Popes Declarations
and Canons, sure it may do it in another; and the
only Question then to be examined, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter of such Laws. For if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of those Laws is good, the Authority is certainly
good; and if the matter is not good, it is confessed that
an Act of Parliament cannot change the nature of
things.</p>
                  <p>But because this matter is better understood by
some Breves printed by Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hist. Reform. Rec. b. 2. n. 37, 38, 39.</note> it will be worth
the while to examine it a little more fully. That
vigorous Act of Parliament came out indeed in
the Reign of a feeble Prince, but the Popedom at that
time was in a more feeble State; and the adherence
of <hi>England</hi> to the Pope, who sat at <hi>Rome,</hi> was in
that time of Schism so valuable a support, that
those at <hi>Rome</hi> (it seems) thought it fit to take
no notice of it. But the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> had no
sooner heal'd that Wound, then the Popes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to have that Law repealed, and <hi>England</hi>
falling again under a new Feebleness in <hi>Henry 6th</hi>
Minority, and Factions at Home, and Losses in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60978:31"/>
                     <hi>France,</hi> having sunk the Reputation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
extreamly, the Pope laid hold of that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
and in his Letters both to the Arch-Bishops
and Clergy, and to the King and Parliament, he
Annuls the Statute, and requires the Clergy to give it
no Obedience, declaring all Persons that obey it, to
be <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunicated, and they should not
be relaxed by any but himself, unless it were at the
point of Death; and he ordered the Clergy to Preach
this Doctrine to all the People. He required the
Parliament under pain of Damnation to repeal it,
and he founds his right in the Commission that
Christ gave to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to feed the Flock. Here
sure, if ever, the Pope speaks <hi>Ex Cathedra;</hi> yet for
all this, the Parliament would neither repeal nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the former Statute. By all which it is plain,
that our Parliament did not think themselves bound
to be born down by big Words, and high Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
In this Dispute then, between the Spiritual
and Temporal Power, we see the Parliament judged
the matter; and by the same right that they judged
one Point, they may judg other Points; and if the
matter of their Judgment was good, their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was as valid under <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, or <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth. For
the Point being once yeilded, that the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may examine the Decisions of the Church,
then this may be certainly carried to other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
or applied to a greater extent of matter, as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discoveries of Truth, and new Provocations may
arise.</p>
                  <p>X. The Affinity of the matter leads me here to
make a leap over several Particulars,<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> which I will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60978:31"/>
review, and to examine that which our
Author hath thought fit to say concerning the
burning of Hereticks; only by the way I must take
notice of the unfaithful Recital that he makes of the
two Statutes made against Hereticks under <hi>Henry</hi> 4th
and <hi>Henry</hi> 5th; which he represents as if they had
merely left the Judgment of Hereticks to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
or Diocesan, without any thing else; by
which the Repeal of them must appear to be the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away that Judgment from the Spiritual Courts;
but there were other and more important Clauses in
those Acts, which gave the Parliament just Reason
to repeal them. In the former, the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
are required to be personally present at the
giving of Sentence against Hereticks; and after the
Sentence was passed, they were to receive <hi>them, and
there before the People, in a high place to be brent.</hi>
Here was the poysonous Sting in that Act, which
our Author was not faithful enough to mention;
and in that past by <hi>Henry 5th,</hi> all Magistrates were
required to take an Oath when they entred upon
their employments, <hi>That they should use their whole
Power and Diligence to destroy all Heresies and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
called</hi> Lollards, <hi>and to assist the Ordinaries and the
Commissaries in their Proceedings against them; and all
convict of</hi> Lollardy <hi>were to forfeit all the Lands that
they held in Fee-simple, as well as their Goods and
Chattels to the King.</hi> These were the true Motives
of repealing those Bloody Laws; which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ought to have mentioned if he had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to deceive his Reader; but when he comes
to examine the matter of <hi>Burning Hereticks,</hi> he does
it so softly, that it is plain he would rather lay us
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60978:32"/>
asleep than quiet us.<note place="margin">P. 78, 79.</note> First he begins with that
trifling Answer, That the Secular Laws, and not
the Ecclesiastical, do both appoint and execute it;
but if the Secular Arm is threatned by the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
not only with lower Censures, but even
with Deposition, and that by a Council, which he
acknowledges to be General, in case they do not
extirpate Hereticks, then this Extirpation is still
the Act of the Church, enforced upon the Civil
Power with a dreadful Sanction, which the Church
was Able to execute in those Ages of Superstition;
and thus the Guilt of all the Blood-shed upon the
account of Heresie lies at the Door of that Church.
In the next place he reckons up several Instances
of severe Executions against Hereticks both in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
and elsewhere, which were practiced not
only in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, but also under
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's; and were carried on chiefly
by <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Authority: Executions made under
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> are also mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
to which is added a Law made by King <hi>Iames,</hi>
adjudging men Traytors for being reconciled to
the Pope, or See of <hi>Rome; which is putting men to
Death for pretended Heresie, and to a Death worse
than Burning.</hi> But to all this I will only say,
That the Reformation being a work of time, as men
did not all at once throw off all the Corruptions of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so this being the received
Doctrine of the <hi>Western</hi> Church for many Ages,
that all Hereticks ought to be extirpated; if our
Reformers did not, so soon as were to be wished,
throw of this Remnant of Popery, it is rather to
be excused and pitied in them, than to be justified
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60978:32"/>
their Practice: <hi>Cranmer</hi> did also soften the Notion
of Heresie as much as he could, by reducing it to
a plain and wilful Opposition to some of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Apostles Creed;</hi> and if the constant
Clamours that the men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
raised against the Reformation, as a Subversion of
the Christian Religion, because some that had been
among the Reformers, advanced some monstrous
Opinions; if these, I say, carried our Reformers to
such a way of justifying themselves of this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by some publick Executions, they who gave
the occasion to this severity, which I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to justifie, ought not to reproach us for that
to which they <hi>drove</hi> our Ancestors. As for King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Law, I will not examine whether the Death
of Traitors, or the Burning of Hereticks, is the
more dreadful; it is certain, <hi>Fire,</hi> especially when
it is slow, is the most terrible of all deaths, and
that which gives the most formidable Impression; but
if the Provocation given to the King and Parliament
at that time <hi>by the Gun-powder Treason,</hi> be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it will not appear strange, if the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
after they had escaped so narrowly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all dangers, took a little more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Care to secure themselves against the like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
in time coming. And if the severe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> against Hereticks
had lain as so many dead Letters in the Body of
the Laws of their Church, as that Law hath done
in our Book of Statutes, they had had much
less Blood to answer for, and less guilt than lies
upon them at present. After these softnings, our
Author comes to pass his own Censure on the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60978:33"/>
of Hereticks; but the common Rules of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should have led him in the present juncture
of Affairs to have condemned it roundly, and so
to have laid our apprehensions a little; yet he saw
so plainly, that this was a practise so clearly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
both by Law and Custom in their Church,
that he durst not disown it in express words; and
indeed he understands so little, how a tender point
ought to be touch'd, that by all the Rules of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
he ought not to have medled with it. His
Discourse in this is an Original; and because I'le
do him no wrong in the manner of Representing
it, I will set it down in his own Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But whether this Law in it self be just; and
again, if just, whether it may be justly extended
to all those simple People put to death in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> days, (such as St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls <hi>Hereticis
Credentes</hi>) because they had so much Obstinacy,
as not to recant their Errors, for which they
saw their former Teachers sacrifice their Lives,
especially when they were prejudiced by the most
common contrary Doctrine and Practice in the
precedent Times of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th;</hi> and had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in such a condition of Life, as neither had
means, nor leasure, nor capacity to examine the
Churches Authority, Councils or Fathers, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
such Persons being only to be reduced
(as they were perverted) by the contrary fashion
and course of the times, and by Example, and
not by Argument, either from Reason or from
Authority; (and the same that I say of these
Laity, may perhaps also be said of some illiterate
Clergy); whether, I say, this Law may justly be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60978:33"/>
extended to such, and the highest suffering Death
be inflicted (especially where the Delinquents are
so numerous) rather than some lower Censures
of pecuniary Mulcts or Imprisonment, these things
I meddle not with, nor would be thought at
all in this place to justifie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a long Period of 208 Words, before
the Verb comes to close it; but there is small
comfort in all this; for even after our Author
hath put the Case with all possible Abatements,
and as soft as may be, of the ignorances, the strong
prejudices, and the numbers of the Delinquents, and
intimated his merciful inclinations only towards
the Laity, and some of the illiterate Clergy,
and that only with relation to Death; Fines and
Imprisonments, being left out of the Grace that he
would shew us; yet in conclusion he only tells
us, <hi>He will not meddle with this matter, nor would
he be thought at all to justifie it in this place; for
he is only concerned</hi> what we think of him, and
whether he justifies it or not; he only tells us
he would not be thought to do it; and yet lest
that seem too much, he adds a further Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he would <hi>not be thought to justifie it in
this place:</hi> So that he hath fully reserved all his
Rights entire to a fitter opportunity, and then he
well may, without the least Reproach, justifie that
in another place, which he doth not think fit to
do at present: Yet it seems he hath a very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
heart in matters of Grace; for this same scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
measure of Favour that he had clogg'd with so
many Reserves, is yet retrenched considerably in the
following Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60978:34"/>
                     <q>Tho some among those unlearned Lay-people,
I confess to have been extremely arrogant, and
obstinate, and zealous, beyond knowledg; and
tho they had suffered for a good Cause, yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for it on good or reasonable grounds, as
neither themselves, being any way learned, nor
pretending the Authority of any Church, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on any present Teachers, but on the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of their own private Judgment, interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture as you may see.</q> And here some
Instances are given; but if this Period will close
it self it may; for our Author, who seldom takes care
of such small matters, leaves it in this unfinished con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
I will not examine the truth of this Maxim,
but will only take notice, that since all Protestants
agree in this, that the Ground of our Faith is that
which appears to us to be the Sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our Author hath by this Limitation of his
former gentleness towards us, delivered us all over
to the Secular Arm; and so God have Mercy on
our Souls, for it is plain he will have none upon
our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>XI. He quarrels with the Privy-Council,<note place="margin">P. 57.</note> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning
of <hi>Bonner,</hi> because he said he would observe
the Injunctions that were sent him, <hi>if they were
not contrary and repugnant to Gods Law, and to the
Statute and Ordinance of the Church; the fault im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
here to him, I suppose, being that he refused
to obey any Injunctions of the King, when repugnant
to the Statute and Ordinance of the Church:</hi> But
since he had a mind to blacken that time, he might
have as well said, that they found fault with him
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60978:34"/>
because he promised to obey the Injunctions, if
they were not contrary to Gods Law; and that
thereby it appeared, that they preferred their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
to the Laws of God, as well as to the
Laws of the Church; and by our Author's taking
no notice of the first Branch of <hi>Bonner</hi>'s Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it may be inferred, That all his Concern is
about the Laws of the Church, and so they be
secured, he troubles himself little what becomes of
the Law of God: But if he had weighed this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as he ought to do, he would have found that
this Exception is very ill grounded. When a Form
of a Subscription is demanded, there is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the World, that will accept of one
that indeed signifies nothing at all; for it is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that a Subscription made with those Reserves,
signifies nothing; therefore if <hi>Bonner</hi> had acted as
became his Character, he should have directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the Subscription of such Injunctions, as he
found to be contrary to the Laws of God, or to
such Laws of the Church as he thought bound his
Conscience: But the Protestation he made, gave
a very just ground to the Government to proceed
against him according to Law.</p>
                  <p>XII.<note place="margin">P. 58.</note> Our Author intending to aggravate the
Proceedings against <hi>Gardiner,</hi> shews his great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in setting down the Article relating to the
Kings Supremacy at full length, whereas he had
only named the others; for he could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
nothing that must needs render all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to the King's Supremacy more visibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
than this doth, which is in these Words:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60978:35"/>
                     <hi>That his Majesty as Supreme Head of the Church of</hi>
England, <hi>hath full Power and Authority to make and
set forth Laws, Injunctions, and Ordinances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion and Orders in the said Church, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
all Errors and Heresies, and other Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Abuses; so that the same Alteration be
not contrary or repugnant to the Scriptures or Law
of God.</hi> This was no other than what <hi>Gardiner</hi>
had over and over again both by his Oaths and
his Writings advanced; and the restriction set on
it was so just, that one would think there lay no
possible Exception to it. Here there is no claim
to the declaring what were <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi>
but only to the repressing them; and this is done
by the Secular Arm, even where men are burnt
for Heresie: Besides, the Power, that according to
our Author, belongs to the Pastors of the Church,
is either founded on the Scriptures, or it is not;
if it is not founded on the Scriptures, there is no
great regard to be had to it; but if it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on it, then it it clearly excepted by the words
of this Article; so it is hard to see of what use
this is to our Author, unless it be to shew him
his Injustice.</p>
                  <p>XIII. He tells us,<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> That all that which had been
done under King <hi>Henry</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
by an equal Authority under Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
But tho I acknowledg he was both the Soveraign,
and the Parliament; yet there was neither Justice
nor Moderation in the Charge now made, equal to
what had been done before. A great deal might be
said concerning the Election of the Members of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60978:35"/>
Parliament, and the Practices upon them, and of
the turning out a Multitude of the Clergy before the
Laws were changed. The Disorders and Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Disputes had nothing of that fair Dealing
in them that had appeared in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time;
and whereas all the Severity of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days,
was the Imprisoning of three or four Bishops, and
the turning out some of the other Clergy; he knows
well how matters went under Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> So
that we cannot be denied this Glory, that a Spirit
of Justice and Moderation appear'd at every time
that the Reformation prevail'd. Whereas things
went much otherwise in this sad Revolution, in
which our Author Glories so much. So that if the
good or ill Behaviours of the several Parties, as they
had their turns in the Administration of Affairs, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
a just Prejudice, even in favour of the Cause it
self, we have this on our side as fully as we can wish
for.</p>
                  <p>XIV. He tells us,<note place="margin">P. 68.</note> That the Bishoprick of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was first kept void in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, and
last of all it was by Act of Parliament <hi>dissolved to
increase the Kings Revenue.</hi> If our Author had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the Records of Parliament, he would have
found that the Act that related to the Bishoprick
of <hi>Durham,</hi> did not at all propose the Increase of
the Kings Revenue, but the dividing of one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
into two; and the raising and endowing
of a new Cathedral Church, all which must have
risen to about Four thousand Marks of old Rents,
which considering how long Lands were let near
the Borders, did certainly very near exhaust the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60978:36"/>
whole Revenue of that See. This is indeed of no
great Importance to the main Cause. For if sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
Men went into the Reformation, hoping
to enrich themselves by it, this is nothing but
what falls out in all great Revolutions. And it
is plain our Author took up general Reports very
easily, that so he might make a Clamour with
them against our Church. But if some that gave
an outward compliance to the Doctrine of our
Church, were really a Reproach to it; he of all
Men for a certain Reason, ought not to insist on
it. Since we are no more accountable for the Duke
of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Actions, than we are for his
own.</p>
                  <p>XV.<note place="margin">P. 71.</note> He tells us, That the Bishops turned out by
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were Ejected, because the greater part of
them were Married; upon which he gives some grounds
to justifie that Sentence.</p>
                  <p>I will not here examine the Point of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of the Marriage of the Clergy. It is not
so much as pretended to be founded on Scripture;
and the Discipline of the Church hath been, and is
to this day very various in that Matter. But this
is certain, that a Law being made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
days allowing the Marriage of the Clergy, the
Queen upon the repeal of that Law, granted a
Commission to some Bishops to examine four of
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Bishops, and to try if they were
Married, and upon that to deprive them. This
was an Act of the Queen Civil Power; so that
the Deprivation, according to our Author's own
Principles, was done by Virtue of that Commission,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60978:36"/>
and was by consequence void. It was also most
unjust with Relation to the Civil Power. For these
Bishops having been married under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a Law that warranted it, that Law must
still justifie them for what was passed; and the
repeal of it, tho it might Impower the Queen to
proceed for the future against those of the Clergy
that should contract Marriage, yet it was against
all the Rules of Justice to deprive them by Virtue
of a Commission from the Queen, for an Action
that was warranted by a Law then in being. But
there was another more extravagant Commission
by which three other Bishops are represented as not
having behaved themselves well, and that as the
Queen credibly understood, they had both Preach'd
erroneous Doctrines, and had carried themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of God, and the practice of the
Universal Church. And therefore She orders these
Persons to proceed against them, either according
to the Ecclesiastical Canons, or the Laws of the
Land, and declare their Bishopricks void, <hi>as they
were indeed already void.</hi> Now our Author will
shew his great reading in an instance that cannot
be disputed, if he can find a President for such a
Commission as this is, in all History, or a Warrant for
it, among all those Canons for which he pretends
so much Respect and Zeal. And thus he hath, A
Deprivation of seven Bishops done by the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and without so much as the Colour of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                  <p>XVI.<note place="margin">P. ibid.</note> The second Reason he gives for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
was their not acknowledging of any
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60978:37"/>
Supremacy in the <hi>Roman-Patriarch;</hi> and here, as
elsewhere, he seems to plead for no higher Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Pope, but that of a <hi>Patriarch.</hi> But not to
repeat what was said upon this in the general Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
the acknowledging of that Power in the
Pope, would not have served turn. It was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of the Clergy, and would certainly not have
been accepted.</p>
                  <p>XVII.<note place="margin">P. 72.</note> Another Reason was their refusing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate
according to the Liturgies received, and used
by the whole Catholick Church, for near a 1000
years. There is some Modesty in this Pretension,
which carries up the Abuses no higher than a
1000 years. Tho, as to the greater part of them,
and the greatest of them all, which is the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Host, there is no just claim to the half
of that Antiquity. Yet if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
will give us the first 500 years, we will not be much
concerned in the 1000 that comes next. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
spake too wide, when he named the <hi>whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church,</hi> he should have said the <hi>Western-Church,</hi>
if he would have spoke exactly: And for
this Pretension to a 1000 years, any that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Missals that have been printed by <hi>Card.
Bona,</hi> and <hi>F. Mabillon,</hi> with the present <hi>Roman</hi> Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
will soon find that the <hi>Roman</hi> Missal of the last
Age, was far different from what it had been or
a 1000 years before. There is one Particular in
which indeed they seem both to agree, and yet
by which the change of the Doctrine of the Church
is very conspicuous in the so much disputed Point
concerning the Presence in the Sacrament. After
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60978:37"/>
the <hi>5th</hi> Century, that a sort of an Invocation of
Saints was received, by which, tho they were not
immediately prayed to, yet Prayers were put up
to God to hear us, upon the account of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession.
There are some Prayers in some Ancient
Missals that mention the offering up of that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to their Honour, and that pray God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it on the account of their Intercession.
Now in the Opinion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that considers the Communion, as a commemorative
Sacrifice of the Death of Christ, and as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Praise that is offered up to God upon it;
these Words bear a good Sense, which is, that to
honour the Memory of such Saints, their Holy-days
were days of Communion; and this Action is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be accepted of God, on the account of their
Intercession. In which there is nothing to be
blamed, but the Superstition of praying to God
with regard to their Intercession. But one sees a
good Sense in those Collects. Yet these very Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
are Nonsense, or down-right Blasphemous in
the present State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in which
the Sacrifice of the Mass is believed to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body and Blood of Christ, which are there of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
up, so as to be a Propitiatory Sacrifice for
the Dead, and the Living. Now to say, That
this is offered up to the Honour of a Saint, or to
Pray that it may be accepted by Virtue of their
Intercession, is the most extravagant and impious
thing that can be imagined. So that this change of
Doctrine hath rendred the Canon of the Mass, even
in those things for which they can pretend to some
Antiquity, both Impious and Blasphemous in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60978:38"/>
and Sense which is now generally received in
that Church.</p>
                  <p>XVIII.<note place="margin">P. 84.</note> Our Author censures a Clause in an Act
passed in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign,
in which it is declared, <hi>That in all time coming,
Doctrines are to be judged and determined to be
Heresies, by the High Court of Parliament, with
the Assent of the Clergy in their Convocation;</hi> as if
by this the Clergy could not pass a Judgment of
Heresy, without the Concurrence of the Parliament.
But Heresy being declared a Crime, that inferred
a Civil Punishment, the Parliament had all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Reason to make their own Concurrence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to a Judgment upon which many Civil
Effects were to follow. If the Judgment of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
went no further than Spritual Censures, then
this Limitation upon the Clergy might be blamed
a little. What is this, but what is practiced at
present in <hi>France,</hi> in which the Censure that the
present <hi>Pope</hi> passed in <hi>May</hi> 1679. condemning some
of the impious Opinions of the modern Casuists,
was declared to be of no force, because it flowed
from the <hi>Pope</hi> with the Court of the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> which
is not received in that Kingdom. And neither the
Bulls of Popes, nor the Decrees of Council are of any
force there, but as they are verified in Parliament, tho
their Parliaments come far short of the Authority of
ours.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60978:38"/>
                     <hi>as if this included all those Laws that were passed
by the Councils, in which Popes presided; since the
Canon-Law is composed of Synodal, as well as of
Pontifical Laws.</hi> In this we will freely own to him,
that since the time that the Popes have so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
the Bishops, as to make them swear Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

been made in Synods, composed of men so pre-engaged,

those Laws that passed before that Authority was

For, as for the first and soundest part of it, which
is <hi>Gratian</hi>'s <hi>Decree,</hi> it was only a Common-place
Book drawn up by a Man that was indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Age in which he lived, of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and good Judgment. But he was at that time
so ill furnished with all necessary helps to make him
judg a right of his Matter, that it is an impudent
thing in the Ages of more Knowledg, to pretend
to keep up the Credit of a Book that was compiled
in so dark, and so corrupt a Time. The rest is yet
worst, made up of Papal Constitutions, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of those ignorant and packt Assemblies, that
had met for the three Ages preceding the Reformation.
If King <hi>Henry</hi> had abrogated the Ancient Canons,
our Author might have had some Colour for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
But the total abrogating of that course Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation
of the Canon-Laws, which never was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on any good Authority, was so just a thing, that
there are very few Learned Men in the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
at present, that will not say it were well
for the Church if it were quite laid aside, since

now all men but such as our Author are ashamed
of it.</p>
                  <p>XX. Our Author writes as if he intended to do
Honour to the Memory of King <hi>Henry.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 93.</note> For he
cites these Words out of his Preface to his Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
<hi>Which Agreement of the Clergy for as much as
we think to have proceeded of a good, right and true
Iudgment, and to be agreeable to the Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God;</hi> He thereupon ordered it to be
published. An ordinary man would be upon this
induced to approve mightily of the King's method.
First to Authorize the Clergy to examine those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and after that, to review their Determinations
himself, before he gave his Civil Sanction to them.
Would our Author have a Prince rely blindly on a
National Clergy, which is subject to Error, as is
acknowledged by all the World? What Judgment then
can he follow but his own? The Civil Power must
be applied in matters of Religion, as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
on all hands, upon the Judgment of the Prince.
For he can follow no other, even in the Principles of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> except when he is determined
by an Infallible Court, which is only in a General
Council.</p>
                  <p>XXI. Among the other Exorbitances of the
King's Supremacy,<note place="margin">P. 9<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> one reckoned up by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is his taking away the Pope's Authority as
Patriarch, in confirming the Metropolitan, and his
requiring his Clergy, under the pains of <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
to consecrate into Bishopricks any that he shall
nominate: It is great Ignorance, or somewhat
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60978:41"/>
worse in our Author, if he will pretend that the
Authority of the Patriarchs over Metropolitans,
was of Primitive Antiquity; for by the Council
of <hi>Nice,</hi> every Province was an intire Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it self; if the Clergy is under some servitude
as to the promoting those nominated by the King,
the <hi>Pope</hi> is under the same to the King of <hi>France</hi>
by the <hi>Concordate;</hi> and our subjection in this Point,
does not bind our Consciences, but lies only on
our Persons and Benefices; and therefore when a
case of Persecution comes, we must resolve to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on a <hi>Premunire,</hi> and worse things too, if we
are pressed hard.</p>
                  <p>XXII. He adds to this another gross mistake in
History,<note place="margin">P. ibid.</note> intimating that the Suppression of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
was done by virtue of this Supremacy;
upon which he runs out into a long deduction of
many Particulars relating to that Affair; but this
is all so false, that the Supremacy was not so
much as once pretended in it; it went all upon
Acts of Parliament, and the surrenders of the
Monks: If the King acted violently and unjustly
in this matter, it doth not at all concern the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and much less his Supremacy; and as
for all the Topicks of Sacriledg and Profanation,
and the alienation of Things, and the violation
of Persons (Sacred), these are general and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
words, which lose their Horror, when it is
considered, That the vast endowments of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
were the effects of the Superstition of those
Ages, in which the belief of the Redemption out
of Purgatory, by the saying of so many Masses,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60978:42"/>
together with many false Miracles, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so far on the Ignorance and Credulity of
the World, as to draw the best part of the Wealth
of <hi>Europe</hi> into those Houses; when, I say, not
only the scandalous Lives of many Monks, which
were indeed but Personal Things, but their false
Miracles and Relicks, and above all, the falshood
of redeeming men out of Purgatory by their means,
were discovered, no doubt it was lawful to dissolve
all those Endowments, and to turn their Wealth
to better uses; and if the King did not enough that
way, it was so much the worse for him; but that
doth not at all blemish the Reformation. So that
all the long digression he makes upon this Head,
is impertinent to the business in hand, which is
the Supremacy.</p>
                  <p>XXIII. He says, That the Pope pretends no such
Power,<note place="margin">P. 108.</note> as to <hi>alienate the Church-Revenues for to spend
them himself, or to dispose of them in what manner,
or to what Persons he pleases; but only for some
just Cause, that is, in a prudential Arbitration, for
an equal or greater benefit accruing to the Church,
or Christianity.</hi> I do not know, if the <hi>D's</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
or a great many other Princes, that have been
raised out of the Patrimony of the Church, would
judg this to be good Doctrine; and if the Church
is always a <hi>minor,</hi> so that the Bargains made in
her name may be ever recalled, it would be hard
to find what <hi>Benefit hath arisen to the Church or
Christianity,</hi> out of the Robberies that Popes have
made to raise their Families; and it is a strange
piece of Impudence in these men, who are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60978:42"/>
always reproaching us with what some of our
Princes did in the time of the Reformation,
when all that put together, doth not amount
to the Injustices that have been committed in
one single Pontificate of those whom they would
have us look on as God's Trustees, and as Christ's
Vicars; if they are not concerned in those who
are the Spiritual Heads of their Church, much
less are we bound to justifie all the Actions of
those who are only the Civil and Temporal Heads
of our Church.</p>
                  <p>XXIV. He tells us that the <hi>Monks could not
give away that which they had only for term of
Life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 110.</note> I know not how this comes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by our Author, at a time when the
surrender of so many Charters to the King
hath been judged Legal, though it was made
by men who had no <hi>Title to these,</hi> and who
were so far from having a <hi>Right to them for
Term of Life,</hi> that they had only the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of them in an Annual Magistracy;
so that our Author had best consider how he
advances such Positions, lest he doth as much
hurt one way, as he thinks to do service
another. In a word, our Author hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cause of the Monasteries, and hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
the Suppression of them severely, tho
as he said concerning the burning of Hereticks,
<hi>he would not be thought to plead for it in this
place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XXV.<note place="margin">P. 111.</note> He accuses King <hi>Henry</hi> for giving
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60978:43"/>
Dispensations in matters of Marriage against Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Canons, and because he declared all
Marriages to be lawful, that were not against
Gods Law: Here, if in any thing, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> appears, or
rather their design to oblige the World to have
oft recourse to them, to pay them well, and
to depend much on them; they have prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
Marriage in many degrees, that were not
forbid by the Law of God; and to ballance this,
they have suffered Marriages to be contracted
in the Degrees forbid by God; for the Pope's
Power of Dispensing is promoted both ways;
they have added a new Contrivance of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Kindred; and as the Prohibitions that they
have set up were unknown to the Ancient Church,
so the Degrees that they have declared dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
were believed by the Ancient Church to
be moral and indispensable: And yet after all this
corruption of Ecclesiastical Discipline they are in
great wrath at the Reformers, because they thought
it was fit to return to the Degrees forbid by the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and to cut off these superadded
Prohibitions, which were inventions to bring
grist to that Mill, where all things were to be
had, so men will come up to the Price. There
follow here a great many Instances, in which
King <hi>Henry</hi> exercised his Supremacy, which our
Author aggravates all he can: But the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that were proposed in the first Part, seem ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to satisfie all the difficulties that can be thought
to arise out of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60978:43"/>
XXVI. He tells us,<note place="margin">P. 119.</note> that such of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
as complied not with the Changes made in
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days, were turned out after some
time; and names Bishop <hi>Tonstal, Wriothesly</hi> the
Chancellor, and the Earl of <hi>Arundel:</hi> and he adds,
That the King had but one Parliament, continued
by Prorogation from Session to Session, till at last it
ended in the Death of the King. Here are Matters
of no great Consequence, I confess: but these shew
how careless our Author was in examining the Story
of our Reformation: and how easy he was to take up
any Reports that might blast it. It will not appear
a very extraordinary thing to see Privy Counsellors
turned out, that do not concur with the Designs
that prevail. Some such things have possibly fallen
out in our own Time; and Men have no great
cause to complain of a severe Administration, when
this is all the Rigour that is shewed to those who
oppose themselves to the <hi>Tide.</hi> But our Author
was misinformed in all these Particulars. <hi>Tonstal</hi>
went along with all that was done, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to protest in Parliament against some Laws;
but as soon as they were made, he gave a ready O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to them; and continued to be still in the
Council, during the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Ministry.
<hi>Wriothesly</hi> was not turned out till after some time;
but immediately upon King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Death, he had
past an illegal Patent, upon which to prevent a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
Sentence, he resign'd his Place; but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
still to be of the Privy Council. And the
Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> continued to be of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
for many Years, and long after fell to be in ill
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60978:44"/>
terms with the Duke of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that an Enquiry was made into his Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he was fined 12000 Pounds. But it is
no wonder to find our Author mistaken in matters
of this Nature, when in so publick a thing as that
King <hi>Edward</hi> had but one Parliament in his whole
Reign, he hath not been at the pains to turn over
the Book of Statutes; for there he would have
found, that King <hi>Edward</hi>'s first Parliament was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April 1552;</hi> and a Second Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
was called, and opened the First of <hi>March</hi>
following, and was dissolved the last Day of that
same Month. So that there were two Parliaments
in this Reign, and the Second was dissolved by an
Act of the King's, and not by his Death. I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
these are not great Matters; yet this may be
drawn out of them, that our Author, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to have examined the Transactions of that
Time, with so much exactness, took things upon
trust, without giving himself the trouble to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into them so critically, as was necessary for
one that was resolved to pass a Judgment upon
them.</p>
                  <p>XXVII. He expostulates upon the Inhibition of
preaching put upon the Bishops,<note place="margin">P. 127.</note> except in their
own Cathedrals; which agrees ill with the Censure
that <hi>Fox</hi> passes upon them, as Dumb Prelates.
And after this there was a general Inhibition on the
whole Clergy, hindring them to preach, till a
Uniform Order of Doctrine should be set out; in
which some Bishops, and other Learned Men, were
then employed by the King's Order. As for this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60978:44"/>
Inhibition upon Bishops to preach, except in their
Cathedrals, it is a Fiction of our Author's, for
which he can give no Voucher; they were not so
much as restrained from giving Licences to preach,
much less to preach themselves over their Diocess. The
second and general Restraint, as it was but for a
very short while, so the Thing is very doubtful, and
stands only on <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Credit, who was too careless
a Writer to be appealed to in any Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
                  <p>XXVIII. Our Author cites here the Discourse of
<hi>Communion in one kind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 134.</note> which by all appearance is
that lately writ by the <hi>Bishop of Meaux.</hi> This
shews that the Author and the Publisher is the
same Person; though others pretend that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is dead many Years ago. But it seems the
Publisher thought fit at least to add some new
touches; and since he did that, he might have
thought it worth the while to have examined at
least the Records published by Dr. <hi>Burnet;</hi> and his
History it self might have been considered, as well
as Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylins.</hi> But since it seems
our Author thought the Discourse of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in one kind fit to be recommended by him, I
will take the liberty to recommend the Answer to
it in French by <hi>Monsieur Larroque,</hi> and that lately
writ in English, in which the disingenuity of the
Discourse mentioned by our Author, is laid open
beyond all possibility of replying.</p>
                  <p>XXIX. He tells us,<note place="margin">P. 135.</note> that the Veneration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
was defined in a General Council, <hi>the Second
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60978:45"/>
Nicene,</hi> which Council also justifies it by Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
That Council hath been lately sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by a Learned and Judicious Pen. It was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a General Council, nor did it justify what it
defined by Antiquity. The falshood of some of
their Allegations, and the Impertinences of the
rest, and the Inferences drawn from those pretended
Authorities, are all such extravagant Things, that
they give a just prejudice against every thing that
was defined by Men that were equally void of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and of common sense.</p>
                  <p>XXX. There follows from this to the end of
the Chapter, a long and laborious Vindication of
the Clergy in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time, in which our
Author endeavours, by many Instances, of which
some were mentioned in the <hi>First Part,</hi> to make it
appear that the Clergy at that time gave only an
outward compliance, that they acted against their
Consciences; that the Severity of that Time, tho
it went no further than to the ejecting them out of
their Benefices, who refused to comply; and to the
imprisoning of a very few, yet wrought so much
upon their weakness, and their love of Mony, that
against their Perswasions, they complied, both in
Subscribing, Swearing, and Officiating in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service. This shews our Author's sound and
good Judgment, that leads him to fancy, that he
hath by this Plea done any thing but blackned them
in the most infamous manner that can be imagined.
It had been much less scandalous upon them to
have owned that many of them were weak and
easy Men, ignorant and tractable, and so were apt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60978:45"/>
to be seduced; but that in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time they
return'd again to their old Persuasions. But this
would not have served our Author's turn, who
wanted somewhat to excuse his own treacherous
Compliance against his Conscience for so many
Years, even after he had all that Conviction, which
he owns in his Book. But if he hopes to excuse
his Crimes, by shewing that his own Church hath
produced in former Times, Men as black and as
criminal as himself, we do not envy him this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
He might perhaps have another design in
it, but of the same size of Sincerity and good
Judgment with the other. He no doubt fancied,
as many more perhaps did, that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> had many more such false Brethren as
<hi>Himself</hi> in her Bosom, who wanted only good
Colours and a fair Occasion to declare themselves,
and so as he had been preparing many Books, with
which he hoped to overthrow us, when ever the
time of publishing them should come; he fancied
this Representation that he gives of the Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Popish Party might offer to others
like himself some excuse for their dissembling so
long with God and Man, only that they might
enjoy the Profits of a Benefice; since it cannot be
so much as pretended, that there was any other
Temptation in the case. But God be thanked he
hath had few Companions in his Apostacy or
Treachery, let him choose which he will.</p>
                  <p>XXXI. Our Author cites a Passage out of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s,<note place="margin">P. 142.</note> written in her Brother's time to
the Privy-Council, in which there is a Period that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60978:46"/>
overthrows a great many of his Assertions. She
says <hi>that she was well assured, that the King her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Laws were all allowed and consented to without
compulsion by the whole Realm, both Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</hi>
Now if the former part of the Citation
he produces makes a little against the Changes in
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, the latter part is as strong in
the Justification of that which was done under
K. <hi>Henry.</hi> I cannot leave this without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of our Author's way of citing, which gives
the justest cause of Suspicion that can be. The
words he cites are, <hi>I have offended no Law, unless
it be a late Law of your own making, for the altering
Matters of Religion, which is not worthy to have the
Name of a Law,</hi> both for, &amp;c. <hi>and for the partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
used in the same.</hi> Now did ever Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Author put an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in such a place? I
have not <hi>Fox</hi> by me, from whom this is cited, but
I am sure this way of cutting a Sentence doth not
look fair.</p>
                  <p>XXXII. I pass over many Particulars,<note place="margin">P. 157.</note> which
are Repetitions of things that have been already
considered, relating to the Instances in which the
King's Supremacy was exercised. Only where he
complains of the restoring the Cup to the Laity,
as contrary to the Injunction of the Council of
<hi>Constance,</hi> I must acknowledg his Sincerity in not
pretending to carry the Violation of our Saviour's
Institution of the Sacrament higher than the <hi>15th</hi>
Century. We are not ashamed to own that our
Reformers thought it better to follow the first 14
Centuries, especially since our Lord's Institution
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60978:46"/>
was at the Head of them, then so late and so
treacherous an Assembly, that had overthrown all
the Confidence that can be among Men, as well
as it had sacrilegiously robbed the People of a Right
that was derived to them by our Saviour's express
Words.</p>
                  <p>XXXIII. He quarrels the Form of Ordination
set out in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Time,<note place="margin">P. 160.</note> because <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to all Antiquity that part was cast out, by
which a Bishop gives to Priests a Power to offer up
Sacrifices, and to say Masses for the Dead and the
Living.</hi> It seems our Author knows Antiquity,
as well as he doth the History of our Reformation;
otherwise he had never pretended that a Form that
is no elder than the <hi>8th Century</hi> was the Practice
of all Antiquity. This is so clear to all, who have
examined this matter, that it is needless to urge
it farther. The Silence of all ancient Authors, the
Form mentioned by the <hi>4th</hi> Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
by the <hi>Apostolical Constitutions,</hi> and by <hi>Denis</hi> the
<hi>Areopagite,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Rituals,</hi> printed by
<hi>Morinus,</hi> are such clear Proofs in this matter, that
I may well save my self a farther Labour.</p>
                  <p>XXXIV. He gives another Exception against
our Book of Ordinations,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>instead of the Oath
of Submission to the Patriarch, there was another
Oath prescribed to the Temporal Prince.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
must needs know, that the Oath which was
formerly sworn to the Pope, was a plain Oath of
Homage, such as Subjects swear to their Princes,
by which all Bishops were bound to the Popes, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60978:47"/>
to the Regalities of St. <hi>Peter</hi> as to their Leige Lord,
in the same form of Words, in which Vassals swore
Homage to their Superiour Lords, and it was no
wonder to see our Legislators change that into an
Oath of Supremacy to our Temporal Prince. In
the Primitive Times there was no such thing as
either Oath or Promise of Obedience to Superiours
in Ordinations, and it was not before the End of
the <hi>7th</hi> Century, that a Promise of Obedience
was requir'd, yet <hi>Charles the Great</hi> found ill Effects
of this,<note place="margin">Tolet. can. 10. §. 75. c. 13.</note> and so got it to be condemned by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Consent of the Second Council of <hi>Chalons:</hi>
And <hi>Radulphus Glaber</hi> tells us, that in the <hi>11th</hi>
Century an ill Custom was creeping in,<note place="margin">1040.</note> that none
was ordain'd Deacon,<note place="margin">Vita Gul. Abb. Dijon. c. 4.</note> till he had first sworn Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Bishop. Among the <hi>Rituals</hi> published
by <hi>Morinus</hi> in the <hi>4th,</hi> there is only mention of a
Promise of Submission and Obedience to the See, in
the <hi>9th Ritual,</hi> which he believes to be about 700
Years old; there is an Oath of Obedience indeed
to the <hi>Patriarchal See,</hi> but this is far from any claim
to Antiquity, since it is plain it did not begin to be
exacted, till the <hi>Popes</hi> began to raise their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
far beyond that of a <hi>Patriarch;</hi> and so this
Oath was soon formed to so high a strain, that no
Temporal Prince whatsoever had his Subjects more
strictly bound to him, than all Bishops were
subjected to the Pope as their Temporal as well
as their Spiritual Head, which will appear to
every one, who will give himself the trouble of
reading it.</p>

XXXV. He quarrels our Liturgy for leaving
the Oblation to God of the Holy Eucharist,<note place="margin">P. 162.</note> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
or impetratory of any Benefits for the
Living or to the Dead; contrary to the Belief of
former Churches and Councils. If by former he
means the Ages of Darkness, that had preceded
the Reformation, this we esteem no Reproach;
but if he will carry this matter higher, it is easie
to shew they had no other Notion of a Sacrifice
in the Eucharist, than such as we still retain,
which is a Commemoration of that one Sacrifice,
by which we were reconciled to God, and a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Praise and Thanksgiving upon it, which we
still retain, and according to the Spirit of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church we use the term <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And here
our Author betrays that malignancy of Spirit,
which he bears our Church in accusing us for some
Changes that our Reformers made in the Liturgy,
as if these had been such heinous things. Whereas
the Changes that the Roman Church hath made
have been of another nature, and they have so
altered all their Books of Divine Offices, that if
any will compare the <hi>Ordo Romanus,</hi> which was a
Ritual of the <hi>10th</hi> or <hi>11th</hi> Century, with the
<hi>Missals</hi> at present, it will appear how inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Changes that our <hi>Reformers</hi> made, are,
when compared to those of that Church. If any
will take the Pains to examine the Books of <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
that are collected by <hi>Morinus,</hi> he will see
that the Prayers, which in one Age were esteemed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60978:48"/>
the Forms of <hi>Ordination,</hi> came to be considered
in another but as preparatory Devotions. And that
the Prayers which in one time were only Blessings
after Orders given, were at another time looked
on, as the formal Words by which they were given
Since then all Churches, chiefly that of <hi>Rome,</hi> have
so often changed their Divine Offices, it is a very
unreasonable thing to reproach the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for having done it once or twice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>XXXVI. Our Author it seems thinks he hath a
privilege to reproach our Church,<note place="margin">P. 176, 273.</note> in spite of the
clearest Discoveries that can be made; so though
that Worthy and Learned Person that answered
his two Discourses concerning the <hi>Real Presence,</hi>
and the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> had from the
light given in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History, answered the
Objection he had made from the Alteration in the
Article of the Sacrament concerning the Presence,
a great deal of the Explanation that was made in
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Time, being left out under
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Yet it is clear, by the Original
Subscription, which I my self viewed in <hi>Bennet Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
Library, that all the Clergy were of the same
mind with those of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time; only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a prudential Consideration it was not thought
necessary to publish it; so that it was not cast out,
but suppressed. Common Decency should have
obliged our Author not to have mentioned this any
more, or to have answered that which had been
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60978:48"/>
said upon it. But it seems with the new Religion
he hath got, he hath received a most indelible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Impudence.</p>
                  <p>XXXVII. Our Author engages into a long enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
concerning the Articles of Religion that were<note place="margin">P. 187.</note>
printed in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath
indeed offered some Things, that seem to leave it
doubtful, whether they were agreed to in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
or not. But all this is a Matter of very
small Importance, if these Articles were not passed
in Convocation in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, we are
sure they were agreed too in Convocation in the
beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. And it is
no great matter to us, whether they are ten Years
older or later, that is, whether they were agreed to
in the Year 1552, or in the Year 1562. It is more
likely they were agreed to in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time,
for they were printed then with that Title; and
though Impostures are but too ordinary to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the baldness of a Title Page, yet things
are seldom printed, as flowing from such a publick
Authority, when it is known that they are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of a few Heads that would impose upon the
World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It cannot now be known from the Records
of the Convocation, they being all burnt; but it is
certain, that soon after in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
these Articles were ever looked on as the Work
of the Convocation in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time. Nor
is there any reason to think otherwise, for by that
time, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> said they <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> made, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60978:49"/>
were so filled, and the Clergy were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where so compliant, that there is no reason to
think that the regular way was not taken in a
Matter of this nature. As long as the Popish Party
was the Majority, our Reformers were obliged to
carry Matters by some selected Bishops and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
whose Propositions were enacted by the
Civil Authority: but when the Clergy was by
degrees wrought to give a more universal concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the Reformation, which was done before
the Year 1552. we have no reason to think that
the regular Method was neglected. But it is to
very little purpose to spend many words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a matter of small consequence, and in which
there is so little certainty.</p>
                  <p>XXXVIII. Our Author shews how dry all his
Concessions are in favour of the Civil Authority<note place="margin">P. 208.</note>
in opposition to the Papal Pretensions not only
for deposing, but even for assassinating Heretical
Princes, in these words. <hi>It shall here be granted
(as being the Opinion of several Catholicks) that no
general Council hath any Authority to make any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Law, which any way intrenches upon any Civil
Right: nor any Foreign Prelate hath Authority to
use a Temporal Power over Princes (when judged He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical)
to kill or depose them, or absolve their Subjects
from their Allegiance.</hi> The King is certainly much
obliged to our Author, who hath given him such
an Assurance, of enjoying his Crown and his
Life. For he grants it here as he said elsewhere
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60978:49"/>
he would not be thought to justify the <hi>burning of
Hereticks in this place.</hi> So here while he is in
<hi>England,</hi> he will condemn these treasonable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
The ground upon which he condemns
them is also suitable to the Condemnation it self.
For he says that this is the Opinion of several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.
This was modestly expressed. For tho
it is true, that several of those he calls <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
are of this mind, yet all Catholicks are not of it.
So that the Doctrine of murdering Kings, is at
least a <hi>probable</hi> one, and since the Decrees of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the deposing of Princes, fall
not only on those that are Hereticks themselves,
but even on the <hi>Fautors and Favourers of Hereticks,</hi>
I do not see how his Majesty's Life is secured.
For besides the Protection and Liberty that he
grants to Hereticks of his own Dominions, he
hath received and encouraged the Refuges of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince, which is to be a Favourer of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
of the worst sort. So that if <hi>Innuendoes</hi> were
in fashion, I do not see how our Author could
defend himself against an Indictment of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or at least against an Information. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
to let us see how wary he is in his Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as he calls them, ends the Paragraph with
another, <hi>It shall be granted here.</hi> For it is plain,
he will not loose an inch of all the Papal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
but will preserve them entire to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time.</p>

XXXIX. Our Author pretends that Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's
Supremacy was carried much higher,<note place="margin">P. 120.</note> than <hi>had
been granted by the former Clergy under K.</hi> Henry <hi>the
8th.</hi> The Allegation is false, for the Supremacy
was carried much higher under King <hi>Henry,</hi> than
it was under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who, as she would
not accept of the Title of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi>
so she explained her Supremacy, both in her own
Injunctions, and in the Acts of Convocation and
Parliament that followed, in so unexceptionable
a manner, that our Author himself hath nothing
to object to it. He seems also to infinuate, as
if the King's Supremacy were asserted by us,
as a Grant of the Clergy; whereas we pretend to
no such thing. The Civil Supremacy that we
ascribe to our Princes, is founded on the Laws of
God, on the Rules of Humane Society, on the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and on the Practice of the
Church for many Ages; and King <hi>Henry</hi> receiv'd
no new strengthning of his Title by the Act of
the Clergy, which did not confer any new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on him, but only declared that which was
already inherent in him.</p>
                  <p>XL. Our Author enters into a long Discourse
to prove the Invalidity of Orders granted in our
Church,<note place="margin">P. 2.</note> which he doth so weakly, and yet as he
doth all other things so tediously, and with so
much Confusion, that I have no mind to follow
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60978:50"/>
him in all his wandrings. He seems to question the
Authority of <hi>Suffragan Bishops,</hi> who though they
were limited as to their Iurisdiction, yet as to
their Order, they were the same with the other
<hi>Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proceedings in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time, were
too full of Irregularity and Violence, to be
brought as Proofs, that the <hi>Orders</hi> given by King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Book, were not valid. In a word, the
Foundation of that false Opinion of some of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was that ever since the Time
of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Form in which
Priests Orders were conferred, was believed to be
the delivering the Sacred Vessels, with a power
<hi>to offer Sacrifices for the Dead and Living.</hi> So
they reckoned, that we had no true Priests, since
that Ceremony was struck out of our <hi>Ordinal.</hi>
But the folly of all this is apparent, since
Men began to examine the Ancient <hi>Rituals;</hi>
and those which have been published by <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
shew, that as this Rite is peculiar to the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> so it was not received before the
Ninth <hi>Century.</hi> And since all <hi>Ordinations,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the first Eight Centuries, were done by the
Imposition of Hands and Prayer, then there can
be no reason to question our Orders, since we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
still all that the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>As for the common Observation of our <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
not being enacted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> before
the Eighth Year of her Reign, it hath been so oft
made and answered, that I am <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> see
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60978:51"/>
our Author urge it any further. Would he that
hath disputed so much against the Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
medling in Matters Sacred, annul our <hi>Orders,</hi>
because the Law was not so clearly worded, with
relation to that part of our Offices? The most
that can possibly be made out of this, is, that
the <hi>Ordinations</hi> were not quite legal; so that
one might have disputed the paiment of the
<hi>Fruits.</hi> But this hath no relation to us, as we
are a Church; in that the Book of <hi>Ordinations</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been annexed to the Book of Common-Prayer
in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Time, the reviving of
the Book of Common-Prayer in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Time was considered, as including the Book of
<hi>Ordinations.</hi> Though its not being expresly named,
this gave occasion to <hi>Bonner</hi> to question the validity
of them in Law. Upon which the Explanatory
Act passed, declaring that it had been the Intention
of the Parliament to include that in the Book of
Common-Prayer. So that this Act only declared
the Law, but did not create any new Right.</p>
                  <p>I have now gone over all that I judged most
material in this tedious Book. The darkness of
the stile, the many unfinished Periods, the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Repetitions, the many long Quotations to
very little purpose, above all the intricate way of
Reasoning, made it a very ungrateful thing to me
to wrestle through it. In it one may see how much
a Man may labour and study to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
For how unhappy soever the Author hath
been in his pains, it cannot be denied but he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60978:51"/>
hath been at a great deal to compass it. But a
Man that neither sees things distinctly, nor judges
well of them, the more he toils about them, he
entangles himself and his Reader so much the
more. So that never was so much pains taken to
less purpose.</p>
                  <p>If our Author gives us many more Books of this
size, both as to Sincerity and good Reasoning, he
will quickly cure the World of the Mistake in
which they were concerning him.</p>
                  <p>He passed once for a Learned Man, and he had
passed so still, if he had not taken care to let
the World see, by so many repeated Essays, how
false a Title he hath to that Reputation which
had fallen upon him. But it seems his Sincerity
and good Judgment are of a piece. Otherwise
as he could not obtrude on the World the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
concerning latter times, and the Ignorance
of Antiquity that appears in all his Books; so
when so many have been at the pains to discover
both his Mistakes, and his Impostures; He would
either have confessed them, or some way excused
them. But it is no wonder to see a Man that
dissembled so long with God, and that <hi>lied</hi> so oft
to him, serve the World now, as he did his God
for so many Years.</p>
                  <p>I pray God touch his Heart, and give him a
Repentance proportioned to the heinousness of
his Sins, by which he hath given so much Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the Atheistical sort of Men, who from
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60978:52"/>
him must be tempted to draw strange Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
And he hath certainly brought a greater
Reproach on that Church to which he hath gone
over, than all the Services he can ever render
them in his useless and confounded Writings, will
be able to wipe off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to whom sovever he hath been a Reproach,
our Church hath no share in it, since of him, and
of such as he is, we must say;</hi> They went out from
us, but they were not of us: For if they had been
of us, they would no doubt have continued with us;
but they went out, that it might be made manifest
that they were not all of us.</p>
