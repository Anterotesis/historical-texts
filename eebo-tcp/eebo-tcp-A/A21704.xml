            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this her Maieſtie likewiſe aſſureth all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that as of theſe vntruethes and falſhoods there was neuer conuention nor accorde betwixt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and the ſaide Earle, nor betwixt him and any her miniſters to her Maieſties knowledge: So was there not at all any conuention or pact, eyther by worde or wrytyng, made betwixt her Maieſtie and the ſayde Earle, for any thing, ſince his laſt comming into this Realme, although it is true that ſome motions haue ben made, aſwell by Therle of Lennox and the Ladie his wyfe, beyng, as it is knowen, parentes to the late murthered father of the prince, as by others, that if hereafter it ſhoulde be ſcene that the ſayde prince could not continue in ſafetie in Scotlande from thattemptes of the murtherers of his father, and other his mortall enemies, that then he might be nouriſhed in Englande vnder the cuſtodie of ſuch as nowe haue the charge of hym, and are knowen to haue moſt tender care of hym. But hereof was there neuer any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conuention or accorde, neither yet was there heard by her Maieſtie any worde of the Earle of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey, or of any in his company, to alowe of any remouing of the ſame prince out of Scotlande, or out of the charge of them that nowe haue the cuſtodie of hym. And likewiſe her Maieſtie aſſureth all maner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that ſhe eſteemeth all other reportes falſe, that are ſayd alſo to be made of any league and intelligence betwixt the Earle of Murrey and the Earle of Hertforde, with other ſuch like improbable falſe deuiſes and ſlaunders. All whiche her Maieſtie woulde haue to be of all honeſt perſons both Engliſhe and Scottiſhe that loue trueth and hate falſhood, to be eſteemed for falſe, and to haue ben ſediciouſly and maliciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, deuiſed, and publiſſhed. Finally, this her Maieſtie willeth all perſons to vnderſtande, that in this cauſe betweene the Queene of Scottes and her ſonne, there hath lacked no good meaning, nor yet doth, to haue had the ſame well ended with quietnes for the whole nation of Scotlande, and without any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the crowne of Scotlande, or to the dignitie thereof: The let and impediment of whiche good ende, her Maieſtie woulde all perſons to vnderſtande, not to haue come of her or her counſell, as hereafter ſhall more manifeſtly appeare.</p>
