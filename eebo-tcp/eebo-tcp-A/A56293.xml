            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>MADAM,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WEre it in the power of Muſick to abate-thoſe ſtrong Impreſſions of Grief which have continued upon me ever ſince the Loſs of my dear lamented Husband, there are few (I believe) who are furniſhed with larger or better ſupplies of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from this Science, than he has left me in his own Compoſitions, and in the Satisfaction I find, that they are not more valued by me (who muſt own my ſelf fond to a Partiality of all that was his) than by thoſe who are no leſs <hi>Judges</hi> than <hi>Patrons</hi> of his Performances. I find, Madam, I have already ſaid enough to juſtifie the Preſumption of this Application to Your Ladiſhip, who have added both theſe Characters to the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Qualities, which make You the Admiration of all that know You. Your Ladiſhip's extraordinary skill in Muſick, beyond moſt of either Sex, and Your great Goodneſs to that dear Perſon, whom You have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been pleaſed to honour with the Title of Your Maſter, makes it hard for me to judge whether he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more to the vaſt Improvements You have made in that Science, or Your Ladiſhip to the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he gain'd in the Profeſſion of it: For I have often heard him ſay, That as ſeveral of his beſt Compoſitions were originally deſign'd for Your Ladiſhip's Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the Pains he beſtowed in fitting them for Your Ear, were abundantly rewarded by the Satisfaction he has received from Your Approbation, and admirable Performance of them, which has beſt recommended both them and their Author to all that have had the happineſs of hearing them from Your Ladiſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94253:3"/>
Another great advantage, to which my Husband has often imputed the ſucceſs of his Labors, and which may beſt plead for Your Ladiſhip's favourable Acceptance of this Collection, has been the great Juſtneſs both of Thought and Numbers which he found in the Poetry of our moſt refin'd Writers, and among them, of that Honourable Gentleman, who has the deareſt and moſt deſerved Relation to your Self, and whoſe Excellent Compoſitions were the Subject of his laſt and beſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in Muſick.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Madam, Your Ladiſhip has every way the juſteſt Title to the Patronage of this Book, the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which, under the auſpicious Influence of Your Name, is the beſt (I had almoſt ſaid the only) means I have left of Teſtifying to the World, my deſire to pay the laſt Honours to its dear Author, Your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip having generouſly prevented my intended Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Duty I owe to his Aſhes, by erecting a fair Monument over them, and gracing it with an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which may perpetuate both the Marble and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Your Generoſity, which was too large to be confin'd either to his Life or his Perſon, has alſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf to his Poſterity, on whom Your Ladiſhip has been pleas'd to entail Your Favours, which muſt, with all Gratitude, be acknowledg'd as the moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of their Inheritance, both by them, and</p>

                  <p>WHereas this Excellent Collection was deſign'd to have been Publiſh'd ſome conſiderable Time before now, the Reaſon of its delay, was to have it as compleat as poſſibly it could be made, both in regard to the Memory of that great Maſter, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all that buy it. And to make amends to thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Ladies who ſubſcrib'd early to this Work, they will here find an Addition of above Thirty Songs more than were at firſt propos'd, which (conſidering the extraordinary charge of Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at this time) is an additional Expence to me, tho' I hope the Compleatneſs of the Work will recompence my Care and Trouble.

                  <p>But I am not ſo vain, as to attempt a Panegyrick on Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> nor to Expatiate on the ſeveral Excellencies of this Celebrated Author: Theſe are Subjects for the Sublimeſt Pens, and are already tranſmitted to Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But my deſign here, is to pay my Gratitude to Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> for the many Favours I have receiv'd; In a Preſent whoſe own Worth, is its Apology, and whoſe Native Graces will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it Acceptable. And to add, if poſſible to the Fame of <hi>Purcell,</hi> and Endear him more to the World: Which can be only done, by prefixing the Name of <hi>Mountague</hi> to His Works.</p>

                  <p>THe late Publication of theſe Excellent Performances in <hi>Muſick</hi> is ſufficiently aton'd for, by the Care that has been taken in the Collection of 'em; and I cannot but think I have made amends enough to the Purchaſer in the Choice of 'em. The great Charge I have been at; the Diligence I have made uſe of to obtain the Aſſiſtance of Friends, and the Dearneſs of Paper in which theſe Admirable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures are tranſmitted to the Publick. are ſufficient Excuſes: And I ſhall inſiſt upon that Subject no farther, Than that as I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways employed in promoting the encreaſe of things of this Nature, and contributed to the utmoſt towards their Encouragement, ſo I ſhall ſtill make it my Endeavours to go on with ſo Laudable an Undertaking. I might indeed make my Compliments in relation to the greatneſs of my Expences in being Beneficial to the Publick, and Expoſe ſome People that build upon my Foundation; but as I deſire the Readers Candour, it's my Buſineſs to make uſe of it in Reſpect to others, only I ſhall take notice, I have more than enough Diſcouragement to drop the purſute of Obliging my Country, ſince Foreigners meet with a reception that is inconſiſtent with the Intereſt of one, that has the Honour to be a Native. But let 'em Underſell me as long as they pleaſe, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant their Foreign Muſick into theſe Climates, the Judicious will be of my ſide, when they make an Eſtimate of Mr. <hi>Purcell</hi>'s Works, which are equal to thoſe of the Beſt Maſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> and conclude, that I, who have now made a compleat Collection of all his Choiceſt Performances, deſerve a better Entertainment from the Hands of the Publick, than any Pretenders whatſoever.</p>
