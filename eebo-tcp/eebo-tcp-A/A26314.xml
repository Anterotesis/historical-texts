            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere have been of late, ſtrange Clamors and Out cries, of horrid, bloody, and almoſt inexpreſſible <hi>Cruelties</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Papiſts in <hi>France,</hi> againſt the Proteſtants (that is to ſay the Calviniſts) there. The chief Incendiaries to which Cruelties (they ſay) are the Roman Clergy. The <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts and Jeſuits</hi> (if we will believe our own weekly <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>) inceſſantly preſs that <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prince, to redouble his alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy outragious Fury, and Tyranny againſt the Lord's People; <hi>Racks</hi> and <hi>Tortures</hi> are their daily Exerciſe; deep and hideous <hi>Dungeons</hi> their conſtant Habitation; and happy is he, that can eſcape into <hi>England</hi> with <hi>burning Match</hi> between his Fingers or <hi>red hot Iron Plates</hi> fixed to the Soals of his Feet.</p>
            <p>There is none per adventure more ſcrupulous of obſtructing Acts of Charity, or more compaſſionate to Perſons in miſery, (eſpecially on the ſcore of <hi>Religion,</hi>) then my ſelf; we can hardly do too much for thoſe who ſuffer for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> yet withal I confeſs, I am loath our Nation ſhould be impoſed upon, by <hi>Shams,</hi> and Cheats, on <hi>Religious</hi> pretexts; I am loath, I ſay, the <hi>Town</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould be incumbred; our own <hi>Poor</hi> deprived of Alms; the Bread eaten out of honeſt <hi>Tradeſmens</hi> mouths; and we made, as it were, the Sink of <hi>France</hi> by countenancing, and entertaining from thence, ſwarms of <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> amongſt whom ſome are <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> and others at beſt, ſuch Proteſtants as hate Epiſcopacy, worſe than <hi>Popery,</hi> and come hither upon no other Perſecution then what Idleneſs, beggery, or ſome miſdemeanor hath laid upon them.</p>
            <p>I would not here be miſunderſtood; it is moſt certain that the french Clergy have made ſeveral late <hi>Efforts,</hi> and deſired herein the Concurrence of their <hi>King,</hi> to bring back the <hi>Hugonets</hi> (ſo

            <p>Indeed they arrived here in a nick of time favourable for their purpoſe, and found us ſo actuated againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> as that we eaſily believed all whatever either they themſelves avouched, or <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> News-mungers invented for them. We were then in an hott purſuit of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> conſpiracy, and it was not to be thought, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who (as it was ſaid and ſworn) had both the Conſcience, and boldneſs, to raiſe <hi>Armies;</hi> To piſtol, poyſon, and ſtabb the <hi>King;</hi> To cutt the Proteſtants throats; To fire <hi>Cities,</hi> burn Navies, &amp;c.

            <p>Yet verily I am apt to believe, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> intereſt may often ſuffer Damage, by this precipitant way of proceeding. Men though in ſome things evil, may nevertheleſs in others, be <hi>falſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Where alone the bottom of the Engliſh <hi>Plott</hi> can certainly be found: I determined to make inquirie into the <hi>French</hi> pretended Cruelties, which conſiſting of overt, publique <hi>Acts,</hi> the certainty as to the Truth or Falſhood of them, might eaſily be known. And herein I promiſed my ſelf a kind of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that the right Knowledge of theſe <hi>Cruelties</hi> might bring me, as it were indirectly, to a right Knowledge alſo of the <hi>Plot;</hi> and that a circumſtantial Conjecture might rationally be made, of the one, by the other. For if the Malice, and Impudence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeemingly honeſt Men, could poſſibly be ſuch, as to concur in devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, telling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> printing, and publiſhing downright <hi>Lies and Fables</hi> of Racks, Tortures and Outrages, ſuppoſed to be <hi>openly</hi> acted (and by conſequence not to be denyed) by <hi>French</hi> Papiſts, in the Face of the whole World. It might well be, that the ſtrange and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Stories alledged againſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Papiſts [of vaſt <hi>Armies,</hi> huge <hi>Magazines</hi> (the Lord knows where, or from whence) num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs <hi>Patents, Letters, Bulls, &amp; Briefs,</hi> bloody <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Treaſons</hi> recommended as ſecrets, yet daily imparted to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of both Sexes, of all ſorts, and conditions, for divers years together; not any the leaſt appearance or footſteps of all which ever <hi>came to light;</hi> atteſted only by a few, and thoſe profligate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>For this Reaſon I made a moſt ſedulous, and exact Scrutiny, into the <hi>French</hi> Perſecution. I ſent Letters to ſeveral Friends in <hi>France,</hi> who I knew both could, and would give me true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. I diſcourſed with ſeveral Perſons of unqueſtionable credit, who had been upon the very place where theſe <hi>Tragedies</hi> were ſaid to be acted. Beſides, I was really aſhamed of the <hi>Kings Evidence</hi> (as they call them) againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the Infamy of their <hi>Lives,</hi> The Exorbitance, the Nonſence, the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of their <hi>Oaths,</hi> The Severities vſed on their ſole Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Reflections hereupon made by other <hi>Nations;</hi> gave me ſome trouble; and I almoſt wiſhed for the Vindication of my Native Country, to find a ſolid Proof of any thing done by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> in other places, might ſeem to counterpoize our late Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and look like the ſad Cataſtrophes practiſed by us, againſt them here; but I laboured in vain; the more I ſought, the leſs I found of truth in theſe pretended diſmal <hi>French</hi> Cruelties; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeared to me, (abating the forementioned efforts) could give the leaſt vmbrage of ground for ſuch rueful Stories.</p>
            <p>Yet I would not (though well I might) reſt here; I heard there had been a general <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> convened at <hi>Paris.</hi> I knew very well the ſaid Clergy lay under no reſtraint, which could hinder them from venting their malice, (if they had any) againſt Proteſtants; on the contrary, the rigours and cruelties which they ſhould expreſs, might ſeem the only means to ingratiate them into the Favour of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Pope</hi> (according to the vſual Idea, and Character we have of both.) They had now a fit opportunity, (if their <hi>Principles</hi> led them to it) to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, or promote <hi>ſanguinary Laws,</hi> and retaliate the Wrongs done (as they conceive) to their fellow Members the Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore now, (thought I) now, if ever, is the time for me to find out the ſpringhead and original of theſe <hi>French</hi> Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So then, I immediately ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> for all the Reſolves made, and Directions given, by that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb facs="tcp:66047:4"/>
to <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And in this I ſucceeded very fortunately; for juſt as my Letters arrived, there were printed, and publiſhed by the expreſs Authority, and Command of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the ſaid general <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> concerning <hi>Religion.</hi> Theſe <hi>Acts</hi> therefore coming to my hands, I not only read them for my own ſatisfaction, but have here rendered them into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the uſe of others, who not underſtanding the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Tongues, might yet have the ſame thoughts, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity with me.</p>

            <p>WHat was long ſince by the <hi>Fathers</hi> in the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Arles,</hi> well and wiſely ordained, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; That the buſineſs, for the performing of which they chiefly convened, being compleated, they ſhould then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their minds to other things which they might underſtand to be advantagious to the good of the Chriſtian <hi>Republick.</hi> The ſame alſo we, in the Name of the <hi>Gallican-Church,</hi> and and by Authority <hi>Royal</hi> congregated at <hi>Paris,</hi> have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to practice, and in this to adhere to the footſteps of our <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> Wherefore the affairs for which we judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to meet, being conſtituted, and tranſacted, we thought good that thoſe things ſhould be next procured, which might ſeem beneficial to the encreaſe and defence of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name. And becauſe in theſe three heads, as ſolid foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are wholy contained the peace, and ſtrength of the <hi>Church. Faith, Manners, Diſcipline;</hi> And in eſtabliſhing of them, the <hi>Father's</hi> of the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> placed their endeavors; We therefore to the ſame end, have bent all our ſtudy, that we might contribute our care and ſollicitude in illuſtrating of <hi>Faith,</hi> regulating of <hi>Manners,</hi> and corroborating the force of ſacred Diſcipline in <hi>France;</hi> leaſt by any Contrivance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that triple Cord, by the firm and wonderful context of which the <hi>Catholick</hi> verity is conſiſtent, may, by any one, be weakned or diſſolved. And ſeing amongſt theſe: <hi>Faith</hi> is the chief; and nothing brings a greater help to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, then if by the light of Truth, <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and by the Ardor of Charity, <hi>Schiſms,</hi> be overcome; we eſteemed it worthy our labour preſently to ſet upon <hi>Calvin's</hi> hereſy,
<pb facs="tcp:66047:6"/>
and to impugn it, as the main, and ſtrongeſt fortreſs of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> In this truly, the <hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> inclined, and <hi>vrged</hi> us.<note place="margin">2 Cor. v. 14</note> For when we beheld, not without a moſt ſharp ſenſe of grief, there was of <hi>one Church</hi> of Chriſt by the Schiſmaticks made <hi>two,</hi> contrary to what Chriſt himſelf taught by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who of <hi>Two</hi> had made <hi>One;</hi> we begun wholy to burn<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. v. 14</note> with deſire of <hi>Vnity;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing every one of us was daily more and more enflamed with theſe voices of Chriſt. <hi>Other ſheep I have which are not of this fold, and them muſt I</hi>

               <hi>bring; and there ſhall be made one fold, and one ſhepherd.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the life and manners of <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> excited us, which are ſo compoſed to the Form of the Antient, and more auſtere Diſcipline, that the Adverſaries of our Faith, ought not to refuſe to agree with him in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe deeds they confeſs, if they will ſpeak true, they muſt wiſh to imitate. Laſtly, <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> man his daily Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits towards the <hi>Church,</hi> yea rather his wonders of <hi>Royal</hi> Fortitude, and Chriſtian piety hath ſtirred up, and augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented our courage, who as many <hi>Heretical</hi> Cities as within the Limits of <hi>France,</hi> he hath reduced to the <hi>antient Faith</hi> of our Forefathers, ſo many unbloody Victories hath he purchaſed to his <hi>Mother Church,</hi> a Son, as well in Birth, as Virtue, the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> his Brethren after a long <hi>divorſe</hi> being partly by entreaty, partly by good deeds, reconciled to the common <hi>Parent</hi> of all. Moved by theſe Examples, and only not conſcious to our ſelves of negligence, in performing our <hi>paſtoral</hi> Charge, we have at length applyed our ſelves to the impugning of <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But ſeing we underſtood this Warr to be ſuch, as ought to be waged with the weapons of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; to be managed in the ſole <hi>Peace of Chriſt</hi> our Lord; we determined not to uſe <hi>Threats;</hi> not to caſt <hi>Terrors;</hi> not to ſtrive with Contumelies, but by Exhortations, Wiſhes, Prayers, to invite our Adverſaries, and bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. For although we are not ignorant, it hath ſometimes happened that thoſe who had refuſed to be drawn by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mercy, were compelled, as it were, by the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Rigour of Charity; yet we thought it both more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and agreeable to the Chriſtian Society which is amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:66047:6"/>
us; and to the Affection of our <hi>Catholick Mother,</hi> that thoſe who have fled from the Boſome of <hi>Apoſtolical Peace,</hi> ſhould by Paternal admonitions be recalled. And truly hitherto the unwilling, and above what what can be expreſſed, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt by a ſevere, but yet legitimate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had <note n="*" place="margin">(<hi>viz.</hi>) By ſpiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>diſſinherited, exauthorized, proſcribed,</hi> voluntary Exiles, as degenerate Sons, renegade Soldiers, rebellious Citizens; but now at laſt by our voice it ſpeaks to the diſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited, the exauthorized, the proſcribed; and lovingly ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits them who have already too long ſuſtained the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bitter <note n="*" place="margin">Through <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
               </note> Exile; and with a <hi>Maternal</hi> affection and deſire treats with them of <hi>correction,</hi> of <hi>Return,</hi> of <hi>Concord,</hi> which if they would have retained, then when they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us, ſhe, for her common Piety to all her Children, would never have <hi>broken.</hi> Wherefore we admoniſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, with all the weight of Charity inclining to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of <hi>Peace,</hi> that they return to us. We ask again and again, why they have departed? why they have forſaken <hi>Catholick vnity?</hi> we give them to underſtand how eaſie it will be, the wound of <hi>Schiſm</hi> once healed, to cure the reſt, which ſhall ſeem to want a Medicine. And we farther promiſe, if they will ſeriouſly grow wiſe again, they ſhall be received by us, even with ſome, as it were, inconvenience to our <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi> And leaſt peradventure they may take an occaſion of flattering themſelves, and their adherents, with a vain Hope of future Diſſunion amongſt us, for that there have lately riſen ſome Differences between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, we thought fit to advertiſe them; firſt, That it is not about the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which ever was one, and the ſame in both places; nor about the inſtitutions of manners, which both <hi>Churches</hi> in each place will have moſt pure and refined; but about ſome <hi>Matters of Diſcipline,</hi> alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by time, concerning which we contend with the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the chief Biſhop,</hi> the Peace of fraternal Charity ſtill remaining. Beſides, things may be diſputed by <hi>Catholicks</hi> againſt <hi>Catholicks</hi> without danger of harm, ſo it be done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Chriſtian way, and manner, within the Bowels of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not <hi>renting</hi> her Womb.

For by how much the more moderate and <hi>amicable</hi> our Conteſt ſhall be, with ſo much the more confidence may we reprove <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and denounce them guilty of breaking <hi>Unity,</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Church;</hi> Becauſe ſeing we are often, though unwillingly, brought to that exigence, that we muſt act, ſometimes in making complaints to the <hi>Roman Biſhop,</hi> ſometimes in vindicating the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Kingdom, or <hi>Priviledges</hi> of our Church; we have hitherto comported our ſelves with that Moderation, Reverence, Religion, in debating, and deciding any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that we have not cauſed even the leaſt ſuſpicion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing Charity; much leſs have we afforded a place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or given Occaſion for divorce. And this is the whole Model of our Deſign for recalling of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> to <hi>Concord,</hi> and the ſame drawn according to the Pattern of the <hi>Affrican Church:</hi> For as thoſe Fathers received from our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> the means whereby they more eaſily overthrew the <hi>Herſies</hi> of old, growing up amongſt them; ſo we by their Example, at this time reaſſume the means whereby we may defend our <hi>Sanctions</hi> againſt the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of theſe Days; which that it may be perfected, according to our, as well as your deſire, we again and again beſeech you, and for that Ardor of Charity wherewith, together with us, you are enflamed towards the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, we expect you will, as ſoon as you ſhall receive theſe Letters, and a Copy of <hi>this Admonition to Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>

            <head>MEMOIRES Containing the different Methods which may very profitably be vs'd for the Converſion of thoſe who profeſs the pretended Reformed RELIGION.</head>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1, Method.</note>THe firſt <hi>Method</hi> is that which Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> made uſe of to reduce by way of diſpute, or conference thoſe of the <hi>pretended reformed Religion,</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them to reunite themſelves to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Method</hi> is to regain them by their own Decree of the Synod of <hi>Chareaton</hi>—1631. By which they received to their Communion thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> who hold the <hi>Real Preſence of Chriſts Body in the Euchariſt,</hi> and many other Articles, much different from the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> of the pretended Reformed: Whereupon the Miniſter <hi>Daillie</hi> ſaith, in his Apology, that if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> held no other Error, than this, they ſhould have no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subject of <hi>ſeperating</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>But it is certain that all the other Points of our Belief which are in controverſie, are not more important, nor more hard to believe than this, which hath always been eſteemed by themſelves one of the Principal Grounds of their <hi>ſeperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and that at which the People take greateſt offence. For that which <hi>Daille,</hi> to elude the force of this inſtance, ſaith, that the <hi>Lutherans admit not the Adoration of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> is altogether unreaſonable, ſince <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf herein reprehendeth the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> And is obliged to acknowledge, that <hi>Adoration</hi> is a neceſſary ſequel of the <hi>Real Preſence; What is more ſtrange,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>then to place him in Bread; and yet not to Adore him there? And if Jeſus Chriſt be in the Bread, 'tis then vnder the Bread he ought to be adored.</hi>

            <p>Seing then according to the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in that <hi>Synod,</hi> the Fundamentals of Salvation are not deſtroyed in believing the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> and other points of their Confeſſion of Faith which are in diſpute with them. This <hi>Cardinal</hi> would convince them, that it is unjuſt, they ſhould ſeperate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in which according to their own <hi>Principles</hi> they may be <hi>ſav'd.</hi>

The ſecond <hi>Method</hi> is to ſuggeſt to them, what the Light of Nature dictate's, and what they themſelves allow, That in matters whereon depends <hi>Salvation,</hi> which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing neceſſary; we ought always to take the ſafeſt courſe; But it is evident by the Decree of the Synod of <hi>Charenton,</hi> that, according to them, it is indifferent to believe, or not believe the <hi>Real Preſence:</hi> According to us it is neceſſary to believe it; Therefore it is ſafeſt to believe it; And in caſe they would diveſt themſelves of their prejudices, they would follow this courſe. And ſo alſo in all the other Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. For according to the Miniſter <hi>Meſtrezat,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Scripture; Points <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation are only thoſe; which are ſo clear in Scripture, that none can doubt of them, as are the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed. If there be any thing obſcure</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it is evident that the Articles in Queſtion, which they maintain againſt us, are not ſo clearly expres'd in Scripture, as that none can doubt of them, ſeing we have good grounds to maintain they are not there at all. One may therefore according to themſelves, disbelieve the ſaid <hi>Articles</hi> without incurring the hazard of <hi>Salvation;</hi> we ſay it is neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of <hi>Damnation</hi> to believe thoſe <hi>Articles</hi> which are oppoſite to them. They muſt then ſubmit herein, if they will take the ſafeſt courſe.</p>

               </gap> in ſhewing them our Articles out of Scripture, and Tradition, as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the primitive times, underſtood the one, and the other; without recourſe to arguments, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn by Syllogiſms, as did Cardinal <hi>Bellermin and Du Perron, Gretſer,</hi> and other controvertiſts; a thing which ordinarily begets diſputes which will never have an end. This was the Method by which they proceeded in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved againſt <hi>Julian</hi> to prove original Sin: <note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">The <hi>4th. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>
               </note>The fourth <hi>Method</hi> is, to evince, that the Miniſters can never do this ſame, nor ſhew in the Scripture any of their Articles controverted: And this is moſt true, for example, they will never produce any one formal <hi>Text</hi> which ſaith that original Sin, as to the Guilt, remains ſtill after Baptiſm: That we receive the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> only by <hi>Faith;</hi> That after Conſecration it is ſtill Bread: That there is no Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; That we merit nothing by our good works: And it may be added, that of all the paſſages which they ſet down in the margent of their confeſſion of <hi>Faith;</hi> There is not ſo much as one, which avers either in expreſs or equivalent terms, or in the ſame ſenſe, the thing which they would have believed. This is the Method of Monſieur <hi>Veron,</hi> which he took from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who ſaith to the Maniches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Contra Epiſt Fundamenti Lib de Vnit. Eccleſiae</hi> Cap. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Shew me that this is in the Scripture:</hi> And in another place, <hi>Let them ſhew me that this is to be found in the holy Scripture.</hi> We may therefore confidently aſſert, that, they can neither prove any of their <hi>Articles</hi> conteſted, nor oppugn any of ours, by <hi>Scripture,</hi> either in expreſs terms, or by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences ſufficient to make their Doctrin be received as of <hi>Faith,</hi> and ours rejected as an <hi>Error.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>5th. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>
               </note>The fifth is a <hi>Method</hi> pacifick, and without diſpute, grounded on the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> which all the pretended
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66047:13"/>
reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> have received, and which hath defined by the holy Scipture, that, when their is a conteſt concerning any Atricle controverted between two Parties, who are of the <hi>true Church,</hi> they ought to refer themſelves to the Judgment of it, under penalty to him, who therein refuſeth ſubmiſſion, of being guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But now recurring to the time when the Diſpute about ſome Article; For example concerning the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> firſt begun, the two conteſting Parties who were the Anceſtors of thoſe of the pretended reformed Religion, and of us, were both of the ſame <hi>Church,</hi> which was the <hi>true,</hi> becauſe it was the <hi>only one,</hi> before the ſeparation, which was not as yet made; Their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> therefore who would not ſubmit to its Judgment, and who did not ſeperate from it but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it condemned their <hi>Tenents,</hi> were <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and ſo by conſequence are theſe alſo, becauſe they follow their Sentiments: To which they can anſwer nothing, but what might have been anſwered by all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> who have been condemned in all Ages. This Method is made good, as to all its parts, in the ſmall Treatiſe compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for that End.</p>

               </note>The ſixth <hi>Method,</hi> is to ſhew them, that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or that which throughout the Earth acknowledgeth the <hi>Pope</hi> or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> Succeſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> for Head, is the true <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe there is none but that which hath the unqueſtionable mark of it (<hi>viz.</hi>) A <hi>viſible continuance</hi> without interruption from Chriſts time, to this preſent day. This is a Method common to all Catholicks, and is very well and briefly explain'd in the little Treatiſe of the <hi>true Church,</hi> annexed to that of the <hi>pacifick Method.</hi> Tis the ſame which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> frequently make's uſe of againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and chiefly in his Book of the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">From 151 to 174.</note> and in his Epiſtles, whereof the prime paſſages, relating to this Subject are alledged by Monſieur Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Roan,</hi> in the firſt Book of his Apology <hi>De l'Evangile</hi> where he excellently treats of this matter.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Method</hi> may be added the Maximes of which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallian,</hi> ſerveth himſelf in his Treatiſe of <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> againſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66047:14"/>
Hereticks and <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis</hi> in his Advertiſements. It may ſuffice here to advertiſe, that thoſe two Treatiſes are enough to any one, that will read them without Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, rightly to <hi>diſcern the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from all <hi>Societies</hi> which would uſurp that Name.</p>

               </note>The ſeventh <hi>Method</hi> is to let them ſee, that thoſe who firſt pretended to reform the <hi>Church</hi> in which they were with us, had not, nor could have, any <hi>Miſſion,</hi> neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, nor extraordinary, to convey to us another Doctrin, than what was there taught, and by conſequence none was obliged to believe them, ſeing they had not any Authority to preach as they did. <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note>
               <hi>How ſhall they preach unleſs they be ſent?</hi> This is the uſual Method which puts the Miniſters on a neceſſity to prove their <hi>Miſſion.</hi> A thing they will never be able to do. This cuts of all diſputes, and is alſo one of the Methods of <hi>Monſieur the Cardinal de Richelieu.</hi>

               </note>The thirteenth <hi>Method</hi> is drawn from the quality of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which ought never to be made, for any reaſons whatever can be alledg'd: For according to the Miniſters themſelves, nothing elſe can be produced but <hi>Errors,</hi> which they pretend to be crept into the <hi>Church,</hi> from which they ſeparated themſelves by <hi>Schiſm;</hi> But thoſe who were there, as well as they, before their Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did firmly maintain, as we do ſtill maintain, to this day, that thoſe, are not <hi>Errors,</hi> but <hi>Verity's;</hi> And it is certain that of theſe ſo different Sentiments, the one is <hi>true</hi> Doctrin, the other <hi>Error,</hi> and falſhood: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the one <hi>good Grain,</hi> the other <hi>Tares:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Verſe 41.</note> to <hi>ſeperate the Darnel from the good Grain; and to Root up the one, without touching the other, at the time of Harveſt,</hi> that is to ſay, in a Council, or by common conſent of the whole <hi>Church:</hi> And in that Caſe there is no need of a Council: <hi>Wilt thou that we go and pluck them up?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This alſo is one of St. <hi>Auſtins Methods,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> where he ſheweth, by th' Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Samuel, David, Iſaiah, Jeremy;</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul</hi> who himſelf tolerated the falſe <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that none ſhould ever ſeperate from their Brethren before a ſolemn condemnation of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thereupon he ſaith that <note place="margin">Epiſ. 162.</note>
               <hi>The Donatiſts were intolerably wicked, For having made a Schiſm; For having erested Altar againſt Altar; For their having ſeperated themſelves from the</hi> Heritage of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66047:15"/>
               <hi>ſpread throughout the whole Earth, according to the promiſe which he made unto it.</hi> He adds, That if they think this a ſmall matter they need only ſee what the <hi>Scripture</hi> teacheth us herein by the Examples there ſhewn of the Puniſhment of ſo great a Crime;<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> For ſaith he, <hi>They who made the Idol of the golden Calf were puniſh'd only by the Sword; But they who made the Schiſm were ſwallowed up by the Earth;</hi> By this diverſity of chaſtiſements, one may know that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a greater Crime than <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See hereupon the Epiſtle—171. where in the Perſon of the <hi>Church</hi> he exhorts the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> to renounce their unhappy <hi>Schiſm;</hi> Amongſt other things there he hath theſe elegant ſayings: <hi>Why will you tear the Garments of our Lord? And why will you not, with the reſt of the world, leave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, this Coat</hi> of Charity, which is but of one ſole <hi>texture, and which his very Perſecutors would not rend?</hi> And a little after. <hi>You feign before the time of harveſt to eſchew the Cockle which is mingled (by what you ſay) with you;</hi> becauſe it <hi>is your ſelves that are this Cockle.</hi> For <hi>if you were the good grain, you would ſuffer the being mixt with Tares and would not ſeperate your ſeves from the Wheat of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needs here no more than to change the word <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> into that of <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> a thing which ſhews how far the Church hath always been, and always ought to be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd for <hi>infallible,</hi> ſeing we muſt give place to its Deciſions, And that the Fathers have ſo firmly aſſerted, we ought never to depart from her boſome, and that we are ſo much the more oblidg'd to remain united to her, for that ſhe never refuſeth to give ear to the complaints of her Children.</p>

               <note place="margin">The <hi>14th. Method.</hi>
               </note>To confirm the precedent <hi>Method</hi> with a fourteenth; we may demand of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as to all our Articles, what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> demanded of the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> when the Church reconcil'd penitent <hi>Hereticks</hi> without <hi>rebaptiſing</hi> them. For example, It may be demanded of them; when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was adored in the <hi>holy Euchariſt</hi> before the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> was the <hi>Church</hi> then the <hi>true Church,</hi> or was it no longer ſo? If it was; then none ought to have ſeperated from it, for a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66047:16"/>
practice which it authorized. If it was no longer ſo; From whence departed Calvin? <note place="margin">Auſtin Lib. 3. de Bapt. Cont Don. Cap. 2.</note>
               <hi>What ſoyl put forth this Sprig? What Sea caſt him on our Coaſt? From what Heaven did he fall upon Earth? From whence came theſe Reformers? Of whom received they their Doctrin, and Authority to Preach? Let thoſe who have followed them look well, where they are, ſeing they can ariſe no higher then to theſe People, to find their Original: As for us, we are ſecure in the Communion of that Church, in which is now practis'd vuiverſally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that which alſo was every where done, before</hi> Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus <hi>and</hi> Cyprian. Then he adds theſe elegant words, which are deciſive. <hi>In the mean while neither</hi> Agrippinus, <hi>nor</hi> Cyprian, <hi>nor thoſe who followed them, though they were of an opinion contrary to that of others, did ſeperate from them, but remained with their Diſſenters in the Communion, and vnity of the ſame Church.</hi> That is to ſay, expecting till ſhe decided their differences.</p>
            <p>Afterwards repeating in few words, what he had ſaid, he conclude's. <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>
               <hi>If then the Church periſh'd, for having taught that the Baptiſm of Hereticks was good, they could not ſhew the original of their Communion; but if the true Church ſubſiſted they could not juſtify their ſeperation, and Schiſm which they made.</hi> As much may be ſaid againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who can derive themſelves no higher, than from <hi>Waldo, Luther, Calvin</hi> and their other Ringleaders. This method of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is excellent.</p>
            <p>If our pretended reform'd Brethren will defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, as in effect, they do in all their Books, that it is not they, that have made the ſeperation, but rather, it came from us, and that it is we who, have cutt them off from our Communion; We muſt anſwer, That there are two ſorts of ſeperation, the one which is <hi>criminal,</hi> the other which is <hi>lawful:</hi> In the firſt, One ſeperates himſelf from his <hi>Paſtor,</hi> by a manifeſt <hi>Diſſobedience.</hi> In the ſecond the <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſeperateth from the <hi>Flock,</hi> him who making a band apart, refuſeth to ſubmit himſelf to the Orders of the <hi>Church;</hi> The one is a <hi>Fault,</hi> the other a <hi>Puniſhment:</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66047:16"/>
the one is a voluntary <hi>Departure</hi> the other an <hi>Abſtiſion</hi> by ſentence; So the Judge pronounceth Condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who hath taken away from himſelf, his own Life.</p>
            <p>The proof of theſe two different ſeperations may be ſeen in the thirty eighth letter of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he ſpeaks of one called <hi>Augendus,</hi> who had betaken himſelf to the party of <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> the Deacon; and it appeared that this great Saint had ſuſpended, and excommunicated him, for having ſubtracted himſelf from his obedience, and engaged others in the ſame ſeperation; <hi>Let him who ſhall follow his opinions, and faction, learn, That he ſhall have no more communication with us,</hi> for his having <hi>voluntarily ſeperated himſelf from the Church.</hi> He ſaith the ſame thing of <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> in his ſeventy ſixth Epiſtle, and of thoſe who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in his Revolt; <hi>For that rending the Church by their Rebellion, and breaking the Peace, and Vnity of Jeſus Chriſt, they were forced to Authorize their particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; To be independent; and to uſurp a power of baptizing, and of offering the Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſtinction is clearly expreſſed in the fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Council of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> where thoſe two anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Canons of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> taken out of the Canons of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> are rehearſed, the firſt concerning thoſe who were ſeperated, the ſecond concerning thoſe who voluntarily ſeperated themſelves; The Greek ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. <gap reason="foreign">

He ſaith, that the Scripture ſpeaks nothing of it.
