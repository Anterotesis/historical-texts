            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Whereas (alſo) Truth and Syncerity, with their Friends and Followers, by the invincible oppreſſion and oppoſition of a <hi>Maſſanellian</hi> brood of bold Uſurpers and Invaders of the Government, (who, like that <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Crew, unhappily thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in their wayes of blood and violence, had got the Maſtery and upper hand of their more Loyal Fellow-Subjects) durſt not of latter times appear abroad, or ſhew themſelves in publick: but were inevitably forced to ſtrike ſail, and give way to the violent and irreſiſtable tide and torrent of Falſhood and Impoſture, with their impudent Abettors; and in ſilence pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to wait for ſuch an opportunity and ſeaſon as this (of ſafer and more ſober times) to diſcover and aſſert themſelves.</p>
            <p>And whereas (further) it highly concerns all men in general; more eſpecially Chriſtians; moſt of all Subjects; and amongſt them Proteſtants, (both in point of Conſcience and Credit) to keep themſelves free not only from the actual guilt, but alſo from the juſt ſuſpition of Regicide and King-killing; of all crying ſins the loudeſt and moſt execrable, as ſcarcely, if at all capable of Expiation.</p>
            <p>VVhereas (moreover) of latter times, ſince we of this County and City, with the reſt of the Nation, laboured under an univerſal and common force, (being with the Defender of our Faith robbed of the Protector of our Freedom, and ſlaviſhly captivated and ſubjected to the lawleſs and Arbitrary power and Tyranny of a perfidious and bloody Engliſh <hi>Phocas,</hi> and his Confederates:) many ſeveral Petitions, Remonſtrances, Declarations, and other like Addreſſes, framed, or rather forged by a few diſloyal, factious and ſeditious time-ſerves, (perſons, for the moſt part, as inconſiderable for their eſtates, as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) have with much Impudence in the Authors, and injury to us, without our privity, and to our great and juſt regret, been fathered, foiſted and obtruded upon us, and preſented and expoſed to the open view of all the world in Print, under our Name and Stamp, as carrying the Title, ſome of this Counties, others of this Cities Addreſſes: and amongſt theſe, one more black, deteſtable, and odious then all the reſt, nor indeed to be remembred without juſt abomination, and perfect abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, to wit, That for requiring of Juſtice againſt his late Majeſty (of ever Bleſſed and pretious memory) and for bringing his ſacred and royal Perſon to (what no Law either of God or Man ſubjected him unto) his Tryal, as an arraigned priſoner at the Bar of a pretended, but ſpurious, illegal, and for ever infamous Court of Juſtice; a Court never once heard or thought of, much leſs with approbation, amongſt Chriſtians, or indeed but civilized Men, in any Age or Nation until then; nor then erected without the perpetual and indeleble ſhame and reproach both of the Engliſh Nation, and of (what ſhould be of higheſt eſteem with it) the Proteſtant Cauſe and Religion, clearly repugnant to ſuch prodigious and infernal practiſes.</p>
            <p>And whereas (laſtly) in truth and verity, (which thanks, under God, to that ever indeared Saviour of his Countrey, our gallant General, may freely now be ſpoken) all thoſe Petitions and Addreſſes in general, and that never enough abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated one in particular, were fo far from being the Acts, or from ſpeaking the Sence and Deſires of our more Loyal County and City, that as they were hatch'd and bred in corners, and in a ſly and clandeſtine way carried on, without either Counties or Cities privity; ſo were they never ſubſcribed or avouched by any party of either place, conſiderable or comparable (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for number or weight) with the Non-ſubſcribers: ſcarce one of a hundred, we may truly ſay of a thouſand, of the numerous Inhabitants of either putting his hand, or giving his conſent to them, but (with full concurrence of heart and ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue) unanimouſly abhorring, abominating, renouncing, deteſting, diſclaiming and diſowning all ſuch (we want words to expreſſe how foul and horrible) deſignes and practiſes, with their promotors and abettors.</p>
