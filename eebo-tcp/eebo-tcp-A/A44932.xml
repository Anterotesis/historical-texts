         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Treatiſe you will find Chriſt and his Apoſtles put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Propoſition: the meaning whereof is not, either that our bleſſed Lord Jeſus was no more, nor no other than a Prophet, or that the Humane Nature of Chriſt had no higher a degree than the Apoſtles had of immediate Illumination: for, being Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united to the Divine, it is reaſonable to believe, it had ſuch communications of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therefrom, as are vouchſaſed to no other man whatever. But the meaning is, that the Eternal Son of God, having graciouſly been pleaſed to take our Nature upon him, <hi>made of a Woman made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> found it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (in order to this end) for him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office of a Prophet, and to inſpire his Apoſtles with <hi>the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſo he did, lies we know at the bottom of our Chriſtian Faith: whoever believes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb facs="tcp:48734:7"/>
to be of God, doth (in a ſort) ſuppoſe it, and take it for granted: for whatever Religion is Divine, muſt needs be either Natural or Revealed: if Revealed, then the firſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it were Prophets, becauſe Prophecy is the only way whereby revealed Truth either is or can be diſpenſed unto us: for very evident it is, that the <hi>Poſitive Truths</hi> of God, beſides, or above what is <hi>Natural,</hi> can no way be made known unto us, but by a free influx of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mind upon ours: ſince therefore (as all agree that) though Chriſtianity doth moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly befriend Natural Theology, yet it ſelf (if it be of God) is Revealed, it muſt be concluded, that Chriſt (the Author of our Faith) and his Apoſtles (the firſt Preachers of it) were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Yet among the many good Books that have either heretofore or lately been written to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity, I have neither ſeen, nor ever heard of any purpoſely written, and directly deſigned to make good this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: I could not but ſomewhat wonder at it, and wiſh it were well done; and this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, did at length vent it ſelf in a Sermon on the Text you find prefixed to this Treatiſe: and this Sermon I reſolved (on an occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me by a Perſon of great Learning and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church) to tranſcribe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in that method which is there propoſed, and you will find here obſerved: from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<pb facs="tcp:48734:7"/>
the ſlenderneſs of mine acquaintance with <hi>Oriental</hi> Language and Learning, did a long time deterr me; but conſidering that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides mine own ſatisfaction, and diverſion from leſs pleaſing Imployments) I wrote it only for his Lordſhips peruſal (who I knew had good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs enough to pardon my Defects, as well as Learning to diſcover them) I reaſſumed my former reſolution: and in order to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, I looked more narrowly than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I had done into thoſe Books which I had that were likely to acquaint me with the cuſtoms and methods of the Jews in the tryal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and by ſo doing, have, I hope, found and pitched upon the principal Means and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods obſerved by that People in that Affair: and this way of procedure (even before I had that <hi>Idea</hi> of it which you will find in this Treatiſe) I did conjecture muſt needs be very rational, becauſe it was not only projected but practiſed (and that, as far as we find, without controul) for many Ages among God's peculiar People: and that I was not miſtaken in this Conjecture, the fifth Chapter of this Treatiſe doth, I hope, make manifeſt, by ſhewing the ſtrength and force of the preceding Arguments to prove that <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles were Prophets.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:48734:9"/>
the higheſt among the <hi>Jews,</hi> imagination had nothing to do, Divine Truth was repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediately to the Underſtanding, the Characters of it were clearly and plainly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the Mind it ſelf, and therein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet might read it without the Hieroglyphicks of Material Phantaſms: a ſoft and gentle ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation did ſo enlighten his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, as that he might know the mind of God, without either Study or Teaching from Men or Angels, Dreams or Viſions, panick Fears or Paſſions; and this degree of Prophecy was in him, not as the tranſient Effect of a ſudden act upon the Patient, but rather as an Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual habit, whoſe acts he might elicit when he pleaſed. This is that degree of Prophecy, which <hi>Maimonides</hi> and his Adherents attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Moſes</hi> their Maſter, and we Chriſtians may do it (I think with greater truth) to Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>For certainly, the Soul of our Saviour had whatever knowledge was convenient for it to have in order to his being able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come to God by him: and foraſmuch as even in the dayes of his Fleſh he was (as well as he now is) <hi>the Captain of our Salvation,</hi> it ſeems convenient for him<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> even then, to have had no leſs knowledge than that wherein it doth conſiſt: the reaſon is, becauſe that that is only in a poſſibility of

               </gap>e of Humiliation, had that knowledge of Viſion, whereunto he then did, and ſtill doth conduct them: and this Knowledge, I ſuppoſe, will be granted to exceed all that ever <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, or any other Mortals whatever either did or could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to. But we need not fly ſo high in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, becauſe it was foretold of him, that <hi>the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Knowledge</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:48734:10"/>
far beyond the degree of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or all other Mortals put together: and if ſo it were, then doubtleſs he could elicit the acts of a Prophetick Spirit, without either previous Diſpoſitions or Preparations, Dreams or Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Angels or Conſternations, and that when he would, in a manner far ſuperiour to that of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then for the Apoſtles; it ſeems not that the Spirit of Prophecy in them was in any point inferior to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but rather more excellent: for <hi>the Spirit of Truth did guide them into all Truth, and ſhew them</hi>

               <hi>things to come:</hi> and this he did in ſuch a manner, as that they knew the mind of God without Dreams or Viſions, or Angels to teach them; and the Knowledge they had of Divine Truth, it is evident they received without thoſe diſcompoſures of Soul, and terrible ſhakings of Body, which uſually befell the old Prophets. Evident alſo it is by the Sermons and Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that they uttered upon all occaſions, that the Knowledge they had they could alwayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; they were cloathed with the Holy Spirit, neither did they need to prepare themſelves to propheſie, but were alwayes diſpoſed, and in a readineſs to deliver ſuch Truths of God as could no way be known, but by the free Influx of the Divine Mind upon theirs: <hi>i. e.</hi> by Prophecy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not all this been true, it would be very hard
<pb facs="tcp:48734:11"/>
to conceive how without any premeditation they could poſſibly have had a <hi>Mouth and Wiſdom, which all their Adverſaries were not able to</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But whether it were or no, is a Queſtion that I am not ſolicitous about. From what I have<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.</note> diſcourſed concerning the Nature of Prophecy in general, it may not obſcurely be collected, that if Chriſt and his Apoſtles were men, who by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influence from God upon their Minds and Faculties, did attain to ſuch knowledge of his Mind, as by their Natural Abilities would be unattainable, it is as much as I mean and contend for in the word <hi>Prophet.</hi> Now that ſuch Knowledge they had, together with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God to teach it, it is the primary deſign of this Treatiſe to prove.</p>
            <p>Yet that is not mine ultimate aim therein;
<pb facs="tcp:48734:11"/>
but beſides that, I have done mine endeavour (as much as I could within the bounds of the propoſed method) to conciliate our moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Religion to our Reaſon, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it (as much as in me lies) upon its true foundations. In order to this end, I have in the fourth Chapter diſcourſed ſomewhat more largely than perhaps otherwiſe was requiſite, about the tranſcendent Wiſdom of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and have added the ſixth Chapter almoſt on purpoſe to ſhake the ſandy Foundation of bare Humane Authority, whereon Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> and his Complices would have it wholly to depend. I do moſt freely acknowledge, that the Authority of the Civil Magiſtrate is very great about matters of Religion, and that the Church of God is exceedingly obliged to thoſe Chriſtian Princes, who by good and wholſom Laws are become its Nurſing Fathers: yet can I not believe, there is nothing of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in Chriſtianity, beſides what it receives extrinſecally from the Laws of Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns: the reaſons the <hi>Leviathan</hi> gives of this poſition, I endeavour to anſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ment of the Affronts Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath caſt, and Injuries he hath done to our Religion thereby. I can hardly think any man worthy the name of a good Chriſtian, much leſs of a Miniſter of Chriſt, that can
<pb facs="tcp:48734:12"/>
read ſuch pernicious Principles and perverſe diſputings againſt the Honour of his Religion, without ſomething of Indignation: for, to make Religion ſo to truckle under Civil Sovereigns, as in and of it ſelf to have nothing of obligation, what is it leſs than to clip the wings of all true Devotion towards God, and render it unable to fly higher than the Thrones and Scepters on Earth; yea alſo, and to null the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Lord that bought us. For though <hi>all Power be given to him in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> yet this opinion makes him ſo far from being the <hi>Prince of the Kings of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the Earth,</hi> as that he is at beſt but their Counſellour, modeſtly propoſing his Advice: which it ſeems they are not bound to take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that neither he nor his Apoſtles had a Kingdom, and ſo could make no Laws; for which reaſon, (ſuch as it is) the <hi>Leviathan</hi> affirms, that the Commands of the Goſpel are but Precepts, or Invitations of men to receive it; and Invitations, we know, we may accept of or refuſe, as we think fit, and yet without ſin: ſo that our Acceptance is an act of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity rather than of Duty, and our Refuſal an act of Unkindneſs, and not at all of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Had not Civil Sovereigns done Chriſtianity the kindneſs to imbody it into their Laws, we had been under no obligation to be Chriſtians; We might have been <hi>Turks</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48734:12"/>
or <hi>Jews, Pagans</hi> or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and yet without Sin, and what would a <hi>Laodicean</hi> deſire more? How kindly doth it cajole his Lukewarmneſs, and how fairly doth it promiſe him ſecurity from danger, by being againſt Chriſt in his Heart and Life, as long as he is with him in his Profeſſion? Thus doth it turn Chriſtianity into Hypocriſie, and makes us to ſerve God for fear of Men.</p>
            <p>But if we are not ſo bereſt of Reaſon, as to think that God borrows his Authority from his <hi>Lieutenants,</hi> then the <hi>Philoſophical Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments</hi> of that <hi>Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

St. <hi>John</hi> fell at the Angel's feet to Worſhip him, but the Angel ſaid unto him, <hi>See thou do it not:</hi> of which Prohibition he gives this reaſon, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>I am thy fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and of thy Brethren, that have the teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> And who were they that had <hi>the teſtimony of Jeſus?</hi> Surely, they were thoſe whom Jeſus himſelf had choſen to be his Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the<note place="margin">

            <p>Which words can be no way Argumentative, unleſs <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus</hi> be underſtood to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, not that which Jeſus himſelf gave, but that which his Apoſtles did give of him; but being thus taken, they import a two-fold Argument,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48734:18"/>
               <hi>viz. ad hominem,</hi> and <hi>ad rem.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> we know was (as all the other Apoſtles) a <hi>Jew</hi> by birth, one of that Nation, wherein it was a received opinion, that there were ten degrees or Orders of Angels, the loweſt whereof were called <hi>Iſchim:</hi> by the Intervention and Miniſtry of this ſort of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels they ſay (whether truly or falſly I affirm<note place="margin">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Revelations, it is apparent enough, that my Text contains an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>ad hominem.</hi> But the truth is, the force of the Angels Argument doth not lye ſo much in St. <hi>John</hi>'s opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in his own employment at that time, which was to propheſie concerning things pertaining to the Church of Chriſt, as appears by the preceding Verſes: let's then but caſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument into this form, and the ſtrength of it will be evident: <hi>Thoſe whom God employes to propheſie are Fellow ſervants: But you and your brethren the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as well as I, God employes to propheſie; therefore we are Fellow-ſervants.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> could make a doubt of nothing in this Argument, but the Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, whether he and the reſt of the Apoſtles were ſent to propheſie? Yes (ſayes the Angel) that you are, for <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus is the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi> Hereby to me it ſeems apparent, that the Teſtimony of Jeſus here ſignifies that which the Apoſtles gave unto him: and would you know why this is called <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> not of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

concerning him, then obſerve that this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus may be conſidered two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Strictly, or Largely: if abſtractly or ſtrictly in it ſelf, then it is little or nothing elſe but the Record they gave of Chriſt, or the Doctrine they taught concerning him: and this is ſaid to be the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus, becauſe he is the principal thing it treats of: but if it be conſidered largely, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends not only the Doctrine of the Apoſtles concerning Chriſt, but alſo the Strength, Power, and Authority whereby they taught it. Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it is the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> not only becauſe they gave it <hi>to</hi> him, but alſo becauſe they received it <hi>from</hi> him.

               </gap>ctually, as <hi>that men of every Nation under Heaven heard them ſpeak in their own Language:</hi> and this ſurely in it ſelf conſidered, was no ſmall matter of Teſtimony to our Jeſus. The Apoſtles we know were ignorant and unlearned men, that underſtood but little of Scripture, leſs of Foreign Languages, yet hereby on a ſudden they were enabled exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely to underſtand the one, and to ſpeak the other of all ſorts: and doth it not ſurpaſs the Power of Nature to make ſo ſtupendious a change as this was? What Creatures can make Men Wiſe, Holy, and Learned in an inſtant? It is a work of Wonder
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48734:19"/>
that falls within the compaſs of little leſs than Omnipotent Power and Wiſdom: Surely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Author of it was God, and if ſo, then Jeſus (to whom the Apoſtles were thereby enabled to give Teſtimony) was at leaſt a Man approved of him. On that account therefore their Doctrine, or rather their Preaching, or Promulgation of the Goſpel by it, may well be called <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi>

               </hi> Prophecy is not an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Fancy, but an Impreſſion of Divine Light: thence perhaps it was, that in old time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were called <hi>Seers,</hi> not becauſe (or at leaſt not ſo Properly becauſe) of their Fore-ſight of things Future, as of their Viſions, thoſe Images or

It ſeems then that all Prophecy, truly ſo called, hath its deſcent from Above; it is not of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretation, or rather of a mans own ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuggeſtion; for it comes not by the Will of Man, but Holy Men of God did thereby ſpeak as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.

For which cauſe, no doubt, it was, that <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> intitles him <hi>the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> But when we conſider, that the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> as in my Text, is affirmed of <hi>the Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> it ſeems moſt probable, that it therein ſignifies not his Perſon, but his Gift, not his Eſſence or Subſiſtence, but an Effect produced by him, which is here called by his Name. Thus <hi>the Spirit of a ſound Mind, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Meckneſs, the Spirit of Knowledge, the Spirit of Grace, and the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> ſignifie Effects, Works, or Gifts, which the Spirit of God produceth in the Souls of Men. So here in my Text, the <hi>Spirit of Prophecy</hi> (by an ordinary Metonymy of the Cauſe for the Effect) is put for the Gift or Ability to propheſie, which the Holy Ghoſt wrought in ſome of Gods Miniſters. This Gift the Angel had when he ſpake to St. <hi>John,</hi> and ſo, ſaith he, had St. <hi>John</hi> too, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, in their <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus; i. e.</hi> in the Record they gave of Chriſt, or in the promulgation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48734:20"/>
they taught concerning him: from whence it apparently follows, that the Angel here ſpeaking and they were Fellow-ſervants. But it is not this their Aſſociation with Angels which I now intend to diſcourſe of, but the Reaſon and Cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> their Gift of Prophecy. It is we ſee here avouched by an Angel, that the Apoſtles in the Promulgation of the Goſpel, were indued with the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; or, in ſhort, that they were Prophets: and if they, in their Teſtimony of Jeſus, were Prophets, much more was He himſelf (by whoſe Spirit they gave it to him) a Prophet; all then that remains for me to do will be to prove, <hi>that Chriſt and his Apoſtles were Prophets.</hi>

For theſe Reaſons I ſhall at preſent aſcribe no more Authority to the Holy Scripture than is uſually given to other Writings far inferiour, and argue only from Reaſon and Teſtimony that cannot be ſuſpected of Partiality: by the help thereof (together with Gods bleſſing) I doubt not to prove theſe five Particulars: 1. That the Notion of a Prophet is very agreeable to Reaſon. 2. That there were Prophets among the <hi>Jews.</hi> 3. That for the Tryal of Pretenders to the Gift of Prophecy, they had certain Rules, Notes, and Signs whereby to judg of them. 4. that if Chriſt and his Apoſtles be tryed thereby, it will be found that they were Prophets. 5. That this way of proving they were ſo, is very ſufficient and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of the Notion of a Prophet, and that there were Prophets among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Notion of a Prophet may certainly beſt be learned from the Nature of Prophecy, before defined: from which Definitions of Prophecy we may gather this of a Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>He is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who by the Influence of God upon his Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, doth attain to ſuch knowledge, as by his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abilities would in one reſpect or other be unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> In which Deſcription, it concerns us at preſent to obſerve only, that it is not Prediction, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from God, which conſtitutes a Prophet, at leaſt ſuch an one as we are now ſpeaking of. And that this is no new Notion, adapted to our preſent Undertaking, is evident enough by the words of a late Author, whoſe Principles are thought moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily of any to undermine ſuch Foundations as we are now laying; yet he expreſſeth himſelf in theſe words: <hi>Although there be many ſignifications in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, of the word</hi> Prophet; <hi>yet is that the moſt frequent in which it is taken for him to whom God ſpeaketh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, that which the Prophet is to ſay from him, to ſome other man, or to the People. Gods ſpeaking to men immediately,</hi> he himſelf ſaith, <hi>is to be interpreted,</hi>

               <hi>that way (whatſoever it be,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Miniſtry of man) <hi>by which God makes them to underſtand his Will.</hi> Hereby 'tis evident that in his Judgment, as well as ours, a Prophet was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on whoſe Underſtanding God had immediate Influence: how elſe is it poſſible, he ſhould make
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48734:22"/>
him immediately to underſtand his Will? and ſure it cannot ſeem ſtrange to any, that there have or might have been ſuch men in the World; the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Wiſdom of God, together with the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mens Souls, are enough to remove all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Its impoſſibility. He that made the Mind, ſhall not He be able to teach men knowledge? and he that was made on purpoſe to know God, and give him the Glory of his Handy-work, ſhall not he be thought capable of learning from ſuch a Teacher? There is therefore no ſhow of Reaſon to doubt the Poſſibility of Prophecy, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that all ſorts of men (how wide ſoever their differences are in other matters, do yet) agree in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are or have been ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the World. This is ſo manifeſt and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known to be the Belief of <hi>Chriſtians, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> as that (among all that have heard of <hi>Chriſt, Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet)</hi> all neceſſity of proving it is perfectly fore-ſtalled: and that the Heathens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were of the ſame opinion, is evident by what they have reported of ſome of their Law-givers, <hi>viz.</hi> that they received their Laws from the Gods: as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> from <hi>Egeria, Minos</hi> from <hi>Jupiter, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>

or elſe they would have fallen into ſome heatheniſh Abomination, or elſe they would have inſtituted ſomething elſe ſomewhat like it among themſelves. Now to ſhew them there was no need of ſo doing, <hi>Moſes</hi> calls to mind the Promiſe that God had made them to raiſe them up a Prophet like unto him. Unto which Promiſe he ſubjoyns the Means of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of Pretenſions to the Gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 22.</note> Now to me it ſeems ſtrange, that this Promiſe at firſt made and afterwards renewed on thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and important Occaſions, and attended with theſe circumſtances, ſhould have no reference at all to ſome Prophet or Order of Prophets that ſhould ſhortly ſucceed <hi>Moſes.</hi> When the People were afraid they ſhould dye, and begged (as it were for their Lives) that God would ſpeak no more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto them, but that he would uſe the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is it likely that God giving this Promiſe in anſwer, ſhould mean only that he would raiſe up a Prophet about two thouſand years after? and as unlikely it is, that a Promiſe of a Prophet to ariſe ſo long after, ſhould keep them from Heatheniſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations in the mean time: nor is it likely that the Rules then given for the trial of Prophets ſhould be of no uſe till Then. Theſe and ſome ſuch other Conſiderations incline me to Confidence, that this Promiſe (though in its Extent and Latitude it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Chriſt, in whom it was moſt compleatly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, yet) in its primary Senſe and Meaning it hath reference to ſome Prophets which God would raiſe up to ſucceed <hi>Moſes</hi> among the <hi>Jews:</hi> and from hence, the Inference is both eaſie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, there where Prophets among them. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is apparent that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> give Teſtimony; nor can the <hi>Heathens</hi> deny it; for from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48734:25"/>
their Aſſertions or at leaſt Conceſſions that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Prophet, by a good Conſequence it follows that this his Promiſe was fulfilled. For it is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible, that ſo important a Promiſe given on ſo ſolemn Occaſions, by ſo illuſtrious a Prophet, ſhould ever fall to the Ground. Can God lye, or his Prophet prevaricate? Our Reaſon ſaith no: it is therefore moſt rational to conclude, there were Prophets among the <hi>Jews.</hi>

it had, or how it might be dreſs'd up to ſerve the emergent exigence of Prophecy; were tryed by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that Tradition known only in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and that Conſiſtory conſiſted of men ſubject (as doubtleſs they were) to Error and Corruptions, the Ark was more like to fall before <hi>Dagon,</hi> than <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark; I mean, the Truth of God to be repelled by Vice and Wickedneſs, oftener than they corrected by the Truth of God. How eaſie was it for Vice to pretend to this Tradition, and for Wickedneſs to plead Preſcription by this Oral Law for its Protection? And if they dwelt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, (as too often they did) or could make ſome friends there (as no doubt they might) they would certainly be more mindful of their concerns, than to neglect ſo fair an Advantage: and then if the Conſiſtory declared that Tradition was for them, that <hi>Prophet</hi> muſt die who preſumed to ſpeak againſt them. But is it poſſible, that the God of Holineſs ſhould make a Law ſo apt to eſtabliſh wickedneſs? no: it borders upon Blaſphemy to ſay he did. Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therefore as well as Reaſon inclines us to look on this Tradition as a meer Fiction, at firſt invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uphold the tottering Reputation of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Rabbies, and afterwards improved and uſed to patronize their Infidelity and juſtifie their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Proceedings againſt Our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus and all that adhered to him.

               <p>But the other part of <hi>Maimonides</hi> his aſſertion <hi>(viz. That Pretenders to the Spirit of Prophecy were not admitted to a Trial unleſs they made no alteration in the written Law of Moſes)</hi> is ſomething more probable; for doubtleſs an attempt to null the Obligation of a Law, which God himſelf hath eſtabliſhed, if he that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48734:30"/>

What Law therefore of the <hi>Jews</hi> it was wherein (our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaith) this Rule was contained, is yet unknown to us; however aſſured we are, that though it might be of theirs, yet it was no part of Gods Law, becauſe it inflicts Death on them, who bring the broad Seal of Heaven to avouch their Authority to ſpeak what they do in his Name. I ſuppoſe therefore the Rule is ſeldom or never true but in caſe either of Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability in the Law it ſelf, or want of ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Gods Intention by the pretender to change it: and that neither of theſe is the caſe now under debate will be evident by conſidering theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48734:36"/>
and convenient for the Office of a Prophet, that the Perſon inſpired ſhould be one of no contemptible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts and Prudence. Not that Natural Sagacity or any acquired Endowments could conduce by way of Efficiency to the Gift of Prophecy, but yet they might and did by way of Anticipation, although they were not abſolutely needful in order to the Production or Reception of the Spirit of Prophecy, yet they were convenient to anticipate and prevent the Prejudices which otherwiſe would ariſe againſt the Perſons of the Prophets. How hard a thing was it, (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if their age were ſuch as ours) to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the God of Infinite Wiſdome would In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire men of ſhallow Intellectuals and incompetent Apprehenſions? Prophecy is one of the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection, whereof in this Life our humane Nature is capable: and how hardly are we perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſo good and perfect a Gift ſhould be congruouſly beſtowed by the moſt Wiſe Diſpoſer of all things. But if they were ſo ſucceſsful as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men of their Calling, yet how could they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Office without Diſcretion and Prudence? By their Office (as we may gather from the uſe of<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> their Scripture) the Prophets were to <hi>teach, reprove, correct, and inſtruct men in righteouſneſs,</hi> to declare what they ought to know and believe, to convince them in Falſhood and Error, to reform and amend their Lives, to build them up, and carry them on unto Perfection, in all Vertue and Holineſs of living: without Diſcretion and Prudence who were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theſe things? Can Ignorance teach, or Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprove? Can Weakneſs of Judgment demoliſh the Strong Holds of Errour, or diſcover the Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Falſhood? Can Shallow Apprehenſions fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the Depths of Sin, or detect the Myſteries of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48734:36"/>
Iniquity? Can Ideots make men Wiſe, or Fools In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others in Righteouſneſs? Yet ſo they muſt, unleſs the rational Faculties of the People rather than of the Prophets, were almoſt wholly abſorpt by the Spirit of Prophecy, and ſo their Wiſdom and Holineſs were increaſed by a ſtrange <hi>antiperiſtaſis</hi> of Folly and Ignorance, than which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unlikely and ridiculous. It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be granted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that Gods Prophets were (though it may be not alwayes Learned in Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Arts and Sciences &amp;c. yet) Wiſe and Prudent Men: and this their Prudence dwelt with ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as was unattainable without Revelation, and that in one or more of theſe three reſpects. Either, firſt, in reſpect of the nature of the things known, as in their Predictions of Future Contingences, (of which hereafter.) Or, ſecondly, in reſpect of the manner of their Knowledge; my meaning is, that thoſe things which of their own nature were ſuch as might have been known by the power of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Abilities, were ſometimes made known to the Prophets by immediate Revelation. Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Samuel</hi> knew where <hi>Sauls</hi> Aſſes were: and<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.</note> thus <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew whither his Servant <hi>Gehazi</hi> was gone, and what he did, when he followed <hi>Naaman,</hi>

Surely he did not, for in another place of his Writings he tells us, that in this Rule the word <hi>Wiſe</hi> without doubt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Intellectual Vertues, but the words <hi>Strong and Rich</hi> import Morals; the former denotes Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the latter Contentment: for his words are theſe; <hi>Gihbor</hi> [Strong] <hi>is of the Moral Vertues,</hi> viz,

contrary, an holy Magnanimity and Contempt of the World, accompanied with all other probity of Manners, do conciliate Authority, and facilitate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Since then the Prophets were Men of Gods own immediate chuſing, and that on purpoſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Holineſs to others, and infuſe it into them, it is more than probable that they themſelves had a great ſhare of it.

For the Spirit of Prophecy and the Office of a Prophet, had ſo little of Secular advantage to allure mens Affections, and ſo much of likelihood to expoſe them to all manner of hardſhips, yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to Death it ſelf, as that it was altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that a Wiſe and Prudent man would undertake it without a Call, or Neceſſity laid upon him to do it: much more unlikely is it, that he ſhould be Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and Reſolute in it, when in his Conſcience he knew, he had nothing to do (and ſo might be put to death, and damned for medling) with it.

It conſiſts not in Myſtical Oblations, Sacrifices, and Purifications, but in Direct and ſtrenuous Striving after that Holineſs and Purity which, perhaps, was ſhadowed thereby: that pure and Spiritual Devotion, which was hardly diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Carnal Ordinances of the Law, is openly and clearly propoſed unto us by the Inſtitutions of the Goſpel: inſomuch that among Chriſtians, there are hardly any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ignorant as not to know, they ought to purſue it in all the parts of Divine Worſhip. And together herewith, it doth not only (as the Law) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain men from Idolatry, but it utterly deſtroyes it. And what can be more effectual to extirpate Vice and promote Vertue than ſuch a Religion? And beſides that, the Goſpel gives us the ſevereſt Precepts and ſtrongeſt Motives that can be, to avoid all Vice and Wickedneſs of Living, and to follow Holineſs in all manner of Converſation: and above all things, it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48734:45"/>
aſſerts the higheſt neceſſity of Charity, which will certainly uphold Juſtice and Equity, and indeed the moſt elevated Vertue of all ſorts. Apparent therefore it is, that the Goſpel doth moſt highly eſtabliſh the Law, as to the general Intention of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But this ſort of Wiſdom (not being peculiar to Prophets) was not I ſuppoſe ſo much inquired after in the Trial of thoſe that pretended to the gift of Prophecy as that that was ſupernatural; namely, that Knowledg which without Revelation was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unattainable, and that in reſpect either of the Matter, Manner, or Meaſure of it. That Knowledg ledg or Wiſdom which in one or other of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects was ſupernatural, was I think, principally enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after in the Trial of Pretenders to Prophecy: the Reaſon of this my Conjecture is, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Nature of the thing requires that it ſhould be ſo, but becauſe the contumelious carriage of the <hi>Jews</hi> towards our bleſſed Saviour ſeems to intimate that it was ſo: for <hi>when they had blind-folded him,</hi>

               <p>Fore-knowledge of future Contingencies, the <hi>Jews</hi> very juſtly held to be Supernatural, in reſpect of the Matter of it.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48734:49"/>
nor yet in the Meaſure of their Knowledg, does there ſeem any thing extraordinary; yet not being informed concerning it, 'tis evident the manner of their Knowledg, or the means whereby they attained to it, were Supernatural; they received it by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Revelation of the Spirit; and that's the<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note> reaſon why St. <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Ananias,</hi> that he <hi>had not lied unto Men, but to the Holy Ghoſt: i. e.</hi> to God himſelf. But of this I ſhall ſay no more, becauſe I would here ſpeak ſomewhat largely of the third ſort of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledg, <hi>viz.</hi> that that is ſo in reſpect of its Degree or Meaſure.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Prophecy did not only Reveal thoſe things, all knowledge whereof was utterly unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Light of Nature; but moreover, it did oft-times illuſtrate thoſe things whereof men had ſome obſcure Conceptions without it. Thus the Being and Attributes of God, although they may in ſome meaſure be underſtood by the things that are made, yet much more clearly by thoſe that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Now that Knowledge which doth clear up and elucidate the Principles of Natural Theology, beyond the poſſibility of Study and Induſtry, is that which I mean by Divine and Supernatural Knowledge, in reſpect of its Degree or meaſure: and this is that Knowledge which ought in all reaſon among the <hi>Jews</hi> to have been honoured with the name of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> if they were ſo prodigal of that honourable<note place="margin">

Methinks then (if they had underſtood it) they could not have been ſo diſingenuouſly partial, as to have denied the title of Wiſdom to Chriſtianity: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſort of Theology far more excellent than their own, and that in a three-fold reference; namely, to our Faith, our Hope, and our Practice. For,</p>
               <p>The Object of Faith is more clearly revealed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, than by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: For very evident it is, that not only the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons in the Unity of the Divine Eſſence, the Perſon and Office of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> are more fully diſcovered, but alſo the very Attributes of God are moſt auſpiciouſly aſſerted and illuſtrated by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any</hi>

Where can we find ſo magnificent a demonſtration of infinite Power and Wiſdom, as in the Incarnation of the Son of God, and his Reſurrection from the Dead? wherein are Gods Holineſs and Mercy, his Juſtice and Goodneſs ſo conſpicuous, as in the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt? and where do Divine Truth and Veracity ſhine ſo brightly as in the Completion of Prophecies in and by our Saviour, from his Birth to his Burial, yea, from his Conception to his Aſcenſion? It ſeems then the Object of Faith (as to the greateſt part of it) is not only more clearly revealed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, than by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, but alſo that part thereof wherein they were moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and clear, is illuſtriouſly demonſtrated by the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Nor have they therein provided worſe for our Hope than they have for our Faith; but as in the Object of that, ſo alſo of this, the Goſpel far excels the Divinity of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for their Maſter <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Inſtitution of their Religion, either promiſed them nothing beyond the good things of this Life, or if he did, it was covered with ſuch Clouds, and

We are indeed aſſured, that <hi>all theſe things ſhall be added to us,</hi> but 'tis upon condition, that <hi>we ſeek</hi>

And indeed, the Goſpel doth Strengthen our hopes of Salvation as well as Raiſe them: for it ſhews us an ineſtimable Price paid for it, and aſſures us that (if we are not wanting to our ſelves) we ſhall be raiſed up unto it, and by Eternal Judgment bidden to take poſſeſſion of it.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48734:55"/>
Obedience is indiſpenſably neceſſary in order to our Salvation. For</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe Sins which are really inavoidable, the Goſpel doth not impute to us for our Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I would not be miſtaken; that that I ſay is, that though according to the Rigour and Severity of the Law as a Covenant of Works the wages of every Sin be death, yet ſuch is the Mercy of God in the Goſpel of Chriſt, as that thoſe Sins which to us are really and truly inavoidable, ſhall not be imputed to us for our Condemnation. Hereof one Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpel puts us into a ſtate of Trial and Probation in this Life, in reference to another after it, Surely therefore there is no inavoidable guilt thereby charged upon us to our eternal Condemnation: it is not imaginable it ſhould ſo Tantali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, That the Goſpel doth promiſe, that our known Sins as well as others, how heinous ſoever they be either in their Nature or their Aggravations, yet, if they are timely retracted by true Repentance and Humiliation, Contrition and Confeſſion, change of Mind and amendment of Life, they ſhall be forgiven us. No mans Sins are either ſo many in Number or ſo heinous in their Quality, but on theſe terms they may be forgiven: inſomuch that to me it ſeems moſt probable, that the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, not for want of Grace in the Goſpel, but for want of repentance in the Sinner.</p>
               <p>Let then our modern Scoffers add theſe things (as they ought) to that againſt which they level their Objection; and then let them tell us what Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility there is in obeying the Goſpel, ſo far forth as is neceſſary to Salvation.

               <p>Hereof alſo we are aſſured by the deſigned End and Scope of it: which in effect is the ſame with that which was pretended by the Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: And what was that?

Hereof we need no other demonſtration than the deſigned End of their Doctrine; which (as we before ſaw) was the Promotion and Eſtabliſhment of the moſt Elevated Vertue and Immaculate Purity; but if any farther proof of it be deſired, we may find it in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by whom we learn, that <hi>the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation</hi> (which words are but a <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of the Goſpel) <hi>teacheth us, that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Greater Love than this we know hath no man, that he layeth down his Life for the Beloved: and the Object of ſtrong Love is like the green Poplar that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſet before the Flocks of <hi>Laban,</hi> it makes the Lover bring forth ſomething that's like it ſelf: it alwayes hath a kind of plaſtick Power, whereby it is able to form its own Image, and work its own likeneſs in the Souls and Lives of the Lovers: and thus it ſeems the Love of God and his Righteouſneſs wrought in Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>

think <hi>Tertullian</hi> much more wiſe and learned than to be ſo bad an Advocate, yea ſo raſh and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a Lyar, as he muſt needs have been, if theſe things had not been true; we have therefore much Reaſon to believe, and none to doubt that they were ſo: and conſequently that in the eſteem of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as of us Chriſtians, our Saviour was holy, harmleſs, and undefiled with Sin, and fully ſatisfyed in the enjoyment of himſelf; for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Self-ſufficiency, and perfect Happineſs are ſuch eſſential Attributes of the Deity, as that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever owns the one, confeſſeth the other.</p>
               <p>And for the Apoſtles, though they themſelves confeſſed, they did not live without Sin, yet ſurely they were in Holineſs that which <hi>Saul</hi> was in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> higher than others by the Head and Shoulders. By their Doctrine they taught men to abſtain from the very appearance of Evil, and to follow Holineſs in all manner of Converſation: and for their help in ſo doing they made no doubt of propounding their own Example to their Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; moſt unlik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Although our Nature be corrupt and depraved, yet not ſo degenerate from all Vertue, as to put no brand of Infamy upon Vice: for of all the things in the World there is hardly any but That ſhameful; at leaſt not ſo apt to blaſt the Reputation of men and leſſen their credit among others: is it then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtles could have drawn the World after them by their Doctrine, if they had been ſtained with moral Vices in their Practice? Was the World ſo weary of it's old Religion as to change it for a

new one, taught them by a few perſons, that had neither any Authority from man to oblige them, nor Eloquence to allure them, and withal were ſo inconſiſtent with themſelves, as that their lives gave their mouths the Lye? There is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely: it is therefore beyond a Probability, that the Apoſtles were burning and ſhining Lights in their lives as well as Doctrine. Hereof methinks the ſilence of their Adverſaries gives occaſion of Confidence, for the Heathens exclaimed againſt the Chriſtians as their common Enemies, that had a deſign to ſhake and unſettle all things, both ſacred and civil, and (to uſe their own Language) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And if they were holy in their Lives, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were contented with their preſent Portion: they were ſo far ſatisfyed with what the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did afford them, as that they did not ſinfully grieve at or labour after what it denyed them: for contentment is at leaſt an integral, if not an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of Holineſs: if it be poſſible to be holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not intirely ſo without contentment; you loſe a limb, if not the Life of Holineſs without it. Since therefore the Apoſtles were eminently holy, it is more than probable that they were alſo contented. Which likewiſe <hi>Lactantius</hi> proves not by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from their Holineſs, but by the cohererence of their Doctrine. <hi>Such</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Nature of Lies, as that they cannot agree, but the Tradition</hi> (or Doctrine) <hi>of the Apoſtles, becauſe it is true, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates on every ſide, and agrees with it ſelf in all things, and therefore it perſwades, becauſe it is ſtayed up with conſtant reaſon: they did not therefore deviſe this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for the ſake of gain or any earthly convenience: for both in their Precepts and their Practice they led ſuch a life, as was void of Pleaſure and deſpiſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: they did not only dye for the Faith, but they alſo both knew and foretold that ſo they ſhould, yea alſo that whoſoever will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Perſecution.</hi> Yet evident it is by their enterprize<note place="margin">de Juſtitia lib. 5. cap. 3.</note>

               <p>Thus have we paſſed through the prerequiſites to Prophecy, or rather the concomitant attendents on it, and have found that in reſpect of them, Chriſt and his Apoſtles (as well as the foregoing Prophets) were <hi>Wiſe, Strong, and Rich</hi> i. e. endowed with all thoſe intellectual and moral Vertues, which the <hi>Jews</hi> thought needful to expect in their Prophets. the force hereof to prove that they alſo were ſuch, I reſerve for another place, where (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) I ſhall joyn it with that of the more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative evidence of their prophetick Spirit: and this is it that comes next to be conſidered.</p>

               <p>It was before obſerved that the evidence of a prophetick Spirit (which the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteemed certain and demonſtrative) was twofold; <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> or <hi>extraordinary,</hi> each one evacuating the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the other: for when divine Providence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the ordinary marks of Prophecy, the <hi>Jews</hi> had no more need of extraordinary, than <hi>Elijah</hi> had the Ravens ſhould feed him while he ſat at his

own Table in <hi>Gilead:</hi> and when men made proof of the prophetick Spirit in them, by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſigns of it, the neceſſity of the ordinary was as eminently ſuperſeded, as the ſame Prophets want of his ordinary proviſion was by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Supply thereof at the brook Cherith. Since therefore Chriſt and his Apoſtles did abundantly demonſtrate their Miſſion from God by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proof of it (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was the leſs need of the ordinary: but God, willing more abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of his promiſe the unqueſtionable certainty of their Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confirmed it by both: our deſign it is to make it appear that he did ſo; and our method requires us to begin with that, which among the <hi>Jews</hi> by Gods appointment was ordinarily expected, <hi>viz.</hi> predictions fully and exactly accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>And ſurely thoſe that are acquainted with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, and have read the New Teſtament, cannot be ignorant that Chriſt and his Apoſtles gave this evidence of the prophetick Spirit in them, as well as in any of the Jewiſh Prophets before them: for the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their City and the Temple, we therein find by them ſo plainly fore-told, and by divine wrath and vengeance ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly fulfilled, as that all the World (I preſume) knows it. Yet ſince particular Demonſtrations are far more convincing than general Aſſertions, it will perhaps be worth the while to take a brief Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of it, as it lyes both in Prophecy and in Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles fore-told it, is ſo manifeſt, as that there is hardly any one of their Epiſtles but makes mention of it; Yea <hi>Lactantius</hi> informs, us, they ſpake of it in their Sermons as well as

                  <hi>be objected againſt it or the Founders of it.</hi> viz. That there never was any thing of great uſe and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men, but there aroſe Diviſions and Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Opinions and Sects about it. As for example Phyſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is and ever was held to be good and uſeful to mankind, yet 'tis confeſſed that among the Greeks (perhaps alſo among the Barbarians that gave their minds to the Study of it) there were not only many Queſtions but divers Sects and Sorts of Phyſitians. Thus alſo Philoſophy that promiſeth the Knowledg of the Truth and directions for a good Life, it is well known there were divers Sects about it, ſome more ſome leſs famous. Yea and Judaiſme it ſelf, though acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be of divine Origine, yet gave occaſion to Sects and Diviſions among thoſe that owned it ſo to be. <hi>From hence it follows, that though it be granted, Chriſt and his Apoſtles did foreſee and foretell, there would be Diviſions among their Followers, yet this doth not argue they were indued with the Spirit of Prophecy; becauſe wiſe men (by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things paſt with things preſent) may gueſs at things future, yea by the ſtrength of Ratiocination, they may be ſo verily perſwaded concerning their future Exiſtence, as that with ſome Confidence and good Succeſs they may foretell it.</hi>

He grew up as a root out of a dry Ground, they thought there was no Form, Comelineſs, or Beauty in him, that

they ſhould deſire him. They would ſee no ſuch bloſſomes in his Youth, as promiſed any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fruit in his riper age: wherein alſo he was deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, a Rock of Offence and Stone of Stumbling, ſet at naught by the Maſter-Builders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> rejected by the chief of his own Nation, purſued by his Enemies, betrayed by one of his pretended Friends, denyed by another, and ſuſpected by all: purſued and apprehended, bound and buffetted, arraigned and ſpit on, condemned and crucified by his own Country-men, as one of the worſt of Malefactors: was this mans Name like to become great in <hi>Iſrael</hi> and famous among the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> yet this was he that ſent forth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and who were They? why men as mean as himſelf, perſons of obſcure Parentage, of no Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Wealth or Wiſdom, Honour or Authority in their own Country: yea ſo far from it, as that the chief of them was a Fiſherman, and others as rude and illiterate as the meaneſt Mechanicks: and when they came abroad among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were looked on as fooliſh Bablers, and were made as the Filth of the World, and off-ſcouring of all Things. Were theſe men likely to out wit the wiſe ones and to baffle the Philoſophers? to be too cunning for the Devil and too ſtrong for the Powers of Darkneſs? was their bare Word likely to pull down the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan, and to convert the World from the Errors of its Wayes? and that by a ſort of Doctrine which in divers points ſeemed Fooliſhneſs to the Wiſe, direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and contrariety to the carnal; and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered not with enticeing words of mans Wiſdom, but in the plaineſt ſimplicity of ſpeech, nakedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting

Were theſe men likely by ſuch Doctrine ſo delivered without Miracles to take down the Gates of Braſs, and break the Bars of Iron in ſunder? to reform the World in ſpite of all Oppoſition? yet ſo they did: for by their preaching, mens beloved Luſts were divorced, the Devils Oracles were put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, his Prophets ſtruck dumb, and Soothſayers were unconſulted: Temples were laid waſt, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars demoliſhed: the Wiſe were confounded by the Fooliſh, the Mighty by the Weak; the baſe and deſpiſed things of the World, yea and things that were not, brought to naught the things that were; although they were favoured and patronized by the Love and Liking, the greateſt Power and Polity of Men and Devils, of Earth and Hell, all which took Council together and ſtood up againſt them. Yet ſuch was the Efficacy of their Doctrine, as that though the Grecian and Roman Lawgivers (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Authority and Reputation for Wiſdom and Power, and their Pretences to Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Gods then worſhipped) could not perſwade even their next Neighbours, but only their own immediate Subjects to embrace their Laws; yet the Apoſtles drew not only them, but all bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</hi> Ser. de Legibus.</note> Nations to the Love of the Law of Chriſt; and that not by the force of Arms and Weapons but againſt it; inſomuch that they and their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in all Places were begirt with Reproaches, and encircled with great Dangers, both to their Lives and Fortunes: yet all Mankind and all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they perſwaded to embrace the Faith and Laws of our crucifyed <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and think ye, men were then ſo mortifyed to the Fleſh, and crucifyed to the World, as that they would hazard their Eaſe and

               <p>Of which concluſion we are alſo aſſured by the Tradition of the Church, which in this caſe is ſo auguſt and illuſtrious, as that there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make it moſt abſolutely compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: it hath Univerſality, Antiquity, and Conſent of all Chriſtians to avouch its Authority and credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: it was every where, always, and by all believed, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought Miracles to confirm their Doctrine.

               <p>As for the time wherein it was firſt reported, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought Miracles, it was not (as we know other reports have been raiſed, <hi>viz.)</hi> long after the Fact was done, but in that Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Doers lived, yea in thoſe Years, Months, and Dayes, wherein the Facts (ſuppoſed to be Miracles) were done: while all men were muſing in their hearts concerning the Wonders they ſaw and heard, and conſequently while Intereſt in ſome, and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in others, did prompt them to make enquiry into the Truth of the Report, and while if falſe, it might moſt eaſily have been found to be ſo; yet then did the firſt Witneſſes of theſe things, with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that not in places far remote and diſtant from thoſe wherein they were done, but even in them: where certainly if there had been any fraud, it might beſt and would effectually have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: for the perſons that found the effects, thoſe alſo that oppoſed the deſign of theſe Miracles, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe on whom they were wrought, and thoſe who were enemies to the belief of them, were then and there living, when and where the Report was firſt ſpread of them: and without all doubt in thoſe times and places wherein Chriſtianity was a <hi>Sect that was every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> there wanted not<note place="margin">

Eſpecially conſidering, they had not only the advantages of time and place, but alſo provocations to have done it if they could: for ſuch was the Confidence and noble Magnanimity of thoſe that firſt avouched it, as that though they were ſtript of all Succour and Support from other men, and expoſed to Contempt and Scorn, Curſes and Execrations, Perſecutions and Afflictions, Stripes and Impriſonments; in ſhort, to all manner of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Death it ſelf in giving this Teſtimony, yet were they not moved with fear, or diverted from it, but they did conſtantly avouch it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten appeal to the Conſciences of their implacable Enemies concerning the Truth of it.

Firſt, That Miracles have been done, may be believed upon the Credit of Teſtimony, without the doing of any Miracle to confirm it. The poſſibility of Miracles I now take for granted, and ſo alſo I might this Obſervation, had it not been for this Authors ſly inſinuation, that <hi>without the doing of a Miracle, it cannot appear credible that ever there were any.</hi> But why ſo? is there any thing in the Nature of a Miracle that renders the Atteſtation of it incredible? It ſeems not: for the ſame Author elſe where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines a Miracle to be <hi>a Work of God (beſides his Operation by the way of Nature, ordained in the Creation) done for the making manifeſt to his elect, the Miſſion of an extraordinary Miniſter for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

And why may not thoſe Witneſſes report them truly to other credible Perſons? And why may not this Report be tranſmitted to Poſterity?

               <p>Secondly, It is needleſs to demand the doing of Miracles to prove that there have been ſome done: the Reaſon is manifeſt; becauſe this Aſſent may be built upon another foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> Teſtimony of credible Witneſſes, tranſmitted or delivered down throughout all Ages to Poſterity: the ſufficiency of this foundation to bear that Superſtructure, will be evident, by the firm Aſſent that men build upon leſs credible Teſtimony: whereof they give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in almoſt all affairs of humane Life. The
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48734:88"/>
Nobleman claims his Peerage, the Gentleman his Eſtate, the Merchant ventures his money, and the Traveller takes his Journey, the honeſt Lawyer Pleads, and the juſt Judge pronounceth Sentence upon the credit of Teſtimony: and ſuch is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Teſtimony, as that the Child cannot learn his Letters, nor the Scholar attain his knowledge in the Sciences, nor the Mechanick skill in his Trade, nor indeed can we our ſelves know our own Names, without aſſenting to Teſtimony: yet ſo firm an Aſſent do we yield unto it, as that there is nothing more ridiculous, and hardly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than perſwaſion of us out of our Names. Moſt firm Aſſent therefore we ſee is yielded to Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that ſuch as is not more, perhaps leſs cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, than that whereby the knowledge of Chriſts Miracles is conveyed unto us; for it hath not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, Univerſality, and Conſent of all Parties (as this hath) to avouch its Credibility: moſt firm Aſſent therefore may, and (in reaſon) ought to be given to it: for, where there is certain Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the matter propounded, and alſo in the Teſtimony that propounds it, there doth ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men an obligation to believe: as appears by the Law of Nature concerning Converſe, which would ſerve to very little or no purpoſe, if the motives of Credibility do not induce an obligation to believe. It ſeems therefore, that the Teſtimony or Tradition whereby we underſtand that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did many and great Miracles, we not only may, but alſo we ought to believe: becauſe there is a certainty of Credibility, both in the Matter propounded, and alſo in the manner of its propoſition to our conſideration: and if this renders it a Duty to believe, then,</p>

Thirdly, It is both wicked and abſurd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a Miracle to induce our Aſſent unto it. It is wicked, becauſe it not only hinders the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our Duty, but alſo meerly to gratifie an unreaſonable Humour, it importunes Almighty Power and Wiſdom (without any neceſſity) to change the courſe of Nature, or at leaſt to act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it: and what affront more petulant and ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can we eaſily offer to Divine Majeſty? It is alſo abſurd as well as wicked: for, ſuppoſe a man in this Age ſhould really work a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; if the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles may not be received on Teſtimony; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may that, how then ſhall the knowledge of it be conveyed to all that are concerned in it? why they themſelves <hi>muſt both ſee it done, and uſe all means poſſible to conſider, whether it be ſuch as no man can do the like by his Natural Power, but that it requires the immediate hand of God.</hi>

And, pity it is, that their ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſhould diſturb any ones reliance on the Pillar and ground of Truth, the Houſe and Church of the Living God: by whoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Tradition we are ſo very well aſſured of the truth of our Saviour and his Apoſtles Miracles, as that we have little or no reaſon to envy either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> whoſe eyes were bleſſed with the ſight of them: For, to what purpoſe did their eyes then ſerve them? Was it not to convey thoſe their Credentials to their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings? Yes, doubtleſs; they therein had little other benefit by the uſe of them. And is not this abundantly ſupplied unto us by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church? Which (if well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) will be found as incapable of Deception as our Senſes. For ought I know, mine Eyes may as ſoon be deceived in an Object of Sight, as the whole Church in this its Tradition: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if Chriſt and his Apoſtles did not do Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, it certainly is a Miracle that the World ſhould receive their report without them, and a lying Wonder (much more incredible than what we plead for) that the whole Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages ſhould ſo confidently believe and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48734:90"/>
teach that they did them. Although therefore the ſight of Miracles might perhaps make deeper Impreſſions on the Fancy and Affections; yet the Tradition of the Church is full out as convincing to our Reaſon and Judgment, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought many and great Miracles.</p>

               </gap>mains of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but the laſt Part, which is, to ſhow that <hi>this way of proving Chriſt and his Apoſtles were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is very ſufficient and Rational.</hi> And this it will appear to be on the account both of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of all ſuſpition, that they were not, and of its poſitive Evidence that they were.</p>
            <p>All juſt Suſpition that they were no Prophets, muſt be Founded on a Probability, either that they pretended not to the Spirit of Prophecy; or if they did, that they therein were deceived; or elſe that they had a deſign to deceive others: but by the preceding Arguments, it is manifeſt that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe is true. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is hardly poſſible for men to have the Antecedents, or Concomitants and Conſequents of Prophecy, and to uſe them (as they did,) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n Order to the Propagation of Doctrine, and yet not pretend to the Spirit of it. Had their mouths been perfectly ſilent, their Actions would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared plainly to what they pretended; Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they Taught, to be the Word of God, and not of man: In the Propagation of it they made Evidence of that Wiſdome, Fortitude and Vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which attended the Prophets in the diſcharge of their Function; and for the Demonſtration of their Miſſion to Teach it, they Foretold Future Contingences, and wrought many and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And how could all this be without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe to <hi>the Spirit of Prophecy</hi> and the Office of Prophets? and if this be Evident by their Actions without their Words, much more ſo is it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with them; for as a mans Actions may either Enervate or ſtrengthen the credibility of his proteſtations and pretenſions, ſo his Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations or Declarations, may very much Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the purport of his Actions; they remove all doubt that otherwiſe might be made concerning them.

Which as it far exceeds them in the nobleneſs of its Nature, ſo alſo in dearneſs to its Maker: For man in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was allyed to God; a Creature ſo neerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto him and ſo gracious with him, as that in a ſort all things elſe were prepared for him. How ſtrange then is it and incredible, that they ſhould
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48734:96"/>
be able to tell him ſuch things as his moſt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and indulgent Creator thought fit to conceal from him? If then this be not likely, it is certainly the dictate of Reaſon, that that knowledge, which at any time any man at firſt hath of them ought to be reſolved into immediate Revelation: and for that cauſe tis likely Predictions ever were (and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be) accounted Infallible Proofs of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Spirit; ſince then Chriſt and his Apoſtles were Authors of Predictions exactly accompliſhed, it is not to be doubted but they were Prophets.</p>
            <p>Hereof, alſo we have yet another and greater Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Miracles: that they really wrought many and great miracles, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready aſſerted: all therefore that now remains, will be to ſhew the Force of that Argument. In order whereunto it will not be amiſs to obſerve, (1.) That Chriſt and his Apoſtles, wrought their Miracles on purpoſe to confirm their Doctrine, or their Miſſion from God to teach it. (2.) That Miracles were always looked on as undeniable, or Demonſtrative proofs of Divine Authority. (3.) The Reaſons for which thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles deſerve to be ſo accounted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt and his Apoſtles wrought their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles on purpoſe to Confirm their Doctrine, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate their Miſſion from God to teach it.</hi> 'Tis true indeed each one of their Miracles conſidered ſingly, and apart from the reſt of its Fellows, may ſeem to be wrought on ſome other occaſion, and to other purpoſe: but conſidered in the whole and in conjunction with the reſt, it will be eaſy to obſerve that the Ultimate End, Scope, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, was to Demonſtrate the truth of their Doctrine, and the reallity of their Miſſion from
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48734:97"/>
God to teach it. Hereof methinks it is no trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al argument that may be drawn from the time of them: and this was not before, but preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Saviours Inauguration into his Office of Preaching the Goſpel: that He himſelf could have done, and inabled others to do Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, is firmly believed among Chriſtians, yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we find not that he did it till after his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and Conſecration to the Sacred and ſolemn Office of Preaching.

If then to the Miracles of Chriſt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48734:102"/>
we add thoſe of His Apoſtles, we ſhall find Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude them almoſt innumerable, for ſince their Sound went into all the Earth, and They themſelves into almoſt all the known Parts of the World, Converting men by their Miracles to their Doctrine, how can it be Imagined that they were but few in Number? The Devil being then in poſſeſſion, Ruled without controle in the Children of Diſobedience, and the World was Then aſleep, yea, dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins; and think ye that a few Miracles would ſuffice to Caſt out the one, and to awake and raiſe the other? it is much more Rational to think that they were many, yea, ſo exceeding many as to admit of no Compariſon with thoſe of others in point of Number: and all theſe being done in one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; (for Chriſt and his Apoſtles were Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries) how ſtrongly do they prove, and how clearly do they Declare the Divine Authority of Them that did Them? If Judaiſine were Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe in the ſpace of above 3000 years <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> wrought 150 Miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, how much more Credible is <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> becauſe fewer Perſons in the ſpace of leſs than an hundred years, wrought incomparably more to Demonſtrate the Truth of it? If the <hi>Jews</hi> had Reaſon to believe that They were <hi>Prophets,</hi> much more have we, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles were ſo well as they. Eſpecially conſidering,</p>
            <p>That the Greatneſs of their Miracles doth as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claim our Aſſent thereunto, as their Number. It is true indeed all Miracles being Works of God, beſides the whole Order of the Created Nature, in reſpect of His Power they are all equal: yet, in reſpect of the Power of Nature one may be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48734:103"/>
greater, becauſe remoter from it, or farther above it than another: for (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well obſerves) theſe Works of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Miracles, may Three ways exceed the Power of Nature; either Firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſubſtance of the Fact, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of theſe Three ſorts of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the Firſt is greater than the Second, the Second than the Third, becauſe it farther exceeds the Power of Nature, yet, ſo as that each Sort have divers Degrees of advance above it, ſo that one Miracle may be greater than another, not only of another, but alſo of the ſame ſort. However, ſure we are, that among the Miracles of our Bleſſed Saviour, it is no hard matter to find Inſtances of the Firſt and Second, as well as the Third Magnitude; witneſs His feeding the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the Wilderneſs, his Caſting out of Devils, His raiſing the Dead and giving Sight unto the

Blind, &amp;c. Inſomuch that ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it was never heard that any Man did the like: and this takes away all Colour of Pretence for Unbelief: for ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> had Reaſon to believe <hi>Moſes</hi> their Maſter for his Miracles, much more had they to believe Chriſt for His, becauſe the Latter did exceed the Former as much almoſt as they did Nature. 'Tis true iudeed had Chriſt fallen ſhort of <hi>Moſes</hi> either in the Number, or the Quality of his Miracles the <hi>Jews</hi> had not had ſin, at moſt not ſo great as They had: but ſince He did among them the Works which no other Man did; their unbelief could not be Imputed to any want of Rational evidence of Truth in him, but to want of good Will, to hatred in them: and ſo muſt it be in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the knowledge of his Miracles is as Infallibly tranſmitted to us by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as it was to them by their Senſes: ſince therefore ſuch were his Works and his promiſe to his Diſciples of doing the ſame, or greater, was<note place="margin">

In which perſuaſion we may be yet, farther confirmed by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</p>
            <p>That the Goodneſs of their Miracles did bear a full proportion with their Greatneſs. 'Tis true indeed they were not ſuch as the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, nor was it requiſite that they ſhould, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sick of their Fore-Fathers Diſeaſe, (whoſe Low and uninſtructed minds could riſe no higher in their Conceptions of the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> than of a King exceeding all Mortals in the Majeſtick Goodlineſs of his preſence and Lovelyneſs of his

Perſonage, in the Wiſdom of his Conduct and Victorious valour of his Battels, putting to flight the Armies of the Aliens and Reſtoring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Glory to <hi>Iſrael;)</hi> They I ſay, being Sick of this Diſeaſe, dreamed of, and looked for Signs from Heaven, unprofitable Amazements, apt only to feed their Eyes and affect their Fancies with Strange Shews and Pompous repreſentations: but there being none ſuch Fore-told by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles were no way obliged ſo to humour the Extravagance of their Fancies, as to fulfill their ungrounded expectations. And although Chriſt and his Apoſtles had as high an eſteem for Moſes, as could be kept within the bounds of Sobriety, and really did Him and his Law more honour than the moſt zealous <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, yet did they not take his Miracles for Patterns of theirs: for we find no ſuch affrighting and hurtfull things, as Serpents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rivers of Blood, or Plagues among them; but Chriſt being ſurety, and his Apoſtles Witneſſes of a better Teſtament, their Miracles were (as it was fit they ſhould be) of a more Benign and better Nature. The Son of Man came not to deſtroy mens Lives, but to ſave them, and his Goſpel brought glad Tidings of great Joy that ſhould be to all Nations. How Suitable then and Decent was it, that the Seals and Confirmations of it ſhould bear the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not of Wrath and Judgment, but of Mercy and Goodneſs? and accordingly ſo we find did their Miracles; for they were like a Flock of Sheep, whereof there was none Barren among them, but rather every one did bear Twins, <hi>viz.</hi> Inſtruction or aſſurance of Salvation for the Souls of Men, and Ineſtimable good and great benefit to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48734:104"/>
their Bodies; for very eaſy it is to diſcern, that the Three ſorts of good things, <hi>viz.</hi> of Fortune, Body and Soul, which all Mankind by the light of Nature perceived requiſite to Happineſs, were conferred by our Saviours Miracles.</p>
            <p>The Goods of Fortune, being not deſireable in themſelves, but only in Order to thoſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or the Soul, we do not indeed find that Chriſt ever made the needy exceeding Rich in Worldly Wealth and Grandure, yet, his own and others neceſſities he ſomtimes ſupplyed by his Miracles: Such was the Nobleneſs and Generoſity of his Temper, as that though he had no viſible Eſtate, nor any Imployment to get one, yet He never was ſo burdenſome as to ask a Gratitude from any to whom He had been a Benefactor by his Miracles, but His neceſſities he ſupplyed by doing others: Thus when Tribute was demanded, he ſent St. <hi>Peter</hi> a Fiſhing, and made him ſo lucky an Angler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that he Caught a Fiſh with Money in its Mouth, ſufficient to pay the Pole-Tax, both for his Maſter and Himſelf: this ſhewed his Goodneſs as well as Loyalty, for though this Money was ſent to Rome with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor did His bounty diſplay it ſelf only in Caſes of neceſſity, but alſo in matters of Delight and Decency, for, to grace the Marriage at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> He turned Water into Wine, and that ſuch as ſurpaſſed what ever they had had before, in Goodneſs. Thus did He (in great mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, kindneſs and urbanity) furniſh many Thouſands with the Goods of fortune, and that without the leaſt injury, yea, with advantage to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: this was a ſort of Bounty that far exceeds the Magnificence of the greateſt Princes.</p>
            <p>And yet this is but a ſmall part of the goodneſs in the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for the good they thereby did to mens Bodies was far more exceeding: they Caſt out Devils and cleanſed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, they made the Deaf to hear and the Blind to ſee, the Dumb to ſpeak and the Lame to walk, they Cured the Sick and Raiſed the Dead: and what good ſo great as theſe to the Body? what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit could the torn and diſtorted Bodies of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed receive greater, than the ejection of their Tormentors? what ſo acceptable to poor Lepers as the cleanſing of their loathſome and perhaps
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48734:105"/>
loathed Bodies? what ſo gladſome to the Deaf as Hearing, or ſo joyful to the Blind as Sight? what ſo proper for the Lame as Strength, or for the Dumb as Speech? and what ſo beneficial to the Sick as Health, or to the Dead as Life? could each one of Theſe afflicted have made his own Option, it is great odds, but He would have Choſen what they thereby gave him. How tranſcendent then was the goodneſs of theſe Miracles? how benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to their Bodies, and obliging to ingenuous Spirits? and that not of them only on whom they were wrought, but of all their Friends, yea, of all in the like Condition throughout the Vicinage: for they being no Select company, but a Promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Multitude of Foes as well as Friends, on whom it pleaſed Chriſt and his Apoſtles to do theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, it was thereby made known unto all, that all Men every where that were ſo, or otherwiſe afflicted in Body, might be relieved, if either they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others in their behalf would have made their due Addreſſes. How Admirable then and Divine were theſe Miracles? they did not only do good to the Bodies of many Thouſands, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it to all that needed or deſired it: what a lively reſemblance therefore were they of God, whoſe mercy is over all his Works?</p>
            <p>Nor was the goodneſs of theſe Miracles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to Mens Bodies, for doubtleſs their Souls were thereby inſtructed, not only to make a better Uſe than formerly they had done of Gods Mercies, but alſo in and by whom to ſeek for Salvation: for thereby they might clearly perceive, that He who did them or in whoſe Name they were done, being a Teacher muſt needs be come from God, and ſo had the Words of Eternal life abiding with

This inclination ſhews it ſelf in no Creature more than Man, who being capable of, propends unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection beyond all that in this life is attainable: hence indeed Reaſon concludes, that there is a ſtate of Eternal Happineſs provided for humane Nature: but this its concluſion leaves the Mind altogether in the dark as to the nature of its beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Object. The Objects provided for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of other Creatures, Reaſon (by the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Senſes for the moſt part) perceives: but what there is provided for its own, it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſomewhat it ſeeketh, but what that is, it directly knoweth not: but being verily perſwaded that God hath made nothing in vain, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all attainments in this world will not ſatisfie the appetites of our reaſonable Nature, it concludes there is ſomething elſe provided for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that exceeds all things elſe that it knowes of, in goodneſs, but what that is, it cannot tell. Now from this its ignorance of the End, ariſeth ſo thick a cloud of darkneſs about the Means conducing to it, as that it knows not what to do, or which way to go to attain it. All that it can poſſibly direct us to do, is to work: but when it well conſiders the happineſs it ſeeks for, it can give no account of its being attainable by our works: for it being ſomething beyond or above the power of Nature ordained in the Creation, it cannot be the natural effect or product of our Works: to imagine this, is to think our works effectual beyond their proper ſtrength and power; yea it is to make God infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in power unto men; it gives them the rule over him, and ſuppoſeth them able to attain to happineſs whether he will give it them or no, and ſo (without a Metaphor) to take the Kingdome of Heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But who ſo void of Reaſon, as (after a juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial examination of his works) to think them worthy of Eternal Life: humane Reaſon ſurely is not ſo ſilly as to think that they are ſo meritorious and beneficial unto God, as to deſerve it at his hands.

For ſuch is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>the Word of Prophecy</hi> as that St. <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it before the voice, which he himſelf heard<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 19.</note> from Heaven when he was with Jeſus <hi>in the holy Mount.</hi> But can any thing be more ſure than ſuch a Voice? No, not in it ſelf conſidered abſolutely, but unto us. God is Truth, and in him there is no Poſſibility of lying, or Shadow of falſhood: all things therefore that come from him muſt needs be equally ſure and certain, infallible and true in themſelves: yet for all that, one thing may have greater evidence of its deſcent, and more apparent credentials of its Miſſion from him than another hath. As for example, St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and our Bleſſed Saviour were both ſent from God, but both did not give equal evidence of their Miſſion from him. St. <hi>John</hi> did no Miracle but our Saviour<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 36.</note> wrought many, and <hi>the Works that he did, did bear witneſs of him, that the Father ſent him.</hi> And as it is in Perſons, ſo may it be in ſeveral wayes of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48734:121"/>
and ſo I conceive it is in thoſe that now lye before us, a Voice from Heaven, and a Word of Prophecie: The Queſtion is not which is moſt true, conſidered as in it ſelf, for ſo there can be no compariſon between them: but which of the two is moſt ſure as to us, <hi>i. e.</hi> which of them gives us the faireſt Credentials of its coming from God? St. <hi>Peter</hi> decides the queſtion; <hi>the Word of Prophecy:</hi> And for this his deciſion, he had the authority of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> among whom it ſeems that in thoſe dayes it was, and perhaps ſtill is a received Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the <hi>Bath Kol, filia vocis</hi> (ſuch as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of) was inferiour to the very loweſt degree of Prophecy; not in its truth as in it ſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but in motives of credibility to others: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Maimonides</hi> inſinuates this reaſon, viz. <hi>becauſe it</hi>

If we will believe no more than what we can demonſtrate to be true, our Aſſent is not Faith, but Science; for it is not built upon the Foundation of Gods Teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but on Demonſtrations from the Nature of the things teſtified, and ſo it honours not God at all; becauſe it receives not the Truth for His ſake, but Him for the Truths ſake; and ſo it pays no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Word, but only to our own Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination. But foraſmuch as the mind aſſents to Teſtimony as well as Reaſon, and the divine Prerogative extends it ſelf to the whole Man, that Religion that becomes God and it is ſuitable to Man, muſt have ſomthing in it to exerciſe this his innate Power about; and for this Cauſe, the Myſteries of Chriſtianity ought to be looked on

Since they make it like to all things elſe of Gods making, they beautifie and adorn it with fairer Characters than otherwiſe it would have of Gods Image on it: and the fairer the Characters of His Image are upon it, the more Legible is his Truth in it: for infiniteneſs of Truth is inſeparable from right Reaſons <hi>Idea</hi> of Deity: and where there is infiniteneſs of Truth, there is no poſſibility of a Lye, Miſtake or Deceit, and where theſe are excluded, there is no room for Heſitance or doubting, but the ſtrongeſt Reaſon imaginable to believe.

               <p n="2">2. Whereunto alſo we are yet farther obliged, by <hi>the Satisfaction which our Redemption by Chriſt affords us.</hi> Such is the Nature of our Souls, as that the difference of Man from other living Creatures, may as well, perhaps better be expreſſed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition by the word <hi>Religious,</hi> than <hi>Rational:</hi> the Reaſon is, becauſe other Creatures ſeem in ſome meaſure to partake of Reaſon, but not at all of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. That there are ſome Footſteps of Reaſon, ſome ſtrictures and emiſſions of Ratiocination in the Actions of ſome Brutes, is too Vulgarly known and too commonly granted to be doubted: it ſeems then that not Reaſon in general, but as it doth diſpoſe us to Actions of an higher Nature than thoſe of Brutes, eſpecially thoſe of Religion, is the form of our humane Nature. This is it that doth conſtitute us Men and moſt of all diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh us from other Animals. And well may the honour of this diſtinction be caſt upon Religion rather than Reaſon, not only becauſe it ſets us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from Brutes than that doth without it, but alſo becauſe it is as inſeparable from our Nature as that is: for no Creature that knoweth it ſelf to be ſo, can be reaſonable without owning it ſelf
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48734:143"/>
obliged to love, reverence and worſhip its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: Hence I ſuppoſe it is, that the Principles and Foundations of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Being of a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and of a future ſtate or judgment, are ſo firmly laid in all mankind (and in no Creature below it) as that the utmoſt endeavours that can be uſed, are inſufficient wholly to race them out, or utterly to ſuppreſs their Energy. Whence elſe is it, that ſomtimes when there is no apparent danger, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Atheiſts are ſubject to fears as well as other Men? or whence elſe is it that it is almoſt as eaſy to find a Nation without Souls, as without all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? theſe things would be unaccountable, if Religion were not Eſſential to our Nature, as well as Reaſon. If then ſo it be, manifeſt it is that a Religion we muſt have; for we cannot be happy becauſe our Souls will not be ſatisfyed without it: and foraſmuch as we aime at ſome good (as our End) in all our Actions, and thoſe of Religion are converſant (not about the little low things of the World, but) about God himſelf and the things that are his, it is alſo manifeſt, that we can therein regularly aim at nothing leſs than ſome Good or Perfection which this World cannot afford, and God only can give: and what can this be but the ſupreme Bliſs and Happineſs whereof our Nature is capable? This then is it which we except to obtain by Religion: and difficult it is for the mind of Man to pitch upon a Religion which his own Reaſon will think in all points ſufficient for this End, for this it cannot judge any Religion to be, unleſs it ſhews us a likely way to Happineſs, and removes the Impediments or obſtructions that therein are unto it.</p>
               <p>The way that to our Reaſon ſeems likely to lead
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48734:144"/>
us to Happineſs muſt of neceſſity lie thorow Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: the Reaſon is, becauſe perfect Righteouſneſs and Integrity in all our Actions, was the way that was made and ordained in our Creation; and our Souls retain ſo much of their Primitive conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that (though by our fall we are ſo bruiſed and maimed as that we cannot walk in it, yet) our Reaſon cannot fully aſſent to any way that leads not to it, there is a kind of Reluctance in Reaſon againſt it: our own Natural Conſcience cannot be fully perſuaded that Happineſs can be attained without Holineſs: it is true indeed, Men that live in Notorious Wickedneſs, by the wind of Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm may be blown up into an Opinion of their own Saintſhip, and confidence of their Salvation; but if the power of imagination did not ſuppreſs their Reaſon and put it to ſilence, their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would ſoon tell them, that they cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards Heaven by their verbal Religion, while they go towards Hell by Wickedneſs of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the way therefore that ſeems likely unto Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to carry us unto Happineſs, muſt guide us unto and keep us in the paths of Holineſs: yet withall, if it deals impartially it will tell us that we cannot therein ſo walk as by walking to attain to that end of our journey, becauſe (as we are thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced) we ſhall ſtumble into Sin, and by ſo doing ſhall fall ſhort of Eternal Glory: for Eternal life (as we have already ſaid,) is ſo far from being a Reward that in Juſtice is due to our works, as that we cannot Reaſonably expect, that God (on whoſe very Being as well as Honour, we have made moſt odious attempts by our Sins,) ſhould ever be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (without Atonement and Satisfaction) either to give, or again to profer it unto us. And indeed,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48734:144"/>
ſhould our own ſelf-love flatter us into a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that God is willing we ſhould be ſaved; yet if there be no way made for our Salvation, but what was at firſt ordained in our Creation, our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would teach us, that we ſhould be never the nigher; for our Souls being fettered to That that is fading, and inſlaved to divers Luſts, cannot poſſibly inable us therein to walk to Eternal Happineſs, but of neceſſity we ſhould relapſe into our former ſtate of Nature ſince the Fall of our firſt Parents. By this diſcourſe then it appears, that That Religion which we rationally make choice of to bring us to the ſupream End of our Being and Actions, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Life and Glory, muſt of neceſſity do theſe three things for us, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt it muſt ſhew us a ſufficient Atonement or Satisfaction made for our ſins paſt, preſent, and to come. Secondly, it muſt lead us unto Vertue and all Holineſs of living. Thirdly, it muſt diſpoſe us ſo to follow it, as that with God we may find acceptance.</p>
               <p>Where then ſhall we find a Religion that upon a juſt and impartial examination may in reaſon be judged ſufficient for theſe things? Shall we ſeek it among the Gentiles? Alas their Wiſdome is but fooliſhneſs, their knowledge of God but Ignorance, their way of worſhip and exerciſe of Religion, Profaneneſs; their vertue, unholineſs, and their ſtrength Weakneſs in reſpect of that that is requiſite for us: And as for the atonements and Satisfactions they make to God for their offences, who ſo weak ſighted as not to ſee the ſhortneſs and vanity of their Sacrifices and Luſtrations? they exceed not the power of corrupted and enfeebled Nature, which by theſe means ſtrives to caſt off the burdens of guilt, that it groans under: They are
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48734:145"/>
therefore at beſt but implorations of Mercy, and ſo no Satisfactions to injured Juſtice: in them therefore men can reaſonably put no confidence. Much more unlikely is it, that our anxious Souls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What he hath done being our duty, how plainly doth it lead us unto Holineſs? But, but what we can do, being a condition of our Salvation, how graciouſly doth it ſtoop to our infirmities?

               <p>Eſpecially conſidering that the Religion therein recommended unto us, doth not only lead us unto holineſs, but alſo (more than any other whatever) it doth diſpoſe us to follow it; becauſe it is taught us by an Example: for, Examples we know (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of thoſe whoſe actions may be thought to warrant ours) have the force of Natural Agents, as well as Moral. Commands do oblige, and Promiſes do perſwade us to obedience; but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples do (in ſome ſort) conſtrain and drive us to an Imitation: The reaſon I ſuppoſe is, becauſe Example makes its way to the Affections, not only by the Underſtanding, but alſo by Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Such is the force of prevalent Affection, as that out of the abundance of the Heart the Eye looketh, the Foot walketh, and indeed the whole Man moveth as well as the Mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And obſervable it is, that there is a kind of plaſtick power in Imagination, whereby it ſhapes and forms a man as much as may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity likeneſs or reſemblance of the image of perſons or things therein lodged by a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and this is apt much more vigorouſly to incite the Affections, than bare Precepts can do to a proſecution.
