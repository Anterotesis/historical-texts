            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REVIEW
OF THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
which those who
plead in any sense for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto, it is not the
least, that in their arguings
and Pleas they are enforced to admit a
Supposition, That those whom they plead
for, are indeed really <hi>mistaken in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi>
about the matters concerning
which they yet desire to be <hi>indulged</hi> in their
practice. For unless they will give place
to such a supposition, or if they will rigidly
contend that what they plead in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58629:3"/>
of, is absolutely the Truth, and that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
thereunto, is the direct Will and
Command of God, there remains no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
field for the Debate about <hi>Indulgence</hi>
to be mannaged in. For things acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be such, are not capable of an
Indulgence properly so called; because the
utmost Liberty that is necessary unto them,
is their Right and Due in strict Justice
and Law. Men therefore in such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
speak not to the nature of the
things themselves, but to the Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them with whom they have to do.
But yet against this Disadvantage every
Party which plead for themselves, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by that secret reserve that they have
in the perswasion of the Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of what they profess, and desire to be
indulged in the practice of. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as occasion doth offer it self, and in
the defence of themselves from the charge
of their Adversaries, they openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and avow. Neither was it judged
formerly, that there was any way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of this Reserve and Relief,
but by a direct and particular Debate of
the matters specially in difference, carried
on unto their Conviction by evidence of
Truth, managed from the Common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of it. But after Tryal made, this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58629:3"/>
way to convince men of their errors and
mistakes, who stand in need of Indulgence
with respect unto the outward Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the powers that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is found, as it should seem, tedious,
unreasonable, and ineffectual. A new way
therefore to this purpose is fixed on, and
it is earnestly pleaded, That there needs
no other Argument or <hi>Medium</hi> to prove
men to be mistaken in their Apprehensions,
and to miscarry in their practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duties, than that at any time, or in
any place they stand in need of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
To <hi>Dissent,</hi> at all adventures, is a crime;
and he whom others persecute, tacitly at
least, confesseth himself guilty. For it is said,
That the Law of the Magistrate being
the sole Rule of Obedience in Religious
Worship, their <hi>Non-complyance</hi> with any
Law by him established, evidencing it self
in their desire of Exemption, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
conviction, yea a self-acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not only of their Errors and Mistakes
in what they apprehend of their Duty in
these things, and of their Miscarriages in
what they practise, but also that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are persons <hi>Turbulent and Seditious</hi> in
withdrawing Obedience from the Laws
which are justly imposed on them. With
what Restrictions and Limitations, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58629:4"/>
with any or no, these Assertions are
maintained, we shall afterward enquire.</p>
            <p>The Management of this Plea, (if I
greatly mistake him not) is one of the
principal Designs of the Author of that
Discourse, a brief <hi>Survey</hi> whereof is here
proposed, The Principle which he proceeds
herein upon, himself it seems knew to be
Novel and Uncouth, and therefore thought
it incumbent on him, that both the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of its handling, and the other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that he judged meet to associate with
it, or annex unto it, should be of the same
kind and complexion. This Design hath
at length produced us this Discourse;
which of what use it may prove to the
Church of God, what tendency it may
have to retrive or promote Love and
Peace among Christians, I know not. This
I know, that it hath filled many persons of
all sorts with manifold surprizals, and
some with amazement. I have therefore
on sundry Considerations, prevailed with
my self much against my inclinations, for
the sake of Truth and Peace, to spend a
few hours in the examination of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
parts and seeming pillars of the
whole Fabrick. And this I was in my own
mind the more easily indueed unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no concernment either of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58629:4"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State</hi> in the things here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
debate, unless it be, that they should
be vindicated from having any concern in
the things and opinions here pleaded and
argued. For as to the present Church, if
the Principles and reasonings here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and managed, are agreeable unto
her Sentiments, and allowed by her; yet
there can be no offence given in their Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
because she hath no where yet
declared them so to be. And the truth is,
if they are once owned and espoused by
her, to the ends for which they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
as the Christians of old triumphed
in the thoughts of him, who first engaged
in wayes of violence against them among
the Nations in the world, so the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
will have no small relief to their
minds in their sufferings, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
these to be the avowed Principles and
Grounds, on which they are to be perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
and destroyed. And for the power
of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> belonging to the
Kings of this Nation, as it hath been
claimed and exercised by them in all ages
since the establishment of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among us, as it is declared in the Laws,
Statutes, and Customs of the Kingdom,
and prescribed unto an Acknowledgement
in the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> it
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                  <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58629:5"/>
and steddiness of expression, which we
shall be farther accustomed unto. But in
what here he avers of himself, he seems to
have the advantage of our Lord Jesus
Christ, who upon less provocations than
he hath undertaken the consideration of
(<hi>for the Pharisees with whom he had to deal,
were Gentlemen be tells us, unto those with
whom himself hath to do</hi>) as he saith, <hi>fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an hot fit of Zeal, yea, into an height of
Impatience, which made him act with a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fury, and transport of passion,</hi> pag. 7.
And if that be indeed his temper which
he commends in himself, he seems to me
to be obliged for it unto his Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and <hi>Complexion,</hi> as he speaks, and not to
his Age; seeing his juvenile expressions
and confidence, will not allow us to think
that he suffers under any defervescency
of spirit by his years. The <hi>Philosopher</hi>
tells us, that <hi>old men</hi> in matters dubious
and weighty, are not over-forward to be
Positive, but ready to cry, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
and it may be so, and this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
because they have <hi>experience</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of things in this world. As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
those who know what entanglements
all humane Affairs are attended withal,
what appearing Causes and probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are to be considered and examined
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58629:5"/>
about them, and how all rational determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are guided and influenced by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen
emergencies and occasions, will
not be over-forward to pronounce abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and peremptorily about the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of important affairs. But as the same
Author informs us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
<hi>Young men suppose that they know
all things, and are vehement in their Asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi>
from which frame proceed all those
Dogmatical Assertions of what is <hi>Politick,</hi>
and <hi>Impolitick</hi> in Princes, of what will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
or ruine Governments, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Conceptions of others about
things conducing to publick peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
which so frequently occur in our
Author. This makes him smile at as seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Consultations for the furtherance of
the welfare and prosperity of this Nation,
as it may be in any age, or juncture of
time have been upon the Wheel, <hi>Preface
p.</hi> 48. These Considerations made it seem
to me, that in an ordinary course, he hath
time enough before him to improve the
notions he hath here blessed the World
with a discovery of; if upon second
thoughts he be equally enamoured of them
unto what now he seems to be.</p>
            <p>I could indeed have desired, that he
had given us a more clear account of that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58629:6"/>
               <hi>Religion</hi> which in his judgement he doth
most approve. His commendation of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> sufficiently manifesteth
his interest to lye therein; and that in
pursuit of his own principles he doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
observe the Institutions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of it. But the <hi>Scheme</hi> he hath
given us of Religion, or Religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
wherein there is mention neither of
Sin, nor a Redeemer, without which no
man can entertain any one true notion of
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> would rather bespeak
him a Philosopher, than a Christian. It
is not unlikely, but that he will pretend he
was treating of Religion, <hi>as</hi> Religion in
general, without an Application of it to
this or that in particular; but to speak of
Religion as it is among men in this world,
or ever was since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a supposition of sin, and the way of
a relief from the Event of it mentioned, is
to talk of <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> things that neither
are, ever were, or will be. On the other
hand the profit and advantage of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
falls clearly on the <hi>Papal</hi> Interest. For
whereas it is framed and contrived for the
advantage, security, and unquestionable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of absolute Complyers with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Possessors of Power, it is evident, that
in the States of <hi>Europe,</hi> the advantage lyes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58629:6"/>
incomparably on that hand. But these
things are not our Concernment. The
design which he manageth in his Discourse,
the subject matter of it, the manner how
he treats those with whom he hath to do,
and deports himself therein, are by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
exposed to the judgement of all, and
are here to be taken into some Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now because we have in his <hi>Preface</hi>
a perfect Representation of the things last
mentioned throughout the whole, I shall in
the first place take a general view and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of it.</p>
            <p>And here I must have regard to the
Judgement of others. I confess for my
own part I do not find my self at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in those <hi>Invectives, tart and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Expressions,</hi> those <hi>sharp and twinging Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
against his Adversaries, which he avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or rather boasteth himself to have used.
If this unparalleld heap of Revilings,
Scoffings, despightful Reproaches, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casms,
Scornful contemptuous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
false Criminations, with frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations
of Sanguinary affections towards
them, do please his Fancy, and express his
Morality to his own Satisfaction, I shall
never complain that he hath used his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and do presume that he judgeth it
not meet that it should be restrained. It

            <p>Yet some Instances of Prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
in this Kind, will in our Process be
reflected on. And it may be the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them may make an appearance unto
some less considerate Readers, of a little
Harshness in some passages of this return.
But as nothing of that nature in the least
is intended, nothing that might provoke
the Author in his own spirit, were he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any hot impressions, nothing to
disadvantage him in his Reputation or
esteem, so what is spoken being duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will be found to have nothing sharp or
unpleasant in it, but what is unavoidably
infused into it from the discourse it self,
in its approach unto it to make a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of it.</p>
            <p>It is of more Concernment to consider
with what frame and temper of Spirit he
manageth his whole Cause and Debate;
and this is such as that a man who knows
nothing of him, but what he learns from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58629:7"/>
this Discourse, would suppose that he hath
been some great Commander,

blew away and scattered all the Legions of his

            <p>Such Confidence in himself and his own
strength, such contempt of all his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as persons <hi>Silly, Ignorant, Illiterate,</hi> such
boastings of his Atchievments, with such a
face and appearance of scorning all that
shall rise up against him; such expressions
<hi>animi gladiatorii</hi> doth he march withall, as
no man sure will be willing to stand in his
way, unless he think himself to have lived,
at least quietly, long enough. Only some
things there are, which I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in his undertaking and management of
it; as first, that such a Man of Arms and
Art as he is, should harness himself with so
much preparation, and enter the Lists with
so much pomp and glory, to combat such
pittiful poor baffled <hi>Ignoramus's</hi> as he hath
chosen to contend withall; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idering
that he knew he had them bound
hand and foot, and cast under his strokes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58629:8"/>
at his pleasure. Methinks it had more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him, to have sought out some Giant in
Reason and Learning, that might have
given him at least <hi>par animo periculum,</hi> as
<hi>Alexander</hi> said in his conflict with <hi>Porus,</hi>
a danger big enough to exercise his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
though through mistake it should in
the issue have proved but a <hi>Wind-mill.</hi>
Again! I know not whence it is, nor by
what Rules of <hi>Errantry</hi> it may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
that being to conflict such <hi>pittiful
trifles,</hi> he should before he come near to
touch them, thunder out such terrible
words, and load them with so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and contemptuous Revilings, as if
he designed to scare them out of the
Lists, that there might be no tryal of his
strength, nor exercise of his skill.</p>
            <p>But leaving him to his own choice and
liberty in these matters, I am yet perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that if he knew how little his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
esteem themselves concerned in, or
worsted by his Revilings, how small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
he hath brought unto the cause
managed by him, with what severity of
Censures, that I say not Indignation, his
proceedings herein are reflected on by
persons Sober and Learned, who have any
respect to modesty or sobriety, or any
reverence for the things of God, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58629:8"/>
among men, he would abate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of that self-delight and satisfaction
which he seems to take in his Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Neither
is it in the matter of <hi>Dissent</hi>
alone from the established Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that this Author, and some others,
endeavour by their Revilings and Scoffings
to expose <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to scorn and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
but a semblance at least is made of
the like Reflections on their whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Gospel, and their Worship
of God; Yea these are the special subjects
of those swelling words of contempt, those
farcastical invidious Representations of
what they oppose, which they seem to place
their confidence of success in; But what
do they think to effect by this Course of
proceedure? do they suppose that by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>canting, phrases, silly, non-sense, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,</hi>
they shall shame the <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
out of the Profession of the Gospel,
or make them foregoe the course of their
Ministry, or alienate one soul from the
Truth taught and profest amongst them?
They know how their Predecessours in the
faith thereof, have been formerly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the World: St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a <hi>Babler,</hi> or one that <hi>Canted;</hi> his Doctrine
despised as <hi>silly</hi> and <hi>foolish,</hi> and his <hi>Phrase's</hi>
pretended to be Unintelligible. These
things move not the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> unless
it be to a Compassion for them whom they
fee to press their Wits and Parts to so
wretched an employment. If they have
any thing to charge on them with respect
to <hi>Gospel-truths,</hi> as that they own, teach,
preach, or publish any Doctrines, or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
that are not agreeable thereunto, and
Doctrine of the Antient, and late (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
Churches, let them come forth, if
they are men of Learning, Reading, and
Ingenuity, and in wayes used and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the beginning of Christianity for
such ends and Purposes, endeavour their
Confutation and Conviction; let them I
say with the Skill and Confidence of Men,
and according to all rules of Method and
Art, state the matters in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
themselves and their Adversaries,
confirm their own judgements with such
Reasons and Arguments as they think
pleadable in their behalf, and oppose the
Opinions they condemn with testimonies
and reasons suited to their Eversion. The
course at present steered and engaged in,
to carpe at phrases, expressions, manners
of the Declaration of mens conceptions,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58629:9"/>
collected from, or falsly fathered upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, thence intimated to be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon
to the whole party of <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
(the greatest guilt of some whereof, it may be
is only their too near approach to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
used in the Scripture to the same
purpose, and the evidence of their being
educed from thence) is unmanly, unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
persons of any philosophick generosity,
much more Christians and Ministers; nay
some of the things or sayings reflected on,
and carped at by a late Author, are such, as
those who have used or asserted them,
dare modestly challenge him in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to make good his charge in a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
conference, provided it may be <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical,</hi>
or <hi>Logical,</hi> not <hi>Dramatick</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick.</hi>
And surely were it not for their
Confidence in that <hi>Tame and Patient Humour,</hi>
which this Author so tramples upon, <hi>p.</hi> 15.
they could not but fear that some or other
by these disingenuous proceedings might
be provoked to a Recrimination, and to
give in a Charge against the cursed Oaths,
Debaucheries, Profaneness, various Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
and sottish Ignorance, that are
openly and notoriously known to have
taken up their residence among some
of those persons, whom the Railleries
of this and some other Authors are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58629:10"/>
designed to countenance and secure.</p>
            <p>Because we may not concern our selves
again in things of this nature, let us take
an Instance or two of the manner of the
dealing of our Author with <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
and those as to their <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi>
which of all things they are principally
maligned about; For their <hi>Preaching</hi> he
thus sets it out, p. 75. <hi>Whoever among them
can Invent any new Language presently sets up
for a Man of new Discoveries, and he that
lights upon the prettyest non-sense, is thought
by the Ignorant Rabble to unfold new Gospel
Mysteries, and thus is the Nation shattered into
infinite factions with senseless and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
phrases; and the most fatal miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of them all lyes in abusing Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
not only without, but in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to their sense; so that had we but an
Act of Parliament to abridge Preachers the use
of fulsome and luscious Metaphors, it might
perhaps be an effectual cure of all our present
Distempers. Let not the Reader smile at the
Oddness of the proposal; for were men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to speak sense as well as Truth, all the
swelling mysteries of Phanaticism would then
sink into flat and empty non-sense; and they
would be ashamed of such jejune and ridiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
stuff as their admired and most profound
nations would appear to be.</hi> Certainly there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58629:10"/>
are few who read these expressions that
can retain themselves from <hi>smiling</hi> at the
pittiful phantastick souls that are here cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized;
or from loathing their way of
Preaching here represented. But yet if
any should by a surprizal indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
herein, and one should seriously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what it is that stirred those humours
in them, it may be they could scarce return
a rational account of their Commotions:
For when they have done their utmost to
countenance themselves in their scorn and
derision, they have nothing but the bare
Assertions of this Author for the proof of
what is here charged on those whom they
deride; And how if these things are most
of them, if not all of them absolutely false?
how if he be not able to prove any of
them by any considerable avowed instance?
How if all the things intended whether
they be so or no as here represented, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
meerly on the judgement and fancy
of this Author, and it should prove in the
issue that they are no such rules, measures,
or standards of mens rational expressions of
their Conceptions, but that they may be
justly appealed from? and how if sundry
things so odiously here expressed, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have been sober Truths declared in
words of Wisdom and Sobriety? What if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58629:11"/>
the things condemned as <hi>fulsome Metaphors</hi>
prove to be Scriptural expressions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Mysteries? What if the principal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel about the grace of
God, the Mediation of Christ, of Faith,
Justification, Gospel-obedience, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, and Union with Christ, are
esteemed and stigmatized by some as <hi>swell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mysteries of Fanaticism;</hi> and the whole
work of our Redemption by the blood of
Christ as expressed in the Scripture, be
deemed <hi>Metaphorical?</hi> In brief, What if
all this Discourse concerning the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> be, as unto the
sense of the words here used, false, and
the Crimes in them injuriously charged
upon them? What if the <hi>Metaphors</hi> they
are charged with, are no other but their
expression of Gospel Mysteries <hi>not in the
words which mans wisdom teacheth, but which
the Holy-Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual
things with Spiritual?</hi> As these things may
and will be made evident when particulars
shall be instanced in. When I say these
things are discovered and laid open, there
will be a composure possibly of those affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and disdainful thoughts, which
these swelling words may have moved in
weak and unexperienced minds. It may be
also it will appear that upon a due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58629:11"/>
there will be little subject matter
remaining to be Enacted in that Law or
<hi>Act of Parliament</hi> which he moves for; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be from that uncouth motion that
men may be <hi>obliged to speak sense as well as
truth;</hi> seeing hitherto it hath been suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that every Proposition that is either
true or false, hath a proper and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sense; and if sense it have not, it can
be neither. I shall only crave leave to say,
that as to the Doctrine which they Preach,
and the manner of their Preaching, or the
way of expressing those Doctrines or
Truths which they believe and teach, the
<hi>Non-Conformists</hi> appeal from the rash, false,
and invidious charge of this Author, to
the judgement of all learned, judicious
and pious men in the world; and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to defend them against himself, and
whosoever he shall take to be his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
or his Associates, before any equal,
competent, and impartial Tribunal under
Heaven. It is far from me to undertake
the absolute defence of any party of men,
or of any man because he is of any party
whatever; much less shall I do so of all the
individual persons of any party, and least of
all, as to all their Expressions, private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and peculiar ways of declaring them,
which too much abound among persons of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58629:12"/>
all sorts. I know there is no party, but
have weak men belonging to it; nor any
men amongst them but have their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
failings and mistakes. And if there
are none such in the <hi>Churcb of England,</hi> I
mean those that universally comply with
all the Observances at present used there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I am sure enough that there are so
amongst all other parties that dissent from
it. But such as these are not principally
intended in these aspersio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: nor would
their Adversaries much rejoyce to have
them known to be, and esteemed of all
what they are. But it is others whom
they aim to expose unto contempt; and
in the behalf of them, not the mistakes,
misapprehensions, or undue expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of any private persons, these things
are pleaded.</p>
            <p>But let us see, if their <hi>Prayers</hi> meet with
any better entertainment; an Account of
his thoughts about them he gives us, p. 19.
<hi>It is the most solemn strain of their devotion to
vilifie themselves with large Confessions of the
hainousest and most aggravated sins: They will
freely acknowledge their Offences against all the
Commands, and that with the foulest and most
enhancing circumstances; they can rake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and confess their injustice, uncleanness
and extortion, and all the Publican and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58629:12"/>
sins in the world; In brief, in all their
Confessions, they stick not to charge themselves
with such large Catalogues of sin, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass
together such as heap of Impieties, as
would make up the compleatest character of
lewdness and villany; and if their Consciences
do really arraign them of all those crimes
whereof they so familiarly indite themselves,
there are no such guilty and unpardonable
Wretches as they: So that their Confessions are
either true or false; if false, then they fool
and trifle with the Almighty; if true, then I
could easily tell them the fittest place to say their
prayers in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess this passage at its first perusal
surprized me with some amazement. It was
unexpected to me, that he who designed all
along to charge his Adversaries with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaism,</hi>
and to render them like unto them,
should instance in their <hi>Confession of Sin</hi> in
their prayers, when it is even a <hi>Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical</hi>
note of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that in their
prayers they made no confession of sin at
all. But it was far more strange to me,
that any man durst undertake the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
of poor sinners with the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
acknowledgement of their sins before
the holy God, that they are capable to
conceive or utter. Is this, thought I, the
Spirit of the men with whom the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58629:13"/>
do contend, and upon whose
Instance alone they suffer? Are these their
Apprehensions concerning God, sin, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others? Is this the Spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Children of the Church are acted?
Are these things suited to the principles,
Doctrines, practices of the Church of
<hi>England?</hi> Such reproaches and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
indeed, might have been justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from those poor deluded souls, who
dream themselves <hi>perfect</hi> and free from sin;
but to meet with such a Treaty from them
who say or sing, <hi>O God the Father of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
have mercy upon us miserable sinners,</hi> at
least three times a Week, was some sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal.
However I am sure, the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
need return no other answer to
them who reproach them for vilifying
themselves in their Confessions to God,
but that of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Michal, It is before the
Lord, and we will yet be more vile than thus,
and will be base in our own sight.</hi> Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
makes no small stir with the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
censures of some whom he opposes;
namely, that they should <hi>esteem themselves
and their Party to be the Elect of God, all
others to be reprobates, themselves and theirs
to be godly, and all others ungodly;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I am satisfied, that he unduely chargeth
those whom he intends to reflect upon:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58629:13"/>
However I am none of them; I do not
judge any <hi>Party</hi> to be <hi>All</hi> the Elect of God,
or all the Elect of God to be confined unto
any Party; I judge no man living to be a
<hi>Reprobate,</hi> though I doubt not but that
there are living men in that condition; I
confine not holiness or godliness to any
Party; not to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> nor
to any of those who dissent from it;
but am perswaded that in all Societies of
Christians that are under Heaven that hold
the head, there are some really fearing
God, working righteousness, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him. But yet neither my own
judgement, nor the Reflections of this
Author, can restrain me from professing
that I fear that he who can thus trample
upon men, scoff at and deride them for the
deepest Confessions of their sins before
God, which they are capable of making,
is scarce either well acquainted with the
holiness of God, the evil of sin, or the
deceitfulness of his own heart, or did not
in his so doing, take them into sufficient
consideration. The <hi>Church of England</hi> it self
requires its Children to <hi>acknowledge their
manifold sins and wickednesses, which from
time to time they have grievously committed by
thought, word and deed, against the Divine
Majesty;</hi> and what in general, others can
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58629:14"/>
confess more, I know not. If men that
are through the light of Gods Spirit and
Grace, brought to an acquaintance with the
deceitful workings of sin in their own
hearts, and the hearts of others, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
aright the <hi>terror of the Lord,</hi> and
the manifold aggravations wherewith all
their sins are attended, do more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
express these things before, and
to the Lord, when indeed nor they, nor
any other can declare the thousandth part
of the vileness and unworthiness of sin and
sinners on the account thereof, shall they
be now despised for it, and judged to be
men meet to be hanged? If this Author
had but seriously perused the Confessions
of <hi>Austin,</hi> and considered how he traces his
sin from his nature in the womb, through
the Cradle, into the whole course of his
life, with his marvellous and truly inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
acknowledgements and aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of it, perhaps the Reverence of so
great a name might have caused him to
suspend this rash, and I fear, impious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>For
the particular instances wherewith
he would countenance his Sentiments and
Censures in this Matter, there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in their removal. Our Lord Jesus
Christ hath taught us, to call the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58629:14"/>
workings of sin in the heart, though
resisted, though controlled, and never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to bring forth, by the names of
those sins which they lye in a tendency
unto; and men in their Confessions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
more the pravity of their natures,
and the inward working and actings of sin,
than the outward perpetrations of it,
wherein perhaps they may have little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
in the world; as <hi>Job</hi> who plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his uprightness, integrity, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
against the charge of all his friends,
yet when he came to deal with God, he
could take that prospect of his Nature and
heart, as to <hi>vilifie himself</hi> before him, <hi>yea to
abhor himself in dust and ashes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Ministers who are the Mouths of
the Congregation to God, may, and ought
to acknowledge, not only the sins whereof
themselves are personally guilty, but those
also which they judge may be upon any
of the Congregation. This assuming of
the persons of them to whom they speak,
or in whose name they speak, is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
even to the Sacred Writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
So speaks the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi>
1 Epist. 4. 3. <hi>For the time past of our lives
may suffice us, to have wrought the will of the
Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58629:15"/>
and abominable idolatries.</hi> He puts himself
amongst them, although the time past of
his life in particular was remote enough
from being spent in the manner there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed:
And so it may be with Ministers
when they confess the sins of the whole
Congregation. And the <hi>Dilemma</hi> of this
Author about the truth or falshood of these
Confessions, will fall as heavy on St. <hi>Paul</hi>
as on any <hi>Non-Conformist</hi> in the world. For
besides the acknowledgement that he
makes of the former sins of his life when
he was <hi>injurious,</hi> a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> and <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
(which sins I pray God deliver others
from) and the secret working of in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
sin, which he cryes out in his present
condition to be freed from; he also when
an Apostle professeth himself the <hi>chiefest of
sinners;</hi> Now this was either true, or it
was not; if it was not true, God was
mocked; if it were, our Author could have
directed him to the fittest place to have
made his acknowledgements in. What
thinks he of the Confessions of <hi>Ezra,</hi> of
<hi>Daniel</hi> and others in the name of the whole
people of God? Of <hi>David</hi> concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whose self-abasements before the Lord,
acknowledgements of the guilt of sin in all
its Aggravations and Effects, far exceed
any thing that <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> are able to
express.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58629:15"/>
As to his Instances of the Confession of
<hi>injustice, uncleanness,</hi> and <hi>extortion,</hi> it may
be as to the first and last, he would be put
to it to make it good by express particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
and I wish it be not found that some
have need to confess them, who cry at
present, they are not as these Publicans.
<hi>Vncleanness</hi> seems to bear the worst sound,
and to lead the mind to the worst appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of all the rest; but it is God with
whom men have to do in their Confessions;
and before him, <hi>What is man that he should
be clean, and he that is born of a woman, that
he should be righteous? Behold he putteth no
trust in his Saints, and the Heavens are not
clean in his sight, and how much more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and filthy is man, who drinketh in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
like water,</hi> Job. 15. and the whole
Church of God in their Confession cry
out, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all
our Righteousnesses are as filthy raggs,</hi> Isa. 54.
There is a Pollution of Flesh and Spirit,
which we are still to be cleansing our
selves from whilst we are in this world.</p>
            <p>But to what purpose is it to contend
about these things? I look upon this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of our Author as a signal instance
of the power of prejudice and passions
over the minds of men. For setting aside
the consideration of a present influence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58629:16"/>
from them, I cannot believe that any one
that professeth the Religion taught by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and contained in the Scripture,
can be so ignorant of the terror of the
Lord, so unaccustomed to thoughts of his
infinite Purity, Severity and Holiness, such
a stranger to the Accuracy, Spirituality, and
Universality of the Law, so unacquainted
with the sin of Nature, and the hidden
deceitful workings of it in the hearts,
minds and affections of men, so senseless of
the great guilt of the least sin, and the
manifold inexpressible aggravations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is attended, so unexercised to that
self-abasement and abhorrency which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
poor sinners in their approaches to
the holy God, when they consider what
they are in themselves, so disrespective of
the price of Redemption that was paid
for our sins, and the mysterious way of
cleansing our souls from them by the blood
of the Son of God, as to revile, despise
and scoff at men for the deepest hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings
of their souls before God, in the
most searching and expressive acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements
of their sins, that they do or
can make at any time.</p>
            <p>The like Account may be given of all the
charges that this Author man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ageth against
the men of his indignation; but I shall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58629:16"/>
return at present to the <hi>Preface</hi> under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>In
the entrance of his Discourse, being
as it seems conscious to himself of a
strange and wild intemperance of speech
in reviling his Adversaries, which he had
either used, or intended so to do, he
pleads sundry things in his excuse or for
his justification. Hereof the first is, his
zeal for the Reformation of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and the settlement thereof with
its Forms and Institutions; these he saith
are <hi>countenanced by the best and purest times
of Christianity, and established by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of this Land;</hi> (which yet as to
the things in contest between him and
<hi>Non Conformists</hi> I greatly doubt of, as not
believing any fundamental Law of this
Land to be of so late a date,) to see this
<hi>opposed by a Wild and Fanatick rabble, rifled
by Folly and Ignorance, on slender and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
pretences so often and so shamefully
baffled, yet again revived by the pride and
ignorance of a few peevish, ignorant and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Preachers, brainsick people,</hi> (all which
gentle and peaceable expressions are
crowded together in the compass of a
few lines) is that which hath <hi>chased him into
this heat and briskness;</hi> If this be not to
deal with gain-sayers in a spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58629:17"/>
if herein there be not an observation
of the rules of speaking evil of no man,
despising no man, of not saying <hi>Racha</hi> to
our Brother, or calling of him <hi>Fool;</hi> if here
be not a discovery how remote he is from
self-conceit, elation of mind, and the like
Immoralities, we must make enquiry after
such things elsewhere; for in this whole
ensuing Treatise we shall scarce meet with
any thing more tending to our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the Plea it self made use of, those
whom he so tramples on, do highly honor
the Reformation of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
and bless God for it continually, as that
which hath had a signal tendency unto his
glory, and usefulness to the souls of men.
That as to the outward Rites of Worship
and Discipline contested about, it was in
all things conformed unto the great Rule
of them, our Author doth not pretend;
nor can he procure it in those things,
whatever he sayes, any countenance from
the best and purest times of Christianity:
That it was every way perfect in its first
Edition, I suppose, will not be affirmed;
nor considering the posture of affairs at
the time of its framing both in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and in our own, was it like it should
so be. We may rather admire that so much
was then done according to the Will of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58629:17"/>
God, than that there was no more. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is wanting in it, the fault is not to be
cast on the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> who went as far
as well in those dayes could be expected
from them. Whether others who have
succeeded in their place and room, have
since discharged their duty in perfecting
what was so happily begun, is <hi>sub judice,</hi>
and there will abide, after this Author and
I have done writing. That as to the
things mentioned, it never had an absolute
quiet possession or admittance in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that a constant and no inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Suffrage hath from first to last been
given in against it, cannot be denyed;
and for any <hi>savage worrying</hi> or <hi>rifling of it</hi>
at present, no man is so barbarous as to
give the least countenance to any such
thing. That which is intended in these
exclamations, is only a desire that those
who cannot comply with it as now esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the matters of Discipline and
Worship before mentioned, may not
meerly for that cause be <hi>worried</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
as many have already been.</p>
            <p>Again, the chief glory of the <hi>English
Reformation</hi> consisted in the purity of its
Doctrine, then first restored to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This, as it is expressed in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Religion, and in the publickly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58629:18"/>
Writings of the Bishops and chief
Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is, as
was said, the glory of the English Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
And it is somewhat strange to
me, that whilst one writes against <hi>Original
Sin,</hi> another preaches up <hi>Justification by
Works,</hi> and scoffs at the <hi>Imputation of the
Righteousness of Christ</hi> to them that believe;
yea whilst some can openly dispute against
the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Deity of
Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> whilst Instances
may be collected of some mens impeaching
all the <hi>Articles</hi> almost throughout, there
should be no Reflection in the least on
these things; only those who dissent from
some outward Methods of Worship must
be made the Object of all this wrath and
indignation.</p>
            <q>Quis tulerit Gracehos de seditione querentes?</q>
            <p>Some mens guilt in this Nature, might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind them of pulling out the <hi>be am out
of their own eyes,</hi> than to act with such fury
to pull out the Eyes of others, for the
Motes which they think they espy in them.
But hence is occasion given to pour out
such a storm of fury, conveyed by words
of as great reproach and Scorn, as the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any man I think could suggest, as is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58629:18"/>
not lightly to be met withal: Might our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
be prevailed with to mind the old
rule, <hi>Mitte malè loqui, dic rem ipsam,</hi> these
things might certainly be debated with less
scandal, less mutual offences and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>Anothor account of the Reasons of his
intemperance in these reproaches, supplying
him with an opportunity to encrease them
in number and weight, he gives us <hi>pag. 6.
&amp;</hi> 7. of his Preface, which because it may
well be esteemed a summary representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his way and manner of arguing in
his whole Discourse, I shall transcribe.</p>
            <p>I know, <hi>sayes he,</hi> but one single Instance
in which zeal or a high indignation is just
and warrantable: and that is when it vents it
self against the Arrogance of haughty peevish
and sullen Religionists, that under higher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of godliness supplant all principles of
Civility and good Nature; that strip Religion
of its outside to make it a covering for spight
and malice; that adorn their peevishness with
a mark of piety, and shrowd their ill nature
under the demure pretences of godly zeal, and
stroke and applaud themselves as the only
Darlings and Favourites of Heaven; and with
a scornfull pride disdained all the residue of
mankind as a rout of worthless and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Reprobates. Thus the only hot fit of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58629:19"/>
zeal we find our Saviour in, was kindled by
an indignation against the pride and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Jews, when he whipped the Buyers
and Sellers out of the outward Court of the
Temple; for though they bore a blind and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
reverence towards that part of it
that was peculiar to their own worship, yet as for
the outward Court, the place where the Gentiles
and Proselytes worshipped, that was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elean
and unhallowed, that they thought it
could not be profaned by being turned into an
Exchange of Vsury: Now this insolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Gentiles, and impudent conceit
of their own holiness, provoked the mild Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our blessed Saviour to such an height of
impatience and indignation, as made him
with a seeming fury and transport of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whip the Tradesmen thence, and overthrew
their Tables.</p>
            <p>What Truth, Candor, or Conscience
hath been attended unto in the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Reproaches here heaped up against
his Adversaries, is left to the Judgement
of God and all impartial men; yea let
judgement be made, and sentence be past
according to the wayes, course of life,
conversation, usefulness amongst men,
readiness to serve the common concerns of
mankind, in exercising lovingkindness in
the earth, of those who are thus injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58629:19"/>
traduced, compared with any in the
approbation and commendation of whom
they are covered with these reproaches,
and there lives not that person who may
not be admitted to pronounce concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the equity and righteousness or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of these intemperances. However it
is nothing with them with whom he hath
to do to be judged by mans day; they
stand at the judgement seat of Christ, and
have not so learned him as to relieve
themselves by false or fierce Recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The measure of the covering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for all these excesses of unbridled
passion, is that alone which is now to
be taken. The Case expressed it seems is
the only single instance in <hi>which zeal is just
and warrantable.</hi> How our Author came
to be assured thereof I know not; sure I
am that it doth neither comprize in it, nor
hath any aspect on, the ground, occasion,
or nature of the zeal of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> or of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
or of <hi>David,</hi> or of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> and
least of all of our Saviour as we shall see.
He must needs be thought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intent
upon his present occasion, when
he forgot not one, or two, but indeed all
instances of just and warrantable zeal that
are given us in the only sacred repository
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58629:20"/>
For what concerns the example of our
blessed Saviour particularly insisted on, I
wish he had ossended one way only in the
report he makes of it. For let any sober
man judge in the first place, whether those
expressions he useth of the <hi>hot fit of zeal,</hi>
that He was in, of the <hi>Height of impatience</hi>
that he was provoked unto, the <hi>seeming
Fury and Transport of Passion</hi> that he acted
withall, do become that Reverence and
Adoration of the Son of God which
ought to possess the hearts, and guide the
Tongues and Writings of men that profess
his Name. But whatever other mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
may be, as it is not improbable
but that some will exercise severity in their
Reflections on these Expressions; for my
part; I shall entertain no other thoughts
but that our Author being engaged in the
Composition of an Invective Declamation,
and aiming at a <hi>Gradeur</hi> of Words, yea to
fill it up with <hi>Tragical</hi> expressions, could
not restrain his pen from some extravagant
excess, when the Lord Christ Himself came
in his way to be spoken of.</p>
            <p>However it will be said the Instance is
pertinently alledged, and the occasion of
the Exercise of the zeal of our Blessed
Saviour is duly represented. It may be
some will think so, but the truth is, there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58629:20"/>
are scarce more lines than mistakes in the
whole discourse to this purpose. What
<hi>Court</hi> it was of the Temple wherein the
Action remembred was performed, is not
here particularly determined; only 'tis
said to be the <hi>Outward Court wherein the
Gentiles and Proselytes worshipped in opposition
to that which was peculiar to the worship of the
Jews.</hi> Now of old from the first Erection
of the Temple there were two Courts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
unto it and no more; the inward
Court, wherein were the <hi>Brazen Altar</hi> with
all those Utensils of worship which the
Priests made use of in their sacred Offices;
and the outward Court whither the people
assembled, as for other Devotions, so to
behold the Priests exercising their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to be in a readiness to bring in
their own especial sacrifices, upon which
account they were admitted to the Altar
it self. Into this outward Court which
was a dedicate part of the Temple, all
<hi>Gentiles</hi> who were <hi>Proselytes of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
that is who being circumeised had
taken upon them the Observation of the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and thereby joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the people of God, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as all the Jewish Writers agrree. And
these were all the Courts that were at first
Sanctified, and were in use when the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58629:21"/>
words were spoken by the Prophet, which
are applyed to the Action of our Saviour;
namely, <hi>My house shall be called a House of
Prayer, but ye have made it a Den of Thieves;</hi>
Afterwards in the dayes of the <hi>Herodians</hi>
another Court was added by the immuring
of the remainder of the Hill, whereunto a
promiscuous entrance was granted unto all
people. It was therefore the antient Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Court whereinto the <hi>Jews</hi> thought
that <hi>Paul</hi> had brought <hi>Trophimus the Ephesian,</hi>
whom they knew to be Uncircumcised. I
confess some Expositors think that it was
this latter <hi>Area</hi> from whence the Lord Christ
east out the Buyers and Sellers; but their
Conjecture seems to be altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
for neither was that Court ever ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
called the <hi>Temple,</hi> nor was it
esteemed <hi>Sacred,</hi> but common or Prophane;
nor was it in being when the Prophet used
the words mentioned concerning the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
It was therefore the other antient
outward Court common to the Jews and
<hi>Proselytes</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that is intended;
for as there the Salt and Wood were stored,
that were daily used in their Sacrifices, so
the Covetous Priests knowing that many
who came up to offer, were wont to buy
the beasts they sacrificed at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to
prevent the charge and labour of bringing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58629:21"/>
them from farr; to further as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
their Accommodation, they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
a <hi>Market</hi> to themselves in this
Court, and added a Trade <hi>in money,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
it may be thereunto, and other
things for their Advantage. Hence the
Lord Christ twice drove them; once at the
Beginning, and once at the End of
his Ministry in the flesh; <hi>not with a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Transport of Fury,</hi> but with that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the presence of God with Him,
and Majesty of God upon Him, that it is
usually reckoned amongst one of the
Miracles that he wrought, considering the
state of all things at that time amongst the
Jews. And the reason why He did this,
and the occasion of the exercise of his
Zeal, is so express in the Scripture, as I
cannot but admire at the Invention of our
Author, who could find out another Reason
and Occasion of it. For it is said directly,
that he did it because of their wicked
profanation of the house of God, contrary
to his express Institution and Command;
Of a regard to the Jews contempt of the
Gentiles there is not one word, not the
least Intimation; nor was there in this
matter the least occasion of any such
thing.</p>
            <p>These things are not pleaded in the least,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58629:22"/>
to give countenance to Any, in their proud
supercillious Censures and Contempt of
others, wherein if any person living have
out-done our Author, or shall endeavour
so to do, he will not fail I think to carry
away the prize in this unworthy Contest.
Nor is it to Apologize for them whom he
charges with extravagances and excesses
in this kind. I have no more to say in
their behalf, but that as far as I know, they
are falsly accused and calumniated, though
I will not be accountable for the expessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of every weak and impertinent person.
Where men indeed sin openly in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Transgressions against the Law and
Gospel, where a spirit of enmity to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and obedience unto God discovers and
acts it self constantly on all occasions; in
a word, where men wear Sin's Livery, some
are not afraid to think them Sin's Servants.
But as to that Elation of mind in self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
wherewith they are charged, their
contempt of other men upon the account
of Party which he imputes unto them, I
must expect other proofs than the bare
assertion of this Author before, I shall
joyn with him in the management of his
Accusation. And no other Answer shall I
return to the ensuing Leaves, fraught with
bitter Reproaches, Invectives, Sarcasms, far
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58629:22"/>
enough distant from Truth and all Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Nor shall I though in their just and
necessary vindication, make mention of
any of those things which might represent
them persons of another Complexion. If
this Author will give those whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
most aims to load with these Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
leave to confess themselves poor and
miserable sinners in the sight of God, willing
to bear his indignation against whom they
have finned, and to undergo quietly the
severest Rebukes and Revilings of men, in
that they know not but that they have a
<hi>Providential permissive Commission</hi> from God
so to deal with them, and add thereunto,
that they yet hope to be saved by Jesus
Christ, and in that hope endeavour to give
up themselves in Obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
it contains that Description of
them which they shall alwayes, and in all
conditions endeavour to answer. But I
have only given these Remarks upon the
preceding Discourse, to discover upon
what feeble grounds our Author builds
for his own justification in his present En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
            <p>Pag.
13. of his <hi>Preface,</hi> He declares his
<hi>Original Design</hi> in writing this Discourse,
which was to <hi>represent to the World the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
folly and silliness of those mens
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58629:23"/>
Religion with whom he had to do,</hi> which he
farther expresses and pursues with such a
Lurry of virulent reproaches as I think is
not to be parallel'd in any leaves, but
some others of the same hand; and in the
close thereof he supposeth he hath evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that in comparison of them, <hi>the most
Insolent of the Pharisees were Gentlemen, and
the most savage of the Americans Philosophers.</hi> I
must confess my self an utter stranger unto
that generous disposition and Philosophick
nobleness of mind, which vent themselves
in such revengefull scornfull wrath, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in such rude and barbarous rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
against any sort of men whatever, as
that here manifested in, and those here
used by this Author. If this be a just
delineation and character of the Spirit
of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a due portraicture of the
Mind and Affections of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> I
know not who will be ambitious to be
esteemed either the one or the other.
But what measures men now make of
<hi>Gentility</hi> I know not; truly noble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
of Spirit was heretofore esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to consist in nothing more, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteness
from such <hi>pedantick severities</hi>
against, and contemptuous reproaches of
persons under all manner of disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
yea impossibilities to manage their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58629:23"/>
own just Vindication, as are here exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
and expressed in this Discourse.
And the principal pretended Attainment
of the old <hi>Philosophy,</hi> was a sedateness of
mind, and a freedome from turbulent
Passions and Affections under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Provocations; which if they are
here manifested by our Author, they will
give the greater countenance unto the
Character which he gives of others; the
judgement and determination whereof
is left unto all impatial Readers.</p>
            <p>But in this <hi>main design</hi> he professeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
prevented by the <hi>late Learned and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Discourse, The Friendly Debate;</hi> which
to manifest, it may be, that his <hi>Rhetorical
faculty</hi> is not confined to Invectives, he
spendeth some pages in the splendid <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi>
of. There is no doubt, I suppose
but that the Author of that Discourse, will
on the next occasion require his <hi>Panegyrick,</hi>
and return him his Commendations for his
own Achievements with Advantage; they
are like enough to agree like those of
the Poet,

            <p>Although the particular instances he
gives of the man's successes, are prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
ridiculous, yet the casting up of the
summ Total to the compleating of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
sinks them all out of Consideration:
And such is the Account we have here of
the <hi>Friendly Debate.</hi> This and that it hath
effected, which though unduly asserted as
to the particular Instances, yet altogether
comes short of that absolute Victory and
Triumph which are ascribed unto it. But
I suppose that upon due consideration, mens
glorying in those Discourses, will be but as
the Crackling of thorns in the fire, noise
and smoak without any real and solid use
or satisfaction. The great design of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58629:24"/>
Author, asis apparent unto all, was to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sentiments and Expressions of his
Adversaries <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their persons to contempt and scorn,
<q>Egregiam vero laudem &amp; spolia ampla!</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to this end his way of writing by
<hi>Dialogues</hi> is exceedingly suited and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated:
For although Ingenious and
Learned men, such as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> have
handled matters of the greatest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in that way of writing, candidly-proposing
the Opinions and Arguments of
Adverse parties in the persons of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists,</hi>
and sometimes used that method to
make their design of Instruction more easie
and perspicuous, yet it cannot be denyed
that advantages may be taken from this
way of Writing to represent both Persons,
Opinions, and Practices, invidiously and
contemptuously, above any other way; and
therefore it hath been principally used by
men who have had that Design. And I
know nothing in the skilfull Contrivance
of <hi>Dialogues,</hi> which is boasted of here with
respect unto the <hi>Friendly Debate,</hi> as also by
the Author of it in his Preface to one of
his worthy Volumes, that should free the
way of writing it self, from being supposed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58629:25"/>
to be peculiarly accommodated to the
ends mentioned. Nor will these Authors
charge them with want of skill and art in
composing of their <hi>Dialogues,</hi> who have
designed nothing in them but to render
<hi>Things</hi> uncouth, and <hi>Persons</hi> ridiculous, with
whom themselves were in Worth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
no way to be compared.</p>
            <p>An Instance hereof we have in the case
of <hi>Socrates.</hi> Sundry in the City being
weary of him for his Uprightness, Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and continual pressing of them to
courses of the like nature; some also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an especial manner incensed at him,
and provoked by him; amongst them they
contrived his ruine. That they might
effect this design, they procured <hi>Aristopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
to write a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> his Comoedy which
he entituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Clouds;</hi> wherein
<hi>Socrates</hi> is introduced and personated,
talking at as contemptible and ridiculous
a rate, as any one can represent the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
to do; and yet withal to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
himself as the only man considerable
amongst them. Without some such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the peoples minds, his enemies
thought it impossible to obtain his Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and Destruction; and they failed
not in their Projection. <hi>Aristophanes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poor, witty, and as is supposed hired to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58629:25"/>
this work, layes out the utmost of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
so to frame and order his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi>
with such Elegancy of words, and
Composure of his verses, with such a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of relating the words and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the manner of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as might leave
an impression on the minds of the people.
And the success of it was no way inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to that of the <hi>Friendly Debate;</hi> for
though at first the people were somewhat
surprized with seeing such a person so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
yet they were after a while so
pleased and tickled with the ridiculous
Representation of him and his Philosophy,
wherein there was much of Appearance and
nothing of Truth, that they could make
no end of applauding the Author of the
<hi>Dialogues.</hi> And though this were the known
design of that <hi>Poet,</hi> yet that his <hi>Dialogues</hi>
were <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>inartificial,</hi> I suppose will
not be affirmed; seeing few were ever more
skilfully contrived. Having got this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of exposing him to publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
his provoked malicious Adversaries
began openly to manage their Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against him. The principal Crime laid
to his charge was <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> or that
he did not comply with the Religion which
the Supream Magistrate had enacted; or as
they then phrased it, <hi>he esteemed not them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58629:26"/>
to be Gods whom the City so esteemed.</hi> By
these means, and through these advantages,
they ceased not until they had destroyed
the best and wisest person, that ever that
City bred in its Heathen condition, and
whereof they quickly repented themselves.
The Reader may see the whole story exactly
related in <hi>Aelian. lib. 2. Var. Histor. cap.</hi> 13.
Much of it also may be collected from the
Apologies of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> in behalf
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as also <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his <hi>Genius.</hi> To this purpose have
<hi>Dialogues</hi> very artificially written been used
and are absolutely the most accommodate
of all sorts of writing unto such a design.
Hence <hi>Lucian</hi> who aimed particularly to
render the things which he disliked <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>
and <hi>Contemptible,</hi> used no other kind
of writing; and I think his <hi>Dialogues</hi> will
be allowed to be <hi>Artificial,</hi> though sundry
of them have no other design but to cast
contempt on persons and Opinions better
than himself and his own. And his way
of dealing with Adversaries in points of
Faith, Opinion and Judgement, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been esteemed fitter for the Stage,
than a serious disquisition after Truth, or
Confutation of Error: Did those who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
their own Achievements in this way of
Process, but consider how easie a thing it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58629:26"/>
is for any one, deposing that respect to
Truth, Modesty, Sobriety, and Christianity
which ought to accompany us in all that
we do, to expose the persons and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men by false, partial, undue Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
to scorn and contempt, they
would perhaps cease to glory in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
success. It is a facile thing to take
the wisest man living, and after he is lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigg'd
with Ink and Paper, and gagged
with a Quill, so that he can neither move
nor speak, to clap a Fools Coat on his
back, and turn him out to be laughed at
in the Streets. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> were not the
most contemptible sort of <hi>Philosophers</hi> of
old, nor will not be thought so by those,
who profess their Religion to consist in
<hi>Morality</hi> only. And yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator
in his pleading for <hi>Muraena,</hi> finding it his
present Interest to cast some disreputation
upon <hi>Cato</hi> his Adversary in that cause, who
was addicted to that Sect, so represented
their <hi>Dogmes,</hi> that he put the whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
into a fit of laughter; whereunto
<hi>Cato</hi> only replyed, That he made others
laugh, but was himself Ridiculous; and
it may be some will find it to fall out not
much otherwise with themselves by that
time the whole account of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
is well cast up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58629:27"/>
Besides, do these men not know, that if
others would employ themselves in a work
of the like kind by way of Retortion and
Recrimination, that they would find real
matter amongst some whom they would
have esteemed sacred, for an ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
to exercise it self upon unto their
disadvantage? But what would be the issue
of such proceedings? Who would be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by it? Every thing that is professed
among them that own Religion, all wayes
and means of their Profession, being by
their mutual Reflections of this kind, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
riciculous, what remains but that
men fly to the Sanctuary of <hi>Atheism</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
themselves from being scoffed at and
despised as fools. On this account alone
I would advise the Author of our late <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi>
to surcease proceeding in the same
kind, lest a provocation unto a Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should befall any of those who are so
fouly aspersed.</p>
            <p>But, as I said, what will be the end of
these things, namely of mutual virulent
reflections upon one another? Shall this
<hi>Sword devour for ever? And will it not be
bitterness in the latter end?</hi> For, as he said
of old of persons contending with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings;

criminal, yea detestable? Will this
way of proceeding compose and satisfie
the minds of men? If there be no other
way for a <hi>Coalescence</hi> in love and unity in

Non-conformists do depose and change in
a moment, as it were, their thoughts, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
and Judgements about the
things in difference amongst us, which they
cannot, which is not in their power to do;
or that in the presence, and with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
respect unto the eye and regard of
God, they will act contrary unto them,
which they ought not, which they dare
not, no not upon the present instruction,
the state of these things is somewhat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable.</p>
            <p>That alone which in the Discourses men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
seemeth to me of any considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if it have any thing of truth to give
it countenance, is that the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
under pretence of preaching <hi>Mysteries</hi> and
<hi>Grace,</hi> do neglect the pressing of <hi>Moral
Duties,</hi> which are of near and indispensable
concernment unto men in all their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Actions; and without which, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is but a pretence and covering for
vice and sin. A crime this is unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58629:28"/>
of the highest nature if true, and
such as might justly render the whole
Profession of those who are guilty of it
suspected. And this is again renewed by
our Author, who to charge home upon
the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> reports the saying of
<hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius Ilyricus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> who dyed an
hundred ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs ago; namely that <hi>bona opera
sunt pernitiosa ad salutem,</hi> though I do not
remember that any such thing was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by <hi>Illyricus,</hi> though it was so by
<hi>Amsdorsius</hi> against <hi>Georgius Major.</hi> But is it
not strange, how any man can assume to
himself, and swallow so much confidence as is
needful to the mannagement of this charge?
The Books and Treatises published by men
of the perswasion traduced, their daily
preaching witnessed unto by multitudes
of all sorts of people, the open avowing
of their duty in this matter, their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
concerning sin, duty, holiness, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
righteousness and honesty, do all of
them proclaim the blackness of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and sink it with those who have
taken, or are able to take any sober cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of these things, utterly beneath
all Consideration; Moral duties they do
esteem, commend, count as necessary in
Religion as any men that live under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
It is true they say that on a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58629:29"/>
of that performance whereof they
are capable without the assistance of the
Grace and Spirit of God, though they may
be good in their own nature, and useful
to mankind, yet they are not available un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the salvation of the souls of men; and
herein they can prove, that they have the
concurrent suffrage of all known Churches
in the world, both those of old, and these
at present: They say moreover, that for
men to rest upon their performances of
these moral duties for their Justification
before God, is but to set up their own
Righteousness through an Ignorance of the
Righteousness of God; for we are justified
freely by his Grace; neither yet are they
sensible of any opposition to this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For
their own discharge of the Work of
the Ministry, they endeavour to take their
rule, pattern and instruction from the
precepts, directions, and examples of them
who were first commissionated unto that
work, even the Apostles of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, recorded in the Scripture, that
they might be used and improved unto that
end. By them are they taught, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the declaring unto men all the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God</hi> concerning his Grace, their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Salvation; and having the <hi>word
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58629:29"/>
of Reconciliation</hi> committed unto them,
they do pray their hearers in <hi>Christs stead
to be reconciled unto God;</hi> to this end do
they declare the <hi>unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi>
and comparatively determine <hi>to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
in this world but <hi>Christ and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
whereby their preaching becometh
principally the word or <hi>Doctrine of the
Cross,</hi> which by experience they find to
be a <hi>stumbling block</hi> unto some, and <hi>foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
unto others; by all means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make known what <hi>is the riches of
the glory of the mysterie of God in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the world unto himself;</hi> praying
<hi>withal for their Hearers, that the God of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, would
give unto them the Spirit of Wisdom and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the knowledge of him, that the eyes
of their understanding being enlightned, they
may learn to know what is the hope of his
Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of
his inheritance in the Saints;</hi> and in these
things are they not ashamed of the Gospel
of Christ, which is the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation.</p>
            <p>By this Dispensation of the Gospel, do
they endeavour to ingenerate in the hearts
and souls of men, <hi>Repentance towards God,
and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them also hereunto, they cease not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58629:30"/>
by the preaching of the <hi>Law,</hi> to make
known to men the <hi>Terror of the Lord,</hi> to
convince them of the nature of sin, of
their own lost and ruined condition by
reason of it, through its guilt as both
Original in their Natures, and Actual in their
lives, that they may be stirred up to <hi>fly
from the wrath to come,</hi> and to lay hold on
eternal life; and thus as God is pleased
to succeed them, do they endeavour to lay
the great <hi>Foundation Jesus Christ,</hi> in the
hearts of their Hearers, and to bring them
to an interest in him by believing. In the
farther pursuit of the work committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, they endeavour more and more
to declare unto, and instruct their Hearers
in all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> and saving Truths of the
Gospel, to the end that by the knowledge
of them, they may be wrought unto Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and brought to Conformity to
Christ, which is the end of their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and in the pursuit of their duty,
there is nothing more that they insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as far as ever I could observe, than
an endeavour to convince men, that that
Faith or Profession that doth not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
it self, which is not justified by works,
which doth not purifie the heart within,
that is not fruitful in universal Obedience
to all the Commands of God, is vain and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58629:30"/>
unprofitable; letting them know that
though we are <hi>saved by Grace, yet we are the
workmanship of God created in Christ Jesus to
good works, which he hath ordained for us
to walk in them;</hi> a neglect whereof doth
uncontrollably evict men of Hypocrisie and
falseness in their Profession; that therefore
these things in those that are Adult, are
indispensably necessary to salvation. Hence
do they esteem it their Duty, continually
to press upon their Hearers the constant
observance and <hi>doing of whatsover things
are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things are pure, whatsoever things are
comely, whatsoever things are of good report;</hi>
letting them know that those who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to a participation of the Grace of the
Gospel, have more, higher, stronger ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
upon them to Righteousness, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
Honesty, usefulness amongst men,
in all moral duties, throughout all Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Conditions and Capacities, than any
others whatever.</p>
            <p>For any man to pretend, to write, plead
that this they do not, but indeed do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
Morality and the Duties of
it, is to take a liberty of saying what he
pleases for his own purpose, when thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
are ready from the highest experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to contradict him. And if this false
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58629:31"/>
supposition should prove the soul that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
any Discourses, let men never so
passionately admire them, and expatiate in
the commendation of them, I know some
that will not be their Rivals in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies.
For the other things which those
Books are mostly filled withal, setting
aside frivolous trifling exceptions about
<hi>Modes</hi> of Carriage, and common phrases of
speech, altogether unworthy the review or
perusal of a serious Person, they consist of
such exceptions against expressions, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
occasional reflections on Texts of
Scripture, Invectives, and impertinent cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
over of things past and by-gone, as
the merit of the Cause under contest is no
way concerned in. And if any one would
engage in so unhandsome an employment,
as to collect such fond speeches, futilous
expressions, ridiculous expositions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
smutty passages, weak &amp; impertinent
Discourses, yea profane scurrilities, which
some others whom for their Honors sake,
and other Reasons I shall not name, have
in their Sermons and Discourses about sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things been guilty of, he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
matter enough for a score of such
<hi>Dialogues</hi> as the <hi>Friendly Debates,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of.</p>
            <p>But to return, That the Advantages
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58629:31"/>
mentioned are somewhat peculiar unto
<hi>Dialogues,</hi> we have a sufficient evidence in
this, that our Author having another spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
design, he chose another way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
suited thereunto. He professeth, that
he hath neither hope, nor expectation to
convince his Adversaries of their <hi>Crimes or
Mistakes,</hi> nor doth endeavour any such
thing. Nor did he meerly project to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them contemptible and ridiculous;
which to have effected, the writing of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues</hi>
in his mannagement would have
been most accommodate. But his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was to expose them to persecution,
or to the severity of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> from the
Magistrate, and if possible, it may be, to
popular Rage and Fury. The voice of his
whole Discourse is the same with that of
the Jews concerning St. <hi>Paul, Away with
such fellows from the earth, for it is not meet
they should live.</hi> Such an account of his
thoughts he gives us; <hi>pag.</hi> 253. saith he,
<hi>The only cause of all our Troubles and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances</hi>
(which what they are he knows
not, nor can declare) <hi>is the inflexible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfeness
of about an hundred proud, ignorant,
and seditious Preachers, against whom if the
severity of the Laws were particularly levelled
how easie would it be,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58629:32"/>
Macte nova virtute puer, sic itur ad astra.</q>
            <p>But I hope it will appear before the close
of this Discourse, that our Author is far
from deserving the reputation of Infallible
in his <hi>Politicks,</hi> whatever he may be
thought to do in his Divinity. It is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
known how he is mistaken in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the numbers of those whom
he designs to brand with the blackest marks
of Infamy, and whom he exposeth in his
Desires to <hi>the severities of Law</hi> for their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
I am sure, it is probable, that there
are <hi>more than an hundred</hi> of those whom he
intends, who may say unto him, as <hi>Gregory of
Nazianzen</hi> introduceth his Father speaking
to himself,
<q>Nondum tot sunt anni tui, quot jam in sacris
Nobis sunt peracti victimis,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Who have been longer in the Ministry
than He in the World, But suppose there
were but <hi>an hundred</hi> of them, he knows,
or may know, when there was such a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the numbers of them that contested
about Religion, that it was said of them,
<hi>All the World against</hi> Athanasius, <hi>and</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius
<hi>against the World;</hi> who yet was in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58629:32"/>
right against them all, as they must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
who frequently say or sing, his
<hi>Quicunque vult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how came he so well acquainted
with them all and every one, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
of them that they are <hi>Proud, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
and <hi>seditious;</hi> allow him the Liberty,
which I see he will take whether we allow
it him or no, to call whom he pleaseth <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious</hi>
upon the account of reall or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
principles not complyant with his
thoughts and apprehensions; yet that men
are <hi>Proud,</hi> and <hi>Ignorant</hi> how he can prove
but by particular Instances from his own
acquaintance with them, I know not; And
if he should be allowed to be a competent
judge of Knowledge and Ignorance in the
whole compass of Wisdom and Science,
which it may be some will except against,
yet unless he had personally conversed
with them all, or were able to give suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
instances of their ignorance from Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Writings, or Expressions of their own,
he would scarce be able to give a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
account of the Honesty of this his
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>remptory censure; And surely this must
needs be looked on, as a lovely, gentle,
and Philosophick Humour, to judge all men
<hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> who are not of our
minds in all things, and on that ground
alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58629:33"/>
But yet let them be as <hi>ignorant</hi> as can be
fancied, this will not determine the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them and their Adversaries.
One unlearned <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in the Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> stopped all the learned Fathers when
they were precipitately casting the Church
into a snare; And others as unlearned as
He, may Honestly attempt the same at any
time. And for our Authors Projection for
the obtaining of Quiet by severe dealings
with these men in an especial manner, one
of the same nature failed in the instance
mentioned. For when <hi>Athanasius</hi> stood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
by himself in the <hi>Eastern Empire</hi> for a
Profession in Religion, which the supream
Magistrate and the generality of the Clergy
condemned, it was thought the <hi>Levelling of
severity</hi> in particular against Him, would
bring all to a Composure. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
after they had again and again charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to be <hi>Proud and Seditious,</hi> they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
engaged in his Prosecution, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Projection here proposed,
and sought him neer all the World over,
but to no purpose at all, as the event dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
For the Truth which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
having left its root in the hearts of
multitudes of the people, on the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
they returned again to the open
avowing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:58629:33"/>
But to return from this Digression! this
being the Design of our Author, not so
much to expose his Adversaries to common
Contempt and Laughter, as to Ruine and
Destruction, he diverted from the beaten
path of <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and betook himself
unto that of <hi>Rhetorical Invective Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which is peculiarly suited to carry on
and promote such a Design. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here leave him for the present, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Triumphant Chariot of his
<hi>Friend;</hi> singing <hi>io triumphe!</hi> and casting
Reflections upon the Captives that he
draggs after him at his chariot wheels,
which will doubtless supply his Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a pleasing entertainment, untill he
shall awake out of his dream, and find all
the Pageantry that his Fancy hath erected
round about him, to vanish and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>His
next attempt is upon <hi>Atheists,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have no concern, nor his principal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
the Non-Conformists; For my
part I have had this Advantage by my own
Obscurity and small Consideration in the
World, as never to converse with any
persons that did, or durst Question the
Being or Providence of God, either really
or in pretence. By common reports, and
published discourses, I find that there are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58629:34"/>
not a few in these dayes, who either out of
pride and ostentation, or in a real comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with their own darkness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
do boldly venture to dispute the
things which we adore; and if I am not
greatly mis-informed, a charge of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Licentiousness and Impiety, may
from pregnant instances, be brought neer
the doors of some who on other occasions
declaim against it. For Practical <hi>Atheism</hi>
the matter seems to be unquestionable;
many live as though they believed neither
God nor Devil in the world, but Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
With neither sort am I concerned
to treat at present, nor shall I examine the
Invectives of our Author against them;
though I greatly doubt, whether ever such
a kind of Defence of the <hi>Being</hi> of God was
written by any man before him. If a man
would make a judgement upon the <hi>genius</hi>
and way of his Discourse, he might possibly
be tempted to fear, that it is persons, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Things that are the object of his
Indignation; and it may be the fate of
some, to suffer under the Infamy of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
as it is thought <hi>Diagoras</hi> did of old,
not for denying the Deity, nor for any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
conceptions of mind concerning it,
but for deriding and contemning them,
who without any interest in, or sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58629:34"/>
did foolishly, in Idoliatrous Instances
make a pretence of it in the world. But
whatever wickedness or miscarriages of
this nature our Author hath observed, his
zeal against them were greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
but that it is not in that <hi>only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
wherein he allows of the exercise of
that vertue, Let it then be his Anger or
Indignation, or what he pleases, that he
may not miss of his due praises and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
Only I must say, that I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whether to charge persons enclined to
<hi>Atheism</hi> with profaning <hi>Johnson</hi> and <hi>Fletcher</hi>
as well as the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> be a way of
proceeding probably suited to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
or Reduction.</p>
            <p>It seems also that those who are here
chastised do vent their Atheism in <hi>Scossing</hi>
and <hi>Drollery, jesting,</hi> and such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
efforts of Wit, that may take for
a while amongst <hi>little and unlearned people,</hi>
and immediately evaporate. I am afraid
more of those who under pretences of <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Reason</hi> do vent and maintain opinions
and principles that have a direct tendency
to give an open admission unto <hi>Atheism</hi> in
the minds of men, than of such fooleries.
When others fury and raving cruelties suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not, he alone prevailed, <hi>qui solus
accessit sobrius ad perdendam Remp.</hi> One
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58629:35"/>
principle contended for as Rational and
true, which if admitted will insensibly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the mind unto, and justifie a practice
ending in Atheism, is more to be feared,
than ten thousand jests and scoffs against
Religion, which methinks, amongst men
of any tolerable Sobriety should easily be
buried under Contempt and Scorn. And
our Author may do well to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath not, unwittingly I presume, in
some instances, so expressed and demeaned
himself, as to give no small Advantage to
those corrupt Inclinations unto Atheism,
which abound in the hearts of men; Are
not men taught here to keep the Liberty of
their Minds and Judgements to themselves,
whilest they practise that which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
not, nor can do so; which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to act against the light and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Conscience? And yet an associate of
his in his present design, in <hi>a modest and free
Conference,</hi> tells us, that there is <hi>not awider
step to Atheism than to do any thing against
Conscience,</hi> and enforms his Friend, that
<hi>Dissent out of grounds that appear to any
founded on the will of God, is Conscience;</hi>
but against such a Conscience, the Light,
Judgement and Conviction of it, are men
here taught to practise; and thereby in the
judgement of that Author, are instructed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58629:35"/>
unto Atheism. And indeed if once men
find themselves at Liberty to practise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what is prescribed unto them in
the name and authority of God, as all
things are which Conscience requires, it
is not long that they will retain any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of him, or Reverence unto Him. It
hath hitherto been the Judgement of all,
who have enquired into these things, that
the great concern of the Glory of God in
the world, the interest of Kings and Rulers,
of all Governments whatever, the good
and welfare of private persons, lyes in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, than in preserving Conscience
from being debauched in the conducting
principles of it; and in keeping up its due
Respect to the immediate Soveraignty of
God over it in all things. Neither ever
was there a more horrid attempt upon the
Truth of the Gospel, all common Morality,
and the good of Mankind, than that which
some of late years or Ages have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in, by suggesting in their <hi>Casuistical
Writings</hi> such principles for the guidance
of the Consciences of men, as in sundry
particular instances might set them free, as
to practice, from the direct and immeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
influencing Authority of God in his
Word. And yet I doubt not, but it may
be made evident, that all their principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58629:36"/>
in conjunction are scarce of so pernicious a
tendency as this one general <hi>Theorem,</hi> That
men may lawfully act in the Worship of
God, or otherwise, against the Light,
Dictates, or Convictions of their
own Consciences. Exempt Conscience
from an absolute, immediate, entire, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
dependance on the Authority, Will,
and Judgement of God, according to what
Conceptions it hath of them, and you
disturb the whole harmony of divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the Government of the World;
and break the first link of that great chain
whereon all Religion and Government in
the world do depend. Teach men to be like
<hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> to believe only in the
God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to Worship Him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Appointment by his own
Choice, and from a sense of duty, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to bow in the house <hi>of Rimmon</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Light and Conviction out of
Complyance with his Master; or with the
men <hi>of Samaria</hi> to <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> but <hi>to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
their Idols,</hi> and they will not fail at one
time or other, rather to seek after Rest in
restless Atheism, than to live in a perpetual
conflict with themselves, or to cherish an
everlasting Sedition in their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes.</p>
            <p>I shall not much reflect upon those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58629:36"/>
which our Author is pleased to
vent his Indignation by; such as <hi>Religious
rage, and fury, Religious villany, religious
lunacies, serious and Consciencious Villanies,
wildness of godly madness,</hi> men lead <hi>by the
Spirit of God to disturb the publick peace,</hi> the
<hi>world filled with a buzze and noise of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit, sanctified fury, sanctified barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,
pious villanies, godly disobedience, sullen
and cross-grained godliness,</hi> with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
others of the like kind; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
perhaps he may countenance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the use of, from the tacite respect
that he hath to the persons whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to vilifie and reproach; yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to others, who have not the
same apprehensions of their occasion, they
tend to nothing but to beget a scorn and
derision of all Religion, and the profession
of it; an humour which will not find
where to rest or fix it self, untill it comes
to be swallowed up in the Abysse of
Atheism.</p>
            <p>We are at length arrived at the <hi>last Act</hi>
of this <hi>Tragical Preface;</hi> and as in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
we have rather heard a great Noise
and Bluster, than really encountred either
true difficulty or danger; so now I confess
that Weariness of conversing with so many
various sounds of the same signification,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58629:37"/>
the summ of all being <hi>Knaves, Villains, Fools,</hi>
will carry me through the remainder of it,
with some more than ordinary precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as grudging an Addition in this kind
of employment to those <hi>few minutes</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the preceding Remarques were written
or dictated.</p>
            <p>There are two or three heads which the
remainders of this <hi>Prefatory Discourse</hi> may
be reduced unto. First, a magnificent
Proclamation of his own Achievements;
what he hath proved, what he hath done,
especially in representing the <hi>Inconsistence
of Liberty of Conscience with the first and
Fundamental Laws of Government;</hi> and I
am content that he please himself with his
own Apprehensions, like him who admired
at the marvelous feats performed in an
empty Theatre. For it may be that upon
examination it will be found, that there is
scarce in his whole Discourse any one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
offered at, that hath the least seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cogency towards such an end; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you take Liberty of Conscience, for
Liberty of Judgement, which himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
uncontroleable, or Liberty of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
upon Indulgence which he seems to
oppose, an impartial Reader will I doubt
be so far from finding the Conclusion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to be evinced, as he will scarcely
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58629:37"/>
be able to satisfie himself that there are
any Premises that have a tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
But I suppose he must extreamly
want an Employment who will design him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a business, in endeavouring to dispossess
him of his self-pleasing Imagination. Yea
he seems not to have pleaded his own cause
absurdly at <hi>Athens,</hi> who giving the City the
news of a Victory when they had received
a Fatal Defeat, affirmed that publick
thanks were due to him, for affording them
two dayes of Mirth and Jollity, before
the tidings came of their ill success; which
was more than they were ever like to see
again in their lives. And there being as
much satisfaction in a fancied, as a real
success, though useless and failing, we shall
leave our Author in the highest content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that thoughts of this nature can afford
him. However it may not be amiss to mind
him of that old good Counsel, <hi>Let not him
that girdeth on his Armour, boast like him that
putteth it off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another part of his Oration is to decry
the folly of that <hi>bruitish Apprehension</hi> that
men can possibly live peaceably and quietly
if they enjoy the Liberty of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
where he fears not to affirm, that it
is more elegible <hi>to tolerate the highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchertes,</hi>
than liberty for men to worship
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58629:38"/>
God according to what they apprehend he
requires; whence some severe persons would
be too apt it may be to make a conjecture
of his own Inclinations; for it is evident
that he is not absolutely insensible of self-interest
in what he doth or writes. But
the contrary to what he asserts, being a
truth at this day written with the beams
of the Sun in many Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> let
Envy, Malice, Fear, and Revenge suggest
what they please otherwise, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Thing it self denyed being
built upon the best, greatest, and surest
Foundations and Warranty that mankind
hath to build on, or trust unto for their
peace and security, I know not why it's
denial was here ventured at, unless it were
to embrace an opportunity once more to
give vent to the remainders of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
by Revilings and Reproaches,
which I had hoped had been now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted.</p>
            <p>But
these things are but Collateral to
his principal Design in this close of his
Declamation; and this is the Removal of
an Objection, that <hi>Liberty of Conscience
would conduce much to the Improvement of
Trade in the Nation.</hi> It is known that many
persons of great Wisdom and Experience,
and who, as it is probable, have had more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58629:38"/>
time to consider the State and proper Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of this Nation, and have spent more
pains in the weighing of all things condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
thereunto than our Author hath done,
are of this mind and judgement. But he
at once strikes them and their Reasons
dumb, by drawing out his <hi>Gorgon's head,</hi>
that he hath proved it <hi>inconsistent with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and so it must needs be a <hi>foolish
and silly thing</hi> to talk of its usefulness to
Trade. <hi>Verum, ad populum phalera;</hi> if great
blustering words, dogmatical Assertions,
uncouth, unproved principles, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a pretence of Contempt and
scorn of all exceptions and oppositions to
what is said, with the persons of them that
make them, may be esteemed proofs, our
Author can prove what he pleaseth, and
he is to be thought to have proved what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he affirms himself so to have done. If
sober Reason, Experience, Arguments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from common acknowledged Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Truth, If a Confirmation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
from such principles, by confessed
and commonly approved Instances are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make up convincing proofs in
matters of this Nature and Importance,
we are yet to seek for them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any thing that hath been offered
by this Author, or as far as I can conjecture
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58629:39"/>
is likely so to be. In the mean time I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
many parts of his Discourse
to be singularly remarkable. His Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>That the Affairs of the Kingdom are not
in a fixed and established condition, that we
are distracted amongst our selves with a
strange variety of Jealous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es and Annimosities,</hi>
and such like expressions, as if divulged
in a Book printed without Licence, would
and that justly, be looked on as <hi>Seditious,</hi>
are the Foundations that he proceedeth
upon. Now as I am confident that there
is very little ground, or none at all for
these Insinuations, so the publick dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the minds of men to <hi>fears, suspicious,</hi>
and <hi>apprehensions</hi> of unseen dangers by such
means, becomes them only, who care not
what disadvantage they cast others, nay
their Rulers under, so they may compass
and secure their own private ends and
concerns.</p>
            <p>But yet not content to have expressed
his own real or pretended apprehensions,
he proceeds to manifest his scorn of those,
or <hi>his smiling at them,</hi> who <hi>with mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
labour for the improvement of Trade,</hi>
which the <hi>Council</hi> appointed, as I take it, by
His Majesty thence denominated, is more
concerned in than the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and
may do well upon this Information finding
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58629:39"/>
themselves lyable to scorn, to desist from
such an useless and contemptible employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They may now know, that to <hi>erect
and encourage trading Combinations, is only
to build so many Nests of Faction and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
for he sayes, <hi>there is not any sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
so inclinable to seditious practices as the
trading part of a Nation; and that their
Pride and Arrogance naturally encrease with
the improvement of their stock.</hi> Besides <hi>the
Fanatick party,</hi> as he sayes, <hi>live in these grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Societies, and it is a very odd and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
folly, to design the enriching of that
sort of people; for wealth doth but only pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and encourage their presumption; and he
is a very silly man, and understands nothing
of the follies, passions and inclinations of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, who sees not that there is no
creature so ungovernable as a wealthy Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It
cannot be denyed, but that this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Policy,</hi> runs contrary to the principles
and experience of former Ages. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
industrious men in a peaceable way
of emproving their own Interests, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might partake in their own and
family concerns, of the good and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Government, hath been by the
weak and silly men of former Generations,
esteemed the most rational way of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58629:40"/>
their minds unto peaceable thoughts
and resolutions. For as the wealth of men
encreaseth, so do their desires and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
after all things and wayes whereby
it may be secured; that so they may not
have spent their labour and the vigour of
their spirits with reference unto their
own good and that of their posterity in
vain. Yea, most men are found to be of
<hi>Issachar's</hi> temper, who when he saw, <hi>that
Rest was good, and the Land pleasant,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own advantages lay, <hi>bowed his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to bear, and became a servant unto Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;
Fortes</hi> and <hi>Miseri,</hi> have heretofore
been only feared, and not such as found sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to their desires in the encreases
and successes of their endeavours. And
as <hi>Caesar</hi> said, he feared not those fat and
corpulent persons <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Dolabella,</hi> but
those pale and lean discontented ones, <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius;</hi> So men have been thought
to be far less dangerous, or to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Government, who are well clothed
with their own wealth and concerns, than
such as have nothing but themselves to
lose, and by reason of their straights and
distresses, do scarce judge them worth
the keeping.</p>
            <p>And hath this Gentleman really consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what the meaning of that word
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58629:40"/>
               <hi>Trade</hi> is, and what is the concernment of
this Nation in it? or is he so fond of his
own Nations and Apprehensions, as to
judge it meet that the Vital Spirits and
Blood of the Kingdom should be offered
in Sacrifice unto them? <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,
that the <hi>profit of the Earth is for all, and
the King himself is served by the field;</hi> and
we may truly in <hi>England</hi> say the same of
Trade; all men know what respect unto it
there is in the <hi>Revenues of the Crown,</hi> and
how much they are concerned in its
growth and promotion; the <hi>Rents of all</hi>
from the highest to the lowest that have
an interest in the soyl, are regulated by it,
and rise and fall with it; nor is there any
possibility to keep them up to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
proportion and standard, much less
to advance them, without the continuance
of Trade in its present condition at least,
may without a steddy endeavour for its
encrease, furtherance and promotion. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and Gentlemen must be contented
to eat their own Bief and Mutton at home,
if Trade decay; to keep up their antient
and present Splendour, they will find no
way or means. Corporations are known
to be the most considerable and significant
Bodies of the Common people, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lies their <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Bread;</hi> to diminish or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58629:41"/>
discountenance their Trade, is to starve
them, and discourage all honest Industry
in the world. It was a sad desolation that
not long since befell the great City by
Fire; yet through the good Providence of
God, under the peaceable Government of
his Majesty, it is rising out of its ashes, with
a new signal Beauty and Lustre. But that
Consumption and Devastation of it, which
the pursuit of this Council will inevitably
produce, would prove Fatal and Irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
And as the Interest of all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the Common-wealth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Trade of the people amongst
our selves, so the honor, power and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the whole in reference unto forraign
Nations, are resolved also into the same
Principles; for as our soyl is but small in
comparison of some of our Neighbours,
and the numbers of our people no wayes
to be compared with theirs, so if we should
forego the advantages of Trade for which
we have opportunities, and unto which
the people of this Nation have Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
above any Countrey on Nation in the
world, we should quickly find how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
the Competition between them
and us would be: for even our Naval
Force, which is the honour of the King,
the security of his Kingdoms, the Terror
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58629:41"/>
of his Enemies, oweth its rise and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto that preparation of persons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
therein, which is made by the
Trade of the Nation. And if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of this Author should be followed, to
suspend all thoughts of the supportment,
encouragement, and furtherance of Trade,
until all men by the severity of Penalties
should be induced to an Uniformity in
Religion; I doubt not but our envious
Neighbours would as readily discern the
concernment of their malice and ill will
therein, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did his, in the Action
of the <hi>Roman General,</hi> who at the Battel of
<hi>Cannae,</hi> according to their usual Discipline,
(but fatally at that time misapplyed)
caused in the great distress of the Army,
his Horsemen to alight and fight on foot,
not considering the Advantage of his great
and politick enemy, as things then stood,
who immediately said, <hi>I had rather he had
delivered them all bound unto me,</hi> though
he knew there was enough done to secure
his Victory.</p>

            <head>A
SURVEY
OF THE
FIRST CHAPTER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
seems in this <hi>First
Chapter</hi> to design the stating
of the Controversie, which
he intendeth to pursue and
handle, (as he expresseth
himself <hi>pag.</hi> II.) as also to lay down the
Main <hi>Foundations</hi> of his ensuing Superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
Nothing could be more regularly
projected, nor more suited to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ingenious Inquirers into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
under debate; For those, who have
any design in reading, beyond a present
divertisement of their Minds, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58629:43"/>
of their Fancies, desire nothing
more than to have the subject matter
which they exercise their thoughts about,
clearly and distinctly proposed, that a
true judgement may be made concerning
<hi>what men say, and whereof they do affirm.</hi>
But I fear our Author hath fallen under
the misadventure of a failure in these
projections; at least as unto that certainty,
clearness, and perspicuity in the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Conceptions, and expression
of his Assertions and Principles; without
which all other Ornaments of Speech in
matters of moment, are of no use or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
His Language is good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
his Periods of Speech laboured, full,
and even; his expressions poynant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Adversaries, and singly taken,
appearing to be very significative and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
of his mind. But I know not
how it is come to pass, that what either
through his own defect, as to a due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the notions whose mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he hath undertaken, or out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to cloud and obscure his sentiments,
and to take the advantage of loose decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
expressions, it is very hard, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to gather from what he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
either what is the true state of the
Controversie proposed to discussion, or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58629:43"/>
what is the precise determinate sense of
of those words wherein he proposeth the
Principles that he proceeds upon. Thus
in the Title of the Book he asserts the
<hi>Power of the Magistrate over the Consciences of
men;</hi> elsewhere confines the whole <hi>work
and duty of Conscience to the inward thoughts
and perswasions of the mind, over which the
Magistrate hath no power at all.</hi> Conscience
it self he sometimes sayes is <hi>every mans
Opinion;</hi> sometimes he calls it an <hi>Imperious
Faculty,</hi> which surely are not the same;
sometimes he pleads for the <hi>uncontrollable
power of Magistrates over Religion and the
Consciences of men;</hi> sometimes asserts their
<hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> as the same thing,
and seemingly all that he intends; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I suppose, no man ever yet defined Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Jurisdiction, to be, <hi>an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
power over Religion and the Consciences
of Men.</hi> The Magistrates <hi>power over Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
he asserts frequently, and denyeth
outward <hi>Worship to be any part of Religion,</hi>
and at last pleads upon the matter only for
his power over outward Worship. Every
<hi>particular Vertue</hi> he affirms to be such, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is <hi>a Resemblance and Imitation of
some of the Divine Attributes;</hi> yet also
teacheth that there may be more vertues,
or new ones that were not so, and that to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58629:44"/>
be Vertue in one place which is not so in
another: Sometimes he pleads that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
hath power to impose <hi>any Religion
on the Consciences of his subjects,</hi> that doth
<hi>not countenance Vice, or disgrace the Deity;</hi>
and then anon pleads for it in <hi>indifferent
things,</hi> and circumstances of outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
only. Also that the Magistrate may
<hi>oblige his Subjects Consciences</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Moral Duties, and other Duties
in Religious Worship under penalties, and
yet <hi>punisheth none for their Crime and Guilt,</hi>
but for the example of others. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Instances of the like Nature may
be given. Now, whatever dress of words
these things may be set off withal, they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
rankly of crude and undigested Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not reduced unto such a Consistency
in his mind, as to suffer him to speak even<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
steadily, and constantly to them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole matter, it may not be unmeet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said of his Discourse, what <hi>Tally</hi> said
of <hi>Rullus</hi> his Oration about the <hi>Agrarian
Law; Concionem advocari jubet; summâ cum
expectatione concurritur; Explicat Orationem

voluisse eum dicere suspicabantur.</hi> Many good
words it is composed of, many sharp Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are made on others, a great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
there is of Reason; but besides
that, it is plain that he treats of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
and the <hi>Magistrates power,</hi> and
would have this latter exercised about
the punishment or destruction of the
former, (which almost every Page ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth)
it is very, hard to gather what
is the Case he speaks unto, or what are
principles he proceeds upon.</p>
            <p>The entrance of his Discourse is designed
to give an account of the great Difficulty
which he intends to assoyl, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
that he will handle and debate,
and of the Difference which he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Here, if any where, Accuracy, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity,
and a clear distinct direction of
the minds of the Readers unto a certain
just Apprehension of the matter in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and difference, ought to be expected.
For if the foundation of Discourses of this
nature, be laid in terms general, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
loose, rhetorical, and flourishing, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no particular determinate sense of the
Controversie, (for so this is called by our
Author) all. that ensues in the pursuit of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58629:45"/>
what is so laid down, must needs be of
the same complexion. And such appears
to be the <hi>declamatory entrance</hi> of this
Chapter. For instead of laying a solid
Foundation to erect his superstructure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Author seems in it only to have
built a <hi>Castle in the Air,</hi> that makes a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appearance and shew, but is of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
or use. Can he suppose that any
man is the wiser, or the more intelligent
in the difference about Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
the power and duty of Magistrates
in granting or denying an Indulgence unto
the exercise of it, by reading an elegant
parabolical Discourse of <hi>two Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the Magistrate and Conscience, contesting
for Soveraignty, in and about</hi> no man knows
what? What Conscience is; what Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conscience; what it is pleaded for
to extend unto, who are concerned in it;
whether its Plea be resolved absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its own Nature and Constitution, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that respect which it hath to another
common Rule of the minds and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men in and about the Worship of
God, is not declared; nor is it easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable,
what he allows and approves of
in his own Discourse, and what he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to reflect upon, and so reject.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 5. he tells us, that <hi>Conscience is subject
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58629:45"/>
and accountable to God alone, that it owns
no Superiour but the Lord of Consciences.</hi>
And pag. 7. <hi>That those who make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to none but God lone, do in effect
usurp their Princes Crown, defie his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and acknowledge no Governour but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
If it be pleaded that in the first
place, not what is, but what is unduly
pretended is declared, his words may be as
well so expounded in all his Ascriptions
unto Magistrates also; namely, that it is
not with them as he asserts; but only' tis
unduly pretended so to be, as to any thing
that appears in the Discourse. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
consideration of the Principles of
Conscience, and the outward exercise of
it, can alone here give any shew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
But as no Distinction of that nature
doth as yet appear, and if rested on, ought
to have been produced by any one who
understood himself, and intended not to
deceive or entangle others, so when it is
brought on the Stage, its inconsistency to
serve the end designed shall be evinced.
But that a plea for the Consciences of
private men, (submitting themselves free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and willingly to the Supream Power and
Government of Magistrates in all things
belonging to publick peace and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,)
to have liberty to express their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58629:46"/>
unto God in the exercise of his
outward Worship, should receive such a
<hi>Tragical</hi> description of a <hi>Rival Supream
Power set up against the Magistrate to the
usurpation of his Crown and Dignity,</hi> is a
new way of stating Controversies whether
in Divinity or Policy, which this Author
judgeth conducing to his design and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And I shall say no more but that
those who delight in such a way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and do receive light and satisfaction
thereby, do seem to be exercised in a <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
that I was never acquainted withal,
and which I shall not now enquire after.</p>
            <p>What seems to be of real Difficulty in
this matter which is so <hi>rhetorically</hi> exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
our Blessed Saviour hath stated and
determined in one word; <hi>Give,</hi> saith he,
<hi>unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's, <hi>and
to God the things that are Gods;</hi> and this he
did, when he gave his Disciples command
not only to think, judge and believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what he should propose and
reveal unto them, but also to <hi>observe and
do in outward practices</hi> what ever he should
<hi>command them.</hi> As he requires all subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto the Magistrate in things of his
proper Cognizance, that is all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to publick Peace and Tranquility in
this world the great end of His Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58629:46"/>
So he asserts also that there are <hi>things
of God</hi> which are to be observed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
even <hi>all and every one of his own
commands;</hi> in a neglect whereof on any
pretence or account, we give not unto
God that which is <hi>His.</hi> And he doubted
not, but that these things, these distinct
respects to God and man, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
well consistent, and together dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to the same end of publick good.
Wherefore passing through the flourishes
of this Frontispiece with the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernment,
we may enter the Fabrick
it self, where possibly we may find him
declaring directly what it is that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
in this matter, and contendeth for;
and this he doth pag. 10. <hi>And therefore
it is the design of this Discourse by a fair
and impartial Debate to compose all these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and adjust all these quarrells and
contentions, and settle things upon their true
and proper foundations; first by proving it to
be absolutely necessary to the peace and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World, that the Supream
Magistrate of every Commonwealth should
be vested with a power to govern and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
the Consciences of Subjects in Affairs of
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure our Author will not be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
if after he hath reported the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58629:47"/>
whole Party whom he opposeth, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>silly, foolish, illiterate</hi> Persons, one
of them should so far acknowledge his
own <hi>stupidity,</hi> as to profess that after the
Consideration of this Declaration of his
Intention and mind, he is yet to seek for the
Direct and determinate sense of his Words,
and for the Principle that he designes the
Confirmation of. I doubt not but that
the Magistrate hath all that power which is
absolutely necessary for the preservation
of publick Peace and Tranquility in the
world. But if men may be allowed to
fancy what they please to be necessary unto
that end, and thence to make their own
measures of that power which is to be
ascribed unto Him, no man knows what
bounds will be fixed unto that Ocean
wherein the Leviathans they have framed
in their Imagination may sport themselves.
Some will perhaps think it necessary to
this purpose that the Magistrate should
have power to declare, and determine <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a God or no;</hi> whether if there
be, it be necessary He should be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
or no; whether any Religion be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in, or usefull to the World; and if
there be, then to determine what all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
shall believe, and practise from first
to last in the whole of it. And our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58629:47"/>
hopes that some are of this mind.
Others may confine it to lesser things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as their own Interest doth call upon
them so to do; though they are not able to
assign a clear distinction between what is
subjected unto Him, and what may plead
an exemption from his Authority. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
who is the Fountain and Original of
all Power, hath both assigned its proper
end, and fully suited it to the attainment
thereof. And if the noise of mens Lusts,
Passions, and Interests, were but a little
silenced, we should quickly hear the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
consenting voice of Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self, declaring the just proportion
that is between the Grant of power and
its end; and undeniably express it in all
the instances of it. For as the Principle
of Rule and Subjection, is natural to us,
concreated with us, and indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Humane Society in all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
it is capable of, and Relations
whence those Distinctions arise; so Nature
it self duly attended unto, will not fail by
the Reason of things, to direct us unto
all that is essential unto it, and necessary
unto its end. Arbitrary Fictions of Ends
of Government, and what is necessary
thereunto, influenced by present Interest,
and arising from circumstances confined to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58629:48"/>
one Place, Time, or Nation, are not to be
imposed on the Nature of Government it
self; which hath nothing belonging unto
it but what inseparably accompanieth
mankind as Sociable.</p>
            <p>But to let this pass; The Authority here
particularly asserted, is a <hi>Power in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate to govern and guide the
Consciences of his Subjects in affairs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
Let any man duly consider these
expressions, and if he be satisfied by them
as to the sense of the <hi>Controversie</hi> under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
I shall acknowledge that he is wiser
than I, which is very easie for any one to
be. What are the <hi>Affairs of Religion</hi> here
intended, all or some? Whether <hi>in</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or <hi>about</hi> it; what are the <hi>Consciences
of men,</hi> and how exercised about these
things; what it is to <hi>govern and conduct</hi>
them; with <hi>what power,</hi> by what means
this may be done; I am at a loss for ought
that yet is here declared. There is a
Guidance, Conduct, yea <hi>Government</hi> of
the Consciences of men, by Instructions
and Directions in a due proposal of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and spiritual motives for those ends;
such as is that which is vested in, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
by the Guides of the Church; and
that in subjection to, and dependance on
Christ alone, as hath been hitherto appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58629:48"/>
though some now seem to have a
mind to change their Master, and to take
up <hi>praesente Numine</hi> who may be of more
Advantage to them. That the Magistrate
hath also power so to <hi>govern and conduct
the Consciences of his Subjects</hi> in his way of
Administration, that is by ordering them
to be taught, instructed, and guided in
their duty, I know none that doth deny.
So did <hi>Jehosophat, 2 Chron.</hi> 17, 7, 8, 9.
But it seems to be a <hi>Government and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
of another nature that is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
To deliver our selves therefore
from the Deceit and Intanglement of these
general expressions, and that we may know
what to speak unto, we must seek for a
Declaration of their sense and Importance
from what is elsewhere in their pursuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and explained by their Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His general Assertion is (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
that the</hi> Magistrate hath power over
the Consciences of his Subjects in Religion, <hi>as
appears in the Title of his Book; Here
p. 10. that</hi> power, <hi>is said to be,</hi> to govern and
conduct their Consciences in Religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
<hi>pag.</hi> 13. that Religion is subject to
his dominion as well as all other affairs of
State, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. it is a Soveraignty over mens
Consciences in matters of Religion, and this
Universal, Absolute, and Uncontrollable;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58629:49"/>
               <hi>Matters of Religion are as uncontrollably
subject to the supream power, as all other
Civil Concerns;</hi> He may if he please reserve
the Exercise of the Priesthood to Himself, <hi>p. 32.
that is, what now in Religion corresponds
unto the ancient Priesthood, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Bishops and</hi> Priests, <hi>Administring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and the like; as the Papists in
Q.</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s time did commonly report,
in their usual manner, that it was done by a</hi>
Woman <hi>amongst us, by a fiction of such
principles as begin it seems now to be
owned. That if this</hi> power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion be not Universal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
it is useless, <hi>p. 35. that this</hi> power is
not derived from Christ, nor any grant of his,
but is antecedent to his coming, or any power
given unto Him or granted by Him, <hi>pag.</hi> 40.
Magistrates have a power to make that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
of the Divine Law, which God had
not made so, <hi>p.</hi> 80. and to introduce new
duties in the most important parts of Religion.
So that there is a publick conscience which
men are in things of a publick concern (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Worship of God) to attend unto
and not to their own. And if there be any
sin in the command, he that imposed it, shall
answer for it, and not I whose whole duty it
is to obey, <hi>p. 308. Hence the command of</hi>
Authority will warrant obedience, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58629:49"/>
obedience will hallow my actions, and excuse
me from sin, <hi>ibid. Hence it follows, that
whatever the Magistrate commands in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
his Authority doth so immediately
affect the Consciences of men, that they
are bound to observe it on the pain of
the greatest sin and punishment; And he
may appoint and command whatever he
pleaseth in Religion,</hi> that doth not either
countenance Vice, or disgrace the Deity,
<hi>p. 85. And many other expressions are
there of the general Assertion before laid
down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore seems to me, and to the
most impartial Considerations of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that I could bring unto it, to be
the Doctrine or Opinion proposed and
advanced for the quieting and composing of
the great tumults described in its entrance;
namely, That the supream <hi>Magistrate</hi> in
every Nation hath power to order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
what Religion his Subjects shall profess
and observe, or what he pleaseth in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as to the worship of God required in it,
provided that he <hi>enjoyneth nothing that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth
Vice, or disgraceth the Deity;</hi> and
thereby binds their Consciences to profess
and observe that which is by him so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
(and nothing else are they to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve)
making it their duty in Conscience
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58629:50"/>
so to do; and the highest Crime or Sin
to do any thing to the contrary; and that
whatever the precise Truth in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
be, or whatever be the apprehensions
of their own Consciences concerning
them. Now if our Author can produce
any Law, Usage, or Custome of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
any Statute or Act of Parliament,
any authentick Record, any Acts or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of our Kings, any publickly
authorised writing, before or since the
Reformation, declaring, asserting, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
approving the Power and Authority
described, to belong unto, to be claimed
or exercised by the Kings of this Nation,
I will faithfully promise him never to write
one word against it, although I am sure I
shall never be of that mind. And if I mistake
not in a transient Reflection on these
Principles, compared with those which the
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath formerly pleaded
against them who opposed her Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they are utterly by them cast out of
all consideration; and this one notion is
advanced in the room of all the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which for so many years her Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
(as wife and as Learned as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
have been building upon. But this
is not my concernment to examine; I shall
leave it unto them whose it is, and whose
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58629:50"/>
it will be made appear to be, if we are
again necessitated to engage in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>For the present; be it granted, that it
is the duty, and in the power of every su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate, to Order, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what Religion, what Way, what
Modes in Religion shall be allowed, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
owned, and countenanced, and by
publick revenue maintained in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
That is, this is allowed with respect
to all pretensions of other Soveraigns, or of
his own Subjects; with respect unto God,
it is his Truth alone, the Religion by him
revealed, and the Worship by him appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he can so allow or establish. The
Rule that holds in private persons with
respect to the publick Magistrate, holds in
him with respect unto God. <hi>Illud possumus
quod jure possumus.</hi> It is also agreed, that
no men, no individual Person, no Order,
or Society of men, are either in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or any of their outward concerns,
exempted, or may be so on the account of
Religion, from His Power and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor any Causes that are lyable unto a
legal, political disposal and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
It is also freely acknowledged that
whatever such a <hi>Magistrate</hi> doth determi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
about the Observances of Religion.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58629:51"/>
under what penalties soever, His Subjects
are bound to observe what He doth so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and appoint, unless by general or
especial Rules, their Consciences are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to a Dissent, or contrary Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Authority of God and His
Word; In this case they are to keep their
Souls entire in their spiritual subjection
unto God, and quietly and peaceably to
bear the troubles, and inconveniencies
which on the account thereof may befall
them, without the least withdrawing of
their Obedience from the Magistrate. And
in this state of things as there is no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
or appearance of it, that any man
should be brought into such a condition,
as wherein Sin on the one hand, or the
other, cannot be avoided; so that state of
things will probably occurr in the world,
as it hath done in all Ages hitherto, that
men may be necessitated to Sin, or
Suffer.</p>
            <p>To winde up the state of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
we say that antecedent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the power of the Magistrate,
and all the Influence that it hath upon men
or their Consciences, there is a superiour
determination of what is true, what false
in Religion, what right and what wrong
in the Worship of God, wherein the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58629:51"/>
Guidance of the Consciences of men doth
principally depend, and whereinto it is
ultimately resolved. This gives an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Liberty unto them, antecedent
unto the imposition of the Magistrate, of
whose command and our actual Obedience
unto them in these things, it is the Rule
and Measure. And I think there is no
Principle, no common presumption of
Nature, nor dictate of Reason more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
known, or confessed, than this, that
whatever God <hi>commands</hi> Us in his Worship
or otherwise, that we are to do; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he forbids us, that we are not to do,
be the things themselves in our eye great,
or small.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any difference in these
things with respect unto the Way or manner
of the declaration of the Will of God;
Whether it be by <hi>innate common light,</hi> or
by Revelation, all is one; The Authority
and Will of God in all is to be observed.
Yea a Command of God made known by
Revelation, (the way which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
about) may suspend as to any
particular Instance, the greatest command
that we are obliged unto by the Law of
Nature in reference unto one another; as
it did in the precept given to <hi>Abraham</hi> for
the Sacrificing of his Son. And we shall
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58629:52"/>
find our Author himself setting up the
Supremacy of Conscience in opposition
unto, and competition with that of the
Magistrate, (though with no great self-consistency)
ascribing the preheminence and
prevalency in obligation unto that of
Conscience, and that in the principal and
most important duties of Religion and
humane life. Such are all those moral
Vertues, which have in their Nature a
resemblance of the divine perfections,
wherein he placeth the Substance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
With respect unto these, he so
setteth up the Throne of Conscience, as
to affirm that if any thing be commanded
by the Magistrate against them, <hi>to disobey
Him is no Sin, but a Duty;</hi> and we shall find
the Case to be the same in matters of meer
Revelation. For what God commands that
he commands, by what way soever that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnad
be made known to us. And there is no
consideration that can adde any thing to
the obligatory power and efficacy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Authority. So that where the Will
of God is the formal Reason of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it is all one how or by what means
it is discovered unto us, Whatever we
are instructed in by innate Reason, or by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by it, is neither the one nor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58629:52"/>
the other, but the Authority of God in
both.</p>
            <p>But we must return unto the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Sentiments of our Author
in this matter as before laid down. The
Authority ascribed to the Civil Magistrate
being as hath been expressed; it will be
very hard for any one to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and the Soveraignty that the
Lord Christ himself hath in and over his
Church; yea if there be any Advantage
on either side, or a comparative prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
it will be found to be cast upon
that of the Magistrate. Is the Lord Christ
the Lord of the Souls and Consciences of
men? Hath he dominion over them to rule
them in the things of the Worship of God?
It is so with the Magistrate also; He hath
<hi>an universal power over the Consciences of his
Subjects.</hi> Doth the Lord Christ require his
Disciples to do and observe in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God what ever he commanded
them? So also may the Magistrate, the
<hi>Rule and Conduct of Conscience in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
belonging unto him;</hi> provided that he
command nothing that may <hi>countenance
Vice, or disgrace the Deity;</hi> which, with
Reverence be it spoken, our Lord Jesus
Christ himself, not only on the Account of
the Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection and rectitude of his own
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58629:53"/>
Nature, but also of his Commission from
the Father, could not do. Is the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Christ the formal Reason making
Obedience necessary to his Commands and
Precepts? So is the Authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in reference unto what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
Do men therefore sin if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the observance of the commands of
Christ in the Worship of God, because of
his immediate Authority so to command
them binding their Consciences? So do
men sin if they omit or neglect to do what
the Magistrate requires in the Worship of
God because of his Authority, without
any farther respect. Hath the Lord
Christ instituted two Sacraments in the
Worship of God, that is <hi>outward visible
signs,</hi> or Symbols, <hi>of inward invisible or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Grace?</hi> the Magistrate if he please
may institute and appoint twenty under
the names of <hi>significant Ceremonies;</hi> that is
<hi>outward visible signs of inward spiritual grace,</hi>
which alone is the significancy contended
about. Hath the Magistrate this his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in and over Religion and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men from Jesus Christ? no
more then Christ hath his Authority from
the Magistrate; for he holds it by the Law
of Nature antecedent to the promise and
coming of Christ? Might Christ in his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58629:53"/>
own Person administer the Holy Things of
the Church of God? not in the Church of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he <hi>sprang of the Tribe of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
<hi>concerning which nothing was spoken as
to the Priesthood;</hi> only he might in that of
the Gospel, but hath judged meet to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Actual Administration of them to
others? So is it with the Magistrate also.
Thus far then Christ and the Magistrate
seem to stand on even or equal terms;
But there are two things remaining that
absolutely turn the scale and cast the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
on the Magistrates side. For
First, Men may do and practise many things
in the Worship of God which the Lord
Christ hath no where, nor by any means
required; yea to think that his Word or
the Revelation of his Mind and Will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is <hi>the sole and adequate Rule of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship,</hi> is reported as an Opinion
foolish, absurd, impious and destructive of
all Government. If this be not supposed
not only the whole Design of our Author
in this Book is defeated, but our whole
Controversie also is composed and at an
end. But on the other hand, no man must
do or practise any thing in that way, but
what is prescribed, appointed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Magistrate, upon pain of
Sin, Schism, Rebellion and all that follows
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58629:54"/>
thereon. To leave this unasserted is all
that the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> would desire in
order unto peace. Comprehension and
Indulgence would ensue thereon. Here I
think the Magistrate hath the advantage.
But that which follows will make it yet
more evident; for Secondly, Suppose the
Magistrate require any thing to be done
and observed in the Worship of God, and
the Lord Christ require the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in a mans own apprehension, so that he
is as well satisfied in his apprehension of his
mind as he can be of any thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to his faith and Conscience in the
Word of God; in this case he is to obey
Magistrate, and not Christ, as far as I can
learn; unless all Confusion and Disorder be
admitted an entrance into the world. Yea,
but this seems directly contrary to that
Rule of the Apostles, which hath such an
evidence and power of rational convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
attending it, that they refer it to the
judgement of their Adversaries, and those
persons of as perverse corrupt minds and
prejudicate engagements against them and
their cause, as ever lived in the world;
namely, <hi>Whether it be meet to obey God or man,
judge ye.</hi> But we are told, that <hi>this holds only
in greater matters;</hi> the <hi>Logick</hi> (by the way)
of which distinction, is as strange as its
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:58629:54"/>
               <hi>Divinity.</hi> For if the formal Reason of the
difference intimated, arise from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
between the Authority of God
and man, it holds equally as to all things
small or great that they may be oppositely
concerned in. Besides who shall judge
what is small, or what is great in things of
this Nature? <hi>Cave ne titubes.</hi> Grant but the
least judgement to private men themselves
in this matter, and the whole Fabrick
tumbles; If the Magistrate be Judge of
what is great and of what is little, we are
still where we were without hopes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.
And this to me is a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the preheminence of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
above Christ in this matter.
Some of the <hi>Old Irish</hi> have a Proverbial
Speech amongst them, <hi>That if christ had
not been Christ when he was Christ,</hi> Patrick
<hi>had been Christ;</hi> but it seems now that take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it for granted that he was Christ, yet
we have another that is so also; that is
Lord over the Souls and Consciences of
men; and what can be said more of him,
<hi>who sits in the Temple of God, and shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we formerly said <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> who
are unacquainted with the Mysteries of
things of this Nature, must needs desire
to know whether these be the avowed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58629:55"/>
Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or
whether they are only Inventions to serve
a present Turn of the pursuit of some mens
designs. Are all the old Pleas of the <hi>Jus
Divinum of Episcopacy,</hi> of <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
Apostolical,</hi> of a <hi>Parity of reason between
the Condition of the Church whilst under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Officers, and whilst under ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
of the power of the Church to appoint Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
for Decency and Order, of the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
of Christian Liberty with the necessary
practice of indifferent things, of the pattern
of the Churches of old,</hi> which (whether, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or otherwise we do not now determine)
have been insisted on in this cause, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
all up in this Abysse of Magistrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Omnipotency, which plainly renders
them useless and unprofitable? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
hath it been that the Christian
World was not sooner blessed with this
great Discovery of the only way and means
of putting a final end, unto all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
contests? That he should not until
now appear,
<q>
                  <l>Qui genus humanum ingenio Superavit, &amp; omnes</l>
                  <l>Praestrinxit stellas, exortus at aetherius sol.</l>
               </q>
But every Age produceth not a <hi>Columbus.</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:58629:55"/>
Many indeed have been the Disputes of
Learned men about the power of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in and concerning Religion. With
us it is stated in the recorded Actings of
our Soveraign Princes, in the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
and the Acts of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, with other Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
explanatory thereof. Some have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
him any concern herein; our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is none of them? but rather like the
<hi>Phrenetick Gentleman</hi> who when he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
in former dayes, for denying the
<hi>Corporal presence of Christ in the Sacrament:</hi>
replyed in his own defence, that he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
him to be present booted and spurred as
he rode to Capernaum.</hi> He hath brought
him in booted and spurred, yea armed
<hi>cap-a-pie</hi> into the Church of God, and
given all power into his hands to dispose
of the Worship of God according to his
own will and pleasure. And that not
with respect unto outward Order only,
but with direct obligation upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men.</p>
            <p>But doubtless it is the Wisdom of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Princes to beware of this sort of
Enemies; Persons who to promote their
own Interest make Ascriptions of such
things unto them, as they cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of, without the utmost hazzard of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58629:56"/>
displeasure of God. Is it meet that to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the desires of any, they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Prerogative of God, or set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
down at his right Hand in the
Throne of his only begotten Son? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they are no way concerned in what
others for their advantage sake, as they
suppose, will ascribe unto them, which
they may sufficiently disown by scorn and
silence. Nor can their sin involve them
in any guilt. It was not the vain Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the multitude unto <hi>Herod, the
voice of God and not of man,</hi> but his own
arrogant satisfaction in that <hi>blasphemous
Assignation</hi> of divine glory to him, that
exposed him to the judgements and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of God. When the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi>
found by the Answer of the <hi>Reubenites</hi>
that they had not transgressed against the
Law of Gods Worship, in adding unto it
or altering of it, which they knew would
have been a provocation not to have
been passed over without a recompence
of Revenge; They replyed unto them,
<hi>Now have you delivered the Children of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<hi>out of the hand of the Lord;</hi> and it is
to be desired that all the <hi>Princes of the</hi>
Israel <hi>of God</hi> in the world, all Christian
Potentates, would diligently watch against
giving admission unto any such Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58629:56"/>
as would deliver them <hi>into the hand
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, such is my Ignorance,
that I know not, that any Magistrate from
the foundation of the world, unless it
were <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Cai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Caligula, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
and Persons like to them, ever claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or pretended to exercise the power
here assigned unto them. The Instances
of the Laws and Edicts of <hi>Constantine</hi> in
the matters of Religion and the Worship
of God, of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Gratian, Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,
Martian</hi> and other Emperours of the
<hi>East</hi> remaining in the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Novels;</hi> the

Laws of <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings, the Right of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Jurisdiction inherent in the
Imperial Crown of this Nation, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
exercised in all Ages are of no
concernment in this matter. For no man
denyes but that it is the duty of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<hi>Magistrate</hi> to protect and further
the true Religion, and right Worship of
God, by all wayes and means suited and
appointed of God thereunto. To encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Professors thereof, to protect
them from wrong and violence, to secure
them in the performance of their duties,
is doubtless incumbent on them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
under pretence of Religion brings
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58629:57"/>
actual disturbance unto the peace of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
they may coerce and restrain. When
Religion as established in any Nation by
Law, doth or may interest the Professors
of it, or Guides in it, in any Priviledges,
Advantages, or Secular Emoluments, which
are subject and lyable, as all humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
to doubts, controversies, and litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
contests in their security and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposal,
all these things depend meerly and
solely on the power of the Magistrate, by
whose Authority they are originally grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by whose Jurisdictive Power both
the Persons vested with them, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are disposable. But for an Absolute
Power <hi>over the Consciences of men</hi> to bind
or oblige them formally thereby, to do
whatever they shall require in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, so as to make it their sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
eternal damnation not so to do,
without any consideration whether the
things are true or false, according to the
mind of God or otherwise, yea though
they are apprehended by them who are
so obliged to practise them, to be contrary
to the Will of God, that this hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been claimed by any Magistrate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
such as those before mentioned, I am
yet to seek. And the case is the same with
respect unto them who are not satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58629:57"/>
that what is so prescribed unto them will
be accepted with God. For whereas in
all that men do in the Worship of God,
they ought to be fully perswaded of its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableness
to God in their own minds,
seeing <hi>whatever is not of faith is sin,</hi> he <hi>that
doubteth</hi> is in a very little better Capacity
to serve God on such injunctions, then he
who apprehendeth them to be directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his mind.</p>
            <p>If an Edict were drawn up for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of Religion and Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in any Christian Nation, according to
the Principles and Directions before laid
down, it may be there would be no great
strife in the world by whom it should be
first owned and espoused. For it must be
of this Importance.</p>
            <p>Whereas We have an Vniversal and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power over the Consciences of all our
Subjects in things appertaining to the Worship
of God; so that if We please We can introduce
new duties, (never yet heard of,) in the most
important parts of Religion (<hi>pag.</hi> 80.) and
may impose on them in the practice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that in our Judgement it doth not countenance

before ever he was born, nor is expressed in

being such as that We our selves if We would,

            <p>Now, as was said before, I suppose Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes will not be earnest in their
Contests, who shall first own the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
intimated, and express it in a suitable
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58629:59"/>
exercise. And if any one of them should
put forth his hand unto it, he will find
that
<q>
                  <l>—Furiarum Maxima juxta</l>
                  <l>Accubat, &amp; manibus prohibet contingere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas.</l>
               </q>
There is one who layes an Antecedent
Claim to a Sole Interest in this Power, and
that bottomed on other manner of Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
than any as yet have been pleaded in
their behalf. For the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
here ascribed unto Princes, is none
other but that which is claimed by the
<hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> (with some few Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
and appropriated unto him by
his <hi>Canonists</hi> and Courtiers. Only here
the <hi>old Gentleman,</hi> (as he is called by our
Author) hath the advantage; that beside
the Precedency of his claim, it being entred
on Record at least six or seven hundred
years before any <hi>Proctor</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the behalf of Princes, he hath
forestall'd them all in the pretence of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;</hi>
which doubtless is a matter of
singular use in the exercise of the power
contended about. For some men are so
<hi>peevish</hi> as to think that thus to deal with
Religion and the Consciences of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58629:59"/>
to none but him, who is Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea <hi>essentially</hi> so, that is Infallible. For
as we have now often said (as contrary to
their design men in haste oftentimes speak
the same things over and over) as to all
Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over persons and
causes Ecclesiastical, and the Soveraign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposal
of all the Civil and Political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of Religion which is vested in
the Imperial Crown of this Nation, and
by sundry <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> is declared so
to be, I shall be alwayes ready to plead
the Right of our Kings, and all Christian
<hi>Kings</hi> whatever, against the absurd Pleas
and Pretences of the Pope; so as to this
Controversie between him and such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as shall think meet to contend with him
about it, concerning the power over the
Consciences of men before described, I
shall not interpose my self in the scuffle;
as being fully satisfied they are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about that which belongs to neither
of them.</p>
            <p>But what Reason is there, why this
Power should not be extended unto the
<hi>inward thoughts and apprehensions of men</hi>
about the Worship of God, as well as to the
expression of them in pure Spiritual Acts
of that Worship. The Power asserted I
presume will be acknowledged to be from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58629:60"/>
God; though I can scarce meet with the
Communication and derivation of it from
him in this Discourse. But whereas, it is
granted on all hands, that the <hi>Powers that
be are of God,</hi> and that none can have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over an other, unless it be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
given him from above; I desire to
be informed why the other part of the
Power mentioned, namely <hi>over the Thoughts,
Judgements, and Apprehensions of men</hi> in the
things of the Worship of God, should not
be invested in the Magistrate also; that so
he having declared what is to be believed,
thought, and judged in such things, all men
should be obliged so to believe, think,
and judge; for this power God can give;
and hath given it unto Jesus Christ. I
presume, it will be said, that this was no
way needful for the preservation of Peace
in Humane Society, which is the end for
which all this Power is vested in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.
For let men believe, think, and
judge what they please, so long as their
outward Actings are, or may be over-ruled,
there is no danger of any publick distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
But this seems to be a mighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
condition for mankind; namely to
live continually in a contradiction between
their Judgements and their Practices, which
in this case is allowed to be incident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58629:60"/>
them. Constantly to judge one way best
and most according to the mind of God
in his Worship, and constantly to practise
another, will, it is to be feared, prove
like the conflicting of vehement vapours
with their contrary qualities, that at one
time or other will produce an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.
How then if men weary of this
perplexing distorting condition of things
in their minds, should be provoked to run
to excesses and inordinate courses for their
freedom and Rest, such as our Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
displayes in all their hideous co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and appearances, and which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pernicious to Humane Policy and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety?
Were it not much better that all
these inconveniencies had been prevented
in the <hi>first Instance,</hi> by taking care that the
Faith, Thoughts, Perswasions, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all Subjects about the things of
God, should be absolutely bound up unto
the declared conceptions of their Rulers
in these matters? Let it not be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this is impossible, and contrary to
the natural liberty of the minds of men,
as rational creatures guiding and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
themselves according to their
own reason of things and understandings.
For do but fix the declared Will of the
Ruler, in the room and place of Divine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58629:61"/>
Revelation, (which is no hard matter to
do, which some actually do universally,
and our Author as to a great share and
proportion) and the obligation sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to prevent all Inconvencies in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
falls as full and directly upon the
minds, thoughts, and judgements of men,
as upon any of their outward Actions.
And this, for the substance of it, is now
pleaded for; seeing it is pretended that
in all things dubious, where men cannot
satisfie themselves that it is the Will of
God that they should do a thing, or no,
the Declaration of the Magistrate deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
not only their Practice, but their
Judgement also, and gives them that <hi>full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion</hi>
of their minds which is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably
required unto their acting in such
things; and that <hi>faith</hi> which frees them
from sin; <hi>For he that doubteth, is damned if
he eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be said, that there will be no
need hereof; For let men think and judge
what they please, whilst they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
and satisfied that it is their duty
not to practise any thing outwardly in
Religion, but what is prescribed by their
Rulers, it is not possible that any publick
evil should ensue upon their mental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
only. We observed before that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58629:61"/>
the condition described is exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie;
which I suppose will not be denyed
by men who have seriously considered,
what it is either to judge or practise any
thing that lyes before them with reference
unto the judgment of God. And that which
should tye men up to rest perpetually in
such a restless state, is as it seems a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of their duty. They ought to be,
and are supposed to be convinced that it
is their duty to maintain the liberty of
their minds and judgements, but to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in their outward practice universally
to the Laws of men that are over them.
And this sense and conviction of duty, is
a sufficient security unto publick tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in all that contrariety and opposition
of Sentiments unto Established Religion
and Forms of Worship that may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
But if this be so; why will not the
same conviction and sense of duty restrain
them, who do peaceably exercise the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God according to the Light and
Dictates of their Consciences, from any
actings whatever that may tend to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
of the Publick Peace? Duty,
nakedly considered, is even as such, the
greatest obligation on the minds of men;
and the great security of others in their
Actings ariseth from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is influenced and advantaged by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
considerations, the less it is assaulted
and opposed by things grievous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
in the way of the Discharge of it,
the more efficacious will be its operations
on the minds of men, and the firmer will
be the security unto others that thence
ariseth. Now these Advantages lye abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
on the part of them who practise, or
are allowed so to do, according to their
own Light and Perswasion in the Worship
of God, wherein they are at rest and full
satisfaction of mind; and not on theirs
who all their dayes are bound up to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
distorted posture of mind and soul, in
judging one thing to be best and most pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto God, and practising of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Such an one, is the man that of all
others, Rulers have need I think to be most
jealous of. For what security can be had
of him, who hath inured himself unto a
continual contradiction between his Faith
and his practice? For my part I should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expect no <hi>other measure</hi> from him in
any other thing, nor ever judge that his
profession and wayes of Actings are any
sufficient Indications of his mind, (which
takes away all security from mankind) or
fear that his Convictions of Light and
Knowledge, (as he apprehends) would
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58629:62"/>
at one time or other precipitate him into
attempts of Irregularity and violence for
his own relief.</p>
            <q>—Hic nig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r est, hunc tu Romane caveto.</q>
            <p>It will be said, perhaps, that we need
not look farther for the Disturbance of
publick peace, from them who practise
outwardly any thing in the Worship of
God but what is prescribed, established,
and enjoyned; seeing that every such
practice is such a disturbance it self. I
say this pretence is miserably ridiculous
and contemptible, and contrary to the
common experience of mankind. If this
were so, the whole World for 300 years,
lived in one continual disturbance and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
upon the account of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
whose Professors constantly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and performed that in the Worship of
God, which was so far from being establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or approved by Publick Authority, that
it was proscribed and condemned under
penalties of all sorts, pecuniary, corporal,
and sanguinary or capital. But we see
no such matter ensued, nor the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietment
unto the World, but what was
given unto it by the rage of bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
that introduced the first Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
into the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58629:63"/>
never well quieted, but ended in its disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
The experience also of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and next preceding Ages, casts this
frivolous exception out of consideration.
And as such a practice, even against Legal
Prohibitions, though it be by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of a penal Law, is yet in it self
and just consequence remote enough from
any disturbance of Government, (unless
we should suppose that every Non-obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of a <hi>penal Statute</hi> invalidates the
Government of a Nation, which were to
fix it upon such a Foundation, as will not
afford it the steddiness of a Weathercok;)
so being allowed by way of exemption,
it contains no invasion upon, or intrusion
into the rights of others; but being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the Abridgement of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of none, or the neglect of any
duty required to the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
it is as consistent with, and
may be as conducing to publick good and
Tranquility, as any order of Religious
things in the World, as shall be elsewhere
demonstrated.</p>
            <p>It remains therefore that the only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this consideration is, that men
who plead for Indulgence and Liberty of
Conscience in the Worship God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Word, and the Light which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58629:63"/>
He hath given them therein, have indeed no
conscience at all, and so are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
as to what they profess against si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
and evil Practises. This Flaile I
know no fence against, but this only; that
they have as good and better grounds to
suspect him to have no conscience at all,
who upon unjust surmises shall so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
charge them, as finding him in a
direct transgression of the principal Rules
that Conscience is to be guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by, than he hath to pronounce such
a judgement concerning them and their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
in what they prosess. And whether
such mutual censures tend not to the utter
overthrow of all peace, love, and security
amongst mankind is easie to determine.
Certainly it is the worst game in the World
for the Publick, to have men bandying
suspicions one against another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
managing mutual charges of all that
they do surmise, or what else they please
to give the countenance of <hi>surmise</hi> unto.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge the notion insisted on,
namely, <hi>that mhilest men reserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the freedom and liberty of judging
what they please, or what seems good unto
them in matters of Religion and the Worship
of God, they ought to esteem it their duty to
practise in all things according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58629:64"/>
of their Rulers, though every may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto, and inconsistent with their own
judgements and perswasions, unless it be in
things that countenance Vice, or disgrace
the Deity</hi> (where of yet it may be, it
will not be thought meet that they
themselves should judge for themselves
and their own practise, seeing they may
extend their conceptions about what doth
so unto such minute Instances as would
frustrate the whole design) is exceedingly
accommodated to the corrupt lusts and
affections of men, and suited to make
provision for their security in this world,
by an exemption from the indispensable
command of professing the truth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
and known unto them; a sense of
the obligation where of, hath hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
innumerable persons in all Ages to
great difficulties, dangers, and sufferings,
yea to death the height and summ of all.
For whereas men have been perswaded that
<hi>with the heart man believeth unto Righteousness,
and with the mouth Confession is made unto
Salvation;</hi> the latter clause is in many
cases hereby sufficiently superseded;
and the troublesome duty seeming to
be required in it, is removed out of
the way. It will not, it may be, be
so easie to prove that in the Religion
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58629:64"/>
of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> there is any thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in practise, that will directly fall
under the limitations assigned unto the
complyance with the commands of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
contended for. And therefore
let a man but retain his own apprehensions
concerning Jesus Christ and the Gospel, it
may be lawful for him, yea be his duty to
observe the worship enjoyned by the Law
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if his lot fall to live under
the power of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> or any
Soveraign Prince of the same perswasion.
But the case is clear in the Religion of
the Papists, which is under the protection
of the greatest number of supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in <hi>Europe.</hi> It will not be pretended,
I suppose by our Author, that there is any
thing in the confession of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or imposed by it on the practices of
men, that directly gives countenance unto
any Immorality, especially as the sense of
that term is by him stated; and it is no
easie matter for ordinary men to prove and
satisfie themselves, that there is ought in
their Modes of Worship of such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
as to cast disgrace upon the Deity;
especially considering with how much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and diligence the charge of any such
miscarriage is endeavoured to be answered
and removed; all which pleas ought to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58629:65"/>
satisfied, before a man can make sedately a
determinate judgement of the contrary.
Let then men's judgements be what they
will in the matters of difference between
<hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> it is on this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
the duty of all that live under the
Dominion of Soveraign Popish Princes,
outwardly to comply with and practise
that Religious Worship that is commanded
by them and enjoyned. The case is the
same also as to the Religion of the Jews.
Now as this casts a Reflection of incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
folly and unexpiable guilt upon all
<hi>Protestant Martyrs,</hi> in casting away their
own lives, and disobeying the Commands
of their lawful Soveraigns? so it exposeth
all the Protestants in the World who are
still in the same condition of subjection,
to the severe censures of Impiety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
and must needs exasperate their
Rulers to pursue them to destruction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of unwarrantable obstinacy
in them. For if we wholly take off the
protection of Conscience in this matter,
and its subjection to the Authority of
God alone, there is no plea left to excuse
dissenting Protestants from the guilt of
such crimes, as may make men justly cry
out against them as the <hi>Jews</hi> did against
St. <hi>Paul, Away with them, away with them,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58629:65"/>
it is not meet</hi> that such Fellows should
live; or, <hi>Frotestantes ad Leones,</hi> according
to the old cry of the Pagans against the
Primitive Christians. But if this should
prove to be a way of teaching and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the grossest <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the nature of man is capable of,
a means to cast off all regard unto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God over the wayes and lives
of men, all the Rhetorick in the World
shall never perswade me that God hath so
moulded and framed the order and state of
humane affairs, that it should be any way
needful to the preservation of publick
peace and tranquility. Openness, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart, Sincerity in our Actions and
Professions, Generous honesty, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
respect in all things to the supream
Rector of all, the great Possessour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, with an endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with His present revealed mind, and
future judgement, are far better Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for, and ligaments of publick peace
and quietness. To make this the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our Political Superstructure, that
<hi>Divisum Imperium Cum Jove Caesar habet,</hi>
God hath immediate and sole power over
the minds and inward thoughts of men;
but the Magistrate over the Exercise of
those thoughts in things especially belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58629:66"/>
to the Worship of God, and in the
same Instances, seems not to prognosticate
a stable or durable building. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
was not of that mind of old, who in
the name of God blamed the people for
willingly walking after the Commandment
of their Ruler, in concerns of Worship
not warranted by Divine appointment;
nor was <hi>Daniel</hi> so, who notwithstanding
the severe prohibition made against his
praying in his house, continued to do so
three times a day.</p>
            <p>But besides all this! I do not see how
this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is necessarily subservient to
the principal design of the Author, but it
may be as well improved to quite distant,
yea contrary ends and purposes. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
plainly is, to have one Fabrick of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
erected, one Form of External
Worship enacted and prescribed, which all
men should be compelled by penalties to
the outward profession and observance
of; these penalties he would have to be
such as should not fail of their end; namely,
of taking away all professed Dissent from
his Religious establishment; which if it
cannot be effected without the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and death of multitudes, they also are
not to be forborn. Now how this ensues
from the fore-mentioned Principle I know
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58629:66"/>
not. For a supream Magistrate, finding
that the minds of very many of his Subjects
are in their judgements and perswasions
engaged in a dissent unto the Religion
established by Him, or somewhat in it, or
some part of it, especially in things of
practical worship; though he should be
perswaded that he hath so far a power
over their Consciences, as to command
them to practise contrary to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet knowing their minds and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to be out of his reach and exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Jurisdiction, why may he not
think it meet and conducing to publick
tranquillity and all the ends of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
even the good of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
committed to his charge, rather to
indulge them in the quiet and peaceable
exercise of the Worship of God according
to their own light, than alwayes to bind
them unto that unavoidable disquietment
which will ensue upon the conflict in their
minds between their judgements and their
practices, if he should oblige them as is
desired. Certainly, as in truth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
so according to this Principle, he hath
power so to do. For to fancy him such a
power over the Religion and Consciences
of his Subjects, as that he should be inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
bound on all occurrences and in all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58629:67"/>
conditions of affairs, to impose upon them
the necessary observation of one form of
Worship, is that which would quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to inextricable troubles. And
Instances of all sorts might be multiplyed
to shew the ridiculous folly of such a
Conception. Nay it implies a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to what is disputed before. For
if he be obliged to settle and impose such
a form on all, it must be because there was
a necessity of somewhat antecedent to his
imposition, whence his obligation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it did arise. And on such a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
it is in vain to enquire after his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
or his power in these things, seeing
by his duty he is absolutely determined,
and whatever that be which doth so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
him and put an obligation upon
him, it doth indispensably do the same on
his Subjects also; which as it is known ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
excludes the Authority pleaded
for.</p>
            <p>This Principle therefore indeed asserts
his liberty to do what he judgeth meet in
these matters, but contains nothing in it
to oblige him to judge, that it may not
be meet and most conducing unto all the
ends of his Government to indulge unto
the Consciences of men peaceable, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if complying with him in all the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58629:67"/>
Fundamentals of the Religion which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
professeth) the liberty of Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God according to what they apprehend
of his own mind and Will. And let an
application of this Principle be made to
the present state of this Nation, wherein
there are so great multitudes of persons
peaceable and not unuseful unto publick
good, who dissent from the present esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of outward Worship, and have
it not in their power either to change their
judgements or to practise contrary unto
them; and as it is in the power of the
supream <hi>Magistrate</hi> to indulge them in
their own way, so it will prove to be his
Interest as he is the spring and center of
of publick Peace and Prosperity.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it appear that in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
our Author hath had any regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the real principles of the power of
the Magistrate as stated in this Nation, or
to his own which are fictitious; but yet
such as ought to be obligatory to himself;
His principal Assertion is, that the <hi>Supream
Magistrate hath power to bind the Consciences
of men in matters of Religion,</hi> that is by
Laws and Edicts to that purpose; Now the
highest and most obligatory way of the
Supream Magistrates speaking in <hi>England,</hi>
is <hi>by Acts of Parliament;</hi> It is therefore
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58629:68"/>
supposed that what is so declared in or
about matters of Religion, should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory
to the Conscience of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
but yet quite otherwise, <hi>p.</hi> 59.
He sets himself to oppose and condemn a
publick Law of the Land, on no other
ground than because it stood in his way,
and seemed incompliant with his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
For whereas the Law of 2 and 3
<hi>Ed.</hi> 6. which appointed two weekly dayes
for Abstinence from flesh, had been amongst
other Reasons Prefaced with this, <hi>That
the Kings Subjects having now a more clear
Light of the Gospel through the Infinite mercy
of God</hi> (such canting Language was then
therein used) <hi>and thereby the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
perceiving that one meat of it self was
not more holy than another,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that due Abstinence, was a means to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and to subdue mens bodies to their souls
and spirits,</hi> &amp;c. And it being after found
(it should seem by a farther degree of
Light) that those Expressions meeting
with the inveterate Opinions of some,
newly brought out of Popery, had given
countenance to them to teach or declare,
that something of Religion was placed
therein; thereon by the Law made
5 <hi>Elizab.</hi> adding another weekly day to
be kept with the former for the same
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58629:68"/>
purpose, the former clause was omitted,
and mention only made therein of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Politique Reasons inducing the
Legislators thereunto; and withall a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of inflicting punishment on those who
<hi>should affirm and maintain that there was
any concernment of Conscience and Religion
in that matter.</hi> This provision hath so
distasted our Author, that forgetting it
seems his own Design, he reproaches it with
the Title of <hi>Jejunium Cecilianum;</hi> and
thinks it so far from obliging his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to acquiess in the Determination
therein made, that he will not allow it to
give Law to his tongue or pen; But (<hi>vexet
censura columbas</hi>) it seems they are the
Phanaticks only that are thus to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained.</p>
            <p>Moreover
on occasion hereof we might
manifest how some other Laws of this Land
do seem carefully to avoid that imposition
on Conscience, which against Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he pleadeth for; For Instance in that
of 21 <hi>Jacob.</hi> touching Usury, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of it unto the summ therein esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
it was <hi>provided, that no words in this
Act conteined shall be construed or expounded
to allow the practise of Vsury in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Conscience.</hi> And why did not the
supream Magistrate in that Law determine
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58629:69"/>
and bind the Consciences of men, by a
declaration of their duty in a point of
Religion; seeing whether way soever the
determination had been made, neither
would <hi>immorality have been countenunced,</hi>
nor the <hi>Deity disgraced?</hi> But plainly it is
rather declared, that he hath not Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce
of such things with reference to the
Consciences of men to oblige them, or set
them at liberty, but only power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what may be practised in order to
publick profit and peace. And therefore
the Law would neither bind, nor set at
liberty the Consciences of men in such
cases, which is a work for the supream
Law-giver only.</p>
            <p>Neither, as it hath been before observed,
do the Principles here asserted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for, either express or represent the
<hi>supremacy of the Kings of this Nation in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Ecclesiastical</hi> as it is stated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by themselves in Parliament; but
rather so, as to give great offence and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the Religion here professed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Adversaries thereof; for
after there appeared some ambiguity in
those words of the Oath enacted 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of
<hi>testifying the Queen to be supream Governour
as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things
or Causes, as in Temporal;</hi> and many doubts and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58629:69"/>
scruples ensued thereon, as though there
were assigned to her a power <hi>over the
Consciences of her Subjects in spiritual things,</hi>
or that she had a power Her self to order
and administer spiritual things; In <hi>quinto
Elizab.</hi> it is enacted by way of Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Oaths aforesaid shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in such form as is set forth in the
<hi>Admonition</hi> annexed to the Queens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,
published in the first year of Her
Reign, where disclaiming the power of the
Ministry of divine offices in the Church, or
the <hi>power of the Priesthood</hi> here by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
affixed to the supream Magistrate, her
power and Authority is declared to be <hi>a
Soveraignty over all manner of persons born
within this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Temporal, so that no foraign power hath,
or ought to have any superiority over them;</hi>
And so is this <hi>supremacy</hi> stated in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<hi>Anno</hi> 1562. namely an <hi>Autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity to Rule
all Estates and Degrees committed to the charge
of the supream Magistrate by God,</hi> whether
they be <hi>Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the stubborn or evil-doers.</hi> Of the things
contended for by our Author; the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Priesthood,</hi> and <hi>power over the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men in matters of Religion</hi> there is
not one word in our Laws, but rather they
are both of them rejected and condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:58629:70"/>
I have yet laid the least part of that
Load upon this Principle, which if it be
farther pressed it must expect to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
withal, and that from the Common
Suffrage of Christians in all Ages. But
yet that I may not transgress against the
design of this short and hasty Discourse,
I shall proceed no farther in the pursuit of
it; but take a little <hi>Survey</hi> of what is here
pleaded in its defence. Now this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
and pursued in the first Chapter,
with the two next ensuing, where an end
is put to this Plea. For if I understand
any thing of his words and expressions,
our Author in the beginning of his fourth
Chapter, cuts down all those Gourds and
Wild Vines that he had been planting in
the three preceding; for he not only
grants but disputes also for an obligation
on the Consciences of men <hi>antecedent and
superiour</hi> unto all humane Laws and their
obligation; his words are as followeth,
pag. 115. <hi>It is not because Subjects are in
any thing free from the Authority of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power on earth, but because they are
subject to a Superiour in Heaven; and they
are only then excused from the duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to their Soveraign when they cannot
give it without Rebellion against God; So that
it is not originally any Right of their own
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58629:70"/>
that exempts them from a subjection to the
Soveraign Power in all things; but it is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gods right of Governing his own Creatures
that Magistrates then invade when they make
Edicts to violate or controll his Laws; and
those who will take off from the Consciences
of men, all obligations antecedent to those of
Humane Laws, instead of making the Power of
Princes, Supream, absolute, and uncontrolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they utterly enervate all their Authority,
and set their Subjects at perfect Liberty from
all their Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no men that pretend to Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
from the Obligation of Humane
Laws, but only on this Plea, that God by
<hi>his Law</hi> requires them to do otherwise;
and if this be so, the Authority of such
Laws as to the Consciences of men, is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseded
by the confession of this Author.
Allow therefore but the Principles here
expressed, namely, that men have a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Power over them in Heaven, whose
Laws, and the Revelation of whose Will
concerning them, is the Supream Rule of
their duty, whence an Obligation is laid
upon their Consciences of doing whatever
is commanded, or not doing what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by him, which is superiour unto,
and actually supersedes all Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Laws that interfere therewith,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58629:71"/>
and I see neither use of, nor place for
that Power of Magistrates over the
Consciences of men, which is so earnestly
contended for. And our Author also in
his ensuing Discourse in that Chapter,
placeth all the security of Government in
the Respect that the Consciences of men
have to the Will and Command of God;
and which they profess to have; which
in all <hi>these Chapters</hi> he pleads to be a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of all Confusion. But it is the first
Chapter which alone we are now taking
a view of.</p>
            <p>The only Argument therein insisted on to
to make good the Ascription unto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
of the power over Religion and the
Consciences of men before described, is <hi>the
absolute and indispensable necessity of it, unto
publick Tranquility, which is the principal, and
most important End of Government.</hi> In the
pursuit of this Argument, sometimes yea
often, such expressions are used concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Magistrates power, as in a tolerable
Construction declare it to be what no man
denyes nor will contend about. But it is
necessary that they be interpreted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Genius</hi> and tenor of the Opinion
contended for, and accordingly we will
consider them. This alone I say is that
which is here pleaded, or is given in as the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58629:71"/>
subject of the ensuing Discourse. But
after all, I think that he who shall set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
seriously to find out how any thing
here spoken, hath a direct and rational co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
towards the establishment of the
conclusion before laid down, will find
himself engaged in no easie an undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
We were told I confess at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
(so as that we may not complain of
a surprizal) that we must expect to have
<hi>Invectives twisted with Arguments,</hi> and some
such thing seems here to be aimed at; but
if a <hi>Logical Chymist</hi> come, and make a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Elements, of this Composition,
he will find, if I mistake not, an heap of
the <hi>drossy Invective,</hi> and scarce the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of any <hi>argument Ore.</hi> Instead of
sober rational arguing,
<q>
                  <l>—crimina rasis</l>
                  <l>Librat in Antithetis;—</l>
               </q>
great Aggravations of mens miscarriages
in the pursuit of the Dictates of their
Consciences, either real or feigned,
edged against, and fiercely reflected upon
those whom he makes his Adversaries, and
these the same for substance, repeated over
and over in a great variety of well placed
words, take up the greatest part of his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58629:72"/>
Plea in this Chapter; especially the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, wherein alone the Controversie
as by himself stated is concerned.</p>
            <p>But if the Power and Authority over
Religion and the Consciences of men here
ascribed unto Supream Magistrates, be so
indispensably necessary to the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of publick Tranquility, as is pretended,
a man cannot but wonder how the world
hath been in any Age past, kept in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
peace and quietness; and how it is
any where blessed with those ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at this day. For it will not be
an easie task for our Author, or any one
else to demonstrate that the Power men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
hath ever been either claimed or
exercised by any Supream Magistrate in
<hi>Christendom,</hi> or that it is so at this day.
The Experience of past and present Ages,
is therefore abundantly sufficient to defeat
this pretence, which is sufficiently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
without the least appearance of
proof or Argument to give it countenance
or confirmation; or they must be very
charitable to him, or ignorant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who will mistake Invectives for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
The remembrance indeed of
these Severities I would willingly lay aside;
especially because the very mention of
them seems to express an higher sense of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58629:72"/>
and regret concerning them, then I am in
the least subject unto, or something that
looks like a design of Retaliation; but as
these things are far from my mind, so the
continual returns that almost in every
Page I meet with, of high and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Reproaches, will not allow that they
be alwayes passed by without any notice
or remark.</p>
            <p>It is indeed indispensably necessary
that publick Peace and Tranquility be
preserved; but that there is any thing
in point of Government necessary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
but that God have all spiritual
power over the Consciences of men, and
Rulers Political power over their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
wherein publick Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
are concerned, the World hath
not hitherto esteemed, nor do I expect to
find it proved by this Author. If these
things will not preserve the publick peace,
it will not be kept if one should rise from
the dead to perswade men unto their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Power of God over the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, I suppose is acknowledged
by all who own any such thing as Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or believe there is a God over all.
That also in the exercise of this Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he requires of men all that obedience
unto Rulers that is any way needfull or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58629:73"/>
expedient unto the preservation of the
ends of their Rule, is a Truth standing
firm on the same Foundation of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
consent, derived from the Law of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
and his positive Commands to that
purpose, have an evidence of his Will in
this matter not liable to exception or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll.
This Conscience unto God our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
confesseth (as we have observed, in
his fourth Chapter, to be the great preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and security of Goverment and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
with respect unto the ends men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
And if so, what becomes of all
the pretences of disorder and confusion
that will ensue, unless this power over
mens Consciences be given to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and taken as it were out of the
hands of God? Nor is it to be supposed
that men will be more true to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
supposing the Reiglement of them
in the hand of men, than when they are
granted to be in the hand and power of
God; for both at present are supposed to
require the same things. Certainly where
Conscience respects Authority, as it always
doth, the more Absolute and Soveraign it
apprehends the Authority by which it is
obliged, the greater and more firm will be
the impressions of the obligation upon it.
And in that Capacity of preheminence, it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58629:73"/>
must look upon the Authority of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the Authority of man. Here
then lyes the security of publick peace
and tranquility, as it is backed by the
Authority of the Magistrate, to see that
all outward Actions are suitable unto
what Conscience toward God doth in this
matter openly and unquestionably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>The
pretence indeed is that the placing
of this Authority over the Consciences of
men in the Supream Ruler, doth obviate
and take away all grounds and occasions
of any such Actings on the Account of
Religion, as may tend unto publick distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
For suppose Conscience in things
concerning Religion and the Worship of
God subject to God alone, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
require such things to be observed
in the one or the other as God hath not
required, at least in the Judgements and
Consciences of them of whom the things
prescribed are required, and to forbid the
things that God requires to be observed
and done; in this case it is said they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or will not comply in Active Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
with the Commands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
But what if it so fall out? Doth
it thence follow that such persons must
needs Rebell and be Seditious and disturb
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58629:74"/>
the publick peace, of the Society whereof
they are Members? Wherefore is it that
they do not do or observe what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them by the Magistrate in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or the Worship of God, or that they
do what he forbids? Is it not because of
the Authority of God over their minds
and Consciences in these things? And why
should it be supposed that men will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Obligations laid by God on their
Consciences in one thing, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
in the things of his Worship and not
of obedience unto Civil Power, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which his Commands are as express and
evident, as they can be pretended to be in
the things which they avow their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto.</p>
            <p>Experience is pretended to the contrary.
It is said again and again, that <hi>men under
pretence of their Consciences unto God in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
have raised Wars and Tumults, and brought
all things into confusion, in this Kingdom</hi> and
Nation especially; and what will words
avail against the evidence of so open an
experience to the contrary? But what if
this also should prove a false and futilous
pretence? Fierce and long Wars have been
in this Nation of old, upon the various
Titles of persons pleading their Right unto
Supream Government in the Kingdom,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58629:74"/>
against one another; so also have there
been about the Civil Rights and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of the Subjects, in the Confusions
commonly called the <hi>Barons Wars.</hi> The
late Troubles, Disorders, and Wars amongst
us must bear the weight of this whole
charge. But if any one will take the pains
to review the publick Writings, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Treaties whereby those Tumults and
Wars were begun and carried on, he will
easily discern that Liberty of Conscience
in practice, or the exemption of it from
the power of the Magistrate as to the Rule
and Conduct of it now ascribed unto him,
in the latitude by sober persons defended
or pleaded for, had neither place in, nor
influence into the Beginnings of those
troubles. And when such confusions are
begun, no man can give assurance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
where they shall end.</p>
            <p>Authority, Laws, Priviledges, and I
know not what things wherein private
men of whom alone we treat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have no
pretence of Interest, were pleaded in those
Affairs. He that would judge aright of
these things, must set aside all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
and give his instance of the
Tumults and Seditions that have ensued on
the account of menskeeping their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
entire for God alone, without any
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58629:75"/>
just Plea, or false pretence of Authority,
and the interest of men in the Civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of Nations.</p>
            <p>However it cannot be pretended that
<hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> gave the least occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto any disorders in those dayes. For
indeed there was none, but only that of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and Judgement, which our Author
placeth out of the Magistrates cognizance
and dispose; and supposeth it is as a thing
wherein the publick peace neither is nor
can be concerned. It is well if it prove
so; but this Liberty of Judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
prest with a practice contrary to
its own determinations, will I fear prove
the most dangerous posture of the minds
of men in reference to publick tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they can be well disposed into.
However we may take a little nearer view
of the certain Remedy provided for all
these evils by our Author, and satisfie our
selves in some Enquiries about it. Shall
then according to this Expedient the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate govern, rule, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
unto obedience the consciences of
his Subjects universally in all things
in Religion and the Worship of God,
so that appoint what he please,
forbid what he please, Subjects are
bound in Concience to observe them
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58629:75"/>
and yield obedience accordingly? His
answer as far as I can gather his meaning
is, that he may and must do so in all things,
taking care that what he commands shall
neither <hi>countenance Vice, nor disgrace the
Deity,</hi> and then the Subjects are obliged
according to the Enquiry. But yet there
seems another limitation to be given to
this power <hi>p.</hi> 37. where he affirms, that the
<hi>Lord Christ hath given severe Injunctions to
secure the obedience of men to all lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
except where they run directly cross
to the interest of the Gospel;</hi> and elsewhere
he seems to give the same priviledge of
Exemption, where a <hi>Religion is introduced
that is Idolatrous or Superstitious.</hi> I would
then a little farther enquire, who shall
judge whether the things commanded in
Religion and the Worship of God be <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
or Superstitious?</hi> Whether they <hi>cross
directly the Interest of the Gospel?</hi> Whether
they countenance Vice, and disgrace the
Deity, or no. To say that the Magistrate
is to judge and determine hereof, is the
highest foppery imaginable. For no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
unless he be distracted, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
such a Religion to observance, as he
judgeth himself to fall under the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
mentioned; and when he hath done
declare that so they do, and yet require
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58629:76"/>
obedience unto them. Besides, if this
Judgement be solely committed unto him,
indeed in the issue there neither is, nor
can be any Question for a Judgement to be
passed upon in this matter. For his Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth quite render useless all disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to that purpose. The judgement and
determination hereof therefore is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be left unto the <hi>Subjects,</hi> from whom
obedience is required. So it lyes in the
letter of the Proposal, <hi>they must obey in all
things but such;</hi> and therefore surely must
judge what is such and what is not. Now
who shall fix bounds to what they will
judge to fall under one or other of these
limitations? if they determine according
to the best light they have that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Observances enjoyned by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
do <hi>directly cross the Interest of the
Gospel,</hi> they are absolved by our Author
from any obligation in Conscience to their
observation. And so we are just as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and this great Engine for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tranquility vanisheth into Air and
Smoak.</p>
            <p>Thus this Author himself in way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
supposeth a case of a Magistrate
enjoyning, as was said, <hi>a Religion Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and Idolatrous;</hi> this he acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be an Inconvenience; yet such as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58629:76"/>
is far beneath the Mischiefs the ensue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Exemption of the Consciences of
men in Religion from the power of the
the Magistrate, which I confess I cannot
but admire at, and can give Reasons why
I do so admire it; which also may be
given in due season. But what then is to be
done in this Case? he answers, <hi>It is to be
born:</hi> True, but how? Is it to be so born
as to practise and observe the things so
enjoyned though Superstitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous?
though his words are dubious, yet
I suppose he will not plainly say so; not
can he unless he will teach men to cast
off all respect unto the Authority of God,
and open such a door to Atheism, as his
rhetorical Prefatory Invective will not be
able to shut. The <hi>bearing</hi> then intended
must be by <hi>patient suffering</hi> in a refusal to
practise what is so commanded, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the contrary Commands of God.
But why in this Case ought they to suffer
quietly for refusing a compliance with what
is commanded, and for their observance
of the contrary Precepts of the Gospel?
Why, they must do so because of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, obliging their Consciences
unto Obedience to the Magistrate in all
things wherein the publick peace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and so that is absolutely secured.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58629:77"/>
Is it not evident to him that hath but
half an eye that we are come about again
where we were before? Let this be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to all the concernments of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Religious Worship, and there will
arise with respect unto them, the same secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which in this case is deemed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and all that Humane Affairs are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of. For if in greater matters men
may refuse to act according to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Command, out of a sense of the
Authority of God obliging them to the
contrary, and yet their Civil Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Obedience be absolutely secured
from the respect of their Consciences to
the Command of God requiring it; why
should it not be admitted that they may
and will have the same respect to that
Command, when they dissent from the
Magistrates Constitution in lesser things,
on the same account of the Authority of
God requiring the contrary of them? Shall
we suppose that they will cast off the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God requiring their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
on the account of their dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in lesser things of the Magistrates
appointment, when they will not do so
for all the violences that may be offered
unto them in things of greater and higher
importance? The Principle therefore as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58629:77"/>
is as useless as it is false, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
sufficiently of both those properties
to render it inconsiderable and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And he that can reconcile these
things among themselves, or make them
useful to the Authors design, will atchieve
what I dare not aspire unto.</p>
            <p>I know not any thing that remains in
this <hi>first Chapter</hi> deserving our farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
What seems to be of real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
or to have any aspect towards the
cause in hand, may undergoe some brief
Remarques, and so leave us at liberty to a
farther progress. In general a supposition
is laid down, and it is so vehemently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
as is evident that it is accompanied
with a desire that it should be taken for
granted; namely, that if the Consciences
of men be not regulated in the choice and
practice of Religion by the Authority of
the Magistrate over them, they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
run into Principles and practices
inconsistent with the safety of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and such as will lead them to Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Tumults; And hence, (if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him, a matter I am continually jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
about from the loosness of his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
though I am satisfied I constantly
take his words in the words in the sense
which is received of them by most intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58629:78"/>
persons) he educeth all his reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and not from a meer dissent from the
Magistrates Injuctions, without the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of such Principles, or an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into such practices. I cannot I say,
find the Arguments that arise from a meer
supposition that men in some things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the worship of God, will or do
practise otherwise than the Magistrate
commands, which are used to prove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency
of such a posture of things with
publick Tranquility, which yet alone was
the Province our Author ought to have
managed. But there is another supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
added, that where Conscience is in
any thing left unto its own liberty to
choose or refuse in the Worship of God,
there it will embrace, sure enough, such
wicked debauched and seditious principles,
as shall dispose men unto commotions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and all such evils as will actually
evert all rule, order and policy amongst
men. But now this supposition will not be
granted him, in reference unto them who
profess to take up all their Profession of
Religion from the command of God, or
the Revelation of his Will in the Scripture,
wherein all such Principles and Practices
as those mentioned are utterly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the whole Profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58629:78"/>
being left for 300 years without the
Rule, Guidance, and conduct of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
now contended for, did not once
give the least disturbance unto the Civil
Governments of the World. Disturbances
indeed there were, and dreadful Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Government in those dayes and
places, when and where the Professors of
it lived; but no concerns of Religion
being then involved in or with the Civil
Rights and Interests of men, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it had no Engagements in them,
so from those Alterations and Troubles no
reflection could be made on their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And the like Peace, the like Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of Religion, the like freedom from
all possibility of such imputations as are
now cast upon it, occasioned meerly by
its intertexture with the Affairs, Rights,
and Laws of the Nations, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of its professours as such therein,
will ensue, when it shall be separated from
that Relation wherein it stands to this
world, and left as the pure naked ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of the souls of men to another, and
not before.</p>
            <p>But what, sayes our Author, <hi>If for the
present the minds of men happen to be tainted
with such furious and boysterous conceptions
of Religion as incline them to stubbornness and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58629:79"/>
sedition, and make them unmanageable to the
laws of Government, shall not a Prince be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to give check to such unruly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
perswasions?</hi> I answer; That such
Principles which being professed and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
are in their own Nature and just Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
destructive to publick peace and
humane Society, are all of them directly
opposite to the Light of humane nature,
that common Reason and consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
wherein and whereon all Government
is founded, with the prime Fundamental
Laws and dictates of the Scripture, and so
may and ought to be restrained in the
practises of the persons that profess them;
and with reference unto them the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<hi>beareth not the sword in Vain—</hi> For
humane Society being inseparably conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
unto, and and an effect of the Law
of our Nature, or concreated principles of
it, which hath subdued the whole race of
Mankind in all times and places unto its
observance, Opinions, perswasions, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
opposite unto it or destructive of it,
manifesting themselves by any sufficient
evidence, or in overt Acts, ought to be no
more allowed than such as profess an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Being and Providence of God
himself. For mens <hi>Inclinations</hi> indeed, as
in themselves considered, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58629:79"/>
Judge of them amongst the Sons of
men; but as to all outward Actions that
are of the tendency described, they are
under publick Inspection to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
according to their Demerit.</p>
            <p>I shall only add that the <hi>Mormo</hi> here
made use of, is not now first composed or
erected; it hath for the substance of it been
flourished by the <hi>Papists</hi> ever since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Reformation. Neither did
they use to please themselves more in, or to
<hi>dance</hi> more merrily about any thing than
<hi>this Calf;</hi> Let private men have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
exempted from a necessary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Prescriptions of the Church,
and they will quickly run into all pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fancies and perswasions. It is known
how this Scare-crow hath been cast to
the ground, and this <hi>Calf</hi> stamped to
powder by Divines of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> It is no pleasant thing I confess
to see this plea revived now with respect
to the Magistrates Authority, and not the
Popes; for I fear that when it shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested,
and that by the consent of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that there is no pleadable Argument
to botom this pretension for the power of
the Magistrate upon, some rather then
forego it, will not be unwilling to recur
to the fountain from whence it first sprang,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58629:80"/>
and admit the Popes plea as meet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
in this case. And indeed if we must
come at length for the security of publick
peace, to deprive all private persons of
the Liberty of judging what is Right and
Wrong in Religion in reference to their
own practice, or what is their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God about his Worship and what
is not, there are innumerable advantages
attending the design of devolving the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
determination of these things upon
the Pope, above that of committing it to
each supream Magistrate in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
For besides the plea of at least bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
security in his determinations than in
that of any Magistrates, if not his Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
which he hath so long talked of, and
so sturdily defended as to get it a great
reputation in the world, the delivering
up of the Faith and Consciences of all men
unto him, will produce a seeming agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at least of incomparably a larger
extent, then the remitting of all things of
this nature to the pleasure of every su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Magistrate, which may probably
establish as many different Religions in the
World, as there are different Nations
Kingdoms or Commonwealths.</p>
            <p>That which alone remains seeming to
give countenance to the Assertions before
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58629:80"/>
laid down, is our Authors assignation of
the <hi>Priesthood</hi> by natural Right unto the
supream Magistrate, which in no alteration
of Religion he can be devested of, but by
vertue of some positive Law of God, as it
was for a season in the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institution
and Government. But these things seem
to be of no force. For it never belonged to
the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to govern or to rule the
Consciences of men with an absolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable
power; but only <hi>in</hi> their
name, and <hi>for</hi> them, to administer the
holy things, which by common consent
were admitted, and received amongst
them. Besides, our Author by his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
seems not to be much acquainted
with the rise of the office of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
amongst men, as shall be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if farther occasion be given thereunto.
However by the way we may observe what
is his judgement in this matter. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
we are told hath not his <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Authority</hi> from Christ; and yet this is
such as that the power of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> is
included therein; the exercise whereof
<hi>as he is pleased to transfer to others,</hi> so
he may, if he <hi>please, reserve it to himself,</hi>
p. 32. whence it follows, not only that it
cannot be given by Christ unto any other,
for it is part of the Magistrates power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:58629:81"/>
which he hath not limited, nor confined
by any subsequent Law, nor can there be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Coordinate Subject</hi> of the same power of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds; so that all the Interest or Right
any man, or men, have in or unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it, is but transfer'd to them by
the Magistrate; and therefore they act
therein, in his name, and by his Authority
only; and hence the Bishops, as such, are
said to be <hi>Ministers of State,</hi> p. 49. Neither
can it be pretended that this was indeed in
the power of the Magistrate before the
coming of Christ, but not since. For he
hath as we are told, all that he ever had,
unless there be a Restraint put upon Him
by some express prohibition of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>p.</hi> 41. which will hardly be found in
this matter. I cannot therefore see how
in the exercise of the <hi>Christian Priesthood</hi>
there is (on these principles) any the
least respect unto Jesus Christ, or his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
for men have only the <hi>exercise of
it transferred to them</hi> by the Magistrate, by
vertue of a power inherent in him ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
unto any concessions of Christ;
and therefore in his name and Authority
they must act in all the sacred offices of
their Functions. It is well if men be so far
awake as to consider the tendency of these
things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:58629:81"/>
At length Scripture proofs for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of these opinions are produced,
<hi>p.</hi> 35, 36. And the first pleaded, is that
promise, that <hi>Kings shall be nursings Fathers
unto the Church.</hi> It is true this is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and God accomplish it more and more;
But yet we do not desire such <hi>Nurses,</hi> as
<hi>beget the Children</hi> they nurse; The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
prescribing, commanding, binding
Religion on the Consciences of men, is
rather the <hi>begetting</hi> of it than its <hi>nursing.</hi>
To take care of the Church and Religion,
that it receive no detriment, by all the
wayes and means appointed by God, and
useful thereunto, is the duty of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
but it is so also antecedently to
their actings unto this purpose, to discern
aright which is the Church whereunto
this promise is made, without which they
cannot duly discharge their Trust, nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the Promise it self; The very Words,
by the rules of the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> do imply,
that the Church, and its Religion, and the
worship of God observed therein, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
fixed, and regulated by God
himself, antecedently unto the Magistrates
duty and power about it. They are to
Nurse that which is committed to them,
and not what Themselves have framed, or
begotten. And we contend for no more
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58629:82"/>
but a Rule concerning Religion, and the
Worship of God antecedent unto the
Magistrates interposing about it, whereby
both his Actings in his place, and those
of Subjects in theirs, are to be regulated
Mistakes herein have engaged many Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Princes in pursuit of their Trust as
<hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> to the Church, to lay out
their strength and power for the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of it; as may be evidenced in instances
too many of those, who in a subserviency
to, and by the direction of the Papal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
have endeavoured to extirpate true
Religion out of the World. Such a
<hi>Nursing Mother</hi> we had sometimes in <hi>England,</hi>
who in pursuit of her care burned so
many Bishops and other Holy men to
Ashes.</p>
            <p>He asks farther, <hi>what doth the Scripture
mean when it stiles our Saviour the King of
Kings, and maketh Princes his Vicegerents
here on earth?</hi> I confess, according to this
Gentleman's principles, I know not what it
means in so doing: Kings, he tells us, have
not their Authority in and over Religion,
and the Consciences of men from him, and
therefore in the exercise of it cannot be
his <hi>Vicegerents;</hi> for none is the <hi>Vicegerent</hi>
of another in the exercise of any power
or Authority, if he have not received that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58629:82"/>
power and Authority from him. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the words have a proper sense, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to our Authors purpose. It is his
power over them, and not theirs over the
Consciences of their Subjects, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the words. Of no more use in
this controversie is the direction of the
Apostle, that we <hi>should pray for Kings, that
under them we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life;</hi> for no more is intended therein,
but that, under their peaceable and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
administration of humane Affairs, we
may live in <hi>that Godliness, and honesty,</hi>
which is required of us. Wherefore then
are these weak attempts made to confirm
and prove what is not? Those, or the most
of them, whom our Author in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
treats with so much severity, do
plead that it is the duty of all supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
to find out, receive, imbrace,
promote the Truths of the Gospel, with
the Worship of God appointed therein,
confirming, protecting, and desending
them, and those that embrace them, by
their Power and Authority. And in the
discharge of this duty, they are to use the
liberty of their own judgements, enform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the wayes that God hath appointed,
independently on the dictates and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of any other persons whatever;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58629:83"/>
They affirm also, that to this end they are
entrusted with supream power over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in their respective Dominions, who on
no pretence can be exempted from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of that power, as occasion in their
judgements shall require it to be exercised;
as also that all causes, wherein the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Religion in their Dominions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
which are determinable in <hi>foro
Civili</hi> by <hi>coercive Vmpirage</hi> or Authority,
are subject unto their cognizance and
power. The Soveraign power over the
Consciences of men to institute, appoint,
and prescribe Religion, and the Worship
of God, they affirm to belong unto him
alone, who is the <hi>Author and Finisher of our
Faith,</hi> who is the <hi>head over all things to the
Church.</hi> The Administration of things
<hi>meerly Spiritual</hi> in the Worship of God is,
they judge, derived immediately from him
to the Ministers, and Administrators of the
Gospel, possessed of their Offices by his
Command, and according to his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as to the external practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Religious Worship as such, it is,
they say, in the power of the Magistrate
to regulate all the outward civil concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, with reference unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of publick peace, and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the prosperity of his subjects;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58629:83"/>
And herein also they judge that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is to be had to the Consciences of
men, as the Scripture, the Nature of the
thing it self, and the right of the L. Christ
to introduce his spiritual Kingdom into all
Nations, do require.</p>
            <p>That which seems to have imposed on
the mind of this Author is, that if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may make Laws for the regulating
of the outward profession of Religion, so
as publick peace and tranquillity may be
kept, added to what is his Duty to do in
the behalf of the Truth; then he must
have the power over Religion, and the
Consciences of men by him ascribed unto
him; But there is no privity of Interest
between these things; the Laws, which
he makes to this purpose, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by the Word of God, and the
good of the Community, over which in
the name of God he doth preside; and
whence he will take his Warranty to forbid
men the exercise of their Consciences in
the duties of <hi>spiritual Worship,</hi> whilest the
Principles they profess, are suited to the
light of nature, and the fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel, with the peace of
mankind, and their practices absolutely
confistent with publick welfare, I am yet to
seek; and so, as far as I can yet perceive, is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58629:84"/>
the Author of the Discourse under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
It will not arise from a Parity
of Reason from the power that he hath
to restrain <hi>cursed Swearing, and Blasphemies
by penal Coercions.</hi> For these things are no
less against the Light of Nature, and no
less condemned by the common suffrage
of mankind (and the persons that contract
the guilt of them may be no less effectually
brought to judge and condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
than are the greatest outrages that
may be committed in and against humane
Society; That the <hi>Gospel</hi> will give no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
hereunto, he seems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
in his assignation of several reasons
why the use of the power, and exercise of
it in the way of compulsion by penalties,
pleaded for by him, is not mentioned
therein; that <hi>Christ and his Apostles behaved
themselves as Subjects; that he neither took nor
exercised any Soveraign power; that He gave
his Laws to Private men as such, and not to
the Magistrate, that the Power that then was,
was in bad hands,</hi> are pleaded as excuses for
the silence of the Gospel in this matter.
But lest this should prove father preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to his present occasion, he adds p. 42.
<hi>the only reason why the Lord Christ bound not
the precepts of the Gospel upon mens Consciences
by any secular compulsories, was not because
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58629:84"/>
Compulsion was an improper way to put his
Laws in execution; for then He had never
established them with more enforcing Sanctions,
but only because himself was not vested with
any secular power, and so could not use those
methods of Government which are proper to
its jurisdiction;</hi> this in plain <hi>English</hi> is, that
if Christ had had power, he would have
ordered the Gospel to have been propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as <hi>Mahomet hath done his Alcoran;</hi> an
Assertion untrue and impious, contrary to
the whole spirit and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Gospel,
and of the Author of it, aud the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and Precepts of it. And it is fondly
supposed that the Lord Christ suited all
the Management of the affairs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
unto that state and condition in this
world, wherein he <hi>emptied Himself, and took
upon Him the form of a Servant, making Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of no reputation, that He might be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto Death, the death of the Cross;</hi> He
layes the Foundation of the promulgation
and propagation of it in the world, in the
grant of <hi>all power unto him in Heaven and
Earth. All power,</hi> saith he to his Apostles,
<hi>is given unto me in heaven and earth, go ye
therefore, and Baptize all Nations, teaching
them to observe all things whatever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you,</hi> Matth. 28. 19, 20. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered
in the dispensation of the Gospel,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58629:85"/>
as He who <hi>is head over all things to the
Church,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi>
whom our Author acknowledgeth to be
his Vicegerents; On this account the Gospel
with all the Worship instituted therein,
and required thereby, is accompanied
with a <hi>Right</hi> to enter into any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Earth, and spiritually to make
the Inhabitants of them subject to Jesus
Christ; and so to translate them out <hi>of
the power of darkness into the Kingdom of the
Son of God;</hi> And this Right is Antecedent
and paramount to the Right of all earthly
Kings and Princes whatever, who have no
power or Authority to exclude the Gospel
out of their Dominions; and what they
exercise of that kind, is done at their
peril.</p>
            <p>The <hi>penalties that he hath annexed to the
final rejection of the Gospel, and disobedience
thereunto,</hi> are pleaded by our Author, to
justifie the Magistrates power of binding
men to the <hi>Observation of his Commands in
Religion on temporal penalties to be by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on them;</hi> unto that is the Discourse of
this <hi>chapter</hi> arrived which was designed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another end. I see neither the order,
method, nor projection of this procedure;
nor know,
<q>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:58629:85"/>
Amphora cum cepit institui, cur Vrceus exit;</q>
However the pretense it self is weak,
and impertinent. Man was originally
made under a Law and constitution of
Eternal Bliss, or Woe; This state, with
regard to his necessary dependance on
God, and respect to his utmost end, was
absolutely unavoidable unto him. All pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of attaining eternal happiness by
himself he lost by Sirr, and became inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
obnoxious to eternal Misery, and the
wrath to come. In this condition the
Lord Jesus Christ, the supream Lord of the
souls and Consciences of men, interposeth
his law of Relief, Redemption, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the great means of man's Recovery,
together with the profession of the way,
and law hereof. He lets them know, that
those by whom it is refused, shall perish
under that Wrath of God, which before
they were obnoxious unto, with a new
Aggravation of their Sin and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
from the contempt of the Relief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for them, and tendered to them.
This He applyes to the Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men, and to all the inward
secret actings of them, in the first place,
such as are exempted not only from the
Judicature of men, but from the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58629:86"/>
of Angels. This he doth by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
means in a spiritual manner, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the subjection of the souls of men
unto God, and with reference unto their
bringing to Him, and enjoyment of Him,
or their being eternally rejected by Him.
Hence to collect, and conclude that Earthly
Princes, who, (whatever is pretended)
are not the Soveraign Lords of the Souls
and Consciences of men, nor do any of
them, that I know of, plead themselves
so to be; who cannot interpose any thing
by their absolute Authority, that should
have a necessary respect unto mens Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
condition; who have no knowledge of,
no acquaintance with, nor can judge of
the principal things whereon it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
from whose temporal jurisdiction,
and punishment the things of the Gospel,
and the Worship of God as purely such,
are (by the nature of them, being spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and not of this World, though exercised
in it, having their respect only unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and by their being taken into the sole
disposal of the Soveraign Lord of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
who hath accompanied His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
concerning them with His own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and Threatnings,) plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted;
should have power over the
Consciences of men, so to lay their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58629:86"/>
upon them in these spiritual things,
as to back them with Temporal, Corporal
Restraints and Punishments, is a way of
Arguing that will not be confined unto any
of those Rules of reasoning, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have been instructed in. When
the Magistrate hath <hi>an Arm like God,</hi> and
<hi>can Thunder with a Voice like Him,</hi> when he
judgeth <hi>not after the sight of his eyes, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
after the hearing of his ears, when he
can smile the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth,
and slay the Wicked with the breath of his
Lipps,</hi> when he is constituted a judge of
the Faith, Repentance, and Obedience of
men, and of their Efficacy in their Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
unto the pleasing of God here, and
the Enjoyment of Him hereafter, when
Spiritual Things in order to their Eternal
Issues and Effects are made subject unto
Him; in brief, when he is Christ, let him
act as Christ, or rather most unlike Him,
and guide the Consciences of men by
Rods, Axes, and Halters (whereunto alone
his power can reach) who in the mean time
have an express command from the Lord
Christ Himself, not to have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
influenced in the least by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of these things.</p>
            <p>Of the like Complexion is the ensuing
Discourse, wherein our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 43.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58629:87"/>
having spoken contemptuously of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Institutions of the Gospel, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>insufficient for the Accomplishment of
the Ends, whereunto they are designed,</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they respect only the Consciences
of men, and are <hi>his</hi> Institutions who is the
Lord of their Consciences, and who will
give them power, and efficacy to attain
their Ends, when administred in his name,
and according to his mind, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are <hi>His;</hi> would prove the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Temporal coercions, and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in things Spiritual, from the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Effects of <hi>Excommunication</hi> in the
primitive times, in the <hi>Vexation and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of persons Excommunicate by the Devil.</hi>
This work the Devil now ceasing to attend
unto, he would have the Magistrate to
take upon him to supply his place, and
Office, by punishments of his own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Infliction; and so at last, to be
sure of giving him full measure, he hath
ascribed two Extreams unto him about
Religion, namely, to act the part of God,
and the Devil. But as this Inference is
built upon a very uncertain conjecture,
namely, that upon the <hi>giving up of persons
to Satan in Excommunication,</hi> there did any
visible, or Corporal Vexation of them by
his power ensue, or any other effects but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58629:87"/>
what may yet be justly expected from an
Influence of his Terrour on the minds of
men, who are duly and regularly cast out
of the visible Kingdom of Christ by that
censure; and whereas, if there be any
truth in it, it was confined unto the dayes
of the Apostles, and is to be reckoned
amongst the <hi>miraculous Operations</hi> granted
to them for the first confirmation of the
Gospel; and the continuance of it, all
the time the Church wanted the Assistance
of the Civil Magistrate, is most unduly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
without any colour of Proof, or
Instance, beyond such as may be evidenced
to continue at this day; supposing it to be
true, the Inference made from it, as to its
consequence on this concession, is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weak, and feeble. For the Argument here
amounteth to no more but this; God was
pleased, in the dayes of the Apostles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their Spiritual Censures against Stuborn
Sinners, Apostates, Blasphemers, and such
like hainous Offenders, with extraordinary
spiritual Punishments, (so in their own
nature, or in the manner, or way of their
Infliction) therefore the Civil Magistrate
hath power to appoint things to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Worship of God, and forbid other
things, which the Light and Consciences
of men, directed by the Word of God,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58629:88"/>
require the observation of, upon ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
standing, corporal penalties to be
inflicted on the outward man; <hi>quod erat
demonstrandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To wind up</hi> this Debate; <hi>I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
the Vmpirage <hi>of it to the</hi> Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<hi>and receive her Determination in
the words of one who may be supposed
to know her sense and Judgement, as well
as any one who lived in his dayes, or since.
And this is</hi> Doctor Bilson Bishop of Winchester,
<hi>a Learned man, skilled in the Laws of the
Land, and a great Adversary unto all that
dissented from Church Constitutions. This
man therefore treating, by way of</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
<hi>in answer to the</hi> Jesuites Apologie and
Defence, <hi>in the</hi> Third Part p. 293. <hi>thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth</hi>
Theophilus <hi>a Protestant Divine,
arguing with</hi> Philander a Jesuite <hi>about these
matters. Theoph.</hi> As for the Supream Head
of the Church; it is certain that Title was first
transferred from the Pope to King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, by the Bishops of your side, not of ours.
And though the Pastors in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time
might not well dislike, much less disswade the
style of the Crown, by Reason the King was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
years, and so remained until he dyed;
yet as soon as it pleased God to place her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in her Fathers Throne, the Nobles and
Preachers perceiving the words, <hi>Head of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58629:88"/>
Church,</hi> (which is Christs proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
honor) to be offensive unto many that had
vehemently refelled the same in the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
her Highness the meaning of that word
which her Father had used, might be expressed
in some plainer and apter terms; And so was
the Prince called Supream Governour of the
Realm; that is Ruler and Bearer of the Sword,
with lawful Authority to command and punish,
answerable to the Word of God, in all Spiritual
or Ecclesiastical things or Causes, as well as in
Temporal. And no Forreign Prince or Prelate,
to have any Jurisdiction, Superiority, Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
or Authority to establish, prohibit,
correct, and chastise with Publick Laws, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Fains, any Crimes or Causes Ecclesiastical
or Spiritual within her Realm. <hi>Philand. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
saith this is Sacriledge and Blasphemy.
Look you therefore with what Consciences you
take that Oath, which your own Master so
mightily detesteth. <hi>Theoph.</hi> Nay look you
with what faces you alledge <hi>Calvin,</hi> who
maketh that style to be sacrilegious and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous,
as well in the Pope as in the Prince;
reason therefore you receive or refuse his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in both. If it derogate from Christ in
the Prince, so it doth in the Pope. Yet we grant
the sense of the word Supream, as <hi>Calvin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it by <hi>Stephen Gardiners</hi> Answer and
behaviour, is very blasphemous and injurious
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58629:89"/>
to Christ and his Word, whether it be Prince
or Pope that so shall use it. <hi>What this sense
is, he declares in the words of</hi> Calvin,
<hi>which are as followeth in his Translation
of them.</hi> That Jugler, which after was Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor,
I mean the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> when
he was at <hi>Rentzburge,</hi> neither would stand
to reason the matter, nor greatly cared for any
testimonies of the Scripture, but said it was at
the Kings discretion to abrogate that which was
in use, and appoint new. He said the King
might forbid Priests Marriage, the King might
bar the people from the Cup in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
the King might determine this or that in
his Kingdom: And why, forsooth the King had
Supream Power. This Sacriledge hath taken
hold on us, whilst Princes think they cannot
reign, except they abolish all the Authority of
the Church, and be themselves supream Judges
as well in Doctrine as in all Spiritual Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>To which he subjoyns;</hi> This was the
sense which <hi>Calvin</hi> affirmed to be sacrilegious
and blasphemous; for Princes to profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be Supream Judges of Doctrine and
Discipline; and indeed it is the blasphemy
which all godly hearts reject and abomine, in
the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neither did King <hi>Henry</hi>
take any such thing on him for ought that
we can learn; but this was <hi>Gardiners</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
to convey the reproach and shame of the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58629:89"/>
Six Articles from himself and his fellows that
were the Authors of them, and to cast it on the
Kings Supream Power. Had <hi>Calvin</hi> been told,
that Supream was first received to declare the
Prince to be Superiour to the Prelates, (which
exempted themselves from the Kings Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by their Church Liberties and Immunities)
as well as to the Lay men of this Realm, and
not to be subject to the Pope, the Word would
never have offended him. <hi>Thus far he; and
if these Controversies be any farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed,
it is probable the next defence
of what is here pleaded, will be in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words of the Principal Prelates of
this Realm since the Reformation, until their
Authority be peremptorily rejected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon my first design to take a brief Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of this Discourse, I had not the least
intention to undertake the examination
of any particular Assertions, or Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that might fall under Controversie;
but meerly to examine the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
whereon it doth proceed. But pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through these things <hi>Currente calamo,</hi>
I find my self engaged beyond my thoughts
and resolutions; I shall therefore here put
an end to the consideration of this Chapter,
although I see sundry things as yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, that might immediately be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58629:90"/>
with case, and advantage, as shall
be manifest, if we are called again to a
review of them. I have neither desire,
nor design <hi>Serram reciprocare,</hi> or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in any Controversial Discourses with
this Author. And I presume himself will
not take it amiss, that I do at present exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
those Principles, whose <hi>Novelty justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi>
a Disquisition into them; and whose
Tendency, as applyed by him, is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and destructive to so many quiet and
peaceable persons, who dissent from him.
And yet I will not deny, but that I
have that Valuation and esteem for that
sparkling of Wit, Eloquence, and sundry
other Abilities of mind, which appear in
his Writing, that if he would lay aside the
manner of his treating those from whom
he dissents, with Revilings, contemptuous
Reproaches, personal Reflections, Sarcasms,
and Satyrical expressions, and would can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
and perspicuously state any matter in
difference; I should think that what he hath
to offer, may deserve the consideration of
them who have leisure for such a purpose.
If he be otherwise minded, and resolve
to proceed in the way, and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
here engaged in, as I shall in the close
of this Discourse absolutely give him my
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58629:90"/>

            <head>A Survey of the Second
Chapter.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Summary</hi> of this Chapter must
needs give the Reader a great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
and the Chapter it self no less of
satisfaction, if what is in the one briefly
proposed, be in the other as firmly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
For amongst other things a
<hi>Scheme of Religion</hi> is promised, reducing all
its branches either to <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Morality;</hi> which being spoken
of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, is, as far as I know,
an undertaking new and peculiar unto this
Author, in whose mannagement all that
read him must needs weigh and consider,
how dextrously he hath acquitted himself.
For as all men grant that <hi>Morality</hi> hath a
great place in Religion, so that all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is nothing but Morality, many are
now to learn. <hi>The Villany of those Mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58629:91"/>
that are wont to distinguish between
Grace and Vertue</hi> (that is Moral Vertue)
is nextly traduced and inveighed against.
I had rather I confess that he had affixed
the term of <hi>Villany</hi> to the men themselves
whom he intended to reflect on than to their
Religion; because as yet it seems to me
that it will fall on <hi>Christianity,</hi> and no other
Real or pretended Religion that is, or
ever was in the world. For if the Proses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of it, have in all Ages according to
its avowed Principles, never before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
made a distinction between <hi>Moral
Vertues</hi> (since these terms were known in
the Church) and <hi>Evangelical Graces,</hi> if they
do so at this day, what Religion else can
be here branded with this Infamous and
horrible reproach, I know not. A farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the <hi>Chapter</hi> it self may possibly
give us farther satisfaction; wherein we
shall deal as impartially as we are able,
with a diligent watchfulness against all
prejudicate Affections, that we may disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what there is of Sense and Truth in
the Discourse, being ready to receive what
ever shall be manifested to have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in them. <hi>The Civil Magistrate,</hi> we are
also here informed, amongst many other
things that he may do, <hi>may command any
thing in the Worship of God that doth not tend
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58629:91"/>
to debauch Mens practices, or to disgrace the
Deity.</hi> And that <hi>all subordinate Duties both
of Morality and Religious Worship</hi> (such as
elsewhere we are told the Sacraments are)
<hi>are equally subject to the determination of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority.</hi> These things and sundry
others represented in this <hi>Summary,</hi> being
new, yea some of them, as far as I know,
unheard of amongst Christians untill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few years last past, any Reader may
justifie himself in the expectation of full
and demonstrative Arguments to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in their proof and confirmation.
What the issue will be, some discovery
may be made by the ensuing enquiry, as
was said, into the body of the Chapter it
self.</p>
            <p>The design of this Chapter in general
is, to confirm the power of the Magistrate
over Religion, and the Consciences of men
ascribed unto him in the former, and to
add unto it some enlargements not therein
insisted on. The Argument used to this
purpose, is taken from the <hi>power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
over the Consciences of men in matters
of morality,</hi> or with <hi>respect unto moral Vertue;</hi>
whence it is supposed the conclusion is so
evident unto his <hi>power over their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in matters of Religious Worship,</hi> that it
strikes our Author <hi>with wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:58629:92"/>
that it should not be received an
acknowledged. Wherefore to further the
conviction of all men in this matter, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
proceeds to discourse of <hi>Moral Vertue, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
wonted reflections upon, and reproache
of <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> for their <hi>ignorance</hi> about
and <hi>villanous misrepresentation</hi> of these
things, which seem more to be aimed at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
than the <hi>Argument</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>I must here with again that our Author
had more perspicuously stated the things
which he proposeth to debate for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Disputation. But I find an
excess of Art is as troublesome sometimes
as the greatest defect therein. From thence
I presume it is, that things are so handled in
this Discourse, that an ordinary man can
seldom discern satisfactorily, what it is that
directly and determinately he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
beyond reviling of Non-conformists.
For in this Proposition, which is the best
and most intelligible that I can reduce the
present Discourse unto, <hi>the Supream Civil
Magistrate hath power over the Consciences of
men in morality, or with respect unto moral
vertue;</hi> excepting only the subject of it,
there is not one term in it that may not
have various significations; and those such
as have countenance given unto them in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58629:92"/>
the ensuing Disputation it self. But, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti
sumus hoc Catone,</hi> and make the best
we can of what lyes before us.</p>
            <p>I do suppose that in the <hi>medium</hi> made
use of in this Argument there is, or I am
sure there may be, a Controversie of much
more importance than that principally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
consideration. It therefore shall be
stated and cleared in the first place, and
then the concernment of the Argument it
self in what is discoursed thereupon, shall
be manifested. It is about <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Grace,</hi> their coincidence, or distinction, that
we are in the first place to enquire. For
without a due stating of the conception
of these things, nothing of this Argument,
nor what belongs unto it, can be rightly
understood. We shall therefore be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to premise a brief Explanation of
these terms themselves, to remove as far
as may be all ambiguity from our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>First
then, the very name of <hi>Vertue,</hi> in
the sense wherein it is commonly used and
received, comes from the <hi>Schools of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi>
and not from the Scripture. In the
Old Testament we have <hi>Vprightness, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
Righteousness, doing Good and eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evil, Fearing, Trusting, Obeying, Believing
in God, Holiness</hi> and the like; but the name
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58629:93"/>
of <hi>Vertue</hi> doth not occur therein. It is
true we have translated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>vertuous
Woman;</hi> and once or twice the same word
<hi>vertuously, Ruth. 3. 11. Prov. 12. 4. Chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
31. 10, 39. But that word signifies as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
used, <hi>strenuous, industrious, diligent,</hi> and hath
no such signification as that we now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
by vertue. Nor is it any where
rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by the <hi>LXX.</hi> although it may
have some respect unto it, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may be
derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and peculiarly denote
the exercise of industrious strength, such
as men use in Battail. For <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is <hi>vis, robur,
potentia,</hi> or <hi>exercitus</hi> also. But in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
acceptation of it, and as it is used
by Philosophers, there is no word in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> nor <hi>Syriack</hi> properly to express it.
<hi>The Rabbins</hi> do it by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which signifies
properly a <hi>measure.</hi> For studying the
Philosophy of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and translating his
<hi>Ethicks</hi> into <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which was done by
<hi>Rabbi Meir,</hi> and finding his <hi>vertue</hi> placed
in mediocrity, they applyed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to express
it. So they call <hi>Aristotles Ethicks</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>the Book of Measures,</hi> that is of vertues.
And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are <hi>boni mores.</hi> Such a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is this very word unto the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In the New Testament <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> occurs
four times; but it should not seem any
where to be taken in the sense now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58629:93"/>
admitted. In some of the places it
rather denotes the excellency and praises
that do attend Vertue, than Vertue it self.
So we render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>praises; 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. as

cannot have the common sense of the word

            <p>The word <hi>Moral</hi> is yet far more exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

And I cannot but think it had been well if
they had never done it; as all will grant
they might have omitted some other things
without the least disadvantage to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Religion. However this expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> having absolutely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
it self of the Fancies and Discourses
of all, and it may be of the Understanding
of some, though with very little satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
when all things are considered, I
shall not endeavour to dispossess it, or
eliminate it from the Confines of Christian
<hi>Theologie.</hi> Only I am sure had we been left
unto the Scripture expressions, of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
towards God,</hi> and <hi>Faith towards our
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> of the <hi>fear of God, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
Righteousness, living unto God, walking
with God, and before him,</hi> we might have
been free from many vain wordy perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities;
and the whole wrangle of this
Chapter in particular, had been utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
For let but the Scripture express
what it is to be <hi>Religious,</hi> and there will
be no contesting about the difference or
no difference between Grace and Moral
Vertue. It is said, that <hi>some judge those
who have Moral Vertue to want Grace, not to
be Gracious.</hi> But say, that men <hi>are born of
God, and do not commit sin,</hi> that they <hi>walk
before God and are upright,</hi> that they <hi>cleave
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58629:94"/>
unto God with full purpose of heart,</hi> that they
<hi>are sanctified in Christ Jesus</hi> and the like,
and no man will say that they have not
<hi>Grace,</hi> or are <hi>not Gracious,</hi> if they receive
your Testimony. But having, as was said,
made its entrance amongst us, we must
deal with it as well as we can, and satisfie
our selves about its common Acceptation
and Use.</p>
            <p>Generally, <hi>moral Vertues</hi> are esteemed to
be the Duties of the <hi>second Table.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
those who handle these matters
more accurately, do not so straiten or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them, yet it is certain that in <hi>vulgar</hi>
and common Acceptation, (which strikes
no small stroke, in the regulating of the
conceptions of the wisest Men, about the
signification of words) nothing else is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by <hi>Moral vertues</hi> or <hi>Duties of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
but the observation of the Precepts
of the second Table. Nor is any thing
else designed by those Divines, who in their
writings so frequently declare, that it is
not <hi>morality alone</hi> that will render men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God. Others do extend these
things further, and fix the denomination
of <hi>moral,</hi> firstly upon the <hi>Law</hi> or Rule of
all those Habits of the Mind, and its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which afterwards thence they call
<hi>moral.</hi> Now this <hi>Moral Law</hi> is nothing but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58629:95"/>
the Law of Nature, or the Law of our
Creation; which the Apostle affirms to lye
equally obligatory on all men, even all the
Gentiles themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and
whereof the <hi>Decalogue</hi> is summarily expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
This <hi>Moral Law</hi> is therefore the Law
written in the hearts of all men by Nature,
which is resolved partly into the Nature of
God himself, which cannot but require most
of the things of it from Rational Creatures;
partly into that state and condition of the
nature of things and their mutual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherein God was pleased to create and
set them. These things might be easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
and exemplified, but that we must
not too much divert from our present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
And herein lyes the largest sense
and Acceptation of the Law Moral, and
consequently of <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> which have
their Form and Being from their Relation
and conformity thereunto. Let it be then,
that <hi>Moral Vertues</hi> consist in the universal
observance of the requisites and Precepts
of the law of our Creation and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on God thereby. And this descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
as we shall see for the substance of
it, is allowed by our Author.</p>
            <p>Now these Vertues, or this conformity
of our minds and actions unto the Law of
our Creation, may be in the light and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58629:95"/>
reason of Christian Religion, considered
two wayes. First, as with respect unto
the substance or Essence of the Duties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they may be performed by men in
their own strength, under the conduct of
their own Reason, without any special as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
from the Spirit, or Sanctifying
Grace of Christ. In this sense, they still
bare the name of <hi>Vertues,</hi> and for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of them deserve so to do. Good
they are in themselves, useful to Mankind,
and seldome in the Providence of God go
without their reward in this World. I
grant I say, that they may be obtained and
acted without special assistance of Grace
Evangelical; though the wiser Heathens
acknowledged something Divine in the
communication of them to Men. <hi>Papinius</hi>
speaks to that purpose,
<q>
                  <l>Diva Jovis solio juxta comes; undeper Orbem</l>
                  <l>Rara dari, Terrís<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But old <hi>Homer</hi> put it absolutely in the
will of his God.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:58629:96"/>
Thus we grant moral vertue to have
been in the Heathen of old. For this is
that alone whereby they were distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst themselves. And he that would
exclude them all from any interest in <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
vertue,</hi> takes away all difference between
<hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Nero, Aristides</hi> and <hi>Tiberius, Titus</hi> and
<hi>Domitian;</hi> and overthrows all natural diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between good and evil; which besides
other abominations that it would plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
spawn in the World, would inevitably
destroy all humane Society. But now
these moral vertues thus performed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Author thinks, are distinct from
Grace, may be without it, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
description, which is not imaginary
but real, are supposed so to be. And if
he pleases he may exercise himself in the
longsome disputes of <hi>Bellarmin, Gregory de
Valentia,</hi> and others to this purpose innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
not to mention Reformed Divines
lest they should be scornfully rejected as
<hi>Systematical.</hi> And this is enough I am sure
to free <hi>their Religion from Villany, who make
a distinction between Moral Vertue and Grace.</hi>
And if our Author is otherwise minded,
and both believe that there is <hi>Grace Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ever there is Moral Vertue, or,
that Moral Vertues may be so obtained and
exercised without the special assistance of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58629:96"/>
Grace, as to become a part of our Religion,
and accepted with God, and will maintain
his Opinion in Writing, I will promise him
if I live to return him an answer, on one
only condition, which is, that he will first
answer what <hi>Augustine</hi> hath written against
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> on this Subject.</p>
            <p>Again these moral Vertues, this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Precepts of the Law of our
Creation, in a consonancy whereunto ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
the Image of God in us did consist,
may now under the Gospel be considered,
as men are principled, assisted, and enabled
to and in their performance by the <hi>Grace
of God,</hi> and as they are directed unto the
especial end of living unto him in and by
Jesus Christ. What is particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
hereunto, shall be afterwards decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Now in this sense no man living ever
distinguished between Grace and Vertue,
any otherwise than the cause and the effect
are to be, or may be distinguished; much
less was any Person ever so Bruitish as to
fancy <hi>an inconsistency between them,</hi> For take
Grace in one sense, and it is the efficient
cause of this Vertue, or of these Vertues
which are the effects of it; and in another
they are all Graces themselves. For that
which is wrought in us by Grace is Grace;
as that which <hi>is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:58629:97"/>
To this purpose something may be
spoken concerning Grace also, the other
term, whose ambiguity renders the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
under consideration somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
and perplexed. Now as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
term of <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> owed its Original
to the Schools of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and its use was
borrowed from them; So this of <hi>Grace</hi> is
purely Scriptural and <hi>Evangelical.</hi> The
World knows nothing of it but what is
declared in the Word of God, especially
in the Gospel, <hi>for the Law was given by</hi>
Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus
Christ.</hi> All the Books of the Ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
will not give us the least light
into that notion of Grace, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
declares unto us. As then we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the sense of the <hi>former term</hi> given
unto it by its first coyners and users, so
we cannot but think it equal, that men be
precisely tyed up in their conceptions
about Grace, unto what is delivered in the
Scripture concerning it; as having no other
Rule either to frame them, or judge of them.
And this We shall attend unto. Not that
I here design to treat of the <hi>nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Grace</hi> in general; but whereas all the
Divines that ever I have read on these
things, whether Ancient or Modern (and
I have not troubled my self to consider
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58629:97"/>
whether they were <hi>Systematical ones</hi> only
or otherwise qualified) allow some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
of this term to be necessary, for
the right understanding of those passages
of Scripture wherein it is made use of.
I shall mention that or those only, which
are so unto the right apprehension of what
is at present under Debate.</p>
            <p>First therefore, Grace in the Scripture
is taken for the <hi>free Grace,</hi> or <hi>favour of
God</hi> towards sinners by Jesus Christ. By
this he freely pardoneth them their, sins,
Justifieth, and accepteth them, or <hi>makes
them accepted in the Beloved.</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is distinct from Moral Vertue.
Secondly, It is taken for the <hi>effectual
working</hi> of the Spirit of God, in and
upon the minds and souls of Believers,
thereby <hi>quickning them when they were
dead in trespasses and sins,</hi> Regenerating of
them, Creating a new heart in them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
his Image upon them: neither
I presume will this be called <hi>Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
Thirdly, For the actual supplies of
Assistance and Ability given to Believers,
so to enable them unto every Duty in
particular, which in the Gospel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them; <hi>for he works in them both
to Will and to Do of his own good pleasure.</hi>
As yet the former distinction will appear
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58629:98"/>
necessary. Fourthly, For the effects
wrought and produced by this Operation
of God and his Grace, in the hearts and
minds of them that believe; which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
habitual in the spiritual disposition of
their minds, or actual in their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
all which are called <hi>Grace.</hi> It may
be our Author will be apt to think that
I <hi>Cant, use Phrases,</hi> or <hi>fulsome Metaphors.</hi>
But besides that I can confirm these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
and the necessity of them, and the
words wherein they are expressed, from
the Scriptures and Ancient Fathers, I can
give them him for the substance of them
out of very Learned Divines, whether
Systematical or no I know not, but this I
know they were not long since <hi>Bishops of
the Church of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>We are now in the next place to inquire
into the mind of our Author in these
things; for from his apprehensions about
them he frames a mighty difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
himself and those whom he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
and from thence takes occasion
and advantage afresh to revile and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore he declares his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Moral Vertues which he
treats of <hi>do consist in Mens observance
of the Law of Nature, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58629:98"/>
of Reason, and Precepts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,
That the <hi>Substance, yea the
whole of Religion consists in these Vertues,
or Duties; So that by the observation of
them Men may attain Everlasting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,
That there <hi>is no actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of present Grace, enabling Men to
perform these Duties, or to exercise these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but they are called Grace on another
account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That his Adversaries are so
far from making Vertue and Grace to be the
same that they make them inconsistent.</hi> And
these things shall we take into a brief
examination according as indeed they do
deserve.</p>
            <p>The first of them, he plainly and more
than once affirms; nor shall I contend
with him about it. So he speaks pag. 68.
<hi>The practice of Vertue consists in living sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to the dictates of Reason and nature,
and this is the substance and main design of
all the Laws of Religion, to oblige mankind
to behave themselves in all their actions as
becomes creatures endowed with Reason and
understanding, and in wayes suitable to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
beings, to prepare and qualifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the State of Glory and immortality.</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:58629:99"/>
This is a plain description both of the
<hi>Rule</hi> of moral Vertues, and of the <hi>nature</hi>
of them. The Law of Reason and nature
is the Rule; and their own nature (as
acting, or acted) consists in a <hi>suitableness
unto Rational Beings;</hi> acting, to prepare
themselves for the state of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
and Glory. The first end of all
vertue no doubt. We need not therefore
make any farther inquiry into this matter,
wherein we are agreed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Substance,</hi> yea the
<hi>whole</hi> of Religion consists in these Moral
Vertues he fully also declares, pag. 69.
<hi>Moral Vertue having the strongest and most
necessary influence upon the, end of all Religion</hi>
viz. <hi>mans Happiness, it is not only its most
material and useful part, but the ultimate
end of all its other Duties;</hi> (though I know
not, how the practice of Vertue in this
life can be the <hi>Vltimate End</hi> of other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
<hi>and all true Religion can consist in
nothing else but either the practice of Vertue
it self, or the use of those means and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that contribute unto it.</hi> So also p. 70.
<hi>All Duties of Devotion excepting only our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of Gratitude are not essential parts of
Religion, but are only in order to it, as they
tend to the practice of Vertue and Moral
Goodness; and their goodness is derived upon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58629:99"/>
them from the Moral Vertues to which they
contribute; and in the same proportion they
are conducive to the ends of Vertue, they are
to be valued among the Ministeries of Religion.</hi>
So then the whole Duty of Man consists in
being vertuous, and all that is injoyned him
beside, is in order thereunto. Hence We
are told elsewhere, that <hi>outward Worship is
no part of Religion;</hi> again pag. 76. <hi>All Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must of necessity be resolved into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm
or Morality; the former is meer
imposture, and therefore all that is true must
be reduced to the latter.</hi> But we need not
insist on particulars, seeing he promoteth
this to confirmation by the best of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
<hi>i. e.</hi> an induction of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
which he calls a <hi>Scheme of Religion;</hi>
wherein yet if any thing necessary be left
out or omitted, this <hi>best of Demonstrations</hi>
is quickly turned into one of the <hi>worst of
Sophismes.</hi> Therefore we have here (no
doubt) a just and full Representation of
all that belongs to Christian Religion; and
it is as follows; pag. 69. <hi>The whole Duty
of Man referrs either to his Creator, or his
Neighbour, or Himself. All that concerns the
two last, is confessedly of a moral nature; and
all that concerns the first, consists either in
Praising of God or Praying to him; The former
is a branch of the Vertue of Gratitude, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58629:100"/>
is nothing but a thankful and Humble temper
of mind, arising from a sense of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Himself, and his Goodness to us. So
that this part of Devotion issues from the same
vertuous quality, that is the Principle of all
other resentments and expressions of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
only those acts of it that are terminated
on God as their Object are stiled Religious;
and therefore Gratitude and Devotion are not
divers things, but only differing names of the
same thing; Devotion being nothing else but
the Vertue of Gratitude towards God.</hi> The
<hi>latter,</hi> viz. <hi>Prayer is either put up in our
own or other mens behalf; if for others it is
an act of that Vertue we call kindness or
Charity; if for our selves, the things we pray
for, unless they be the comforts and enjoyments
of this life, are some or other vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
and therefore the proper and direct use
of Prayer is to be instrumental to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Morality.</hi> It is of <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
that this Author treats, as is manifest from
his ensuing Discourse, and the Reason he
gives why Moral Vertues are stiled Graces.
Now I must needs say that I look on this
of our Author as the rudest, most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and weakest <hi>Scheme of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
that ever yet I saw; so far from
comprising an induction of all particulars
belonging to it, that there is nothing in it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58629:100"/>
that is constitutive of Christian Religion
as such at all. I wish he had given us a
summary of the <hi>Credenda</hi> of it, as he hath
done of its <hi>Agenda,</hi> that we might have
had a prospect of the body of his Divinity.
The <hi>ten Commandments</hi> would in my mind
have done twice as well on this present
occasion, with the addition of the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them given us in the <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teehism.</hi>
But I am afraid that very <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi>
may ere long be esteemed <hi>Phanatical</hi>
also. One I confess I have read of before,
who was of this Opinion, that all Religion
consisted <hi>in Morality alone.</hi> But withall
he was so Ingenious as to follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Judgement in this matter, unto
a full Renunciation of the Gospel, which
is certainly inconsistent with it. This was
one <hi>Martin Sidelius a Seilesian,</hi> who gave the
ensuing account of his Faith unto <hi>Faustus
Socinus</hi> and his Society at <hi>Cracovia.</hi>

qui est aeterna Dei voluntas, qui Decalogus

Sacrifices and the rest of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58629:101"/>
of <hi>Moses</hi> belong not to me, but were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
given, and granted unto the people of
the Jews alone. Neither were they the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God among the Jews, but were only
subservient unto Divine Worship, and lead the
Jews unto it (<hi>the same Opinion is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our Author concerning all exterior
Worship:</hi>) but the true Worship which I call
my Religion, is the Decalogue which is the
Eternal and immutable Will of God; (<hi>And
here also he hath the consent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of our Author</hi>) which Decalogue
doth therefore belong unto me because it is
given by God to me also; not indeed by a voice
sounding from Heaven as he gave it to the
people of the Jews, but it is implanted in my
mind by nature. But because this implanted
Decalogue by reason of the corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and through depraved Customs,
is in some measure obscured, for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it I make use of the vocal Decalogue,
which therefore also belongs unto me and all
people; because it consenteth with the Decalogue
written in our hearts; yea is the same Law
with it. This is my opinion concerning the
Messiah, or the promised King; and this is my
Religion which I freely acknowledge before ye.
<hi>So he, This is plain dealing. He saw clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if all Religion and the Worship of
God consisted in</hi> Morality only, there was
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58629:102"/>
neither need nor use of Christ, nor the
Gospel. And accordingly having no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
advantage by them, discarded them.
But setting aside his bold renunciation of
Christ as promised, I see not any material
difference between the Religion of this
man and that now contended for. The
poor deluded souls among our selves, who
leaving the Scripture, pretend that they
are guided by the <hi>Light within them,</hi> are
upon the matter of the same Religion.
For that <hi>light</hi> being nothing but the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Reason and a natural Conscience,
it extends not it self beyond <hi>Morality;</hi>
which some of them understanding, we
know what thoughts and apprehensions
they have had of Christ and of his Gospel
and the Worship of God instituted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
For hence it is, (and not as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
pretends, with a strange incogitancy
concerning them and the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> that
they assert the Scripture to be the only
Rule of Religious Worship) that they are
fallen into these fond imaginations. And
these are the effects which this Principle
doth naturally lead unto. I confess then
that I do not agree with our Author in
and about this Scheme of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which I shall therefore first briefly
put in my exceptions unto, and then offer
him another in lieu of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:58629:102"/>
First, Then this Scheme seems to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Religion unto us as suited to the state
of Innocency, and that very imperfectly
also. For it is composed to answer the
former assertions of confining Religion
to Moral Vertues, which are granted to
consist in our conformity unto and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Dictates of Reason and the Law
of Nature. Again the whole duty of man
is said to refer either to his <hi>Creator, or his
Neighbour, or himself.</hi> Had it been said to
<hi>God absolutely,</hi> another interpretation might
have been put upon the words. But being
restrained unto him as our <hi>Creator,</hi> all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
referring to our Redeemer are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
or not included, which certainly
have some place in Christian Religion.
Our Obedience therein is the Obedience
of Faith, and must answer the special ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of it. And we are taught in the
<hi>Church Catechism to believe in God the Father
who made us and all the world,</hi> and <hi>in God
the Son who redeemed us and all Mankind;</hi>
and <hi>in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifies us
and all the Elect people of God.</hi> Now these
distinct acts of Faith, have distinct acts of
Obedience attending them; whereas none
here are admitted, or at least required,
but those which fall under the first head.
It is also very imperfect as a description
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58629:103"/>
of natural Religion, or the Duties of the
Law of Nature. For the principal Duties
of it, such as fear, love, trust, affiance of
and in God, are wholly omitted; nor
will they be reduced unto either of the
heads which all Religion is here distributed
unto. For <hi>Gratitude unto God</hi> hath respect
formally and directly to the benefits we
our selves are made partakers of. But these
Duties are eternally necessary on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the nature of God himself, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
unto the consideration of his
communicating of himself unto us by his
benefits. Prayer proceeds from them;
and it is an odd Method to reduce the
Cause under the head of its effect. And
Prayer it self is made at length not to be
so much a <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> as somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to the vertues of Morality.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I cannot think we have here
a compleat Representation of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
nor an induction of all its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
because we have neither Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nor Assertion of Sin, or a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> or
of any Duty with respect unto them.
<hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> I confess are two heads,
whereunto sundry Duties of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
without respect unto these things may
be reduced. But since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>
there was never any Religion in the world
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58629:103"/>
accepted with God, that was not built and
founded on the supposition of them, and
whose principal Duties towards God did
not respect them. To prescribe now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us a Religion as it respects God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
those Duties which arise from the
consideration of sin, and a Redeemer, is to
perswade us to throw away our Bibles.
Sin, and the condition of all men on the
account thereof, their Duty in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
what God requires of them with
reference thereunto, the way that God
hath found out, proposed, and requires of
us to make use of, that we may be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from that condition, with the duties
necessary to that end, do even constitute
and make up that Religion which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
teacheth us, and which, as it sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
expresseth it self, consists in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
towards God, and Faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ; neither of which, nor
scarce any thing that belongs unto them,
appears in this Scheme; so that</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The most important duties of
Christian Religion are here not only omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but excluded. Where shall we find
any place here to introduce Repentance;
and as belonging thereunto Conviction of
Sin, Humiliation, Godly Sorrow, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it self to God? For my part I will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58629:104"/>
never be of that Religion where these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
towards God have no place. Faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ, with all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to it, preparatory for it, included
in it, and consequentiall on it, are in like
manner cast out of the verge of Religious
duties here <hi>schematized.</hi> An endeavour to
fly from the wrath to come, to receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, to accept of the attonement, to
seek after the forgiveness of sins by him
(that we may cant a little) and to give up
our souls in universal Obedience to all his
commands, belong also to the duties of
that Religion towards God which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
prescribeth unto us; but here they
appear not in the least intimation of them.
No more do the duties which though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
included in the Law of loving God
above all, yet are prescribed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the Gospel alone. Such are <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal,</hi>
readiness to <hi>take up the Cross,</hi> and the
like. Besides all the duties wherein our
Christian conflict against our Spiritual
Adversaries doth consist, and in especial
the whole of our duty towards God in
the mortification of sin, can be of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
there, where no supposition of
sin is made or allowed. But there would
be no end if all exceptions of this nature,
that readily offer themselves, might here
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58629:104"/>
have admittance. If this be the Religion
of our Adversaries in these things, if this
be a perfect Scheme of its Duties towards
God, and induction of all its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
let our Author insult over, and
reproach them whilst he pleaseth, who
blame it as insufficient without Grace and
Godliness: I would not be in the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them who trust their eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to meer Observance of it; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is no name under Heaven
given unto men whereby they may be
saved, but only the name of Jesus Christ.
It will be in vain pretended, that it is not
a description of Christian Religion, but of
Religion, as Religion in general, that is here
attempted. For besides that, it is Christian
Religion, and that as used and practised by
Christians, which is alone under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and an Introduction of Religion here
under any other notion would be griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
inconsistent and incoherent with the
whole Discourse. It is acknowledged by
our Author in the progress of his Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as was before observed, when he
gives a Reason why <hi>Moral Vertue</hi> is stiled
Grace, which is peculiar and appropriate
to Christian Religion alone. Besides, to
talk now of a Religion in the World,
which either hath been, or may be, since
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58629:105"/>
the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> without respect unto sin,
is to build Castles in the air. All the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that God now requires, prescribes,
accepts, that is or can be, is the Religion
of <hi>Sinners,</hi> or of those who are such, and
of them <hi>as such,</hi> though also under other
qualifications. On many accounts therefore
this <hi>scheme of Religion</hi> or Religious Duties
towards God, is exceedingly insufficient
and imperfect. To lay it therefore as a
Foundation whereon to stand, and revile
them who plead for a superaddition unto
it of Grace and Godliness, is an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from whence no great success is to be
expected.</p>
            <p>I can easily supply another <hi>Scheme of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in the room of this, which though it
have not any such contexture of method,
nor is set out with such <hi>gaudy words</hi> as
those which our Author hath at his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
yet I am confident in the confession
of all Christians shall give a better account
than what is here offered unto us both of
the Religion we profess, and of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that God requires therein; and this
taken out of one Epistle of St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
namely, that to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And I shall
do it as things come to mind in the haste
wherein I am writing. He then gives us
his <hi>Scheme</hi> to this purpose. As First, That
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58629:105"/>
all Men <hi>sinned in Adam,</hi> came short of the
Glory of God, and rendred themselves
liable to death and the whole curse of the
Law. Then, that they do all, as left to
themselves accumulate their Original Sin
and Transgression, with a world of actual
sins, and provocations of God. That
against Men in this condition, God testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his wrath and displeasure, both in his
works and by his word. Hence it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follows, that the <hi>first Duty</hi> of Man
towards God is to be sensible of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
of the guilt of sin, with a fear of
the wrath and judgement due to them.
Then he informs us, that neither the
<hi>Jews</hi> by the Law, nor the Gentiles by the
light of Nature, could disentangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from this state, or do that which
is pleasing unto God, so as they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
forgiveness of Sin and acceptation
with him. This bespeaks unto all the great
<hi>Duty towards God,</hi> of their acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto him, of their miserable and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
condition, with all those Affections and
subordinate Duties, wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
In this state he declares, that God
himself in his Infinite Wisdome, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Grace, provided a Remedy, a way
of relief; on which he hath put such an
impression of his Glorious Excellencies as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58629:106"/>

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:58629:107"/>
may stirr up the hearts of his Creatures, to
endeavour a return unto him from their
Apostasie; and that this remedy consists
in his <hi>setting forth Jesus Christ to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
through Faith in his blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his Righteousness for the forgiveness of
Sin;</hi> which he proposeth unto Men for
their receiving and acceptance. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it the <hi>greatest duty</hi> of mankind towards
God, <hi>to believe in the Son of God</hi> so set
forth, to seek after an Interest in him, or
being made partaker of him; for this is
the great work that God requires, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we believe on him whom he hath
sent. Again, he declares that God justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
them who so believe, pardoning their
sins, and imputing Righteousness unto
them; whereon innumerable Duties do
depend, even all the Obedience that Christ
requires of us; seeing in our believing in
him, we accept him to be our King to rule,
govern and conduct our souls to God. And
all these are Religious duties towards God.
He declares moreover, that whereas Men
are by Nature <hi>dead in trespasses and sins,</hi>
and stand in need of a new spiritual
life, to be born again, that they may live
unto God; that God in Jesus Christ doth by
his spirit quicken them, and regenerate them,
and work in them a new principle of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58629:107"/>
life; whence it is their great Duty
towards God (in this Religion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>)
to comply with, and to yield obedience,
unto all the wayes and methods that God
is pleased to use in the accomplishment of
this work upon them, the <hi>especial Duties</hi>
whereof are too many to be instanced in.
But he further manifests, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Regeneration of Men</hi> by the
Spirit, and their Conversion to God, there
yet continues in them a remainder of the
<hi>Principle of corrupted nature,</hi> which he
calls the <hi>flesh, and Indwelling Sin,</hi> that is
of it self wholly <hi>enmity against God,</hi> and
as far it abides in any, inclines the heart
and mind unto sin, which is to be watched
against and opposed. And on this head,
he introduceth the great Religious Duty
towards God of our spiritual conflict
against sin, and of the mortification of it,
wherein those that believe are to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
all the dayes of their lives, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their principal duty towards God doth
consist, and without which they can perform
no other in a due manner. Moreover he
farther adds the great Gospel-Priviledge
of the Communication of the Spirit of
Christ unto Believers, for their Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Consolation, and Edification; with
the Duties of Thankfulness towards God,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58629:108"/>
Joy and Rejoycing in him, Cheerfulness
under Tryals, Afflictions, and Persecutions,
and sundry others that on that account are
required of us, all Religious Duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, in the Religion by him proposed
unto us. Having laid these foundations,
and manifested how they all proceed from
the Eternal Counsel and free Grace of God,
in which it is our Duty to admire, adore, and
praise him, he declareth how hereby and
on the account of these things, we are bound
unto all Holiness, Righteousness, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Honesty, and Usefulness in this world,
in all Relations and Conditions whatsoever;
declaring our Duties in Churches, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our especial interest in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Believers; and towards all Men in
the World in our several Relations; in
Obedience to Magistrates; and all superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
in a word in universal observance of
the whole will and all the commands of
God. Now whither any one will call this
a <hi>Scheme</hi> or no, or allow it to have any
thing of <hi>Method</hi> in it or no, I neither know
nor care; but am perswaded that it makes a
better, more plain, and intelligible Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Religious Duties towards God
which Christian Religion, requires of us,
unto all that suppose this whole Religion
to depend on Divine Revelation, than that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58629:108"/>
of our Author. But I find my self in a
digression; the end of this Discourse was
only to manifest the Sentiments of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
on the second head before laid down,
which I think are sufficiently evinced.</p>
            <p>The third is, That there is no actual
work of present Grace, either to sit the
Persons, of whom these Duties of Moral
Vertues are required, unto the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of them, or to work and effect them
in them. For although they are <hi>called
Graces,</hi> and the Graces of the Spirit, in the
Scripture, yet that is upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
as he declares himself, pag. 72. <hi>All
that the Scripture intends by the Graces of the
Spirit, are only Vertuous qualities of the Soul
that are therefore stiled Graces, because they
are derived purely from God's free-Grace and
Goodness, in that in the first Ages of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
he was pleased out of his infinite concern
for its propagation, in a miraculous manner
to inspire its Converts with all sorts of Vertue.</hi>
Vertuous Qualities of the soul, is a very
ambigious expression. Take these Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Qualities, for a new principle of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life, consisting in the habitual Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
Inclination, and Ability of mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the things required of us in the will of
God, or unto the Acts of Religious Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and it may express the Graces of the

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:58629:110"/>
Spirit; which yet are far enough from
being so called upon the account here
mentioned. But these Vertuous Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are to be interpreted according to
the tenour of the preceding Discourses,
that have already passed under Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Let now our Author produce any
one Writer of the Church of God, from
first to last, of any repute or Acceptation,
from the day that the name of Christian
was known in the World, unto this wherein
we live, giving us this account why the
fruits of the Spirit, the Vertuous or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
qualities of the minds of Believers,
are called Graces that here he gives, and
I will give him my thanks publickly for his
discovery. For if this be the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why any thing in Believers is called
<hi>Grace,</hi> why Vertues are Graces, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God <hi>was pleased in the first Ages of
Christianity miraculously to inspire its Converts
with all sorts of Vertue,</hi> then there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
Communication of Grace unto any, no
work of Grace in and upon any, in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way, through the Ministry of the
Gospel, in these latter Ages. The whole
Being, and efficacy of Grace, according to
this notion, is to be confined unto the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Operations of God in Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
in the <hi>first Ages,</hi> whence a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58629:110"/>
in the Scripture is cast upon
our Vertues, when obtained and exercised by
and in our own strength. Now this plainly
<hi>overthrows the whole Gospel,</hi> and contains a
<hi>Pelagianisme</hi> that <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself never did,
nor durst avow.</p>
            <p>Are these things then so indeed? that
God did from his free Grace and Goodness,
miraculously inspire the first Converts of
Christianity with all sorts of Vertues, but
that He doth not still continue to put forth
in any, actually, the Efficacy of his Grace,
to make them Gracious, Holy, Believing,
Obedient to himself, and to work in them
all suitable actings towards himself and
others? Then farewell Scripture, the
Covenant of Grace, the Intercession of
Christ, yea all the Ancient Fathers,
Counsels, Schoolmen, and most of the
<hi>Jesuites</hi> themselves. Many have been the
disputes amongst Christians about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Grace, the Rule of its Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the manner and way of its Operation,
its Efficacy, Concurrence, and Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Wills of men; but that there
is no dispensation of it, no operation but
what was miraculous in the first Converts
of the Gospel, was I think untill now
undiscovered. Nor can it be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that although the Vertuous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58629:111"/>
of our minds and their Exercise, by
which is intended all the Obedience that
God requireth of us, in Principle and
Practice, that we may please him, and come
to the enjoyment of him, are not said to
be called Graces, <hi>only,</hi> on the account men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
For as in respect of us, they are
not so termed at all, so if the term <hi>only</hi>
be not understood, the whole discourse is
impertinent and ridiculous. For those
other Reasons and Accounts that may be
taken in, will render that given utterly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
unto our Authors intention, and indeed
are altogether inconsistent with it. And
he hath given us no reason to suppose, that
he talks after such a weak and preposterous
a rate. This then is that which is here
asserted, the Qualities of our minds and
their Exercise wherein the Vertues plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about, and affirmed to contain the whole
Substance of Religion, do consist, are not
wrought in us by the Grace or Spirit of
God through the Preaching of the Gospel,
but are only called Graces, as before.
Now though here be a plain contradiction
to what is delivered but two pages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
namely, <hi>that we pray for some or other
Vertuous qualities,</hi> that is doubtless to be
wrought in us by the Grace of God; yet
this present discourse is capable of no
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58629:111"/>
other interpretation but that given unto it.
And indeed it seems to be the design of
some men, to confine all real Gifts and
Graces of the Spirit of God, to the first
Ages of the Gospel, and the miraculous
operations in it; which is to overthrow
the whole Gospel, the Church, and the
Ministry of it, as to their use and efficacy,
leaving Men only the Book of the Bible
to <hi>Philosophize</hi> upon, as shall be elsewhere
demonstrated, Our Author indeed tells
us, that on the occasion of some mens
writings in <hi>Theology, there hath been a buzz
and a noise of the Spirit of God in the World.</hi>
His expressions are exceedingly suited to
pour contempt on what he doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;
not so to express what he doth
himself intend. But I desire that he and
others would speak plain, and openly in this
matter, that neither others may be deceived
nor themselves have occasion to complain
that they are mis-represented; a pretence
whereof would probably give them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation
to deal very roughly, if not
despightfully with them with whom they
shall have to do. Doth he therefore think
or believe, that there are not now any real
Gracious Operations of the Spirit of God,
upon the hearts and minds of men in the
world? that the dispensation of the Spirit
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58629:112"/>
is ceased, as well unto ordinary Ministerial
Gifts, with its sanctifying, renewing, assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace, as unto Gifts miraculous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary?
that there is no work at all
of God upon the hearts of Sinners, but that
which is purely moral, and perswasive by
the word? that what is asserted by some
concerning the <hi>Efficacy of the Grace</hi> of the
Spirit, and concerning his gifts, is no more
but a <hi>buzz and a noise?</hi> I wish he would
explain himself directly and positively in
these things; for they are of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And the loose expressions which
we meet with, do give great Offence
unto some, who are apt to think, that as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
an Heresie as ever infested the
Church of God, may be covered and clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them.</p>
            <p>But to return; In the sense that <hi>Moral
Vertue</hi> is here taken, I dare boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
that there is <hi>no Villany in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those men,</hi> who distinguish <hi>between
Vertue and Grace;</hi> that is, there not in their
so doing; this being the known and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Religion of Christianity. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that whereever Grace is, there is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
For Grace will produce and effect all
Vertues in the Soul whatever. But <hi>Vertue</hi>
on the other side may be where there is
no Grace, which is sufficient to confirm a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58629:112"/>
distinction between them. It was so in
fundry of the Heathen of old; though
now it be pretended that Grace is nothing
but an occasional denomination of Vertue,
not that it is the cause or principle of it.
But the proofs produced by our Author
are exceedingly incompetent unto the end
whereunto they are applyed. For that
place of the Apostle, Gal. 5. v. 22, 23.
<hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace,
long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith,
meekness, Temperance;</hi> Though our Author
should be allowed to turn <hi>Joy</hi> into <hi>cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
peace</hi> into <hi>peaceableness, Faith</hi> into
<hi>Faithfulness,</hi> as he hath done, corruptly
enough, to accommodate it to his purpose,
yet it will no way reach his end, nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his intention. For doth it follow that
because the Spirit effects all these <hi>Moral
vertues</hi> in a new and gracious manner, and
with a direction to a new and special end
in Believers, either that these things are
nothing but meer <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> not
wrought in us by the grace of God, (the
contrary whereof is plainly asserted in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them fruits of the Spirit) or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there is <hi>Moral Vertue,</hi> though not so
wrought by the Spirit, that there is Grace
also, because Vertue and Grace are the
same? If these are the Expositions of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58629:113"/>
Scripture which we may expect from them,
who make such out-cries against other mens,
perverting and corrupting of it, the matter
is not like to be much mended with us,
for ought I can see, upon their taking of
that work into their own hands. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
his Quotation of this place is pretty
odd. He doth not in the Print express
the words as he useth, and as he doth those
of another Scripture immediately, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
character, as the direct words of the
Apostle, that no man may charge him with a
false Allegation of the Text. Yet he repeats
all the words of it which he intends to use
to his purpose, somewhat altering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
But he hath had, I fear, some
unhappiness in his Explanations. By <hi>Joy</hi>
he would have <hi>Cheerfulness</hi> intended. But
what is meant by <hi>cheerfulness</hi> is much more
uncertain than what is intended by Joy.
<hi>Mirth</hi> it may be in Conversation is aimed
at, or somewhat of that nature. But how
remote this is from that <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi>
which is recommended unto us in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and is affirmed to be <hi>unspeakable and
full of glory,</hi> he that knows not, is scarce
meet to <hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles.
Neither is that <hi>Peace</hi> with God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, which is rought in the Hearts
of Believers by the Holy Ghost, who
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58629:113"/>
               <hi>creates the fruit of the lipps, peace, peace, unto
them,</hi> a matter of any more affinity with a
<hi>Moral peaceableness</hi> of mind and Affections.
Our <hi>Faith</hi> also in God, and our Faithfulness
in our Duties, Trusts, Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are sufficiently distinct. So palpably
must the Scripture be corrupted and
wrested to be made serviceable to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
He yet adds another proof to the
same purpose, if any man know distinctly
what that purpose is; namely, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11.
Where he tells us that the same Apostle
make the <hi>Grace of God, to consist in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
towards God, Temperance towards our
Selves, and Justice towards our Neighbours.</hi>
But these things are not so. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
doth not say that the <hi>Grace of God doth
consist in these things,</hi> but that the <hi>Grace of
God teacheth us these things.</hi> Neither is
the Grace here intended, any <hi>Subjective</hi> or
<hi>inherent Grace,</hi> or to speak with our Author
any <hi>Vertuous Quality</hi> or Vertue, but the
Love and Grace of God himself, in sending
Jesus Christ as declared in the Gospel,
was is manifest in the words and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
beyond contradiction. And I cannot
but wonder, how our Author desirous to
prove that the whole of our Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in <hi>Moral Vertues,</hi> and these only called
Graces because of the Miraculous Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58629:114"/>
of God from his own Grace in
the first Gospel converts, should endeavour
to do it by these two testimonies; the
first whereof expresly assigns the <hi>Duties of
Morality</hi> as in Believers, to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit, and the latter in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
makes them to proceed from Grace.</p>
            <p>Our last inquiry is into what he ascribes
unto his Adversaries in this matter, and
how he deals with them thereupon. This
therefore he informs us pag. 71. <hi>It is not
enough say they to be compleatly vertuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
ye have grace too.</hi> I can scarce believe
that ever he heard any one of them say so,
or ever read it in any of their writings.
For there is nothing that they are more
positive in, than that men cannot in any
sense be <hi>compleatly vertuous</hi> unless they
have grace; and so cannot suppose them to
be so, who have it not. They say indeed,
that moral vertues, as before described,
so far as they are attainable by, or may be
exercised in the strength of Mens own wills
and natural faculties, are not enough to
please God and to make men accepted with
him. So that vertue as it may be without
Grace, and some vertues may be so for the
substance of them, is not available unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And I had almost said that he is no
Christian that is of another mind. In a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58629:114"/>
word, Vertue is, or may be without Grace,
in all or any of the Acceptations of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laid down. Where it is without the
Favour of God and the Pardon of sin, where
it is without the renewing of our natures,
and the endowment of our Persons with a
Principle of spiritual life, where it is not
wrought in us by present efficacious Grace,
it is not enough; nor will <hi>serve any mans
turn</hi> with respect unto the everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of his Soul.</p>
            <p>But he gives in his Exceptions, pag. 71.
<hi>But when,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have set aside all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of vertue, let them tell me what remains to
be called Grace, and give me any notion of
it distinct from all morality, that consists in the
right order and government of our actions in
all our Relations, and so comprehends all our
Duty; and therefore if Grace be not included in
it, it is but a phantasme and an imaginary
thing.</hi> I say <hi>first;</hi> where Grace is, we cannot <hi>set
aside vertue,</hi> because it will and doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and effect it in the minds of men.
But Vertue may be, where Grace is not, in
the sense so often declared. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take
<hi>moral vertue</hi> in the notion of it here recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and explained by our Author, and I
have given sundry Instances before, of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Duties,</hi> that come not within the verge
or compass of the <hi>Scheme</hi> given us of it.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58629:115"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The whole aimed at, lies in this,
that vertue that governs our actions in all
our Duties may be considered either as the
Duty we owe to the Law of nature, for
the ends of it, to be performed in the
strength of nature, and by the direction
of it, or it may be considered as it is an
especial effect of the grace of God in us,
which gives it a new principle, and a new
end, and a new respect unto the Covenant
of Grace Wherein we walk with God, the
consideration where of frustrates the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Author in this discourse.</p>
            <p>But he renews his charge, pag. 73. <hi>So
destructive of all true and real goodness is the
very Religion of those men, that are wont
to set grace at odds with vertue; and are so
farr from making them the same, that they
make them inconsistent; and though a man be
exact in all the duties of moral goodness, yet
if he be a graceless person</hi> (i. e. <hi>void of I
know not what imaginary Godliness) he is but
in a cleaner way to Hell; and his conversion
is more hopeless than the vilest and most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
sinners, and the morally Righteous man
is at a greater distance from grace, than the
prophane; and better be lend and debanched
than live an honest and vertuous life, if you
are not of the Godly Party;</hi> with much more
to this purpose. For the men that are
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58629:115"/>
wont to set grace at odds with vertue,
and are so far from making them the same,
that they make them inconsistent; I wish
our Author would discover them, that he
might take us along with him in his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of them. It is not unlikely, if all
be true that is told of them, but that the
<hi>Gnosticks</hi> might have some principles not
unlike this; but beside them I never heard
of any that were of this mind in the world.
And in truth the liberty that is taken in
these discourses, is a great instance of the
<hi>morality</hi> under consideration. But the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words will direct us where these
things are charged. For some say, that if
<hi>a man be exact in all the Duties of moral
Goodness, yet if he be a Graceless Person, void
of I know not what imaginary Godliness, he is
but in a cleaner way to Hell.</hi> I think I
know both what, and who are intended,
and that both are dealt withal with that
candour we have been now accustomed
unto. But First, you will scarce find those
you intend over forward in granting that
men may be <hi>exact in all the Duties of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
goodness,</hi> and yet be <hi>graceless</hi> persons.
For taking <hi>Moral vertues</hi> to comprehend,
as you do, their duties toward God, they
will tell you such Persons cannot perform
one of them aright, much less <hi>all of them
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58629:116"/>
exactly.</hi> For they can neither <hi>trust in God,</hi>
no <hi>believe</hi> him, nor <hi>fear</hi> him, nor <hi>glorifie</hi> him
in a due manner. Take the Duties of moral
Goodness, for the duties of the Law between
man and man, and the observation of the
outward Duties of Gods worship, and they
say indeed, that they may be so perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as that in respect of them, men may be
<hi>blameless,</hi> and yet be <hi>Graceless.</hi> For that
account if they mistake not the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> gives of himself. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8.
They do say therefore that many of these
Duties, so as to be useful in the world,
and blameless before men, they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
who are yet Graceless. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This
<hi>Gracelessness</hi> is said to consist in being <hi>void
of I know not what imaginary Godliness.</hi> No,
no; It is to be void <hi>of the Spirit of</hi> God, of
the Grace of Christ, not to be born again,
not to have a new spiritual life in Christ,
not to be united to him, or ingrafted in him,
not to be accepted and made an heir of God,
and enabled to a due Spiritual Evangelical
performance of all Duties of Obedience,
according to the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
these are the things intended. And
as many with their <hi>moral Duties</hi> may come
short of them and be Graceless; so those
to whom they are <hi>imaginary,</hi> must reject
the whole Gospel of Christ as an <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:58629:116"/>
And I must say, to give matter of a
new charge, that to the best Observation
that I have been able to make in the world,
none have been, nor are more negligent
in the principal Duties of morality, than
those who are aptest to exalt them above
the Gospel, and the whole Mystery of it;
unless <hi>morality</hi> do consist in such a course
of life and Conversation, as I will not at
present charactarize.</p>
            <p>It is farther added, that the <hi>conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such a one, is more hopeless than the
vilest and most notorious Sinners;</hi> and <hi>the
morally Righteous man,</hi> &amp;c. Setting aside
the inviduous expression of what is here
reflected upon, and there is nothing more
openly taught in the Gospel. The <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>
were a People <hi>morally Righteous,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they trusted to themselves that they
were Righteous; and yet our Lord Jesus
Christ told them, that <hi>Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi>
the vilest and most notorious of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
entred before them into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. And where Men trust to
their own Righteousness, their own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be they moral or what they will,
there are no Men farther from the way of
the Gospel than they. Nay our Saviour
lets us know, that as such, the Gospel is
not concerned in them, not they in it. He
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58629:117"/>
came not, he sayes, <hi>to call the Righteous,
but Sinners to Repentance;</hi> not Men justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
or lifting up themselves in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceit
of their <hi>moral Duties,</hi> but those who are
burdened and laden with a sense of their
sins. And so in like manner, that <hi>the
whole have no need of the Physitian but the
sick;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares what <hi>Enemies they
were to the Righteousness of God, who went
about to set up their own Righteousness;</hi>
Rom. 10. Now because <hi>moral Duties</hi> are
incumbent on all Persons, at all times,
they are continually to be pressed upon all,
from a sense of the Authority, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, indispensibly requiring all
Mens attendance unto them. Yet such is
the deceitfulness of the heart of Man,
and the power of unbelief, that oftentimes
Persons who through their Education, or
following convictions, have been brought
to some observance of them, and being
not enlightned in their minds to discern
their insufficiency unto the great end of
salvation, in and of themselves, are apt to
take up with them, and to rest in them
without ever coming to sincere Repentance
towards God, or faith in our Lord Jesus
Christ; Whereas others, the guilt of whose
sins doth unavoidably press upon them,
as it did on the <hi>Publicans and Sinners of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58629:117"/>
old,</hi> are oft times more ready to look out
after relief. And those who question these
things, do nothing but manifest their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Scripture, and want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the work of the Ministry.
But yet upon the account of the charge
mentioned, so unduly framed, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
managed, our Author makes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion
into such an extravagancy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
as is scaree exceeded in his whole
Book: Part of it I have considered before
in our view of his <hi>Preface;</hi> and I am now
so used to the noise and bluster wherewith
he pours out the storm of his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that I am altogether inconcerned in it,
and cannot prevail with my self to give
it any further consideration.</p>
            <p>These things though not direct to the
Argument in hand, and which on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
might have been neglected; yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that the Author placed as much of
his design in them, as in any part of his
Discourse, I could not wholly omit the
consideration of; not so much out of
a desire for their vindication who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly
traduced in them, as to plead for
the Gospel it self, and to lay a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a further defence of the Truths of
it, if ocasiou shall so require. And we
have also here an insight into the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58629:118"/>
of our Author, or his mistake in this
matter. He tells us that it is better to
<hi>tollerate debaucheries and immoralities,</hi> than
liberty of conscience, for men to worship
God according to their light and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Now all Religion according to him,
consisting in <hi>morality,</hi> to tollerate <hi>immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
and <hi>debauckeries</hi> in conversation, is
plainly to tollerate <hi>Atheism;</hi> which it seems
is more eligible than to grant liberty of
conscience, unto them who differ from the
present establishment, only as to some things
belonging to the outward worship of God.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self pleaded in this Chap. is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a speedy dispatch. It is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>The Magistrate hath power over the
consciences of men in reference to Morals, or
Moral Vertues, which are the principal things
in Religion, and therefore much more hath so
in reference to the Worship of God, which is
of less importance.</hi> We have complained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the ambiguity of these general
terms, but it is to no purpose to do so
any more, seeing we are not like to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in this discourse. Let us then take
things as we find them, and satisfie our
selves in the intention of the Author, by
that Declaration which he makes of it up
and down the Chap. But yet here we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58629:118"/>
are at a loss also. When he speaks, or
seems to speak to this purpose, whether in
the confirmation of the Proposition, or the
Inference, whereof his Argument consists,
what he sayes is cast into such an inter-tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with invectives and reproaches, and
expressed in such a loose declamatory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as it is hard to discover or find out
what it is that he intends. Suppose
therefore in the first place, that a Man
should call his consequent into question;
namely that because the Magistrate hath
power over the Consciences of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<hi>in morals,</hi> that therefore he hath so
also in matters of <hi>Instituted Worship?</hi> how
will he confirm and vindicate it? Two
things are all I can observe that are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the confirmation of it. <hi>First,</hi> That
<hi>these things of morality, moral Vertues, are
of more importance in Religion than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worship of God,</hi> which the amplitude
of power before asserted, is now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to a respect unto. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
<hi>there is much more danger of his erring and
mistaking in things of morality, than in things
of outward Worship, because of their great
weight and importance.</hi> These things are
pleaded, <hi>p.</hi> 28. And elsewhere up and
down. That any thing else is offered, in
the confirmation of this consequent I find
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58629:119"/>
not. And it may be some will think these
proofs to be very weak and feeble, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to sustain the weight that is laid upon
them. For it is certain that the first Rule,
that he that hath power over the Greater,
hath so over the Lesser, doth not hold
unless it be in things of the same nature
and kind; and it is no less certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that there is an especial and formal
difference between these things, namely
moral Vertues, and Instituted Worship;
the one depending as to their Being and
discovery on the light of Nature, and the
dictates of that Reason which is common to
all, and speakes the same language in the
Consciences of all mankind; the other on
pure Revelation, which may be, and is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
apprehended. Hence it is, that
whereas there is no <hi>difference</hi> in the world
about what is Vertue and what is not, there
is no <hi>Agreement</hi> about what belongs to
divine Worship and what doth not.</p>
            <p>Again; <hi>lesser things</hi> may be exempted
from that Power and Authority by espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
priviledge or Law, which hath the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of <hi>greater</hi> committed into it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with it. As the Magistrate amongst
us, may take away the life of a Man, which
is the greatest of his concernments, the
name of his all, for fellony, but cannot
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58629:119"/>
take away his Estate or Inheritance of Land,
which is a far less concernment unto him,
if it be antecedently setled by Law to
other uses than his own. And if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved that the disposal of the
Worship of God, as to what doth really
and truly belong unto it, and all the parts
of it, is exempted from all humane Power
by special Law and Priviledge, let it be
disposed of as who so will, shall judge
meet.</p>
            <p>Nor is the latter consideration suggested
to inforce this consequent of any more
validity; namely, <hi>that there is more danger
of the Magistrates erring or mistakes about
Moral Vertue, than about Rites of Worship;</hi>
because that is of most concernment in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For it is true, that suppose a Man
to walk on the top of an high house or
Tower, on a plain floor with battlements
or Walls round about him, there will be
more danger of breaking his neck, if he
should fall from thence, than if he should
fall from the top of a narrow wall that
had not the fourth part of the heighth of
the house. But there would not be so
much <hi>danger of falling.</hi> For from the top
of the house as circumstantiated, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fall, unless he will wilfully and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
cast himself down headlong; and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58629:120"/>
on the top of the Wall, it may be, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand, with the utmost of his heed and
endeavours. The Magistrate cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
about Moral Vertues unless he will
do it wilfully. They have their station fixed
in the world, on the same ground and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with Magistracy it self. The same
evidence, the same common consent and
suffrage of mankind is given unto Moral
Vertues, as is to any Government in the
World. And to suppose a supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
a Law-giver, to mistake in these
things, in judging whether Justice, and
Temperance, or Fortitude, be Vertues or
no, and that in their Legislative capacity,
is ridiculous. Neither <hi>Nero</hi> nor <hi>Caligula</hi>
were ever in danger of any such mis-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
All the Magistrates in the World
at this day, are agreed about these things.
But as to what concerns the Worship of
God, they are all at variance. There is
no such Evidence in these things, no such
common suffrage about them, as to free
any absolutely from failings and mistakes;
so that in respect of them, and not of the
other, lyes the principal danger of miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
as to their determination and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.
Supposing therefore the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
our Author layes down to be true,
his Inference from them is feeble, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58629:120"/>
to various impeachments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I have given some few Instances only,
which shall be increased if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>But the Assertion it self which is the
foundation of these consequences, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
remote from Accuracy and Truth.
It is said that the <hi>Magistrate hath power over
the Consciences of Men in reference unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Duties, which are the principal parts of
Religion.</hi> Our first and most difficult in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
is after the meaning of this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the later after its truth. I ask then,
first whether he hath power over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men with respect unto <hi>Moral</hi>
Vertue, and over Moral Vertue it self, as
Vertue, and as a part of Religion, or on
some other account; If his power respect
Vertue as a part of Religion, then it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extends it self to all that is so, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Rule which will not be easily
everted. But it doth not appear that it
so extends it self as to plead an obliging
Authority in reference unto all Duties.
For let but the <hi>Scheme of Moral Duties,</hi>
especially those whose Object is God,
given us by our Author be considered,
and it will quickly be discerned how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are exempted from all humane
cognizance and Authority; and that from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58629:121"/>
and by their nature as well as their use
in the World. And it is in vain to ascribe
an authority to Magistrates which they
have no power to exert, or take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
whether it be obeyed or no. And
what can they do therein with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Gratitude to God,</hi> which holds the first
place in the <hi>Scheme of Moral Vertues</hi> here
given in unto us. We are told also, p. 83.
<hi>That in matters both of Moral Vertue, and
Divine Worship, there are some rules of Good
and Evil that are of an Eternal and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
obligation, and these can never be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
or altered by any humane power, because
the reason of their Obligation arises from a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and constitution of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> perpetual as that; but then there
are other rules of Duty that are alterable
according to the various accidents changes and
conditions of humane life, and depend chiefly
upon contracts and positive Laws of Kingdoms.</hi>
It would not be unworthy our inquiry to
consider what rules of Moral Duty they
are, which are <hi>alterable</hi> and depend on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and contracts. But we might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find work enough, should we call all such
fond Assertions to a just examination.
Neither doth the distinction here given us
between <hi>various Rules</hi> of Moral Vertue,
very well answer what we are told, p. 69.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58629:121"/>
namely, <hi>that every particular Vertue is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such, because it is are semblance and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of some of the Divine Attributes,</hi>
which I suppose they are not, whose <hi>Rules</hi>
and <hi>formes</hi> are alterable upon accidents
and occasions. And we are taught also,
<hi>pag.</hi> 68. that <hi>the practice of Vertue consists in
living suitable to the dictates of Reason and
Nature;</hi> which are Rules not variable and
Changeable. There must be some new
distinction to reconcile these things, which
I cannot at present think of. That which
I would enquire from hence is, whether
the Magistrates have power over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men in reference unto those
things in Morality, whose Rules of good
and evil are of an Eternal obligation. That
he hath not is evidently implyed in this
place. And I shall not enter into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of the ensuing Discourse, where
the latter sort of Rules for Vertue, the
other member of the distinction, are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into various Methods of executing Laws
about outward acts of Vertue or Vice;
and the Vertues themselves into outward
expressions and significations of Duty;
for I have at present no contest with this
Author about his manner of writing, nor
do intend to have. It is enough that
here at once all the principal and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:58629:122"/>
Vertues are vindicated to their
own unalterable Rules as such, and the
Consciences of Men in reference unto
them put under another jurisdiction. And
what then becomes of this Argument,
That the Magistrate must have power over
the Consciences of Men in matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, because he hath so in things
Moral which are of greater importance,
when what is so of importance, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from his power.</p>
            <p>Hence it sufficiently, appears that the
Authority of the Magistrate over men,
with reference unto Moral Vertue and
Duty, doth not respect Vertue as Vertue,
but hath some other consideration. Now
what this is, is evident unto all. How
Moral Vertues do belong unto Religion
and are parts of it, hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
But God who hath ordered all
things in weight and measure, hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>designed
them also to another end and
purpose. For preparing mankind for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Society in the world among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for a time, as well as for Religious
Obedience unto himself, he inlayed his
nature and composition with principles
suited to both those ends, and appointed
them to be acted with different respects
unto them. Hence Moral Vertues not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58629:122"/>
their peculiar tendency unto
him, are appointed to be the instrument
and ligament of humane Society also.
As the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had in it a <hi>typical end,</hi>
use, and signification, with respect to Christ
and the Gospel, and a <hi>political</hi> use as the
instrument of the Government of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jews. Now the Power of the
Magistrate in respect of Moral Vertues, is
in their latter use; namely, as they relate
to humane policy, which is concerned in
the outward actings of them. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is granted; and we shall enquire far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whether any more be proved, namely,
that the Magistrate hath power over the
outward actings of Vertue and Vice, so far
as humane Society or publick Tranquility
is concerned in them, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
It may be enquired what is
the Power and Authority over Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which is here ascribed unto the
Civil Magistrate, and over the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, with respect unto them.
Is it such as to make that to be Vertue
which was not Vertue before, or which
was Vice, and oblige men in Conscience to
practise it as Vertue? This would go a
great way indeed, and answer somewhat
of what is, or as it is said, may be done
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58629:123"/>
in the Worship of God, when that is made
a part of it which was not so before. But
what name shall these new Vertues be called
by? A new Vertue both as to its Acts and
Objects, will as much fly the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men, as a sixth sense doth.
It may be our Author will satisfie us as
to this enquiry; for he tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 80.
That he hath power <hi>to make that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
of the Divine Law, that God hath not
made so.</hi> I wish he had declared himself
how, and wherein; for I am afraid this
expression as here it lyes, is offensive. The
Divine Law is Divine, and so is every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and how a man can make a
thing <hi>Divine,</hi> that is not so of it self, nor
by Divine Institution, is hard to find out.
It may be that only the subject matter of
the Law, and not the Law it self formally is
intended; and to make a thing <hi>a particular
of the Divine Law,</hi> is no more but to make
the Divine Law require, that in particular
of a man which it did not require of him
before. But this <hi>Particular,</hi> referrs to the
Nature, Essence and Being of the thing,
or to the acting, and occasion of it in
particular. And if it be taken in the
latter sense, here is no more ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Magistrate, than is common with him
to every man in the World. For every
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58629:123"/>
one that puts himself into new circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
or new Relations, doth so make
that unto him to be a particular of the
Divine Law, which was not so before;
for he is bound and obliged unto the
actual performance of many Duties, which
as so circumstantiated, he was not bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
unto before.</p>
            <p>But somewhat else seems to be intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
from the ensuing discourse; <hi>they are fully
empowred to declare new instances of Vertue
and Vice, and to introduce new duties in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
most important parts of Religion.</hi> And y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
I am still at the same loss. For by his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
new Instances of Vertue and Vice,</hi>
suppose he intends an Authoritative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
such as that they have no other
foundation, nor need none to make them
what they are. They are new Instances of
Vertue and Vice, because so declared.
And this suits unto the <hi>introducing of new
Duties in the most important parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
made Duties by that introduction.
I wish I could yet learn what these <hi>new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Vertue and Vice</hi> are, or mean.
Whether they are new <hi>as Vertues</hi> and Vices,
or as Instances. For the first, would I
could see a new practice of old Virtues;
but to tell you the truth, I care not for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58629:124"/>
any of the new Vertues, that I have lately
observed in the World; nor do I hope ever
to see any better new ones.</p>
            <p>If it be the <hi>Instances that are new,</hi> I wish
again I knew what were more in them, than
the actual and occasional exercise of old
Duties. <hi>Pag.</hi> 79, 80. conduce most to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
us out of these ambiguities. There
we are informed, <hi>that the Laws of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do distinguish and settle mens rights, and
properties, and that distinctly with respect
whereunto, Justice, that prime Natural Vertue,
is in particular Instances to be exercised.</hi>
And <hi>pag.</hi> 84. It is further declared, <hi>that
in the administration of Justice, there may be
great difference in the constitution of penalties
and execution of men.</hi> This it seems is that
which is aimed at; the Magistrate by his
Laws determines, whteher <hi>Titius</hi> have set his
hedge upon <hi>Caius</hi>'s <hi>ground;</hi> and whether
<hi>Sempronius</hi> hath rightly conveyed his Land
or House, to his Son, or Neighbour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
what is just and lawfull in it self, is
accommodated to the use of political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
He determines also how Persons
guilty of death shall be executed, and by
whom, and in what manner; whence it
must needs follow that he hath power to
<hi>assign new particulars of the Divine Law,</hi> to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58629:124"/>
               <hi>declare new bounds, or hedges,</hi> of right and
wrong, which the Law of God neither
doth, nor can limit, or hath power over
the Consciences of men with respect to
Moral Vertues; which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.
Let us lay aside these swelling
expressions, and we shall find that all that
can be ascribed unto the Civil Magistrate
in this matter, is no more, than to preserve
Property and Peace, by that Rule and
power over the outward Actions of men,
which is necessary thereunto.</p>
            <p>Having made some enquiry into the
termes of Moral Vertue and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
power, it remains only that we
consider what respect this case hath unto
the Consciences of men, with reference
unto them. And I desire to know whether
all mankind, be not obliged in Conscience
to the Observation of all Moral Vertue,
antecedently to the command or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Magistrate, who doth only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their observation of them as to the
concerns of publick peace and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Certainly if all Moral Vertue consists
in living suitable to the dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as we are told, and in a sense rightly,
if the Rule of them all and every one,
which gives them their formal Nature, be
the Law of our Creation, which all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58629:125"/>
enter the World under an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
obligation unto, it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that there is such an antecedent
obligation on the Consciences of Men, as
that inquired after. But the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
are granted by our Author; nor
can by any be denyed, without offering
the highest outrage to Scripture, Reason,
and the common consent of Mankind. Now
if this Obligation be thus on all Men, unto
all Vertue as Vertue, and this absolutely
from the Authority of God over them
and their Consciences, how comes an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Authority to interpose it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that of God and their Consciences,
so immediately to oblige them. It is
granted that when the Magistrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
and requireth the exercise of any
Moral Duty, in a way suited unto publick
good and tranquility, he is to be obeyed
for Conscience sake; because he who is the
Lord of Conscience doth require Men to
be obedient unto him, whereon they are
obliged in Conscience so to be. But if the
things required of them be in themselves
Moral Duties, as they are such, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are obliged to observe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
them, from the command of God, and
other obligation unto them as such, they
neither have nor can have. But the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58629:125"/>
and command for the exercise of
them, in these and those circumstances, for
the ends of publick. Good whereunto they
are directed, belongs unto the Magistrate,
who is to be obeyed. For as in things meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Civil, and which have nothing original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of morality in them, but secondarily
only, as they tend to the preservation and
welfare of humane Society, which is a thing
Morally good, the Magistrate is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Conscience sake, and the things
themselves as far as they partake of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
come directly under the command
of God which affects the Conscience; so
in things that have an inherent and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Morality, and so respect God in the
first place, when they come to have a civil
Sanction in reference to their exercise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
publick political Good, that Sanction is
to be obeyed out of Conscience; but the
antecedent obligation that was upon the
Conscience unto a due exercise of those
Duties, when made necessary by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
is not superseded, nor any new one
added thereunto.</p>
            <p>I know what is said, but I find not as yet
what is proved from these things, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the uncontroleable and absolute power
of the supream Magistrate, over Religion
and the consciences of men. Some things
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58629:126"/>
are added indeed here up and down, about
circumstances of Divine Worship, and the
power of ordering them by the Magistrate,
which though there may be some different
conceptions about, yet they no way reach
the cause under debate. But as they are
expressed by our Author, I know not of
any one Writer in and of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> that hitherto hath so stated them, as
they are by him. For he tells us <hi>pag.</hi> 85.
That <hi>all Rituals, Ceremonies, Postures and
Manners of performing the outward expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Devotion, that are not chargeable with
countenancing Vice or disgracing the Deity,
are capable of being adopted into the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Divine Service, and are not exempted
from being Subject to the determinations of
humane power.</hi> Whether they are so or
no, the Magistrate I presume is to judge;
or all this flourish of words and concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of power, vanish into smoak. His
command of them binds the Consciences of
men to observe them, according to the
principle under consideration. Hence it
must be absolutely in the power of every
supream Magistrate to impose on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Subjects, a greater number of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
observances in the Worship of
God, and those of greater weight than
ever were laid upon the Jews. For who
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58629:126"/>
knows not that under the names of <hi>Rituals,
Ceremonies, Postures, manners of Performing all
Divine Service,</hi> what a butrdensome heap of
things are imposed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;
whereunto as far as I know a thousand more
may be added, not chargeable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with either of the crimes, which alone
are allowed to be put in, in Barr or Plea
against them. And whether this be the
Liberty whereunto Jesus Christ hath vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
his Disciples and Church, is left
unto the judgement of sober men. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Religious Worship we know is to be
performed by natural actions; these have
their circumstances, and those oft-times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the publick concernments of the
exercise of Religion, of great importance.
These may be ordered by the power, and
according to the Wisdome of those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But that they should make so
many things, as this assertion allows them to
make to belong unto, and to be Parts of
the Worship of God, whereof not one is
enjoyned or required by him, and the
Consciences of men be thereby obliged
unto their observance; I do not believe,
nor is it here at all proved.</p>
            <p>To close this Discourse about the power
of obliging the consciences of men; I think
our Author grants that Conscience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58629:127"/>
obliged to the Observation of all
things that are Good in themselves, from
the Law of our Creation. Such things as
either the nature of God, or our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from us, our Consciences surely are
obliged immediately by the Authority of
God to observe. Nor can we have any
dispensation for the non-performance of
our Duty, from the interposition of the
commands and Authority of any of the
sons of Men. For this would be openly
and directly to set up men against God, and
to advance them or their Authority above
him or his. Things evidently deduced, and
necessarily following the first Principles
and Dictates of Nature, are of the same
kind with themselves, and have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God no less enstamped on them than
the other; and in respect unto them, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
cannot by Vertue of inferiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
plead an exemption. Things of
meer <hi>Revelation</hi> do remain; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them I desire to know, whether we are
not bound to observe and do, whatever
God in his <hi>revealed Will</hi> commands us to
observe and do, and to abstain from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he forbids, and this indispensably?
If this be denyed I will prove it with the
same Arguments whereby I can prove that
there is a God, and that we are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58629:127"/>
made to serve him; For the Reason
of these things is inseparable from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Being of God. Let this be granted, and
ascribe what ye will, or please, or can, to
the Supream Magistrate, and you shall not
from me have the least contradiction.</p>

            <head>A Survey of the Third
Chapter.</head>
            <p>THe third Chapter entertains us with
a Magnificent Grant of <hi>Liberty of
Conscience.</hi> The very first <hi>Paragraph</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts,
a <hi>Liberty of Conscience in Mankind
over all their Actions whether Moral, or Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Religious.</hi> But lest this should prove a

whole design in hand, it is delivered to
the power of a Keeper, who yet upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
is no less wild and extravagant,
than it self is esteemed absolutely to be.
This is, <hi>That they have it as far as concerns
their judgements, but not their practice;</hi>
That is; They have Liberty of Conscience
<hi>over their Actions,</hi> but <hi>not their practices;</hi> or

               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:58629:128"/>
For upon Tryal their Actions
and Practices will prove to be the same.
And I do not as yet well understand, what
is this <hi>Liberty of Conscience over mens Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
Is it to do, or not to do, as their
Consciences dictate to them? This is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
denied, and opposed in the chap.
it self. Is it to judge of their Actions as
done, whether they be good or evil?
This Conscience is at no liberty in. For
it is determined to a judgment in that
kind Naturally, and Necessarily, and must
be so whilest it hath the Light of Nature,
and Word of God to regard, So far as a
Rule is capable of giving a measure and
Determination to things to be regulated
by it; That is; its moral actings, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
determined. What then <hi>this Liberty
of Conscience over mens actions</hi> should be,
where they can neither Act freely accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Consciences what they are to
do, nor abstain from what they are not
to do, nor are at liberty to judge what
they have done to be good or bad, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
divine.</p>
            <p>Let us search after an Explication of
these things in the <hi>Paragraph</hi> it self, whose
Contents are represented in the words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Here we are told, that this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
consists <hi>in mens thinking of things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58629:128"/>
to their own perswasion, and therein assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the freedom of their judgements.</hi> I would
be loth to think <hi>that this Liberty of mens
Consciences over all their moral Actions,</hi>
should at first dash dwindle into a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Speculations; That men may Think
what they will, opine as they please, in,
and about things that are not to be
brought into practice; but yet as far as
I can perceive, I must think so, or matters
will come to a worse issue.</p>
            <p>But these things must be a little farther
examined, and that very briefly. Here is
mention of <hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> but what
Conscience is, or what that Liberty is, is
not declared. For Conscience it is called
sometimes the <hi>Mind,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
sometimes <hi>Opinion,</hi> sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the <hi>Liberty of Thinking,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
termed an <hi>Imperious Faculty,</hi> which
things without much discourse, and more
words, than I can now afford to use, are
not reconcilable amongst themselves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Liberty is no proper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Affection of
the Mind, or Understanding. Though I
acknowledge the mind, and its Actings to
be naturally free from outward Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or Coaction; yet it is capable of such
a Determination from the things proposed
unto it, and the manner of their proposal,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58629:129"/>
as to make necessary the <hi>Elicitation of its
Acts.</hi> It cannot but judge that two and
three make five. It is the will that is
the proper seat of <hi>Liberty;</hi> and what some
suppose to be the ultimate determination
of the practical understanding, is indeed
an <hi>Act of the Will.</hi> It is so if you speak
of Liberty naturally and morally, and not
of state and condition, which are here
confounded. But suppose what you will
to be Conscience, it is <hi>Moral Actions or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
that are here supposed to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of its actings. Now what are, or can
be the thoughts, or actings of the Mind
of Man about <hi>moral Actions,</hi> but about
their Vertue, or their Vice, their moral
good or evil? nor is a conclusion of what
is a mans own duty in reference to the
practice of them, possibly to be separated
from them. That then which is here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
is, That a man may think, judge,
or conceive such or such a thing to be his
Duty, and yet have thereby no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
put upon him to perform it; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
we are informed, hath nothing
to do beyond the inward thoughts of mens
minds.</p>
            <p>To state this matter a little more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
let us take Conscience in the most
usual Acceptation of it, and that which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58629:129"/>
answers the experience of every man that
ever looks into the Affairs and Concerns
within; and so it is, The practical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that men make of themselves, and
of their Actions, or what they are to do,
and what they are not to do, what they
have done, or what they have omitted,
with reference unto the Judgement of
God, at present declared in their own
hearts, and in his word, and to be fully
executed at the last day. For we speak of
Conscience as it is amongst Christians, who
acknowledge the Word of God, and that
for a double end; <hi>First,</hi> as the Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
it self; <hi>Secondly,</hi> as the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Will of God, as to his Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Rejecting of what we do, or omit.
Suppose then, that a man make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Conscience, regulated by the
Word of God, and with respect unto the
judgement of God concerning him, that
such and such a thing is a duty, and whose
performance is required of him; I desire
to know, whether any obligation be upon
him from thence to act accordingly? It is
answered that the <hi>Territory of Conscience is
confined unto mens thoughts, judgements and
perswasions, and these are free,</hi> yea, no doubt;
but <hi>for outward actions there is no remedy,
but they must be subject to the Cognizance of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58629:130"/>
humane Laws,</hi> pag. 9. Who ever doubted
of it? He that would have men so have
Liberty from outward Actions, as not to
have those Actions <hi>cognoscible</hi> by the civil
power, as to the end of publick Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to have their whole station firmed
absolutely in the world upon the plea of
Conscience, would no doubt lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for confusion in all government.
But what is this to the present enquiry,
whether Conscience lay an Obligation on
men, as regulated by the word of God,
and respecting Him, to practise according
to its dictates? It is true enough; that if
any of its practices do not please, or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the Magistrate, their Authors must for
ought I know, stand to what will follow,
or ensue on them to their prejudice; but
this frees them not, from the Obligation
that is upon them in Conscience unto
what is their duty. This is that, which
must be here proved, if any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto the purpose of this Author;
namely that notwithstanding the judgment
of Conscience concerning any duty, by
the interposition of the Authority of the
Magistrate to the contrary, there is no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
ensues for the performance of
that duty. This is the Answer that ought
plainly to be returned, and not a sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58629:130"/>
that outward Actions must fall under
the <hi>Cognizance of the Magistrate;</hi> which
none ever doubted of, and which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the present purpose; unless he
would have them to fall under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Cognizance, as that his will should
be the supream Rule of them; which I
think he cannot prove. But what sense
the Magistrate will have of the outward
Actions, wherein the discharge of mans
duty doth consist, is of another conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>This
therefore is the state of the present
case applied unto Religious Worship.
Suppose the Magistrate <hi>command</hi> such things
in Religion, as a man in his Conscience
guided by the Word, and respecting God,
doth look upon as <hi>Vnlawful,</hi> and such as
are Evil, and Sin unto him, if he should
perform them; and <hi>forbid</hi> such things in the
Worship of God, as he esteems himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
in Conscience to observe as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ; If he may practise the
things so commanded, and omit the things
so forbidden, I fear he will find himself
within doors continually at confession, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with trouble enough; <hi>I have done
those things, which I ought not to have done,
and I have left undone those things, which I
ought to have done, and there is no health in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58629:131"/>
me;</hi> unless this Author can prove that the
Commands of God respect only the minds
of men; but not their outward actions
which are left unto the Authority of the
Magistrate alone. If no more be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
but that whatever Conscience
may require of any, it will not secure
them, but that when they come to act out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
according to it, the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may, and will consider their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and allow them, or forbid them
according to his own judgement, it
were surely a madness to deny it, as great,
as to say the Sun shineth not at noon day.
If Conscience to God be confined to
Thoughts, and Opinions, and Speculations
about the general Notions, and Notices of
things, about <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False,</hi> and unto a
liberty of judging, and determining upon
them what they are, whether they are so
or no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the whole nature and being of
Conscience, and that to the Reason, sense,
and experience of every man, is utterly
overthrown. If Conscience be allowed to
make its judgement of what is good or
evil, what is Duty or sin, and no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be allowed to ensue from thence unto
a suitable practice, a wide door is opened
unto <hi>Atheism,</hi> and thereby the subversion
of all Religion and Government in the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:58629:131"/>
This therefore is the summ of what is
asserted in this matter; Conscience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Apprehension, which it
hath of the will of God about His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
(whereunto we confine our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
obligeth men to act, or forbear
accordingly; if their Apprehensions are
right and true, just and equal, what the
Scripture, the great Rule of Conscience
doth declare and require, I hope none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
second thoughts will deny, but that
such things are attended with a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Liberty to be practised, whilst the
Lord Jesus Christ is esteemed the Lord
of Lords, and King of Kings, and is
thought to have power to command the
observance of his own Institutions. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
these Apprehensions to be such as
may in some things, be they more or less,
be judged not to correspond exactly with
the great Rule of Conscience, yet suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them also to contain nothing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with, or of a disturbing nature to
civil Society, and publick Tranquillity,
nothing that gives countenance to any
Vice, or Evil, or is opposite to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Truths and main Duties of Religion,
wherein the minds of men in a Nation do
coalesce, nor carry any politick entangle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments
along with them; and add thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:58629:132"/>
the peaceableness of the persons posses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
with those Apprehensions, and the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
they are under to devest themselves
of them, and I say Natural Right, Justice,
Equity, Religion, Conscience, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all, and His Voice in the hearts
of all unprejudiced persons, do require
that neither the persons themselves, on the
account of their Consciences, have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
offered unto them, nor their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
in pursuit of their Apprehensions, be
restrained by severe prohibitions and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.
But whereas the Magistrate is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to judge, and dispose of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Actions in reference to publick tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
if any shall assert Principles, as
of Conscience, tending, or obliging unto
the practice of Vice, Immorality, or Sin,
or to the disturbance of publick society,
such principles being all notoriously judged
by Scripture, Nature, the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Mankind, and inconsistent with
the fundamental principles of Humane
Polity, may be in all instances of
their discovery and practice, coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and restrained. But plainly, as to the
commands of Conscience, they are of the
same extent with the commands of God:
If these respect only the inward man, or
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:58629:132"/>
the mind, Conscience doth no more; if
they respect outward Actions, Conscience
doth so also.</p>
            <p>From the Liberty of Conscience, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
is made to <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> which <hi>is
said to be a Duty, or priviledg founded upon
the</hi> (chimaerical) <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
granted. But these things stand not
in the Relation imagined; Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is of natural Right, <hi>Christian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is a Gospel-priviledge, though both may
be pleaded in bar of unwarrantable Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
on Conscience. But these things
are so described by our Author, as to be
confounded. For the <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
in this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> is either restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to matters of pure Speculation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the mind of man is left entirely free
to judge of the Truth, and falsehood of
things; or as it regards things that fall
under Laws and Impositions, wherein men
are left intirely free to judge of them, as
they are objects of meer Opinion. Now
how this differs from the <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
granted before, I know not. And
that there is some mistake in this descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> need no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
to evince but this; namely that
<hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> as our Author tells us,
is a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but this is not so, being
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58629:133"/>
that which is equally common unto all
mankind. This Liberty is necessary unto
<hi>Humane Nature,</hi> nor can it be divested of
it, and so it is not a <hi>Priviledge</hi> that includes a
specialty in it. Every man cannot but think
what he thinks, and judge what he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and that when he doth so, whether
he will or no; for every thing when it is,
and as it is, is necessary. In the use of
what means they please, to guide, direct,
and determine their thoughts, their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
doth consist; This is equal in all,
and natural unto all. Now this inward
freedom of our Judgements is, it seems,
our <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> consistent with any
impositions upon men in the exercise of the
Worship of God, with an Obligation
on Conscience, unto their use and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
A Liberty indeed of no value, but
a meer Aggravation of bondage; And
these things are further discoursed, Sect. 3.
pag. 95. wherein we are told, <hi>That this
prerogative of our Christian Liberty, is not so
much any new favour granted in the Gospel,
as the Restauration of the mind of man to its
natural priviledge, by exempting us from the
yoke of the Ceremonial Lam, whereby things in
themselves indifferent were tyed upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with as indispensable an obligation,
as the Rule of Essential Goodness, and Equitys
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58629:133"/>
during the whole period of Mosaick Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which being corrected by the Gospel,
those indifferent things, that have been made
necessary by a Divine positive command, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their own nature to be used, or
omitted, only as occasion should direct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that a good part of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty, consists in our deliverance from
the yoke of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions; but that
this is not so much a <hi>new favour granted in
the Gospel, as the Restauration of the mind of
man to its natural priviledge,</hi> is an insertion
that runs parallel with many others in
this discourse. This Priviledge, as all
others of the Gospel are, is spiritual, and
its outward concerns, and exercise, are of no
value, where the mind is not spiritually
made free by Christ. And it is uncertain
what is meant by the <hi>Restauration of the
mind to its natural priviledge;</hi> If the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the mind in its condition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
purity is intended, as it was before
the entrance of sin, it is false; If any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
the mind of man in its corrupt
depraved condition is capable of, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
it is no less untrue. In things of
this nature, the mind in that condition is
<hi>in bondage,</hi> and not capable of any Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for it is a thing ridiculous, to confound
the meer natural Liberty of our wills,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58629:134"/>
which is an affection inseparable from that
faculty, with a moral, or spiritual Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind, relating unto God and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
But this whole <hi>Paragraph</hi> runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no small mistake; namely that the yoke of
<hi>Mosaical</hi> Institutions, consisted in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
on the minds, and judgments of
men, with an opinion of the antecedent
necessity of them. For although the words
recited, <hi>things in themselves indifferent, were
tyed upon the Conscience with as indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an obligation as the rules of essential good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and equity,</hi> may be restrained to their
use, exercise, and observation; yet the
Conclusion of it, that <hi>whatever our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
impose upon us, whether in matters of
Religious Worship, or any other Duties of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
there neither is, nor can be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
upon our Christian Liberty, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it be not imposed with an Opinion of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
necessity of the thing it self,</hi> with the
whole scope of the Argument insisted on,
makes it evident to be the sense intended.
But this is wide enough from the mark;
the <hi>Jews</hi> were never obliged, to judge the
whole <hi>Systeme</hi> of their Legal institutions,
to be any way necessary, antecedent unto
their Institution and Appointment; nor
were they obliged to judge their intrincsik
nature changed by their institution, only
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58629:134"/>
they knew they were obliged to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and indispensable practice, as parts
of the Worship of God, instituted and
commanded by him, who hath the supream
Authority over their Souls and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
There was indeed a <hi>bondage frame of
Spirit</hi> upon them in all things, especially in
their whole Worship of God, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Paul</hi> several times declares. But this
is a thing of another Nature, though our
delivery from it, be also a part of Christian
Liberty. This was no part of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
no more than their outward bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
that they should think, believe, judge
or esteem the things themselves enjoyned
them, to be absolutely of any other nature,
than they were; Had they been obliged
unto any such judgement of things, they
had been obliged to deceive themselves,
or to be deceived; But by the absolute
Authority of God, they were indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bound in Conscience to the actual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance,
and continual use of such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Ceremonies, Carnal Ordinances,
and outward Observances, as being things
in themselves low, and mean, called by
the Apostle <hi>Beggerly Elements,</hi> and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with so great strictness, and under so
severe penalties, many of them, of Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or Extermination from among the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58629:135"/>
people, as became an intolerable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
yoke unto them. Neither doth
the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> dispute about a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their nature, but the necessity of
their Observation, when he calls <hi>them a
yoke, which neither they, nor their Fathers
were able to bear,</hi> Acts 15. 10. And when
St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a charge to Believers, <hi>to stand
fast in the Liberty, wherewith Christ hath
made them fres,</hi> it is with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the outward Observation of <hi>Mosaical
Rites,</hi> as by him instituted, and not as to
any inward judgment of their minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Nature, antecedent unto that
institution. His whole disputation on that
subject, respects only mens practice, with
regard unto an Authoritative Obligation
thereunto, which he pleaded to be now
expired, and removed. And if this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Liberty, which he built and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon, be of force to free, not our
minds from the judgement that they had
before of things in themselves, but our
persons from the necessary practice, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of things instituted of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
antecedently indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
I think it is, at least, of equal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy,
to exempt us from the necessary
practice of things imposed on us in the
Worship of God, by men. For, setting aside
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58629:135"/>
the Inequality of the Imposing Authority,
which casts the Advantage on the other
side, (for these Legal Institutions were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on the Church by God himself, those
now intended are such matters, as our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
of themselves impose on us in
Religious Worship) the case is absolutely
the same; for as God did not give the
<hi>Law of Commandment's contained in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>
unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the Goodness
of things required therein, antecedent to
His Command, which should make them
necessary to be practised by them for
their Good; but did it of His own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Arbitrary Will and Pleasure; so
He obliged not the people themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any other judgement of them, but that
they were necessarily to be observed; and
setting aside the consideration of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
they were things in their own nature
altogether indifferent; so is it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case; It is pleaded that there is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
on the Minds, Consciences, or
judgements of men, to <hi>think</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of what is imposed on them, than
as their nature is, and doth require; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are obliged unto their Usage, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance,
and Practice; which is to put
us into a thousand times worse condition
than the <hi>Jews,</hi> if Instances of them should
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58629:136"/>
be multiplyed, as they may lawfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
every year; seeing it much more quiet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the mind; to be able to resolve its thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
immediately into the Authority of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
therefore we are freed from the one <hi>by
our Christian Liberty,</hi> we are so much more
from the other; so, as that being made
<hi>free by Christ, we should not be the servants
of men,</hi> in things belonging to his Service
and Worship.</p>
            <p>From this discovery here made of the
nature of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> our Author
makes some deductions, <hi>p.</hi> 98, 99. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of Religious Worship,
wherein he tells us, that the <hi>whole substance
of Religious Worship is transacted within the
mind of man, and dwells in the heart, and
thoughts, the soul being its proper Seat, and
Temple, where men may Worship their God as
they please, without offending their Prince; and
that External Worship is no part of Religion it
self.</hi> I wish he had more clearly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
expressed his mind in this matter;
for his Assertions, in the sense the words
seem to bear, are prodigiously false, and
such as will open a door to <hi>Atheism</hi> with all
Villany and Confusion in the World. For
who would not think this to be his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>Let men keep their minds and inward
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58629:136"/>
thoughts, and apprehensious right for God, and
then they may practise outwardly in Religion
what they please; one thing one day, another
another; be Papists and Protestants, Arians
and Homousians;</hi> yea <hi>Mahometans and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi>
any thing, every thing, after the
manner of the Country, and Laws of the
Prince, where they are, and live; the
Rule that <hi>Ecebolius</hi> walked by of old? I
think there is no man, that owns the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but will confess that this is, at least,
if not a direct, yet an interpretative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the whole Authority of God.
And may not this Rule be quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto Oaths themselves, the bonds
and Ligaments of humane Society? For
whereas in their own formal nature they
belong to the Worship of God, why may
not men pretend to keep up their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto God, in the internal part of
them, or their esteem of Him in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of His Name, but as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part, accommodate it unto what by
their Interest is required of them; so
swearing with their Tongues, but keeping
their Mind at Liberty? If the Principles
laid down be capable of any other more
tolerable sense, and such as may be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of these Inferences, I shall gladly
admit it; at present what is here deduced
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58629:137"/>
from them, seems to be evidently included
in them.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that Natural, Moral, or
Internal Worship, consisting in Faith, Love,
Fear, Thankfulness, Submission, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and the like, hath its constant Seat,
and Residence in the Souls, and Minds of
men; but that the wayes whereby these
Principles of it are to be outwardly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
<hi>and expressed,</hi> by Gods Command and
Appointment, are not also indispensably
necessary unto us, and parts of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is utterly false. That which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in the Scripture, comes under the
notion of the <hi>Worship of God,</hi> is the due
observance of his outward Institutions;
which <hi>Divines</hi> have upon unquestionable
grounds, contended to be commanded and
appointed in general in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the Decalogue, whence all
particular Institutions in the several sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Church, are educed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into the Authority of God therein
expressed. And that account which we
have here given us of outward Worship,
namely, that it is <hi>no part of Religion it self,
but only an Instrument to express the inward
Veneration of the mind, by some outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or posture of the body,</hi> as it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly
to be accommodated unto the <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:58629:137"/>
of old, or the present <hi>Sacraments</hi> of
the Church, which were, and are parts of
outward Worship, and, as I take it, of
Religion; so the being an <hi>instrument</hi> unto
the purpose mentioned, doth not exclude
any thing from being also a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Worship it self, if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God to be performed in His
Service, unto His Glory. It is pretended
that all Outward Worship is only <hi>an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
signification of Honour;</hi> but yet all the
parts of it in their performance, are <hi>Acts of
Obedience</hi> unto God, and are the proper
Actings of Faith, Love, and Submission of
Soul unto God, which if they are not His
Worship, and parts of Religion, I know
not what may be so esteemed. Let then
Outward Worship, stand In what Relation
it will to Inward Spiritual Honour, where
God requires it, and commands it, it is no
less necessary and in dispensably to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
than any part of Inward Worship
it self, and is a no less important duty of
Religion. For any thing comes to be a
part of Religious Worship outwardly to
be performed, not from its own nature,
but from its respect unto the command of
God; and the End whereunto it is by him
designed. So the Apostle tells us <hi>that with
the heart man believeth unto Righteousness,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
our hearts; but yet it is no less necessary
to Salvation, than Faith it self is to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
And those, who regulate their
Obedience, and Religious Worship by the
Commands of God, knowing that which
way ever they are signified, by inbred
Light, or superadded Revelation, it is
they which give their Obedience its formal
nature, making it Religious, will not allow
that place and use of the outward Worship
required by God Himself, which should
exclude it from being Religious, or a part
of their Religion.</p>
            <p>But upon the whole matter our Author
affirms, <hi>that in all Ages of the World, God
hath left the Management of His Outward
Worship unto the Discretion of Men, unless
when to determine some particulars hath been
usefull to some other purpose,</hi> pag. 100. The
<hi>management of Outward Worship,</hi> may signifie
no more but the due performance of it;
and so I acknowledge that though it be
not left unto mens discretion to observe,
or not observe it, yet it is too their <hi>Duty</hi>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which are their Discretion
and their Wisdom. But the <hi>management</hi>
here understood, is opposed to Gods own
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58629:138"/>
determination of <hi>particular Forms,</hi> that is,
His especial Institutions; and hereof I
shall make bold to say, that it <hi>was never
in any Age so left to the Discretion of men.</hi>
To prove this Assertion, <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are
singled out as an Instance; It is known,
and granted, that these were the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
part of the Outward Worship of God
for many Ages; and that there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consent of Mankind unto the use of
them; so that however the greatest part of
the World apostatized from the true, only,
and proper object of all Religious Worship,
Worship, yet they retained this <hi>Mode</hi> and
<hi>Medium</hi> of it. These Sacrifices we are told,
p. 101. <hi>did not owe their Original unto any
Divine Institution, but were made choice of by
good men as a fit way of imitating the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
resentments of their minds.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone, as far as I can find, fixed on
to firm this Assertion is, that those who
teach the contrary, and say that this <hi>Mode
of Worship was commanded,</hi> do <hi>say so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof, or evidence.</hi> Our Author, for the
most part, sets off his Assertions at no less
rate than as such, without whose admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
all Order, and Government, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every thing that is Good amongst
mankind, would be ruined and destroyed.

And though the Instance be ill laid
and not proved, yet the general Rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
unto the <hi>Religion of Sinners,</hi> is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
easily to be evicted. For as in Christian
Religion we have a Sacrifice that
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as to its Efficacy, alwayes
<hi>newly offered, and living;</hi> so before the
Personal Offering of it in the body of
Chirst, there was no season or Age, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due Representation of it in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<hi>Typical,</hi> and of <hi>Mystical</hi> signification.
And although there be no express mention
in the Scripture of their Institution, (for
<hi>these are ancient things</hi>) yet there is as
good warrant for it, as for Offering, and
burning Incense only with Sacred fire taken
from the Altar, which was of an Heavenly
traduction; for a neglect whereof the Priests
were consumed with fire from before the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58629:139"/>
Lord; that is, though an express command
be not recorded for their Institution and
Observation, yet enough may be collected
from the Scripture that they were of a
Divine Extract, and Original. And if
they were arbitrary Inventions of some
men, I desire to have a rational account
given me of their <hi>Catholicism</hi> in the World;
and one Instance more of any thing not
Natural, or Divine, that ever prevailed to
such an absolute universal acceptance
amongst Mankind. It is not so safe, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to assign an arbitrary Original, unto
any thing that hath obtained an universal
Consent and Suffrage; lest men be thought
to set their own houses on fire, on purpose
to consume their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Besides, no tolerable colour can be given
to the Assertion, that they were the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good men. The first <hi>notice</hi> we have
of them, is, in those of <hi>Cain and Abel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one was a <hi>bad man,</hi> and of the <hi>Evil
One,</hi> and yet must be looked on as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Inventor of Sacrifices, if this fiction
be allowed. Some of the Antients indeed
thought, that <hi>Adam</hi> Sacrificed the <hi>Beasts</hi> to
God, whose <hi>Skins his first Garments</hi> were
made of; and if so, he was very pregnant and
sudden in his invention, if he had no directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God. But more than all this, <hi>bloody
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:58629:140"/>
Sacrifices</hi> were Types of Christ from the
Foundation of the World; and <hi>Socinus</hi>
himself, who, and his followers are the
principal Assertors of this <hi>paradox,</hi> grants
that Christ is called the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> with
respect unto the Sacrifices of old, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law; As He is termed <hi>A Lamb slain
from the Foundation of the World,</hi> not only
with respect unto the Efficacy of his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
but to the Typical Representation of it.
And he that shall deny, that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in
their Sacrifices had respect unto the <hi>promised
Seed,</hi> will endeavour the shaking of a Pillar
of the Churches Creed. Now I desire to
know how men, by their own Invention, or
Authority, could assign such an end unto their
Sacrifices, if they were not of Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
if not designed of God thereunto.</p>
            <p>Again; the Apostle tells us, <hi>Abel offered
his Sacrifice by Faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. And Faith
hath respect unto the Testimony or God,
revealing, commanding, and promising to
accept our duty. Wherever any thing
is done in Faith, there an Assent is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to this, <hi>that God is True,</hi> Joh. 3. 33. And
what it doth, is thereby distinguished from
Will-Worship, that is resolved into the
Commandments, and Doctrines of men,
which whoso rest on, <hi>make void the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God,</hi> Matth. 15. 3, 6. And the Faith
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:58629:140"/>
of <hi>Abel</hi> as to its general Nature was the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not seen, and the Substance of
things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. which in this
matter it could not be, if it had neither
Divine Command, nor Promise to rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is evident therefore that Sacrifices
were of a divine <hi>Original;</hi> and the Instance
in them to prove, that the Outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God hath in all Ages been left unto
the Prudence, and Management of men, is
feeble, and such as will give no countenance
unto what it is produced in the Justification
of; And herewith the whole Discourse of
our Author on this Subject falls to the
ground, where I shall at present let it lye,
though it might in sundry Particulars be
easily crumbled into useless Asseverations,
and some express Contradictions.</p>
            <p>In the close of this Chapter, an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made, of what hath been before ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued,
or rather dictated, unto a particular
Controversie about <hi>significant Ceremonies.</hi>
I am not willing to engage in any Contests
of that Nature; seeing, to the due
handling of them, a greater length of
Discourse would be necessary, than I think
meet at present to draw forth this <hi>Survey</hi>
unto. Only seeing a very few words, may
serve to manifest the loosness of what is here
Discoursed, to that purpose, I shall

venter on the Patience of <hi>the Reader</hi> wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
an addition of them. We have therefore
in the first place, a Reflection on <hi>the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Impertinency of the clamour against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Institution of significant Ceremonies, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is the only use of Ceremonies, as all other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Expressions of Religion, to be Significan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
I do somewhat admire at the Temper of
this Author, who cannot express his disser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
from others, in Controverted Points of the
Meanest and Lowest concernment, but
with crying out <hi>Prodigies, Clamours, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies,</hi>
and the like Expressions of
Astonishment in himself, and Contempt
of others. He might reserve some of
these great Words for more important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.
But yet I joyn with him thus fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in what he pleads; that Ceremonies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the Worship of God, that <hi>art
not significant,</hi> are things very <hi>insignificant;</hi>
and such as deserve not the least conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about them. He truly also in the
next words tells us, that all <hi>outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is a sign of inward Honour.</hi> It is so;
both in Civil things, and Sacred. All our
Questionis, How these <hi>instituted Ceremonies</hi>
come to be significant, and what it is they
signifie, and whether it be lawful to assign
a significancy to them in the Worship of
God, when indeed they have none, of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58629:141"/>
kind intended? To free us from any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
herein he informs us, p. 108. <hi>That all
the Magistrates power of instituting significant
Ceremonies, amounts to no more, than a power
of determining what shall, or what shall not,
be visible signs of honour, and this can be no
Vsurpation upon the Consciences of men.</hi>
This is new Language, and such as we have
not formerly been used unto in the <hi>Church
of England;</hi> namely, That of the <hi>Magistrates
Instituting Significant Ceremonies;</hi> It was of
old, the Churches appointing Ceremonies
for decency and Order. But all the Terms
of that Assertion are now <hi>metamorphosed;</hi>
The <hi>Church</hi> into the <hi>Magistrates; Appointing,</hi>
which respects exercise, into <hi>Institution,</hi>
which respects the nature of the thing,
and hath a singular use and sense in this
matter (or let them pass for the same)
and <hi>Order and decency,</hi> into Ceremonies <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.</hi>
These things were indeed implyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but not so fully and plainly expressed
or avowed. But the honour here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this matter, is the honour, which is
given to God in his Worship. This is the
honour of Faith, Love, Fear, Obedience
spiritual, and holy, in Jesus Christ. To
say that the Magistrate hath power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
visible signs of this honour, to be
observed in the outward Worship of God,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:58629:142"/>
is upon the matter to say that he hath
power to institute new <hi>Sacraments;</hi> for so
such things would be. And to say what
neither is, nor can be proved, nor is here
either <hi>Logically,</hi> or any way <hi>regularly,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
so to be.</p>
            <p>The Compiring of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and
their signification, with <hi>words</hi> and their sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
will not relieve our Author in
this matter. Some things are naturally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
of one another; so Effects are of
Causes; so is Smoke of Fire; and such
were the Signes of the Weather mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 2, 3. Thus
I suppose Ceremonies are not significant;
they do not <hi>Naturally</hi> signifie the things
whereunto they are applyed; for if they
did, there would be no need of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
And they are here said to be
<hi>instituted by the Magistrate.</hi> Again; there
are Customary Signes, some it may be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
many <hi>Topical,</hi> that have prevailed
by Custome, and Usage, to signifie such
things, as they have no absolute Natural
Coherence with, or Relation unto; such
are <hi>putting off the Hat</hi> in sign of Reverence,
with others innumerable. And both these
sorts of Signs, may have some use about the
Service, and Worship of God, as might be
manifested in Instances. But the Signes
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58629:142"/>
we enquire after, are voluntary, arbitrary
and <hi>instituted</hi> as our Author confesseth; for
we do not treat of appointing some <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
for order and decency,</hi> which our <hi>Canons</hi>
take notice of, but of <hi>instituting Ceremonies
for Signification,</hi> such as neither naturally,
nor meerly by Custome and Usage, come
to be significant, but only by Vertue of their
Institution. Now concerning these one
Rule may be observed; namely, that they
cannot be of one kind, and signifie things of
another, by vertue of any command, and
consent of men, unless they have an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority both over the sign, and thing
signified, and can change their Natures, or
Create a new Relation between them. To
take therefore things Natural, that are Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Visible, and appoint them to be
Signs not Natural, nor Civil, nor Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but <hi>Mystical</hi> of things Spiritual, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
Inward, and Invisible, and, as such,
to have them observed in the Church, or
Worship of God, is a thing which is not as
yet proved to be Lawfull; signifie thus
naturally they never can, seeing there is no
natural Relation between them; Civilly,
or by Consent they do not so; for they are
things <hi>Sacred,</hi> which they are supposed to
signifie; and are so far from signifying by
consent, that those, who plead for their
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:58629:143"/>
Signification, do not agree wherein it doth
consist. They must therefore signifie so
<hi>Mystically,</hi> and Spiritually; and <hi>Signa, cum
ad res Divinas pertinent, sunt Sacramenta,</hi>
sayes <hi>Austin;</hi> these things are Sacraments;
And when men can give Mystical, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Efficacy to any of their own Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
when they can make a Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such Signes, and the things signified
by them; when they can make that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and instructing in spiritual things, and
the Worship of God, which he hath not
made so, nor appointed, blessed, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to that end; when they can bind
Gods Promises of Assistance, and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to their own Inventions; when they
can advance what they will into the same
rank, and <hi>Series</hi> of things in the Worship
of God, with the Sacrifices of old, or other
parts of instituted Worship introduced into
the Church by Gods Command, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with his promise of gracious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
then and not before may they
institute the <hi>significant Ceremonies</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for. <hi>Words,</hi> it is true, are Signs of
things; and those of a mixed Nature; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Natural, partly by Consent. But they are
not of one kind, and signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for, say the <hi>Schoolmen, where words are
Signs of Sacred things, they are Signs of them
as Things, but not as Sacred.</hi>

            <p>IN the fourth Chapter we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern;
The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> whose Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he hath undertaken, as it is in it self
false, so it is rather suited to promote
what he aims at, than what he opposeth;
And the principles which himself proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

not to be <hi>borrowed from</hi> his, and those
which are here confuted. And thence it is
that the foundations, which he layes
down in the entrance of this discourse,
are as destructive of his own pretensions,
as of those, against which they are by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
improved. For it is granted, and assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, that there are Actions, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in, and about which, the Consciences of
men are not to be obliged by humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but have an antecedent Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on them from the Authority of God
himself; <hi>So that disobedience unto the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
commands of humane Authority is no sin, but
an indispensible Duty;</hi> And although he seems
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58629:144"/>
at first to restrain things of this nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things natural, and of an essential Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;

Gospel,</hi> which is a matter of meer and purr
Revelation: And hereon he adds, The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
and adequate reason of this exemption
of Conscience from humane Authority, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
obligation unto duty, before its considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without it, and against it, which is, not
because Subjects are in any thing free from
the Authority of the Supream power on earth,
but because they are Subject to a Superiour i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Heaven, and they are then only excused from
the Duty of obedience to their Soveraign, when
they cannot give it without rebellion against
God; so that it is not originally any right of
their own, that exempts them from a Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Soveraign power in all things, but it
is purely Gods right of governing his own
Creatures, that Magistrates then invade, when
they make Edicts to violate, or controll His
Laws.</p>
            <p>It is about Religion, and the Worship
of God that we are discoursing; Now in
these things no man ever thought that it
was originally a right of Subjects, as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
abstracting from the Consideration of
the Authority of God, that should exempt
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58629:144"/>
them from a subjection to the Soveraign
Power. For though some of the Antients
discourse at large, that it is of <hi>natural Right
and Equity,</hi> that every one should Worship
God as he would himself, yet they found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Equity in the nature of God, and
the Authority of his Commands. This
Exemption then ariseth merely, as our
Author observes, because they are subject
to a Superiour Power in Heaven, which
excuseth them from the Duty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Superiours on Earth, when
they cannot give it without Rebellion
against God; whence it undeniably follows
that that Supream Power in Heaven hath
exempted these things from all inferiour
Powers on earth. Extend this now unto
all things wherein men have, and ought
to have a regard unto that <hi>Superiour Power
in Heaven,</hi> as it must be extended, or the
whole is ridiculous, (for that heavenly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
is made the formall reason of the
exemption here granted,) and all that our
Author hath been so earnestly contending
for in the preceeding Chapters, falls to the
ground. For no man pleads exemption
from subjection unto, yea from giving
active obedience unto the Authority, and
Commands of the Magistrate, even in things
Religious, but merely on the account of

his subjection to the Authority of God
Heaven; and, where this is so, he is set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>A Survey of the Fifth
Chapter.</head>
            <p>THe fifth Chapter is at such variance
with it self, and what is elsewhere
dictated in the Treatise, that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no small labour, to make any tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
composition of things between them.
This I shall not engage in, as not being of
my present concernment. What seems to
tend unto the carrying on of the design of
the whole, may be called unto some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
In the beginning of it, he tells us
that <hi>a belief of the indifferency or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture
of all Religions; is made the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
not to say the most fashionable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for liberty of Conscience.</hi> For my part,
I never read, I never heard of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58629:145"/>
or Argument, to be used to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
It wants no such defence. Nay the
principle it self, seems to me, to be suited
directly to oppose and overthrow it. For if
there be no such thing in reality as <hi>Religion</hi>
in the World, it is certainly a very foolish
thing, to have differences perpetuated
amongst men upon the account of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which without a supposition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is nothing but a vain and empty
name: But hence our Author takes occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to discourse of the use of Religion
and Conscience in the Government of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the World; and proves in many
words, that <hi>Conscience unto God, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to future eternal rewards or punishments,
is the great ligament of humane Society, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of Government, the strongest bond of
Laws, and only support of Rule, without
which every man would first and last, be
guided by mere self Interest, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all power and Authority to meer force
and violence.</hi> To this purpose doth he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
at large in <hi>one</hi> section of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
And in <hi>another,</hi> with no less earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Elegancy of Words, and Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of various Expressions of the same
signification, that the <hi>use and exercise of
conscience, will certainly overthrow all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and fill the world with confusion.</hi> In like

            <p>Nor can I find much of that Importance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in the third and fourth paragraphs of this
Declamatory Invective. It is evident
whom he regards and reflects upon, and
with what false, unmanly, unchristian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,
he indeavours to traduce them. He
would have the world believe, that there
is a Generation of men, <hi>whose principles of
Religion teach them to be proud, peevish,
malicious, spightful, envious, turbulent, boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous,
seditious,</hi> and what ever is evil in
the world; when others are <hi>all for can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
moderation and ingenuity;</hi> amongst
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58629:146"/>
whom no doubt he reckons himself for
one, and gives in this Discourse in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
thereof. But what are these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Articles of mens belief,</hi> which
dispose them inevitably to all the <hi>villanies</hi>
that our Author could find names for.
A catalogue of them he gives us, pag. 147,
148. Saith he, <hi>what if they believe that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are but the Executioners of the decrces of
the presbitery; and that in case of disobe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience
to their Spiritual Governours, they
may be excommunicated, and by consequence
deposed? What if they believe that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is founded in Grace, and therefore all
wicked Kings forfeit their Crowns, and
that it is in the power of the People of God to
bestow them where they please? And what if
others believe that to pursue their successes in
Villany and Rebellion is to follow Providence?</hi>
All the World knows what it is, that hath
given him the Advantage of providing a
covering, for these monstrous fictions; and
an account thereof hath been given else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
And what now if those intended
do <hi>not believe</hi> these things, nor any one of
them? What if they do openly disavow
every one of them, as for ought I ever
heard or know they do, and as I do my
self? What if some of them, are ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
framed into Articles of faith, from the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58629:147"/>
supposed practices of some individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?
And what if men be of never so vile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
opinions about the <hi>pursuit of their successes,</hi>
so they have none to countenance them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any unlawful Enterprises, which I think
must go before successes? What if only
the <hi>Papists</hi> be concerned in these Articles of
faith; and they only in one of them about
the Excommunication and Deposition
of Princes, and that only some of them;
and not one of those have any concern in
them, whom he intends to reproach? I say
if these things are so, we need look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the principles of that Religion,
which hath furnished him with all this
candor, moderation and ingenuity, and hath
wrought him to such a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
temper, by teaching him that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Charity and Meekness, which here
bewray themselves</p>
            <p>Let it be granted, as it must and ought
to be, that all Principles of the minds of
men, pretended to be from Apprehensions
of Religion, that are in themselves incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with any Lawful Government, in
any place what ever, ought to be coerced,
and restrained. For our Lord Jesus
Christ, sending his Gospel to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and published in all Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the World, then, and at all times,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58629:147"/>
under various sorts of Governments, all for
the same end of publick Tranquility and
Prosperity, did propose nothing in it, but
what a Submission and Obedience unto,
might be consistent with the Government
it self, of what sort soever it were. He
came, as they used to sing of old, <hi>to give
men an Heavenly Kingdom, and not to deprive
them, or take from them their earthly tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dominions.</hi> There is therefore nothing
more certain, than that there is no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Religion taught by Jesus Christ,
which either in it self, or in the practice of
it, is inconsistent with any Righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
on the Earth. And if any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
can truly and really be manifested
so to be, I will be no Advocate for them,
nor their Abettors. But such as these, our
Author shall never be able justly to affix
on them whom he opposeth; nor the least
umbrage of them; if he do but allow the
Gospel, and the power of Christ to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
those Spiritual Ordinances, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
their Administration, which do
not, which cannot extend unto any thing
wherein a Magistrate as such, hath the
least concernment in point of prejudice.
For if on a false, or undue practice of
them, any thing should be done, that is not
purely spiritual, or that being done, should
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58629:148"/>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58629:148"/>
from the entring of Christianity
into the World to this very day, as will
admit of no Competition with all those
together, which on any account or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
have produced the like effects. This
it was, and is, that hath soaked the Earth
with blood, depopulated Nations, ruined
Families, Countrys, Kingdoms, and at
length made innumerable Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the yoke of <hi>Turkish Tyranny,</hi> to
free themselves from their perpetual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
on the account of their dissent
from the Worship publickly established in
the places of their Nativity. And as for
the Humours, Inclinations, and passions of
men, when our Author will give such
Rules and directions, as whereby the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
may know how to make a true and
legal judgement, of who are fit on their
account, to live in his Territories, and
who are not, I suppose there will not be
any contest about them; until then, we may
leave them as here displayed and set up by
our Author, for every one to cast a cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
at them, that hath a mind thereunto.</p>
            <p>For to what purpose is it to consider the
frequent Occasions he takes, to diseourse
about the ill tempers and humours of men,
or of enveighing against them for being <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,</hi>
and <hi>ungentile, unsociable, peevish, censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:58629:149"/>
with many other terms of reproach,
that do not at present occur to my memory,
nor are doubtless worth the searching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Suppose he hath the Advantage of
a better natural temper, have more sedate
affections, a more complyant humour, be
more remote from giving or receiving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
and have learned the wayes of
Courtly deportment, only was pleased to
vail them all and every one, in the writing
of this Discourse; is it meet that they
should be persecuted and destroyed, be
esteemed Seditious and I know not what,
because they are of a natural temper not
so disposed to Affability and sweetness of
Conversation as some others are? For my
part, I dislike the humour and temper of
mind characterised by our Author, it may
be as much as he; I am sure, I think, as
much as I ought. But to make it a matter
of such huge importance, as solemnly to
introduce it into a Discourse about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and publick Tranquility, will not it
may be, on second thoughts, be esteemed
over considerately done. And it is not
unlikely, but that our Author seems of
as untoward a Composition, and peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
an Humour to them whom he reflects
upon, as they do to him, and that they
satisfie themselves as much in their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58629:149"/>
and deportment, as he doth himself
in his.</p>
            <q>

            <p>
               <hi>Sect. 5. pag.</hi> 155, 156. He inveighs against
the Events that attend the permission of
<hi>different Sects of Religion</hi> in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
And it is not denyed, but that
some inconveniencies may ensue thereon.
But as himself hath well observed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, we do not in these things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what is absolutely best, and what
hath no inconvenience attending it; but
what is the best which in our present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
we can attain unto; and what in
that state answers the Duty that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of us. <hi>Questionless,</hi> it were best
that we should <hi>be all of one mind</hi> in these
things of God; and it is no doubt also
our Duty on all hands to endeavour so to
be. But seeing <hi>de facto,</hi> this is not so, nor
is it in the power of men, when and how
they wil to depose those perswasions of their
minds, and dictates of their Consciences,
from whence it is not so, on the one part
or the other; (although in some
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58629:150"/>
parts of our differences, some may do so
and will not, namely in things acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be of no necessity antecedent to
their imposition; and some would do so
and cannot,) It is now enquired, what is
the best way to be steer'd in, for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of the desired end of peace
and Tranquility for the <hi>future;</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
love, quietness and mutual use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
at <hi>present</hi> amongst men. Two ways
are proposed to this purpose; the one is
to exercise mutual forbearance to each
other, whilst we are inevitably under the
power of different perswasions in these
things, producing no practices that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
injurious unto private men in their
rights, or hurtful unto the State, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace; endeavouring in the mean
time, by the evidence of Truth, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
suited unto it, to win upon each
other to a consent and Agreement in the
things wherein we differ. The other is,
by Severe Laws, Penalties, outward force,
as Imprisonments, Mulcts, Fines, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Capital punishments, to compell
all men out of hand, to an uniformity of
practice, whatever their judgements be to
the contrary. Now as the state of things
is amongst us, which of these wayes is
most suitable to the Law of our Being
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58629:150"/>
and Creation, the best Principles of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man, and those which have the
most evident Resemblance of Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
the Gospel, the Spirit and Letter
of it, with the mind of its Author our
Lord Jesus Christ, which is most condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to attain the end aimed at, in wayes
of a natural and genuine complyance with
the things themselves of Religion, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Divine Worship, is left unto the
judgement of God, and all good men.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, if men will make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
upon their own surmises, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and suspitions of things which are
either so indeed, that is really surmized,
or pretended to be so for some private
interests or advantages of their own, which
no man can answer or remove; if they
may fancy at their pleasure Ghosts, Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
Fiends, walking Sprights, Seditions,
Drums, Trumpets, Armies, Bears, and Tigers;
Every difference in Religion, be it never
so small, be the agreement amongst them
that differ, never so great, be it the visible,
known, open interest of them that dissent
from what is established, to live quietly
and peaceably, and to promote the good
of the Commonwealth wherein they live;
do they profess that it is their duty, their
Principle, their Faith, and Doctrine, to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58629:151"/>
obey constantly their Rulers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in all things, not contrary to the
mind of God, and pretend no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of his, as should interfere in the
least with their power in order to publick
tranquility; do they offer all the security
of their Adherence to such declared Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as mankind is necessitated to be
contented and satisfied with, in things of
their highest concernment; do they avow
an especial sense of the Obligation that is
put upon them by their Rulers, when
they are protected in peace; have they no
concernment in any such Political Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Combinations, Interests, as might
alone give countenance unto any such
disturbance; all is one, every different
<hi>Opinion is Press-money, and every Sect is an
Army,</hi> although they be all and every one
of them Protestants, of whom alone we
do discourse. Other answer therefore I
shall not return unto this part of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
arguing, than what he gave of
old.</p>

            <p>Only, I may add, that sundry of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
our Author makes use of, are false,
and unduly alledged. For what is here
charged on differences in and about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in reference unto publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
might have been, yea and was charged
on <hi>Christian Religion</hi> for three hundred
years, and is so by many still on <hi>Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
as such; and that it were a very easie
and facile task, to set out the pernicious
evills of a compelled Agreement in the
practice of Religion, and those not <hi>fancied</hi>
only or feigned, but such as do follow it,
have followed it, and will follow it in the
world.</p>
            <p>An enquiry in this Invective, tending to
evince its reasonableness is offered, in
<hi>pag.</hi> 158. namely, <hi>Where there are divided
Interests in Religion in the same Kingdom, it
is asked how shall the Prince behave himself
towards them.</hi> The answer thereunto is
not I confess easie, because it is not easie
to be understood, what is intended by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Interests in Religion.</hi> We will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay that aside, and consider what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
is amongst us, or may be according to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58629:152"/>
what we understand by these expressions.
Suppose then, that in the same profession
of Protestant Religion, some different way
and Observances in the outward Worship
of God should be allowed, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned herein have no other, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved to have any other interest
with respect unto Religion, but to <hi>fear
God and honour the King;</hi> it is a very easie
thing to return an Answer to this enquiry.
For not entring into the profound Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Speculation of our Author, about <hi>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
of Parties, or siding with this or that
Party,</hi> where the differences themselves
constitute no distinct Parties, in reference
to Civil Government and publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility;
let the Prince openly avow by
the declaration of his judgement, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice, his establishing of Legal
Rights, disposing of publick favours in
places and preferments, that way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which himself owns and approves;
and let him indulge and protect others of
the same Religion, for the substance of it
with what himself professeth, in the quiet
and peaceable exercise of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in the Worship of God, keeping all
Dissenters within the bounds allotted to
them, that none transgress them to the
invasion of the Rights of others; and he
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58629:152"/>
may have both the Reality, and Glory of
Religion, Righteousness, Justice, and all
other Royal Vertues which will render him
like to him whose Vice-gerent he is; and
will undoubtedly reap the blessed fruits of
them, in the industry, peaceableness, and
Loyalty of all his Subjects whatever.</p>
            <p>There are sundry things in the close of
this Chapter objected against such a course
of proceedure; but those such, as are
all of them resolved into a supposition,
that they who in any place or part of the
world, desire <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> for the
Worship of God, have indeed no Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at all. For it is thereon supposed
without further evidence, that they will
thence fall into all wicked and unconsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
practices. I shall make, as I said,
no reply to such surmises. <hi>Christianity</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
under them for many Ages. <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi>
hath done so in sundry places for
many years. And those who now may do
so, must as they did, bear the effects of
them as well as they are able. Only I
shall say, First, Whatever is of real incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
in this pretension, on the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Liberty of Conscience, is no way
removed by taking away all different
practices, unless ye could also obliterate

Tranquility is, and will be as well secured

Chapter.</head>
            <p>THE sixth Chapter in this Discourse,
which is the last that at the present I
shall call to any account, (as being now
utterly wearied with the frequent occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the same things in various dresses;)
is designed to the confutation of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is termed the <hi>Foundation of all
Puritanism,</hi> and that wherein <hi>the Mysterie of
it</hi> consisteth. Now this is, that <hi>nothing
ought to be established in the Worship of God, but
what is authorised by some Precept or Example
in the Word of God, which is the compleat and
adequate Rule of Worship.</hi> Be it so, that this
Principle is by some allowed, yea contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for. It will not be easie to affix a guilt
upon them, on the account of its being so;
For, lay aside prejudics, corrupt interests,
and passions, and I am perswaded that at
the first view, it will not seem to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
unto what is in an hundred places
declared and taught in the Scripture. And
certainly a man must be Master of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58629:155"/>
projections, who can foresee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
the evil, confusion and desolation in the
World, which our Author hath found

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
tance. It hath, I confess, been former
disputed with colourable Arguments, Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
tences and Instances, on the one side and
the other; and variously stated among<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
and with diverse limitations. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of our Author is, that whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Apprehensions, must present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
confusion into the World. Such huge
weight hath he wonted himself to lay o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the smallest different conceptions of the
minds of men, where his own are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
throned. Particularly it is contended
that there can be no Peace in any Churche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
or States, whilest this Principle is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
when it is easily demonstrable, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
without the admittance of it, as to its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and principal End, all peace and
agreement among Churches are utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
The like also may be said of
States, which indeed are not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, any farther, than as it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
means of their Peace and Security,
where it is embraced; and that which
would reduce Rulers to a Stability of
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:58629:155"/>
mind in these things, after they have been
tossed up and down with the various sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of men, striving every one to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
their own Imaginations. But seeing it
is pretended and granted to be of so much
importance, I shall, without much regard
to the Exclamations of this Author, and
the reproachful contemptuous expressions,
which without stint or measure he poures
out upon the Assertors of it, consider both
what is the concern of his present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
in it, and what is to be thought of
the Principle it self; so submiting the
whole to the judgement of the candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Only I must add one thing to the
Position, without which it is not maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any of those, with whom he hath
to do; which may deliver him from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
the air in his next Assault of it;
and this is, That nothing ought to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in the Worship of God, <hi>as a part
of that Worship,</hi> or made constantly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in its Observance, without the warranty
before-mentioned; for this is expresly
contended for by them, who maintain it;
and who reject nothing upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of it, but what they can prove to be
a pretended part of Religious Worship as
such. And, as thus laid down, I shall give
some further account both of the Principle
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:58629:156"/>
it self, and of the interest of the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi>
in it; because both it and they are
together here reproached.</p>
            <p>What then I say is the true sense and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of that which our Author design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to oppose, according to the mind of them
who assert it; how impotent his attempts
against it are for its removal, shall briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
be declared. In the mean time I cannot
but, in the first place, tell him, that if by
any means this Principle truly stated, as to
the Expression wherein it is before laid
down, and the formal Terms whereof it
consisteth, should be shaken, or rendred
dubious, yet that the way will not be
much the plainer, or clearer, for the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of his pretensions. There are yet
other general <hi>maxims,</hi> which <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi>
adhere unto, and suppose not justly
questionable, which they can firmly stand
and build upon in the management of their
Plea, as to all differences between him and
them. And because, it may be, he is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with them, I shall reckon over
some of them for his Information. And
they are these that follow.</p>
            <p>1. That whatever the Scripture hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
prescribed, and appointed to be done,
and observed in the Worship or God, and
the government of the Church, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58629:156"/>
to be done and observed. This, they
suppose, will not be opposed: at least they
do not yet know, notwithstanding any
thing spoken or disputed in this Discourse,
any pretences, on which it may honestly
so be. It is also, as I think, secured, <hi>Matth.</hi>
28. 20.</p>
            <p>2. That nothing in Conjunction with,
nothing as an Addition or Supplement unto
what is so appointed, ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if it be contrary either to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rules, or particular preceptive Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Scripture. And this also, I
suppose, will be granted: and if it be not
freely, some are ready by Arguments to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
the confession of it from them that
shall deny it.</p>
            <p>3. That nothing ought to be joyned with,
or added unto, what in the Scripture is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and appointed in these things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some Cogent Reason, making such
Conjunction: or Addition necessary. Of
what necessity may accrue unto the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of such things, by their prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we do not now dispute: but at present
only desire to see the necessity of: their
prescription. And this can be nothing,
but some defect in Substance or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
matter or manner, kind or form, in
the Institutions mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58629:157"/>
as to their proper ends. Now whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Reasons assigned unto any Additional pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
in the Worship of God unto
what is revealed in the Scripture, rendring
the matter of those prescriptions antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
necessary and reasonable.</p>
            <p>4. That if any thing or things in this
kind, shall be found necessary, to be added
and prescribed, then that and those alone
be so, which are most consonant unto the
general Rules of the Scripture, given as
for our Guidance in the Worship of God,
and the nature of those Institutions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
wherewith they are conjoyned, or
whereunto they are added. And this also
I suppose to be a reasonable Request, and
such as will be granted by all men, who
dare not advance their own Wills and
Wisdom above or against the Will and
Wisdom of God.</p>
            <p>5. Now if, as was said, the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
before-mentioned, should by any
means be duly removed, or could be so; if
intangled or rendred dubious; yet as far
as I can learn, the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> will be
very far from supposing the matters in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58629:157"/>
between them and their Adversaries,
to be concluded. But as they look upon
their concernments to be absolutely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
in the Principles now mentioned,
all which they know to be true, and hope
to be unquestionable: so the truth is,
there is by this Author very small occasion
administred unto any thoughts of quitting
the former more general <hi>Thesis</hi> as rightly
stated; but rather, if his Ability be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
measure of the merit of his cause,
there is a strong confirmation given unto
it in the minds of considering men, from
the Impotency and Succeslesness of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
made upon it. And that this may
appear to the indifferent Readers Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I shall so far divert in this place
from the pursuit of my first design, as to State
the Principle aright, and briefly to call the
present Opposition of it, unto a new account.</p>
            <p>The summ in general, of what this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
opposeth with so much clamour is,
<hi>That Divine Revelation is the sole Rule of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Religious Worship;</hi> an Assertion, that
in its latitude of expression, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in, and by, all Nations and
People. The very Heathen admitted it
of old, as shall be manifested, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
by instances sufficient. For though
they framed many Gods in their foolish
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58629:158"/>
darkened imaginations, yet they thought,
that every one of them would be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
according to his own mind, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and prescription. So did, and,
think do, Christians generally believe: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some have a mind to pare this generally
avowed Principle, to curb it, and order it
so by distinctions and restrictions, that it
may serve their turn, and consist with their
interest. For an opposition unto it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
directly and expresly, few have had
the confidence yet to make. And the
Non-Conformists need not go one step far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in the expression of their Judgements
and Principles in this matter. For who
shall compell them to take their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
distinctions, (which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and used by the most Learned of
them) of, <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>accidental; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
and <hi>reductive; primitive</hi> and <hi>accessary;
direct</hi> and <hi>consequential; intrinsick</hi> and <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial</hi>
Worship, and the like, for the
most part unintelligible terms in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
into the state of the question?
If men have a mind, let them oppose this
<hi>Thesis</hi> as laid down, if not, let them let it
alone: and they, who shall undertake the
confirmation of it, will, no doubt, carry it
through the briets of those unscriptural
distinctions. And that this Author may
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58629:158"/>
be the better instructed in his future work,
I shall give him a little farther account of
the terms of the Assertion laid down.</p>
            <p>Revelation is either <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and containeth every discovery or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that God hath made of himself, or
of his mind and will, unto men. Thus it is
comprehensive of that concreated Light,
which is in all men, concerning him and his
Will. For although we say, that this is
natural; and is commonly <hi>contra</hi>-distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
to Revelation properly so called,
which for perspicuity sake we call Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
supernatural; yet whereas it doth
not so necessarily accompany humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but that it may be separated from it;
not is it educed out of our natural faculties
by their own native or primigenial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
but is, or was distinctly implanted in
them by God himself; I place it under the
general head of Revelation. Hence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is certainly from God, by the Light
of Nature and Instinct thereof declared so
to be, is no less a certain Rule of Worship
and Obedience, so far forth as it is from
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m, and concerneth those things, than any
thing that comes from him by express vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Revelation. And this casts out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
a vain exception, wherewith
some men please themselves; as though the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58629:159"/>
men of this Opinion, denyed the Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of what is from God, and by the
Light of Nature discovered to be his
mind and will. Let them once prove any
thing in contest between them and their
Adversaries to be required, prescribed,
exacted or made necessary by the Light of
Nature, as the Will of God revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and I will assure them, that as to my
concern, there shall be an end of all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
about it. But yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I may adde
a little farther light into the sense of the
Non-Conformists in this matter; I say,</p>
            <p>1. That this inbred Light of Reason
guides unto nothing at all in or about the
Worship of God, but what is more fully,
clearly and directly taught and declared in
the Scripture. And this may easily be
evinced, as from the untoward mixture of
darkness and Corruption, that is befallen
our primigenial i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bred Principles of Light
and Wisdom, by the entrance of sin; so
also from the end of the Scripture it self;
which was to restore that knowledge of
God and his mind, which was lost by sin;
and which might be as useful to man in his
lapsed condition, as the other was in his
pure and uncorrupted estate. At present
therefore, I shall leave this Assertion, in
expectation of some instance, in matters
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58629:159"/>
great or small, to the contrary, before I
suppose it be obnoxious to question or
dispute.</p>
            <p>2. As there can be no Opposition, nor
contradiction, between the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and inspired Vocal or Scriptural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
because they are both from God:
So if in any instance, there should appear any
such thing unto us, neither Faith nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can rest in that which is pretended to
be <hi>natural Light,</hi> but must betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for their resolution unto express
Revelation. And the reason hereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
because nothing is <hi>natural light,</hi> but
what is common to all men; and where it
is denyed, it is frustrated as to its ruling
Efficacy. Again, it is mixed, as we said
before; and it is not every mans work to
separate the Chaffe from the Wheat; or
what God hath implanted in the mind of
man when he <hi>made him upright,</hi> and what is
since soaked into the Principles of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from <hi>his own inventions.</hi> But this
case may possibly very rarely fall out, and
so shall not much be insisted on.</p>
            <p>3. Our enquiry in our present contest,
is solely about <hi>Instituted Worship,</hi> which we
believe to depend on supernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
the light of Nature can no way
relieve or guide us in it or about it,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58629:160"/>
because it refers universally to things
above, and beyond that light: but only
with reference unto those Moral, Natural
Circumstances, which appertain unto those
actings or actions of men, whereby it is
performed; which we willingly submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its guidance and direction.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Vocal Revelation</hi> hath come under
two considerations: First, As it was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional.
Secondly, As it became stated.</p>
            <p>First, As it was occasional. For a long
time God was pleased to guide his Church
in many concerns of his Worship, by fresh
occasional Revelations; even from the
giving of the first promise unto <hi>Adam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the solemn giving of the Law by <hi>Moses.</hi>
For although men had in process of time
many <hi>stated Revelations,</hi> that were preserved
by Tradition among them; as the first
Promise; the Institution of Sacrifices, and
the like: yet as to sundry emergencies of
his Worship, and parts of it, God guided
them by new Occasional Revelations. Now
those Revelations being not recorded in
the Scripture, as being only for present or
emergent use; we have no way to know
them, but by what those, to whom God
was pleased so to reveal himself, did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise;
and which, on good testimony found
acceptance with him. Whatever they so
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58629:160"/>
did, they had especial Warranty from God
for; which is the case of the great Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Sacrifices it self. It is a sufficient
Argument that they were Divinely insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
because they were graciously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<hi>Vocal Revelation</hi> as the Rule of
Worship, became stated and invariable, in
and by the giving and writing of the Law.
From thence, with the allowances before
mentioned, we confine it to the Scripture,
and so unto all succeeding generations.
I confess many of our company, who kept
to us hitherto in granting Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to be the sole Principle and Rule of
Religious Worship, now leave us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to paths of their own.
The <hi>Postmisnicall Jews,</hi> after many attempts
made that way by their Predecessors, both
before and after the Conversation of our
Lord Christ in the flesh, at length took up
a resolution, that all obligatory Divine
Revelation was not contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
but was partly preserved by <hi>Orall
Tradition.</hi> For although they added a
multitude of Observances, unto what were
prescribed unto their Fathers by <hi>Moses:</hi>
yet they would never plainly forego that
Principle, nor do to this day; that <hi>Divine
Revelation is the Rule of Divine Worship.</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:58629:161"/>
Wherefore to secure their Principle and
practice, and to reconcile them together,
(which are indeed at an unspeakable vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
they have fancied their <hi>Oral Law;</hi>
which they assert to be of no less certain
and Divine Original, than the Law that is
written. On this pretence they plead, that
they keep themselves unto the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Principle, under the Superstition of
a multitude of self-invented observances.
The <hi>Papists</hi> also here leave us; but still
with a semblance of adhering to that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which carryes so great and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable
an evidence with it, as that
there are very few as was said, who have
hitherto risen up in a direct and open
opposition unto it. For whereas they have
advanced a double Principle for the Rule
of Religious Worship, besides the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
namely Tradition, and the present
Determinations of their Church, from
thence educed; they assert the first to be
Divine or Apostolical, which is all one;
and the latter to be accompanyed with
<hi>Infallibility,</hi> which is the formal Reason of
our adherence and submission unto Divine
Revelations. So that they still adhere in
general unto the fore-mentioned Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
however they have debauched it by
their advancement of those other Guides.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58629:161"/>
But herein also, we must do them right;
that they do not absolutely turn loose those
two rude creatures of their own; <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and <hi>present Church determinations,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole face of Religion, to act
therein at their pleasure; but they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from whatever is determined in
the written word; affirming them to take
place only in those things, that are not
<hi>contrary to the Word,</hi> or not condemned in
it. For in such, they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess, they ought
not, nor can take place. Which I doubt
whether our Author will allow of or no,
in reference to the power by him as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</p>
            <p>By
Religious Worship, in the <hi>Thesis</hi>
above, we understand, as was said before,
<hi>instituted Worship only,</hi> and not that which
is purely Moral and Natural; which, in
many instances of it, hath a great coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the light of Nature, as was
before discoursed.</p>
            <p>We understand also the <hi>Solemn or stated
Worship</hi> of the Church of God. That Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I say, which is solemn and stated, for
the Church, the whole Church, at all
times and seasons, according to the rules
of his appointment, is that which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after. Hence in this matter, we
have no concernment in the fact of this or
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58629:162"/>
that particular person, which might be

               </gap> it as such. For it was all still <hi>without.</hi>
Now all those things in or about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, that belonged unto <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
Episcopacy,</hi> that is the ordering and
disposal of things without the Church, but
about it; without Worship, but about it;
we acknowledge to be left unto common
prudence, guided by the general Rules of
Scripture, by which the Church is to walk
and compose its actings. And this wholly
supersedes the Discourse of our Author
concerning the great variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
wherewith all humane actions are
attended. For in one word, all such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
as necessarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attend humane
actions as such, neither are Sacred, nor can
be made so without an express Institution
of God, and are, disposable by humane
Authority. So that the long contest of
our Author on that Head, is altogether
vain. So then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, By all the concernments of
Religious Worship, which any affirm, that
they must be directed by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
or regulated by the Scripture;
they intend all that is Religious, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
belongs to the Worship of God, as
it is Divine Worship: and not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58629:163"/>
unto the actions, wherein and when
by it is performed, as they are actions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That when any part of Worship
is instituted in special, and general Rule
are given for the practice of it <hi>hic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
nunc:</hi> there the Warranty is sufficient fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
its practice at its due seasons; and for those
seasons the nature of the thing it self, with
what it hath respect unto, and the ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of the general Scripture Rules, will give
them an acceptable determination.</p>
            <p>And these few Observations will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
manifest, the impertinency of those
who think it incumbent on any, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Principle before laid down,
to produce express Warranty in words of
Scripture, for every <hi>Circumstance</hi> that doth
attend and belong unto the Actions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Worship of God is performed:
which as they require not; so no such
thing is included in the Principle as duly
stated. For particular circumstances, that
have respect to good order, decency, and
external regulation of Divine Worship,
they are all of them either circumstances
of the Actions themselves, whereby Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship is performed and exercised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so in general they are natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
which in particular, or <hi>actu exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito,</hi>
depend on Moral Prudence; or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58629:163"/>
Rites themselves, added in and to
the whole, or any parts of Divine Service,
which alone in this question come under
enquiry.</p>
            <p>I know there are usually sundry Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
put into this <hi>Thesis,</hi> as before stated
and asserted: and instances to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
are pretended; some whereof are touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 181. which
are not now particularly, and at large
to be considered. But yet because
I am, beyond expectation, engaged in
the Explication of this Principle, I shall
set it so far forth right and straight unto
further examination, as to give in such
general Observations, as, being consistent
with it, and explanatory of it, will serve
to obviate the most of the exceptions that
are laid against it. As,</p>
            <p>1. Where ever in the Scripture we meet
with any Religious duty, that had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Institution, although we find not
expresly a consequent Approbation, we

not to be drawn into Example of giving
the shew-bread promiscuously to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And sundry instances to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are given by our Saviour himself.</p>
            <p>5. There is nothing of any dangerous or
had consequence in this whole controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58629:164"/>
but what lyes in the imposition on mens
practices of the Observation of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Rites, making them necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them in their observation. The things
themselves are said in their own nature,
antecedent to their injunction for practice,
to be indifferent, and indifferent as unto
practice. What hurt would it be to leave
them so? They cannot, say some, be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for such and such Reasons. Are there
then <hi>Reasons:</hi> for their observation besides
their Injuction, and such as on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
whereof they are injoyned? Then
are they indeed necessary in some degree
before their Injunction. For all Reason for
them must be taken from themselves. And
things wholly indifferent have nothing in
themselves one more than another, why
one should be taken, and another left. For
if one have the advantage of another in
the Reasons for its practice, it is no more
indifferent: at least it is not comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so. Granting therefore, things injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be antecedently to their injunction,
equally indifferent in their own nature,
with all other things of the same or the
like kind, which yet are rejected or not
injoyned; and then to give reasons taken
from themselves, their decency, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducingness
to edification, their tendency
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58629:165"/>
to the increase of devotion, their signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
of this or that; is to speak daggers
and contradictions; and to say, a thing is
indifferent before the injuction of its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
but yet if we had thought so, we
would never have enjoyned it; seeing we
do so upon reasons. And without doubt
this making necessary the practice of things
in the worship of God, proclaimed to be
indifferent in themselves, and no way cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for by any antecedent Reason, is an act
of power.</p>
            <p>6. Where things are instituted of God,
and he himself makes an Alteration in, or
of his own Institutions, those Institutions
may be lawfully practised and observed,
untill the mind of God for their Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Abolition be sufficiently revealed,
proposed, and con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irmed unto them that
are concerned in them. For as the making
of a Law doth not oblige, untill, and
without the promulgation of it, so as that
any should offend in not yielding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto it; so upon the Abrogation of
a Law, Obedience may be conscienciously
and without sin yielded unto that Law,
untill the Abrogation, by what act soever
it was made, be notified and confirmed.
An instance hereof we have in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Mosaical Rites,</hi> in the forbearance
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58629:165"/>
of God, after the Law of their instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was enervated, and the Obligation of it
unto obedience really dissolved; at least
the foundation of it laid; for the actual
dissolution of it depended on the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fact, wherein it was founded.</p>
            <p>7. There may be a coincidence of things
performed by sundry persons, at the same
time and in the same place; whereof some
may have respect unto Religious Worishp
directly, and so belong unto it; and others
only occasionally, and so not at all belong
thereunto. As if when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had
been worshipping of their Altars, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had come, and reading the inscription of
one of them, and thence taking occasion
and advantage to preach the <hi>unknown God</hi>
unto them; their Act was a part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Veneration, his presence and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them, and laying hold of that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for his own purpose, was not so.</p>
            <p>8. Many things, which are meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circumstances, requisite unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all Actions in communities
whatever, and so to be ordered by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
according unto general rules of the
word of God, may seem to be <hi>Adjuncts of
Worship,</hi> unless they are followed to their
Original, which will discover them to be
of another nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:58629:166"/>
9. Civil usages and customes observed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
a religious manner, as they are all to be by
them that believe, and directed by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
moral ends, may have a shew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Religious Worship; and so, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the principle before stated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
express institution. But although
they belong unto our living unto God is
general; as do all things that we do, <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether we eat or drink, we are to do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to the glory of God;</hi> and therefore are to be
done in faith; yet they are or may be no
part of instituted worship, but such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of life as in our whole course, we are
to regulate by the rules of the Scripture,
so farr as they afford us guidance there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>10. Many observances in and about the
Worship of God, are recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without especial reflecting any blame
or crime on them, by whom they were
performed; (as many great sins are <hi>histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi>
only related, and left to be judged
by the Rule of the world in other places,
without the least remark of displeasure on
the persons guilty of them,) and that by
such whose Persons were accepted of God;
yea it may be in that very service, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
less or more they failed in their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
God being merciful to them
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58629:166"/>
though not in all things prepared accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the prepartion of the sanctuary;
and yet the things themselves not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
nor justified, but condemned of
God. Such was the fact of <hi>Judas Maccabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
in his offering sacrifices for the sin of
them that were dead; adn that of institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Aniversary feast in commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>dedication of the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This little search have I made into this
great <hi>mystery,</hi> as it is called, of <hi>Puritanism,</hi>
after which so mighty an outcry is raised
by this Author; And if it might be here
further pursued, it would as stated by us
in these general Rules and Explications, be
fully manifested to be a principle in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
admitted, untill of late, by all sorts of
men: Some few only having been forced
sometimes to corrupt it for the security of
some especial interest of their own. And
it were an easie thing to confirm this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the testimonies of the most learned
<hi>Protestant writers,</hi> that have served the
Church in the last ages. But I know how
with many amongst us they are regarded;
and that the citation of some of the most
reverend names among them, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to prejudice and disadvantage the
cause, wherein their witness is produced.
I shall not therefore expose them to the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58629:167"/>
contempt of those, now they are dead,
who would have been unwilling to have
entred the lists with them in any kind of
learning, when they were alive. There is,
in my apprehension, the substance of this
Assertion still retained among the Papists.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself layes it down as the
foundtion of all his controversies; and
indeavours to prove, <hi>Propheticos &amp; Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licos
libros verum esse verbum Dei, &amp; certam
&amp; stabilem regulam fidei. De verbo Dei.
lib. 1. cap. 1. That the Prophetical and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iclal
books, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>are the true word of God, a certain
and stable rule of faith,</hi> wil go a great way in
this matter. For all our Obedience in the
Worship of God is the obedience of faith:
and if the scripture be the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
our faith is not in any of its concerns, to
be extended beyond it; nor more than the
thing regulated is to be beyond the Rule.</p>
            <p>Neither is this opinion of so late a date,
as our Author and others would perswade
their ceredulous followers. The full sense
of it was spoken out roudly of old. So
speaks the great <hi>Constantine</hi> (that an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
may lead the way) in his Oration
to the renowned Fathers assembled at
Nice. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

i. e. <hi>The Evangelical and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Books, and the Oracles of the Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
do plainly instruct us, what we are to
think of Divine things. Laying aside there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all hostile discord, let us resolve the things
brought into Question, by the Testimonies of
the writings given by divine inspiration.</hi> We
have here the full substance of what is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for; and might the Advice of this Noble
<hi>Emperour</hi> be admitted, we should have a
readier way to expedite all our present
Differences, than as yet seems to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for us. The <hi>great Basil</hi> speaks yet
more expresly than <hi>Constantine the great
lib. de confes. fid.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

i. e. <hi>It hath the manifest
guilt of infidelity and pride, to reject any
thing that is written, or to add or introduce
any thing that is not written;</hi> which is the
summ of all that in this matter is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for. To the same purpose he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>Epist. 80. ad Eustath:</hi> where moreover
he <hi>rejects</hi> all pretences of Customs and
usages of any sorts of men, and will have
all differences to be brought for their
Determination to the Scripture. <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
in his <hi>Homily</hi> on <hi>Psalm</hi> 95. speaks the
same sense, saith he; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58629:168"/>
               <hi>Who is
it that promiseth these things?</hi> Paul. <hi>For
we are not to say any thing without Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
nor upon our meer Reasonings. For if
any thing be spoken without Scripture (Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony)
the mind of the hearers fluctuates,
now assenting, anon hesitating, sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
what is spoken as frivolous, sometimes
receiving it as probable. But where the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Divine Voice comes forth from
the Scripture, it confirmeth the word of the
Speaker, and the mind of the Hearer.</hi> It is even
so; whilest things relating to Religion and
the Worship of God, are debated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by the reasonings of men, or on
any other principles besides the express
Authority of the Scriptures, no certainty
or full perswasion of mind can be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about them. Men under such actings
are as <hi>Lucian</hi> in his <hi>Menippus,</hi> says He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Disputations of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
sometimes he nodded one way, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another, and seemed to give his assent
backwards and forwards to express contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58629:168"/>
It is in the Testimony of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
alone, about the things of God, that
the Consciences of those that fear him can
acquiesce and find satisfaction. The same
Author as in many other places, so in his
13 <hi>Homily</hi> on the 2 Epist. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi>
expresly sends us to the Scripture to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after all things, as that which is the
<hi>exact Canon, ballance, and Rule of Religion.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Among
the Latines <hi>Tertullian</hi> is express to the
same purpose. In his Book against <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,
Adoro</hi> (said he) <hi>plenitudinem Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum

Adore the fulness of the Scripture;—And
let Hermogenes prove what he saith, to
be written, or fear the Woe denounced against
them, who add to, or take from, the Word.</hi>
And again in his Book <hi>de Carne Christi; Non

And 'tis said, that <hi>there can never be an end
of alterations and disturbances in the Church,
whilest it is maintained.</hi> The contrary
whereof is true, confirmed by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Evidence of the thing it self.
The admittance of it would put an End to
all disturbances. For let any man judge,
whether, if there be matters in difference,
as in all these things there are and ever
were; the bringing them to an issue and
a setled stability, be not likelier to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by all mean consenting unto one
common Rule, whereby they may be tryed
and examined, than that every party
should be left at liberty, to indulge to
their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Affections and Imaginations
about them. And yet we are told, p. 178.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58629:170"/>
               <hi>that all the pious Villanies, that ever have disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Christian World, have sheltered themselves
in this grand Maxime; that Jesus Christ is the
only Law-maker to his Church.</hi> I confess, I
could heartily desire, that such expressions
might be forborn. For let what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
men please be given to them, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
put upon them; they are full of
scandal to Christian Religion. The
<hi>Mixime</hi> it self, here traduced, is as
true as any part of the Gospel. And it
cannot be pretended, that it is not the
<hi>Maxime</hi> it self, but the abuse of it, (as all
the Principles of the Gospel, through the
Blindness and Lusts of men, have been
abused;) that is reflected on: seeing the
design of the whole Discourse is to evert
the Maxime it self. Now whatever Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
our Author may have of his
own Abilities, I am satisfied, that they are
no way competent to disprove this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the Gospel; as will be evident on
the first attempt he shall make to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
let him begin the tryal as soon as he
pleaseth.</p>
            <p>In the third Section, we have an heap of
instances raked together to confront the
Principle, in its proper sense before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and vindicated, in no one whereof
it is at all concerned. For the Reason
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:58629:170"/>
of things, in matters Civil and Religious,
are not the same. All political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in theWorld consists in the exercise
of Principles of natural Right, and their
just Application to Times, Ages, People,
Occasions and Occurences. Whilest this is
done, Government is acted regularly to its
proper end: where this is missed, it failes.
There things God hath left unto the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of men, and their consent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they cannot, for the most part, faile,
unless they are absolutely given up unto
unbridled lusts; and the things, wherein
they may faile, are alwaies convenient or
inconvenient; good and useful, or hurrful
and destructive; not alwaies, yea very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
directly and in themselves morally
Good or Evil. In such things mens ease
and pofit not their Consciences, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
In the Worship of God things
are quite otherwise. It is not Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or Inconvenience, Advantage or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
as to the things of this life,
but meerly Good or Evil, in reference to
the pleasing of God, and to Ternity, that
is in question. Particular Applications to
the manners, customes, usages of places,
times, Countreys, which is the proper

in all Nations; and the order of it is
fixt and determined in all particulars, that
belong unto it. And let not men pretend
the contrary, untill they can give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of any such defect in the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ, as that the Worship of God
cannot be carryed on, nor his Church
Ruled and Edified, without an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of something of their own for the
supply thereof; which therefore should
and would be necessary to that end
antecedent unto its addition; and when
they have so done, I will subscribe unto
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:58629:171"/>
whatsoever they shall be pleased to add
of that, or indeed any other kind.

Circumstances, wherein Religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Worship of the Church may
have their concern, as they are Actions,
and are disposable by humane Authority.
But he will not, I presume, so soon desert
his fundamental Principle, of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
appointing things in, and parts of
Religious Worship, no where described

And yet if I should say, that none
of these Actions are indeed indifferent in

that if this Author will consent to Um<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pire
these differences by either the Old
or New Testament, or by any Protestant
Church in the World; we shall be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
an end of them, than, as far as I can
see, yet otherwise we are. If he will
not be bound, neither to the Example of
the Church of the Jews; nor of the
Churches of the New-Testament; nor of
the present Protestant Churches; it must
he confessed, that their names are here
made use of, only for a pretence and an
Advantage. Under the Old Testament
we find, that all that God required of his
Church, was, that <hi>they should observe the
Law of</hi> Moses <hi>his Servant, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to him in</hi> Horeb, <hi>for all Israel,
with his Statutes and Judgements,</hi> Mal. 4. 4.
And when God had given out his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the whole Order of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
it being fixed in the Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:58629:172"/>
it is added eight or ten times
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n one Chapter, that this was done, <hi>as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Lord commanded Moses, even so did he,</hi>
Exod. 40. After this God gives them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
strict prohibitions, from adding any
thing to what he had so commanded; as
<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. and <hi>Chap. 12. 32 Prov.</hi> 30. 6.
And as he had in the Decalogue rejected
any Worship not of his own appointment
as such, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4, 5. so he made it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the Rule of his acceptation of
that People and what they did, or his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
of them and it; whether it was by
him commanded or no. So in Particular, he
expresly rejects that which was so added,
as to <hi>dayes,</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> though
of the nearest Affinity and Cognation to
what was appointed by himself, because
it was invented by man; yea by a King,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 33. And when in process of
time, many things of an uncertain origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
were crept into the observance of the
Church, and had firmed themselves with the
notion of Traditions; they were all at
once rejected in that word of the blessed
Holy One; <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

observation of any superadditions of their
own; we no where find written, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
or exemplified by any practice of
theirs. Nor, however, in that juncture of
time, the like whereunto did never occurt
before, nor ever shall do again, during
the expiration and taking down of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical</hi>
Institutions, before they became ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
unlawful to be observed, the
Apostles, according to the liberty given
them by our Lord Jesus Christ, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Holy Ghost, did practise some
things complyant with both Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
did they, in any one instance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any thing on the practice of the
Churches in the Worship of God, to be
necessarily and for a continuance observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them, but what they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Warrant, and Authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our Lord Christ for. Counsel
they gave in particular cases, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon present emergencies; Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:58629:173"/>
for the regular and due observation of
Institutions, and the Application of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules in particular practice; They
also taught a due and sanctified use of
Civil customes; and the proper use of
Moral or Natural Symbols. But to impose
any <hi>Religious Rites</hi> on the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church in the Worship of
God, making them necessary to be alwaies
observed by that imposition, they did not
once attempt to do, or assume power for
it to themselves. Yea, when upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
difficulty, and to prevent a ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
scandal, they were enforced to declare
their judgement to the Churches in some
points, wherein they were to abridge the
practice of their Christian liberty for a
season; they would do it only in things
made <hi>necessary</hi> by the state of things then
among the Churches, (in reference to the
great end of edification, whereby all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
are to be regulated) before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of their judgement, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction
mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. So remote
were they from assuming unto themselves
a Dominion over the Religion, Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or faith of the Disciples of Christ; or
requiring any thing in the constant Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Church, but what was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Will, Appointment and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58629:174"/>
of their Lord and Master, Little
countenance therefore is our Author like
to obtain unto his sentiments, from the
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament;
or the Example either of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
mentioned in them.</p>
            <p>The Instances he gives from the Church
of the Jewes, or that may be given, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Civil Observances, as the <hi>feast of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim;</hi>
or Moral conveniencies directed by
general Rules, as the <hi>building of Synagogues;</hi>
or customary signes suited to the nature of
things, as <hi>wearing of Sackcloth;</hi> or such as
have no proof of their being approved,
<hi>As the feast of Dedication,</hi> and some <hi>monethly
Fasts</hi> taken up in the Captivity, from none
of which any objection can be taken
against the position before laid down.
Those from the Church of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had either a perpetual binding insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
from the Authority of Christ, as the
<hi>Lords day Sabbath;</hi> or contain only a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to use Civil Customes and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in an holy and sanctified manner, <hi>as
the Love Feasts and Kiss of Charity;</hi> or such
as were never heard of in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all, as the <hi>observation of Lent and
Easter.</hi> He that out of these instances can

to the Worship of God, to be observed

            <p>A removal of the Argument taken from
the perfection of the Scripture, and its

what have been discovered to be insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

is alledged, <hi>That what the Scripture commands
in the Worship of God, is to be observed; that
what it forbids, is to be avoided,</hi> Which if
really acknowledged, and a concernment
of the Consciences of men be granted
therein, is sufficiently destructive of the
principal Design of our Author. But

made unlawful by some prohibition: for things
become evil, not upon the scors of there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not commanded; but upon that of their
being forbidden, And what the Scripture
forbids not, it allows; and what it allows, is
not unlawful; and what is not unlawful, may
lawfully be done.</hi> This tale, I confess, we
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58629:175"/>
have been told many and many a time: but
it hath been as often answered, that the
whole of It, as to any thing of reasoning,
is captious and sophistical.</p>
            <p>Once more therefore; what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Worship of God, is lawful;
yea is our duty to observe. All particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instances of this sort, that are to have
actual place in the Worship of God, were
easily enumerated, and so expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
And why among sundry things
that might equally belong thereunto one
should be commanded, and another left at
liberty without any Institution, no man
can divine. Of particular things not to
be observed there is not the same reason.
It is morally impossible, that all instances
of mens Inventions, all that they can find
out to introduce into the Worship of
God, at any time, in any Age, and please
themselves therein, should be before hand
enumerated, and prohibited in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
instances. And if because they
are not so forbidden, they may lawfully
be introduced into Divine Worship, and
imposed upon the practices of men; ten
thousand things may be made lawful, and
be so imposed. But the truth is, although
a particular prohibition be needful to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a thing evil in it self; a general
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58629:176"/>
prohibition is enough to render any
thing unlawful in the Worship of God.
So we grant, that what is not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
is lawful: but withal say, that
every thing is forbidden, that should be
esteemed as any part of Divine Worship,
that is not commanded; and if it were
not, yet for want of such a command, or
Divine Institution, it can have neither
use nor efficacy, with respect to the end
of all Religious Worship.</p>
            <p>Our Author speaks with his wonted
confidence in this matter; yea it seems to
rise to its highest pitch: as also doth his
contempt of his Adversaries, or whatever
is, or may be offered by them in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of this principle. <hi>Infinite cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
on his own part, pag. 193. <hi>baffled

up a great part of his leaves, are what
he can afford unto those whom he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth.
But yet I am not, for all this
bluster, well satisfied, much less <hi>infinitely
certain,</hi> that he doth in any competent
measure understand aright the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
about which he treats with all this
wrath and confidence. For the summ of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:58629:176"/>
all, that here he pleads, is no more but
this; that the <hi>Circumstances of Actions in
particular are various, and as they are not,
so they cannot be determined by the Word of
God; and therefore must be ordered by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Prudence and Authority:</hi> which if he
suppose that any men deny, I shall the less
wonder at his severe Reflections upon
them; though I shall never judge them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

sufficiehtly evidenceth, that either be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands

               <hi>Section</hi> 6. From the Concession, that the
Magistrate <hi>may take care, that the Laws of
Christ be executed;</hi> that is, command and
require his Subjects to observe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ, in that way, and by such
means, as those commands, from the nature
of the things themselves, and according
to the Rule of the Gospel, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and required; he infers, that he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58629:177"/>
hath himself <hi>power of making Laws in Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gion.</hi>
But why so? And how doth thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
follow? Why, saith he, <hi>It is apparently im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>plyed,
because whoever hath a power to see the
Laws be executed, cannot be without a pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
to command their execution.</hi> Very good
but the conclusion should have been; <hi>he
cannot be without a power to make Laws is
the matter, about which he looks to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
which would be good Doctrine for
Justices of the Peace to follow. But what
is here laid down is nothing but repeating
of the same thing in words a little varied;
as if it had been said; <hi>He that hath power to
see the Laws executed, or a power to command
their execution, he hath power to see the Laws
executed, or a power to command their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;</hi>
which is very true. And this we
acknowledge the Magistrate hath, in the
way before declared. But that because
he may do this, he may also make Laws of
his own in Religion, it doth not at all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from hence, whether it be true or no.
But this is further confirmed from the
<hi>nature of the Laws of Christ, which have only
declared the substance and morality of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship: and therefore must needs have
left the ordering of its circumstances to the
power and wisdom of lawful Authority.</hi> The
Laws of Christ, which are intended, are
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:58629:177"/>
those, which he hath given concerning
the Worship of God. That these have
determined the <hi>morality of Religious Worship,</hi>
I know not how he can well allow, who
makes the Law of Nature to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Morality, and all Moral Religious
Worship. And for the <hi>substance of Religious
Worship,</hi> I wish it were well declared what
is intended by it. For my part I think,
that whatever is commanded by Christ,
the Observation of it, is of the substance
of Religious Worship; else I am sure the
<hi>Sacraments</hi> are not so. Now do but give
men leave, as rational creatures, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those commands of Christ in such a
way and manner, as the nature of them
requires them to be observed; as he hath
himself in general Rules prescribed; as
the concurrent actions of many in society
make necessary; and all this Controversie
will be at an end. When a duty, as to
the kind of it, is commanded in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or instituted by Christ in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, he hath given general Rules
to guide us in the individual performance
of it, as to the circumstances that the
actions whereby it is performed, will be
attended withal. For the disposal of those
circumstances according to those Rules,
prudence is to take place and to be used.

For men, who are obliged to act as men
in all other things, are not to be looked
on as Brutes in what is required of them
in the Worship of God.</p>
            <p>But to institute <hi>Mystical Rites,</hi> and <hi>fixed
forms</hi> of Sacred Administrations, whereof
nothing in the like kind doth necessarily
attend the acting of instituted Worship, it
not to determine circumstances, but to
ordain new parts of Divine Worship: and
such Injunctions are here confessed by
our Author, <hi>pag.</hi> 191. to be <hi>new and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
commands by themselves,</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
something that the Scripture no
where commands: which when he produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a Warranty for, he will have made a
great progress towards the determining of
the present Controversie.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> 192. He answers an Objection, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of two branches, as by him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
whereof the first is; <hi>that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand with the love and wisdom of God
not to take order himself for all things, that
immediately concern his own Worship and
Kingdom.</hi> Now though I doubt not at all,
but that God hath so done; yet I do not
remember at present, that I have read any
imposing the necessity hereof upon him, in
answer to his Love and Wisdom. I confess
<hi>Valerianus Magnus,</hi> a famous Writer of the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:58629:178"/>
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tells us, that never any
one did so foolishly institute or order a
Commonwealth, as Jesus Christ must be
thought to have done; if he have not left
one Supream Judge to determine the faith
and Consciences of men in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Divine Worship. And our
Author seems not to be remote from that
kind of reasoning, who, without an assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a power to that purpose, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
that all things among men will
run into confusion; of so little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do the Scriptures and the Authority
of God in them, to some seem to be.
We do indeed thankfully acknowledge,
that God out of his Love and Wisdom hath
ordered all things belonging to his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Spiritual Kingdom in the world.
And we do suppose, we need no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to evince this Assertion, but to
challenge all men, who are otherwise
minded, to give an instance of any defect
in his Institutions to that purpose. And this
we are the more confirmed in, because those
things, which men think good to add unto
them, they dare not contend that they are
parts of his Worship; or that they are added
to supply any defect therein. Neither did
ever any man yet say, that there is a defect
in the divine Institutions of Worship, which
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58629:179"/>
must be supplyed by a Ministers wearing
Surplice. All then that is intended in this
consideration, though not urged, as is here
pretended, is; that God in his Goodness,
Love and Care towards his Church, hath
determined all things that are needful i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
or to his Worship: and about what is not
needful, men, if they please, may contend;
but it will be to no great purpose.</p>
            <p>The other part of the Objection, which
he proposeth to himself, is laid down by
him in these words; <hi>If Jesus Christ hath
not determined all particular Rites and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Religion, he hath discharged his
Office with less wisdom and fidelity than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
who ordered every thing appertaining to
the Worship of God, even as far as the pint
or nails of the Tabernacle.</hi> And hereunto
in particular he returns in answer, not
one word: but only ranks it amongst <hi>idle
and impertinent reasonings.</hi> And I dare say,
he wants not reasons for his silence: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be <hi>pertinent</hi> or no, I know not.
For setting aside the advantage, that, it is
possible, he aimed to make in the manner
and terms of the proposal of this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his Sentiments; and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that he hath not much to offer for
its removal. We dispute not about the
<hi>Rites and Circumstances of Religion,</hi> which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:58629:179"/>
are termes ambiguous, and, as hath been
declared, may be variously interpreted;
no more than we do about the <hi>nails of the
Tabernacle,</hi> wherein there were none at all.
But it is about the Worship of God and
what is necessary thereunto. The orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hereof, that is, of the House of God
and all things belonging thereunto, was
committed to Jesus Christ, <hi>as a Son over his
own house,</hi> Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5. In the discharge
of his trust herein, he was <hi>faithful as was
Moses;</hi> who received that testimony from
God, that he <hi>was faithful in all his house,</hi>
upon his ordering all things in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God as he commanded him, without
adding any thing of his own thereunto, or
leaving any thing uninstituted or undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
which was to be of use therein.
From the faithfulness of Christ, therefore,
in and over the house of God, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the <hi>faithfulness of Moses,</hi> it may
be concluded, I think; that he ordered
all things for the Worship of God in the
Churches of the New Testament, as far as
<hi>Moses</hi> did in and for the Church of the old;
and more is not contended for. And it
will be made appear, that his Commission
in this matter was as extensive, as that of
<hi>Moses</hi> at the least; or he could not, in that
trust and the discharge of it, have that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:58629:180"/>
preheminence above him, which in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

they are not, as by God, so by al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
wise men, left free, under the conduct

obliged to the duty it self by the command
of God? And why may not the same Rule
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58629:180"/>
and Order be observed with respect to the
circumstances that attend the performance
of the duties of instituted Worship? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
there are general circumstances that
are capable of a determination: such are time
and place as naturally considered, without
such Adjuncts as might give them a moral
consideration, or render them good or
evil; these the Magistrate may determine.
But for particular circumstances attending
individual actions, they will hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by a standing Law. But none of
these things have the least interest in our
debate. To add things necessarily to be
observed in the Worship of God, no way
naturally related unto the actions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
prescribed Worship is to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then to call them circumstances
thereof, erects a notion of things which

            <p>His
eighth <hi>Section</hi> is unanswerable. It
contains such a strenuous reviling of the

                  </gap>ms</hi> of
their Adversaries, as there is no dealing
with it. And so I leave it. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I do his ninth, wherein, as he saith,
<hi>he upbraids the men of his contest with their
shameful overthrows: and dares them to look
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58629:181"/>
those enemies in the face, that have so lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
cowed them, by so many absolute tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and victories.</hi> Which kind of <hi>juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile
exultations</hi> on feigned suppositions,
will, I suppose, in due time receive an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
from his own more advised thoughts
and considerations. The instance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he countenaunceth himself in his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Acclamations unto the victory of
his party, is the Book of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> and its
being unanswered. Concerning which I
shall only say; that, as I wish the same
moderation, ingenuity and learning unto
all, that engage in the same cause with him
in these dayes; so if this Author will
mind us of any one Argument in his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Discourse, not already frequently
answered, and that in Print, long ago, that
it shall have its due consideration. But
this kind of Discourses, it may be, on se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thoughts will be esteemed not so
comely. And I can mind him of those,
who boast as highly of some Champions of
their own against all Protestants, as he
can do of any Patron of those Opinions,
which he contendeth for. But it doth
not alwayes fall out, that those who have
the most outward advantages, and greatest
leisure, have the best cause, and abilities to
mannage it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:58629:181"/>
The next Sections treat concerning <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
Will-worship</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> which, as
he faith, having been charged by some on
the Church unduly, he retorts the crime of
them upon the Authors of that charge. I
love not to strive, nor will I contend about
words that may have various significations
fixed on them. It is about things that we
differ. That which is evil, is so, however
you call it, and whether you can give it
any special name or no. That which is
good, will still be so, call it what and
how men please. The giving of a bad or
odious name to any thing, doth not make
it self to be bad or odious. The managing
therefore of those Appellations, either as
to their charge or recharge, I am no way
concerned in. When it is proved, that
men believe, teach or practise otherwise,
than in duty to God they ought to do; then
they do evil: and when they obey his
mind and will in all things, then they do
well; and in the end will have the praise
thereof. In particular, I confess <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as the Word is commonly used, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
a <hi>vicious habit of mind</hi> with respect
unto God and his Worship; and so is not
a proper denomination for the <hi>Worship it
self,</hi> or of any evil or crime in it. But
yet, if it were worth contending about, I
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58629:182"/>
could easily manifest, that according to
the use of the word by good Authors in
all Ages, men have been charged with that
crime, from the kind and nature of the
Worship it self observed by them. And
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged the <hi>Athenians</hi> with an
<hi>excess in Superstition,</hi> it was from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of their Gods, and thronging
them together, right or wrong, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of their Altars. But these things
belong not at all to our present design.
Let them, who enjoyn things unto an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
necessary Observation in the
Worship of God, which are not by him
prescribed therein, take care of their own
minds, that they be free from the <hi>Vice of
Superstition;</hi> and they shall never be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or charged by me therewith. Though I
must say, that a multiplication of Instances
in this kind, as to their own observation,
is the principle, if not the only way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men who own the true and proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Religious Worship, do or may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
themselves to be influenced by that
corrupt habit of mind; so that they may
relate unto Superstition, as the Effect to
its Cause. But the Recrimination here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, with respect unto them, who
refuse admittance unto, or observance of
things so enjoyned, is such as ought to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:58629:182"/>
be expected from provocations, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Retortion. Such things usually taste
of the Cask; and are sufficiently weak
and impertinent. For it is a mistake, that
those charged do make, as 'tis here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<hi>any thing necessary not to be done;</hi>
or put <hi>any Religion in the not doing of any
thing,</hi> or the non-observance of any Rites,
Orders, or Ceremonies; any other, than
every one puts in his abstinence from
what God forbids; which is a part of our
Moral Obedience.</p>
            <p>And the whole Question, in this matter,
is not, whether, as it is here phrased, <hi>God
hath tyed up his creatures to nice and pettish
Laws; laying a greater stress upon a doubtful
or indifferent Ceremony, than upon the great
duty of obedience.</hi> But meerly, whether
men are to observe in the Worship of God,
what they apprehend he hath enjoyned
them; and to abstain from what he doth
forbid; according to all the light that they
have into his mind and will; Which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
as I suppose, may be satisfied; that
they are so to practise, and so to abstain,
without being lyable to the charge of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi>
No man can answer for the
minds of other men; nor know what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
vicious habits and inclinations, they
are subject unto. Outward actions are all,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58629:183"/>
that we are in any case allowed to pass
judgement upon; and of mens minds, as
those Actions are Indications of them.
Let men therefore, observe and do in
the Worship of God whatever the Lord
Christ hath commanded them; and abstain
from what he hath forbidden, whether in
particular instances, or by general dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
precepts and Rules, by which
means alone many things are capable of
falling under a prohibition; without the
least thought of placing any Worship of
God in their abstinence from this or that
thing in particular; and I think, they need
not much concern themselves in the charge
of superstition, given in, or out, by any
against them.</p>
            <p>For what is discoursed Section 11.
about <hi>will-worship,</hi> I cannot so far agree
with our Author, as I could in what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before about superstition; and that
partly because I cannot discern him to be
herein at any good Agreement with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
For <hi>superstition,</hi> he tells us, <hi>consists
in the Apprehensions of men, when their minds
are possessed with weak and uncomly conceits
of God, pag. 201. here, that will-worship
is one sort of superstition;</hi> and yet this will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship
consists <hi>in nothing else, than in mens
making their own phancys and inventions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58629:183"/>
parts of Religion,</hi> which outward
actings are not coincident with the inward
frame and habit of mind before described.
And I do heartily wish, that some men
could well free themselves from the charge
of <hi>will worship,</hi> as it is here described by
our Author; though cautelously expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to secure the concernments of his own
Interest from it. For although I will not
call the things, they contend to impose on
others in the worship of God, their <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cys;</hi>
yet themselves acknowledge them to be
their <hi>Inventions:</hi> and when they make them
necessary to be observed in the whole
Worship of God, as publick and stated;
and forbid the celebration of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
without them; when they declare
their Usefulness, and spiritual or mystical
significancy in that Worship or service,
designed to Honour God in or by their
use; setting up some of them to an Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of what Christ hath commanded; if
I cannot understand, but that they make
them necessary parts of Gods Worship, as
to the actual observance of it, I hope they
will not be angry with me: since I know
the worst they can possibly with truth
charge upon me in this matter, is, that I
am not so wise, nor of so quick an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
as themselves. Neither doth our
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58629:184"/>
Author well remove his charge from those
whose defence he hath undertaken: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
doth it only by this consideration; <hi>tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
they do not make the things, by them intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the Worship of God, to be parts of
Religion. They are not so,</hi> he saith, <hi>nor are
made so by then.</hi> For this hinders not, but
that they may be looked on as <hi>parts of
Divine Worship;</hi> seeing we are taught by
the same hand, <hi>that external Worship is no
part of Religion at all.</hi> And let him abide
by what he closeth this section withall;
namely, that they make not any Additions
to the Worship of God, but only provide,
that what God hath required, be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in an <hi>orderly and decent manner,</hi> and
as to my concern, there shall be an end of
this part of our controversie.</p>
            <p>The ensuing <hi>paragraphs</hi> about Christian

those preceeding about superstition and
Will-worship. There is nothing new in
them, but words; and they may be briefly
passed through. For the charge of <hi>Popery,</hi>
on the one side or other, I know nothing
in it; but that, when any thing is injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or imposed on mens practice in the
Worship of God, which is known to have
been invented in and by the Papal Church
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58629:184"/>
during the time of its confessed Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ection</hi>
of that Church; and are jealous of
a sinful complyance with it in any of those
things. The Recharge on those, who are
said <hi>to set up a Pope in every mans conscience,
whilest they vest it with a power of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the decrees of Princes;</hi> if no more
be intended, <hi>by countermanding,</hi> but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
to observe their decrees, and yield
Obedience to them in things against their
Consciences, which is all can be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
if it fall not on this Author himself,
as in some cases it doth; and which by the
certain conduct of right reason, must be
extended to all, wherein the Consciences

               </gap>n are affected with the Authority of
God; yet it doth on all Christians in the
World, that I know of, besides himself.
For <hi>adding to the Law of God,</hi> it is not
charged on any, that they <hi>add to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi>
as though they made their own
divine, or part of his word and law: but
only that they add in his Worship to
the things commanded by him, which
being forbidden in the Scripture, when
they can free themselves from it, I shall
rejoyce; but as yet see not how they can

What way, therefore, any thing becomes

a sin. And it is a wild notion, that when
any persons abstain from the practice of
that in the Worship of God, which to them
is sinful as so practised, they add <hi>prohibitions</hi>

            <p>The same is to be said concerning <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

The close of this Chapter is designed to
the removal of an Objection, pretended to
be weighty and difficult; but indeed made
so meerly by the Novel Opinions advanced
by this Author. For laying aside all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto some uncouth Principles
broached in this Discourse, there is scarce
a Christian Child of ten years old, but
can resolve the difficulty pretended, and
that according to the mind of God. For
it is supposed, that the Magistrate may <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a Worship that is Idolatrous and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious:</hi>
and an enquiry is made thereon,
what the <hi>subject</hi> shall do in that case? why?
where lyes the difficulty? why, saith he,
<hi>in this case they must be either Rebels, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
If they obey, they sin against God:
if they disobey, they sin against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</hi>
According to the Principles hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to received in Christian Religion, any
one would Reply, and say, <hi>no:</hi> for it is
certain, that men must obey God, and
not contract the guilt of such horrible
sins, as Idolatry and Superstition; but in
so doing they are neither <hi>Rebels</hi> against
their Ruler, nor do <hi>sin against</hi> him. It is
true, they must quieily and patiently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to what they may suffer from him:
but they are in so doing guilty of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
nor sin against him. Did ever any
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58629:187"/>
Christian yet so much as call it into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether the Primitive Christians were
Rebels, and sinned against their Rulers
because they would not obey those Edicts,
whereby they established Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
or did any one ever think, that they
had a difficult case of Conscience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
in that matter? They were indeed
accused by the <hi>Pagans</hi> as Rebels against
the Emperours; but no Christian every yet
thought their case to have been doubtful.
But all this difficulty ariseth from the
making of two Gods, where there ought
to be but one. And this renders the case
so perplexed, that, for my part, I cannot
see directly, how it is determined by our
Author. Sometimes he speaks, as though
it were the duty of Subjects to comply
with the establishment of <hi>Idolatry</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
as <hi>pag.</hi> 214, 215. for with respect,
as I suppose it is, to the case as by him
stated, that he sayes; <hi>men must not withdraw
their obedience:</hi> and better <hi>submit unto the
unreasonable impositions of</hi> Nero <hi>or</hi> Caligula,
<hi>than to hazard the dissolution of the State.</hi>
Sometimes he seems not to oblige them
in Conscience to practise according to the
publick prescription; but only pleads, that
the Magistrate may punish them, if they
do not; and sain would have it thought,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:58629:187"/>
that he may do so justly. But these things
are certain unto us in this matter, and are
so many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Christian Religion;
that if the supream Magistrate command
any thing in the Worship of God that is
Idolatrous, we are not to practise it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
because we must obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than men. Nextly, that in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
of complyance with the Magistrates
commands, we do neither rebel nor sin
against him. For God hath not, doth not
at any time, shut us up in any condition
unto a necessity of sinning. Thirdly, that
in case the Magistrate shall think meet,
through his own mistakes and misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
to punish, destroy and burn
them alive, who shall not comply with
his Edicts, as did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> or as
they did in <hi>England</hi> in times of Popery;
after all honest and Lawful private wayes
of self-preservation used, which we are
obliged unto; we are quietly and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to submit to the Will of God in our
sufferings, without opposing or resisting
by force, or stirring up seditions or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
to the disturbance of publick peace.
But our Author hath elsewhere provided a
full Solution of this difficulty, <hi>Chap. 8. p.</hi> 308.
Where he tells us, <hi>that in cases and disputes

Divine Writer,</hi> Any of the Ancient Fathers,
any sober Schoolmen, or Casuists, any Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
modern Divines, speaking at this rate,
or giving countenance unto this direction
given to men, for the regulating of their
moral actions, it shall be farther attended
unto. I know some such thing is mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
amongst the pleaders for <hi>blind Obedience</hi>
upon <hi>Vowes</hi> voluntarily engaged into, for
that purpose. But as it is acknowledged
by themselves, that by those <hi>Vowes,</hi> they
deprive themselves of that Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which naturally belongs unto them,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:58629:188"/>
as unto all other men, wherein they place
much of the merit of them; so by others
those Vowes themselves, with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
bruitish Obedience that proceeds
from them, are sufficiently evidenced to
be an horrible Abomination, and such as
make a ready way for the perpetration
of all villanies in the world, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that kind of Obedience hath been
principally made use of. But these things
are extreamly fond; and not only, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
unto the Worship of God, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Gospel, but also in themselves
to the Law of our Creation, and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
dependance on God, which is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
unto all individuals of mankind. We
are told in the Gospel, that every <hi>one is to
be fully perswaded in his own mind; that
whatever is not of faith is sin; that we are
not to be</hi> (in such things) <hi>the Servants of
men;</hi> that other mens leading of us amiss,
whoever they are, will not excuse us; <hi>for
if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ditch;</hi> and he that followeth, is as sure
to perish as he that leadeth. The next Guids
of the souls and Consciences of men, are
doubtless those who speak unto them in the
name of God, or Preachers of the Gospel.
Yet are all the Disciples of Christ, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
warned to <hi>take heed</hi> that they be
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:58629:189"/>
not deceived by any, under that pretence,
but <hi>diligently examining</hi> what is proposed
unto them, they discern in themselves
what is good and evil. Nor doth the
great Apostle himself require us to be <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of him,</hi> any further than he was <hi>a
follower of Christ.</hi> They will find small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
who at the last day shall charge their
sins on the commands of others, whatever
hope to the contrary they are put into by
our Author. Neither will it be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
that we have done <hi>according</hi> to the
Precepts of men, if we have done <hi>contrary</hi>
to those of God. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of old, <hi>was
broken in judgement, because he willingly
walked after the commandment,</hi> Hos. 5. 14
But would not his Obedience <hi>hallow,</hi> or <hi>at
least excuse</hi> his action? And would not the
Authority of the King warrant his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Or must <hi>Ephraim</hi> now answer for
the sin, and not be only that imposed the
command? But it seems that when <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
sinned, who at that time had this
goodly Creature of the <hi>publick Conscience</hi>
in keeping, he made <hi>Israel</hi> sin also, who
obeyed him. It is moreover a brave at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to assert that Private men with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to any of their <hi>Moral Actions,</hi> are not
properly <hi>sui juris,</hi> have <hi>no power over their
actions,</hi> are <hi>not to be directed by their own
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58629:189"/>
judgements,</hi> or <hi>determined by their own wills.</hi>
This is <hi>Circes Rod,</hi> one stroke whereof
turned men into Hoggs. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
serve their Understandings, their
Judgements, their Wills, if not to guide
and determine them in their Actions?
I think he would find hard work, that
should go about to perswade men to put
out their own eyes, or blind themselves,
that they might see all by one publick
Eye. And I am sure it is no less unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
to desire them to reject their own
Wills, Understandings, and Judgements, to
be lead and determined by a <hi>publick Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
considering especially that that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Conscience it self is a meer <hi>Tragelaphus,</hi>
which never had Existence in <hi>Rerum natura.</hi>
Besides, suppose men should be willing to
accept of this condition of renouncing
their own Understandings and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
from being their Guides as to their
Moral actions; I fear it will be found that
indeed they are not able so to do. Mens
Understandings, and their Consciences, are
placed in them by him who made them, to
rule in them and over their actions in his
name, and with respect unto their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on him. And let men endeavour it
whilest they please, they shall never be
able utterly to cast of this Yoke of God,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58629:190"/>
and destroy this order of things, which

and take arms against the Prince; but will
Reverence and Humility serve</hi> God <hi>before the
Prince, and that is nothing against our Oath.</hi>
Philand. <hi>Then is not the Prince Supream.</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oph.
<hi>Why so.</hi> Philand. <hi>Your selves are superiour,
when you serve whom you list.</hi> Theoph. <hi>As thought
to serve God according to his will, were to serve
whom we list, and not whom Princes and all

every man shall answer for himself, good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he be Master of his own Conscience, in
that which toucheth him so near, and no man
shall excuse him for.</hi> Philand. <hi>This is to
make every man Supream Judge of Religion.</hi>
Theoph. <hi>The poorest wretch that is, may be
Supreme Governour of his own heart; Princes
rule the publick and external actions of their
Countreyes, but not the Consciences of men.</hi>
This in his dayes was the Doctrine of the
<hi>Church of England;</hi> and as was observed
before, no Person who then lived in it,
knew better what was so.</p>
            <p>The sole enquiry remaining is, whether
the Magistrate, having established such a
Religion, as is Idolatrous or Superstitious,
may justly and lawfully punish and destroy
his Subjects, for their non-complyance
therewithall? This is that, which, if I
understand him, our Author would give
countenance unto; contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense of all Christians, yea of common
sense it self. For wherereas he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaves
his Discourse with suppositions,
that men may mistake in Religion, and
abuse it; all such Interpositions are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>sophistical,</hi> seeing the Case proposed to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:58629:191"/>
Resolution, which ought in the whole to
be precisely attended unto, is about the
refusal to observe and practise a <hi>Religion
Idolatrous or Superstitious.</hi> Of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is that Argument, which alone he
makes use of here and elsewhere, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Principles; namely, the <hi>necessity of
Government;</hi> and how much better the
worst Government is, and the most depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in its administration, than <hi>Anarchy or
Confusion.</hi> For as this by all mankind is
unquestioned; so I do not think there is
any one among them, who can tell how to
use this concession to our Authors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Doth it follow, that because Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
cannot justly nor Righteously
prescribe an Idolatrous Religion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
their Subjects to the Profession and
Obedience of it; and because the Subjects
cannot, nor ought to yield Obedience
therein, because of the antecedent and
superiour power of God over them; that
therefore Anarchy or Confusion must be
preferred before such an Administration of
Government? Let the Magistrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what he will in Religion, yet whilest
he attends unto the ends of all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that Government must needs be
every way better than none; and is by
private Christians to be born with, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58629:191"/>
submitted unto, untill God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
shall provide relief. The primitive
Christians lived some Ages in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
described; refusing to observe the
Religion required by Law; and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
themselves in the Worship of God,
which was strictly forbidden. And yet
neither Anarchy, nor Confusion, nor any
disturbance of publick Tranquility did
ensue thereon. So did the Protestants
here in <hi>England</hi> in the dayes of Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and sometime before. The <hi>Argument,</hi>
which he endeavours in these Discourses
to give an Answer unto, is only of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
If the supream Magistrate may
command what Religion he pleaseth, and
enact the observation of it under destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
penalties; whereas the greatest part of
Magistrates in the World will and do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
such Religions and wayes of Divine
Worship, as are Idolatrous or Superstitious,
which their Subjects are indispensibly
bound in Conscience not to comply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
then is the Magistrate justified in the
punishing of men for their serving of
God as they ought; and they may suffer
as <hi>evil doers,</hi> in what they <hi>suffer as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
This, all the World over, will justifie
them that are uppermost, and have power
in their hands, (on no other ground, but
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58629:192"/>
because they are so, and have so,) in this

               </gap>posed
in this Discourse, as was observed
about sedition, troubling of publick peace
men being turbulent against prescribe
Rules of Worship, whereof if he pretend
that every peaceable dissenter and dissent
from what is publickly established in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship, are guilty, he is a pleasa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
man in a disputation; and, if he do any
thing, he determines his case proposed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and Superstitious Worship. If he do not
so; the mention of them in this place it
very importune and unseasonable. All
men acknowledge, that such miscarriages
and practices may be justly coerced and
punished. But what is this to a bare refusal
to comply in any Idolatrous Worship, and
peacable Practice of what God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as that which he will accept and own?</p>
            <p>But our Author proceeds to find out
many pretences, on the account whereof,
Persons whom he acknowledgeth to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58629:192"/>
be innocent and guiltless, may be punished.
And though their <hi>Apprehensions in Religion
be not, as he saith, so much their crime, as
their infelicity, yet there is no remedy, but it
must expose them to the publick Rods and
Axes,</hi> pag. 219. I have heard of some wise
and Righteous Princes, who have affirmed,
<hi>that they had rather let twenty nocent persons
go free, than punish or destroy one that is
innocent.</hi> This seems to render them more
like him, whose Vice-gerents they are;
than to seek out colourable reasons for
the punishment of them, whom they
know to be innocent; which course is
here suggested unto them. Such advice
might be welcome to him, whom men
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Clay mingled and
leavened with blood;</hi> others no doubt will
abhor it, and detest it. But what spirit of
meekness and mercy our Author is acted
by, he discovereth in the close of this
Chapter, <hi>pag.</hi> 223. for, saith he, <hi>it is easily
imaginable how an honest and well-meaning
man may, through meer ignorance, fall into
such errours, which, though God will pardon,
yet governours must punish. His integrity may
expiate the crime, but cannot prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of his errour. Nay so easie is it for men
to deserve to be punished for their Consciences,
that there is no Nation in the World, in
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58629:193"/>
which, (were government rightly understood
and duty managed,) mistakes and abuses of
Religion would not supply the gallies with
vastly greater numbers, than Villany.</hi> There
is no doubt, but that if <hi>Phaeton</hi> get into
the Chariot of the Sun, the world will be
sufficiently fired. And if every <hi>Absalom</hi>
who thinks he understands government
and the due management of it, better than
its present possessours, were enthroned,
there would be havock enough made
among mankind. But blessed be God,
who in many places, hath disposed it into
such hands, as under whom, those who
desire to fear and serve him according to his
Will, may yet enjoy a more tolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than such Adversaries are pleased
withall. That honest and well-meaning
men, falling into errours about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, through their ownignorance,
wherein their <hi>integrity may expiate their
crime; must be punished, must not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;</hi>
looks, methinks, with an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of more severity, than it is the Will
of God, that the World should be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by; seeing one end of his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and appointing Government among
men, is, to represent himself in his Power,
Goodness and Wisdom unto them. And
he that shall conjoyn another assertion of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58629:193"/>
our Author, namely, that it is <hi>better and
more eligible to tolerate debaucheries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities
in conversation, than liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for men to worship God according to
those apprehensions which they have of his will;</hi>
with the close of this Chapter, <hi>that it is
so easie for men to deserve to be punished for
their consciences, that there is no Nation in
the world, in which, were Government rightly
understood, and duly managed, mistakes and
abuses of Religion would not supply the Gallies
with vastly greater numbers, than Villany;</hi>
will easily judge with what Spirit, from
what principles, and with what design,
this whole Discourse was composed.</p>
            <p>But I find my self, utterly besides and
beyond my intention, engaged in particular
controversies: and finding by the prospect I
have taken of what remains in the Treatise
under consideration; that it is of the same
nature and importance, with what is past
and a full continuation of those opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reproaches of them whom he opposeth;
and open discoveries of earnest desires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their trouble and ruine, which we
have now sufficiently been inured unto;
I shall choose rather here to break off
this Discourse, than further to pursue the
ventilation of those differences, wherein
I shall not willingly, or of choice, at any
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:58629:194"/>
time engage. Besides, what is in the whole
Discourse of especial and particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
may be better handled apart by
it self: as probably ere long it will be;
if this new Representation of old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
quickned by invectives, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
beyond all bounds and measures
formerly fixt or given unto them, be
judged to deserve a particular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In the mean time this Author is more
concerned than I, to consider, whether
those bold incursions, that he hath made
upon the antient boundaries and rules of
Religion, and the consciences of men; those
contemptuous revilings of his Adversaries,
which he hath almost fill'd the Pages of
his Book withal; those discoveries he hath
made of the want of a due sense of the
weaknesses and infirmities of men, which
himself wants not; and of fierce, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
sanguinary thoughts against them,
who appeal to the Judgement Seat of God,
that they do not in any thing dissent from
him or others, but out of a Reverence of
the Authority of God, and for fear of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
his holy Majesty; his incompassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
insulting overmen in distresses and
sufferings, will add to the comfort of
that account, which he must shortly make
before his Lord and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:58629:194"/>
To close up this Discourse; The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
design of the Treatise thus far survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is to perswade or seduce Soveraign
Princes, or Supream Magistrates unto two
evils, that are indeed inseparable, and
equally pernicious to themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The one of these is, to invade or
usurp the Throne of God; and the other,
to behave themselves therein unlike him.
And where the one leads the way, the
other will assuredly follow. The Empire
over Religion, the souls and consciences
of men in the Worship of God, hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been esteemed to belong unto God
alone, to be a peculiar Jewel in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Diadem. Neither can it spring from
any other fountain but absolute and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Supremacy, such as belongs to him,
as he hath alone, who is the first cause and
last end of all. All attempts to educe it
from, or to resolve it into any other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
are vain and will prove abortive.
But here the Sons of men are enticed to
say with him of old; <hi>We will ascend into
Heaven; we will exalt our Throne above the
Stars of God; we will sit upon the Mount of
the Congregation, in the sides of the North;
we will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
we will be like the Most High.</hi> For wherein
can this be effected? What Ladders have
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:58629:195"/>
men to climb personally into Heaven? and
who shall attend them in their attempt? It
is an assuming of a dominion over the
souls and consciences of men in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, wherein and whereby this
may be pretended, and therein alone. And
all this description of the invasion of the
Throne of God, whence he, who did so,
is compared to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who sought Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in Heaven; is but the setting up of
his power in and over the Church in its
Worship, which was performed in the
<hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Mount of the Congregation,</hi> and in
<hi>Sion,</hi> on the <hi>North of the City of Jerusalem,
Isaiah</hi> 14. This now Princes are perswaded
unto: and can scarce escape without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
where they refuse or omit the
attempting of it. Suppose they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with, to run the hazzard and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of such an undertaking; what is it
that they are thereon perswaded unto?
How are they directed to behave themselves,
after they have assumed a likeness unto
the Most High, and exalted themselves to
his Throne? Plainly that which is now
expected from them, is nothing but wrath,
fury, indignation, persecution, destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
banishments, ruine of the persons, and
families of men innocent, peaceable, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, and useful in their several stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:58629:195"/>
to satisfie their own wills, or to serve
the interests of other men. Is this to act
like God, whose power and authority
they have assumed, or like to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Adversary? Doth God deal thus in this
world, in his Rule over the souls of men?
or is not this that, which is set out in the
Fable of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> that he, who takes the
Chariot of the Sun, will cast the whole
world into a combustion? So he, who of
old is supposed to have affected the Throne
of God, hath ever since acted that cruelty
to his power, which manifests what was
his design therein, and what would have
been the end of his coveted Soveraignty.
And whoever at any time shall take to
himself that power, that is peculiar
to God, will find himself left in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it, to act utterly unlike him,
yea contrary unto him. Power, they say,
is a liquor, that let it be put into what
vessel you will, it is ready to overflow: and
as useful as it is, as nothing is more to
mankind in this world, yet when it is not
accompanied with a due proportion of
Wisdom and Goodness, it is troublesome
if not pernicious to them concerned in it.
The power of God is infinite, and his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
absolute: but the whole exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:58629:196"/>
of those glorious dreadful Properties
of his nature, is regulated by Wisdom and
Goodness no less infinite than themselves.
And as he hath all power over the souls
and consciences of men; so he exercises it
with that Goodness, Grace, Clemency, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Forbearance, which I hope
we are all sensible of. If there be any like
him, equal unto him in these things, I will
readily submit the whole of my Religion
and conscience unto him, without the least
hesitation. And if God, in his Dominion
and Rule over the souls and consciences of
men, do exercise all Patience, Benignity,
Long-suffering and Mercy; <hi>for it is his
compassion that we are not consumed;</hi> doth
he not declare, that none is meet to be
entrusted with that Power and Rule, but
they, who have those things like himself:
at least, that in what they are or may be
concerned in it, they express, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to answer his example. Indeed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Princes and Supream Magistrates
are Gods Vice-gerents, and are <hi>called Gods</hi>
on the earth; to represent his Power and
Authority unto men in Government,
within the bounds prefixed by himself
unto them, which are the most extensive
that the nature of things is capable of;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:58629:196"/>
and in so doing, to conform themselves
and their actings to him and his, as he is
the great <hi>Monarch,</hi> the Proto-type of all
Rule and the exercise of it, in Justice,
Goodness, Clemency and Benignity; that
so the whole of what they do may tend
to the relief, comfort, refreshment and
satisfaction of mankind, walking in wayes
of peace and innocency, in answer unto
the ends of their Rule, is their Duty, their
Honour and their Safety. And to this end,
doth God usually and ordinarily furnish
them with a due proportion of Wisdom
and understanding: for <hi>they also are of God;</hi>
He gives them an understanding suited
and commensurate to their work; that
what they have to do, shall not ordinarily
be too hard for them: nor shall they be
tempted to mistakes and miscarriages from
the work they are imployed about, which
he hath made to be their own. But if
any of them shall once begin to exceed
their bounds, to invade his Throne, and
to take to themselves the Rule of any
Province, belonging peculiarly and solely
to the Kingdom of Heaven; therein a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
unto God in their actings is not
to be expected. For be they never so
amply furnished with all Abilities of mind
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58629:197"/>
and soul for the work, and those duties
which are their own, which are proper
unto them: yet they are not capable of
any such stores of Wisdom and Goodness,
as should fit them for the work of God,
that which peculiarly belongs to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Power. His Power is infinite;
his Authority is absolute; so are his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Goodness and Patience. Thus he
rules Religion, the souls and consciences of
men. And when Princes partake in these
things, <hi>infinite Power, infinite Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness,</hi> they may assume the same
Rule and act like him. But to pretend
an interest in the one, and not in the other,
will set them in the greatest Opposition
to him. Those therefore, who can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with Magistrates to take the power
of God over Religion and the souls of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in their observance of it, need never fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that when they have so done, they will
imitate him in his Patience, Clemency,
Meekness, Forbearance and Benignity;
for they are no way capable of these things
in a due proportion to that Power which
is not their own; however they may be
eminently furnished for that which is so.
Thus have we known Princes, (such as
<hi>Trajan, Adrian, Julian</hi> of old) whilst they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:58629:197"/>
kept themselves to their proper Sphere,
ordering and disposing the affairs of this
world, and all things belonging to publick
Peace, Tranquility and Welfare, to have
been renowned for their Righteousness,
Moderation and Clemency, and thereby
made dear to mankind: who, when they
have fallen into the excess of assuming
Divine power over the consciences of men
and the Worship of God, have left behind
them such footsteps and remembrances of
Rage, Cruelty and Blood in the World, as
make them justly abhorred to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
This alone is the seat and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
wherein the Powers of the Earth,
are delighted with the sighs and groans of
innocent persons, with the fears and dread
of them, that are and would be at peace;
with the punishment of their Obedient
Subjects; and the binding of those hands
of industry, which would willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselves for the publick good and
welfare. Take this occasion out of the
way, and there is nothing that should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Soveraign Magistrates, to any thing
that is grievous, irksome or troublesome
to men peaceable and innocent; nothing
that should hinder their Subjects from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the presence of God with them in their
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58629:198"/>
Rule, and his Image upon them in their
Authority, causing them to delight in the
thoughts of them, and to pray continually
for their continuance and prosperity. It
may be some may be pleased for a season
with s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rities against Dissenters, such as
concerning whom we discourse; who false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suppose their interest to lye therein. It
may be they may think meet, rather to have
all <hi>debaucheries of life and conversation tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,</hi>
than liberty for peaceable men to
Worship God, according to their light and
perswasion of his mind and will; as the
multitude was pleased of old with the
cry of, <hi>Release Barrabas, and let Jesus be
crucified;</hi> Magistrates themselves will at
length perceive, how little they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to any, who importunately sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
unto them fierce and sanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
connsels in these matters. It is a say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Magistrates need not fear, but that
the open wickedness and bloody crimes
of men, will supply them with objects to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58629:198"/>
be Examples and Testimonies of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and severity. And methinks it should
not be judged an unequal Petition by
them, who Rule in the stead and fear of
God, that those who are <hi>innocent</hi> in their
lives, <hi>useful</hi> in their callings and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>peaceable</hi> in the Land, might not be
exposed to trouble, only because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and endeavour, according to their
light, which they are invincibly perswaded
to be from God himself, to take care, that
they <hi>perish not eternally.</hi> However I know,
I can mind them of Advice, which is ten
thousand times more their interest to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto, than to any that is tendred in
the Treatise we have had under conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and it is that given by a King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those that should pertake of the like
Royal Authority with himself; Psalm 2.
10, 11, 12. <hi>Be wise now therefore, O ye
Kings; be instructed, ye Judges of the earth.
Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with
trembling. Kiss the Son, left he be angry, and
ye perish from the way, when his wrath is
kindled but a little; blessed are all they that
put their trust in him.</hi> And he who can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me, how they can render themselves
more like unto God, more acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and more the Concern and Delight
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:58629:199"/>
of mankind, than by relieving peaceable
and innocent persons from their Fears,
Cares, and Solicitousness about undeserved
evils, or from the suffering of such things,
which no mortal man can convince them,
that they have merited to undergo or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
he shall have my thanks for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>And
what is it, that we treat about?
What is it, that a little Truce and Peace is
desired unto, and pleaded for? What are
the concerns of publick good therein?
Let a little sedate consideration be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
about these things, and the causeles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of all the Wrath we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
withall, will quickly appear.
That there is a sad degeneracy of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in the world, amongst the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Christian Religion, from the Rule,
Spirit, Worship and Conversation of the
first Christians, who in all things observed
and expressed the Nature, Vertue, and
Power of the Gospel, all must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and many do complain. Whatever
of this kind comes to pass, and by what
means soever, it is the interest and design
of them, who are present gainers by it in
the world, to keep all things in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
that yields them their advantage.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58629:199"/>
Hence upon every Appearance of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
or Apprehension that any will
desert the Wayes of Worship, wherein
they have been engaged, they are cast
into a storm of passion and outrage, like
<hi>Demetrius</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Silver-smiths,</hi>
pretending divisions, present settlement,
ancient veneration, and the like; when
their gain and advantage, whether known
or unknown to themselves, is that, which
both influenceth them with such a frame
of Spirit, and animates them to actings sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thereunto. Thus in the Ages past there
was so great and universal an Apostacy,
long before fore-told, overspreading Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
that by innumerable sober persons
it was judged intolerable: and that, if
men had any regard to the Gospel of Christ,
their own freedom in the world, or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
blessedness, there was a necessity
of a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the reduction of the
profession of Christian Religion unto some
nearer conformity to the Primitive times
and pattern. Into this design sundry
Kings, Princes, and whole Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
themselves, namely what lay in
them, and according to the sentiments of
Truth they had received, to reduce
Religion unto its pristine Glory. What
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58629:200"/>
Wrath, Clamours, Fury, Indignation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
Malice, this occasioned in them
whose Subsistence, Wealth, Advantages,
Honour and Reputation, all lay in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
things in their state of defection
and Apostacy, is known to all the world,
Hence therefore arose bloody persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in all, and fierce Wars in many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where this thing was attempted;
stirred up by the craft and cruelty of
them, who had mastered and managed the
former declensions of Religion to their
own use and advantage. The guilt of
which mischiefs and miseries unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
is by a late Writer amongst our
selves, contrary to all the monuments of
times past, and confessions of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
themselves, endeavoured to be cast
on the Reformers. However a work of
Reformation was carried on in the world,
and succeeded in many places: in none
more eminently, than in this Nation
wherein we live. That the end aimed at,
which was professedly the Reduction of
Religion to its antient Beauty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in Truth and Worship, is attained
amongst us, some perhaps do judge, and
absolutely acquiesce therein: and for my
part I wish we had more did so. For,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58629:200"/>
be it spoken, as I hope, without offence
on the part of others, so without fear of
giving it, or having it taken, on my own;
there are among many, such evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensions
from the first established Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
towards the old or a new, and it
may be worse Apostacy; such an apparent
weariness of the principal Doctrines and
practices, which enlivened the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as I cannot but be troubled at,
and wherewith many are offended. For
although I do own a dissent from some
present establishments in the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> yet I have that honour for the
first Reformers of it, and Reformation it
self; that love to the Truth declared and
established in it; that respect to the Work
and Grace of God, in the conversion of
the souls of thousands by the Ministry of
the word in these Nations; that I cannot
but grieve continually to see the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Doctrines of it deserted, its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
principles and practices derided,
its pristine zeal despised by some, who
make advantage of its outward constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
inheriting the profits, emoluments
and wealth, which the bounty of our
Kings have endowed it withal; but not
its Spirit, its Love, its stedfastness in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58629:201"/>
owning the Protestant Truth and Cause.
But to return; for these things may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
elsewhere be complained of, seeing
they relate only to particular persons.
That what is done in Reformation be
established; that any farther publick work
of the same nature be attempted; or
the retrivement of what is done to its
original condition and estate, belongs
to the determination of the Supream
Magistrate, and to that alone. Private
persons have no Call, no Warrant to
attempt any thing unto those purposes.
However many there are, who dislike
some <hi>Ecclestastical Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of
outward Worship, which have been the
matter of great contests from the first
Reformation: but much more dislike the
degeneracy from the Spirit, way and
principles of the first Reformers before
mentioned, which in some at present,
they apprehend, And therefore though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
seem to be at a great distance from the
present established Forms of the <hi>Church of
England;</hi> yet certainly all who are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and peaceable, when they shall see
the Ministry of the Church, as in former
dayes in some measure, acted rightly and
zealously towards the known ends of it,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:58629:201"/>
and such as are undeniably by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
namely, the Conviction of the
World, the Conversion of Souls, and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of them that do believe; and
the discipline of it exercised, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formily
at least to the Rule of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the secular powers of the earth,
<hi>not to be a terrour to the good, but to them
that do evil;</hi> and in these things a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Meekness, Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
forbearance, condescension to the
weakness, mistakes, errings and wandrings
of others, which the Gospel doth as
plainly and evidently require of us, as
it doth, that we should believe in Jesus
Christ; will continually pray for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
though they cannot themselves
joyn with it in sundry of its practices
and wayes. In the mean time, I say,
such persons as these, in themselves
and for their own concerns, do think it
their duty, not absolutely to take up in
what hath been attained amongst us;
much less in what many are degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into; but to endeavour the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their practice in the Worship of
God, to what was first appointed by
Jesus Christ; as being perswaded, that
he requires it of them; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:58629:202"/>
that in the unspeakable variety
that is in humane constitutions, Rest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Souls and Consciences is not
otherwise to be obtained. And if at
the same time they endeavour not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Manner and Course of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
to the same Rule and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by which they would have their
Worship of God regulated; they are
<hi>hypocrites.</hi> Short enough, no doubt, they
come in both of perfection; but both they
profess to aim equally at. And herein
alone can their Consciences find rest and
peace. In the doctrine of faith, consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on in the first Reformation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the allowed Writings of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> they agree with others;
and wish with all their hearts they had
more to agree withall. Only they cannot
come up to the practice of some things in
the Worship of God; which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
of humane prescription, their
Obedience in them would lye in a perfect
contradiction to their principal design
before mentioned. For those things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen out from a great multitude of
things of the same nature, invented by
those, whose Authority was rejected in
the first Reformation, or Reduction of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:58629:202"/>
Religion from its Catholick Apostacy;
they suppose, cannot justly be imposed
on them; they are sure, cannot be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
received by them, whilest they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to reduce themselves unto the
primitive Rules and Examples of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
In this design they profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready to be ruled by, and to yield
subjection unto any Truth or Direction,
that can or may be given them from the
Word of God, or any Principles lawfully
from thence educed. How their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
is at present attempted, let the
Book under consideration, and some late
unparallel'd and illegal Acts of Violence,
conformable to the spirit of it, be a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
But in the management of their
design, they proceed on no other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
than those of the Libetty of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eretion or discerning they call
it,) for the determining of themselves
and their own practices, in what they
believe and prosess about Religion, and
the liberty of their Consciences from all
humane impositions, than were owned,
pleaded and contended for by the first
Reformers, and the most learned defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in their
disputations against the Papists; those
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:58629:203"/>
they will stand to, and abide by: yea than
what are warranted by the Principles of
our nature and constitution; for no man
practiseth any thing, nor can practise it,
but according to his own will and
choice.</p>
            <p>Now in these things, in their Principle,
or in their management of it, it may be
they are mistaken; it may be they are
in an errour; or under many mistakes
and errours. But from their integrity
they know themselves <hi>innocent,</hi> even in
their mistakes. And it is in the nature
of men to think strange of sedate vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
that befall them without their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,
and of suffering by Law without
any Guilt. Their design of reducing
themselves in Worship and Conversation
to the primitive pattern, they openly
avow: nor dare any directly condemn
that design; nor can they be convinced of
insincerity in what they profess. And
shall they they be destroyed, if they miss
it in some matters of smaller concernment?
which, whatever some may boast of, is not
hitherto tolerably proved. Shall now
their dissent in Religious Observances on
this occasion, and those, and that about
things mostly and chiefly, if not only,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58629:203"/>
that appear neither name nor thing in
the Scripture, be judged a crime not to
be expiated, but by their ruine? Are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities
or vicious debaucheries rather
to be tolerated, or exempted from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than such a dissent? What place of
Scripture in the Old or New Testament,
which of the ancient Fathers of the
Church, do speak at this rate? Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inconsistent with publick Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
with the general Rules of Moral
Duties in all Relations and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
practices of any tendency in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to political disturbances, are by
none pleaded for. Meer dissent it self,
with different Observances in the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worship of God, is by some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
indeed to be a Civil distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.
It hath alwayes been so by
some, even by those, whose own esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
wayes have been Superstitious
and Idolatrous. But wise men begin
to smile, when they hear private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
pleaded as publick good, and the
affections which it begets, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reason of things. And these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
have been by all parties, at one
time or another, refuted and discarded.
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58629:204"/>
Let the merit of the cause be stated
and considered, which is truly as above
proposed, and no other: set aside Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
Animosities, Advantages from
things past and by-gone in political dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and tumults, wherein it hath no
concern; and it will quickly appear
how little it is, how much, if possible,
less than nothing, that is or can be
pleaded for the countenancing of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
severity in this case. Doth it suite
the Spirit of the Gospel, or his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
to destroy <hi>good Wheat,</hi> for stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as is supposed, a <hi>little out of order,</hi>
who would not have men pluck up <hi>the
tares,</hi> but to let them stand quietly
in the field untill Harvest? Doth it
answer his mind to destroy <hi>his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
who profess to love and obey
him, from the Earth; who blamed <hi>his
Disciples of old</hi> for desiring to destroy
<hi>the Samaritans, his Enemies,</hi> with fire
from Heaven? We are told, that he,
who <hi>was born after the flesh, persecuted
him, who was born after the promise:</hi>
and a work becoming him it was.
And if men are sincere Disciples of
Christ, though they may fall into
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58629:204"/>
some mistakes and errours, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
persecuting of them on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
will be found to be of the works
of the flesh. It is certain, that for those
in particular, who take upon them, in
any place or degree, to be <hi>Ministers of
the Gospel,</hi> there are commands for meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
patience and forbearance, given
unto them. And it is one of the greatest
duties incumbent on them, to express
the Lord Jesus Christ, in the frame of his
mind and Spirit unto men; and that
eminently in his <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>lowliness,</hi>
which he calls us all in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to learn of him. A peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
also to the Gospel, to the holy
Law of Love, self-denyal and condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is required of them; that they may
not in their spirits, wayes and actings, make
a <hi>false representation</hi> of him, and that
which they profess.</p>
            <p>I know not therefore whence it is come
to pass, that this sort of men do princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
if not only stir up Magistrates and
Rulers to Laws, Seventies, Penalties,
Coercions, Imprisonments, and the like
outward means of fierce and carnal
power, against those, who in any thing
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:58629:205"/>
dissent from them in Religion. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
abroad throughout <hi>Christendome,</hi>
those, in whose hands the Civil Powers
are, and who may be supposed to have
inclinations unto the severe exercise of
that power which is their own, such as
they think possibly may become them as
men and Governours, would be incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to moderation towards dissenters,
were they not excited, provoked and
wearied by them, who pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
Jesus Christ to the world; as
if any earthly Potentate had more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
mercy and compassion, than he
Look on those <hi>Lutheran</hi> Countreyes where
they persecute the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
declared and proved, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
for the most part, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
bear with those dissenters, were
they not stirred up continually to severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by them, whose duty it were to
perswade them to clemency and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
if in themselves they were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
enclined. And this hath ruined the
interest of the Protestant Religion in
<hi>Germany,</hi> in a great measure. Do men,
who destroy no more than they
can, nor punish more than they are
able, and cry out for Assistence where
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58629:205"/>
their own arm fails them, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
hereby like to their heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Is this Spirit from above? Doth
that, which is so, teach men to harrase
the consciences of persons, their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and fellow-servants, on every little
difference in judgement and practice about
religious things? Whom will such men
fulfill the commands of patience, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
waiting, meekness, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that the Gospel abounds with, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?
Is it only towards them, who are
of the same mind with themselves? They
stand in no need of them: they stand
upon the same terms of advantage with
themselves. And for those that dissent,
<hi>arise, kill, and eat,</hi> seems to be the only
command to be observed towards them.
And why all this fierceness and severity?
Let men talk what they please, those
aimed at, are peaceable in the Land; and
resolve to be so, whatever may befall
them. They despise all contrary insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.
That they are, in their stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
severally, usefull to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and collectively in their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and trading, of great considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to publick welfare, is now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58629:206"/>
unto all indifferent men. It is or
must be, if it be for any thing, (as
surely no men delight in troubling others
for trouble sake;) for their Errors
and Mistakes, in and about the Worship of
God. All other Pleass are meer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of passion and interest. But who
judgeth them to be so guilty of <hi>errors?</hi>
Why those, that stir up others to their
hurt and disquietment. But is their
Judgement infallible? How if they
should be mistaken themselves in their
judgement? If they are, they do not
only err, but persecute others for the
Truth. And this hath been the general
issue of this matter in the world. Error
hath persecuted Truth ten times, for
Truths once persecuting of Error. But
suppose the worst; suppose them in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and under mistakes; let it be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that God hath appointed, that all
men who so err, should be so punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as they would have <hi>Non-conformists,</hi>
and though I should believe them in the
truth, I would never more plead their
cause. And would these men be willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus dealt withall, by those who
judge, or may judge them to err? It
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58629:206"/>
may be some would; because they have
a good security, that none shall ever
judge them so to do, who hath power
to punish them: for they will be of
his mind. But sure none can be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
confined unto themselves, nor
so universally in all their affections and
desires unto their own personal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
as not to have a compassion for
some or other, who in one place or
other are judged to err by them, who
have power over them to affix what
guilt they please unto that, which is
not their crime. And will they justifie
all their oppressors? All men have an
equal right in this matter, nothing is
required, but being uppermost, to
make a difference. This is that, which
hath turned <hi>Christendome</hi> into a Shambles;
whilest every prevailing Party, hath
judged it their duty and interest, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them that do dissent from them.</p>
            <p>Once more; what name of sin or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
will they find to affix to these
errors? <hi>Nullum criminis nomen, nist no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis
crimen.</hi> No man errs willingly,
nor ought to be thought to tempt or
seduce his own will, when his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:58629:207"/>
is to his disadvantage. And he
is innocent whose will is not guilty.
Moreover, those pretended errors in
our case, are not in matters of
faith; nor for the most part, in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Worship of God, or that which
is acknowledged so to be: but in or
about those things, which some think it
convenient to add unto it, or conjoyn
with it. And what quietness, what peace
is there like to be in the world, whilst
the sword of vengeance must be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
drawn about these things? Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of peace, patience, and forbearance,
would certainly better become Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Gospel, and Preachers of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
peace than such passionate
and furious enterprizes for severity, as
we meet withal.</p>
            <p>And I no way doubt, but that all
generous noble and heroick spirits,
such as are not concerned in the impale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
peculiar interest and advantages of
some, and do scorn the pedantick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of mean and emulous souls;
when once a few more clouds of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
are scattered, will be willing to
give up to God the Glory of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58629:207"/>
over the consciences of men;
and despise the thoughts of giving them
disquietments for such things, as they
can no way remedy; and which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them not from being servants of God,
good Subjects to the King, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in their respective lots and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And
now instead of those words of
<hi>Pilate, What I have written, I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
which though uttered by him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
and despightfully, as was also

is that servant, whom his Lord when he
cometh shall find so doing. Verily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
