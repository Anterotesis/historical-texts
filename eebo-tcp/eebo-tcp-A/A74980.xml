            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When a Body of Horſe is Drawn up, the Officers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172436:31"/>
muſt ſtand cloſe to their Men; onely he that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands muſt be a Horſe length before the Reſt of the Officers: And they muſt obſerve the ſame thing in Marching; for nothing is more unſeemly, than to ſee the Officers at too great a Diſtance from their Men.</p>
            <p>It is thought neceſſary to make an Alteration in the manner of Wheeling of Horſe; For whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, when a Squadron of Horſe was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Wheel, (if it were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172436:32"/>
to the Right) the Right-hand Men cloſed to the Left; Which way was found ſubject to put the Ranks out of Order, and therefore the Practiſe now is, That the Right-hand Men ſhould keep their Ground, onely turning their Horſes Heads to the Right, whilſt the Left comes about; in which Motion they muſt obſerve their Left-hand man.</p>
            <p>When a Squadron of Horſe is to Charge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is better they ſhould do it with their

            <p>It is to be obſerved that this meaſure of ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid is meant onely for the Encamping of an Army; For if it was to be ranged

            <p>THough there can be no certain Rules giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for any Order of Battel, which depend chiefly upon the circumſtances of Place, and other Accidents that may happen, yet I ſhall ſet down ſome which may ſerve for an Example to ſhew the nature of the Thing.</p>
            <p>You muſt then firſt of all Command Silence; next to March very Leiſurely. To obſerve the right in Marching, and preſerve the Intervals, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be fifty or ſixty
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172436:39"/>
Paces at leaſt, that fifty of a Battalion may paſs through them.</p>
            <p>None to ſpeak but the Commander in chief, or the Major by his Order.</p>
            <p>Advancing againſt the Enemy in Battel, out of Muſquet Shot, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and other Officers at the head of the Battalion, are all to March in a Line, with their Pikes in their Hands, two good Paces before the Men, and are often to look behind them; Becauſe otherwiſe they may inſenſibly get too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172436:39"/>
the Body; And the Souldiers by following too faſt, fall into diſorder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of great care is to be taken in Marching againſt an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>At which time the Ranks are to be two great Paces diſtant, and the Files cloſed in ſuch a manner, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Souldier may March at his eaſe, and ſo Charge and Fire; which will be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he have liberty of moving his Elbows as he Marcheth.</p>
            <p>When the Muſqueteers come within Shot, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:172436:40"/>
March ready with their Pans guarded, the Ranks ſhould be cloſed forward to the Swords point. But to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void talking, which uſually happens at this inſtant, it is better to leave the diſtance of one Pace between the Ranks; ſo the Souldiers will not preſs one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which ordinarily cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes breach of Silence in a Battalion. The diſtance of Files is to be preſerved as hath been ſaid already.</p>
            <p>He that Commands a Battalion, is to be in the Center of it, at the Head
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:172436:40"/>
of the Pikes; the Officer next in degree, is to be in the Rere of the Pikes; the third in degree, at the Right Wing of Shot, in the Front; the fourth, at the Left Wing of Shot, in the Front; The reſt of the Captains are to be in the Rere on the Wings of Shot, according to their degrees. The Lieutenants are to be Placed, two in the Front, two in the Rere, and one on each Flank. The Colours are to be in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Pikes. The Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are to be Placed one on the Right and Left of each
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172436:41"/>
Rank. If a Battalion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of more then Six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the reſpective Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are to be Placed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diſcretion of the Commander of the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
            <p>It were not amiſs to Place the Company of the Captain that Commands the left Wing of Shot, on the left of all that Wing; unleſs the Battalion be the outermoſt on the Line: for then the Collonels Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to be on the Left of all, in this caſe the Right and Left Exchanging.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:172436:41"/>
In a Battel, the Captains and other Officers are to March in a Line; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within Shot of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Muſqueteers Marching ready with their Pans guarded, the whole Line of Captains and other Officers is to retire each of them into the Intervals of his Files next after his Poſt; yet ſo, as they may look to the Right and Left of the Battalion. Whilſt they are Marching towards the Enemy, they are to be very careful to keep themſelves in this Poſture, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172436:42"/>
to be forwarder nor backwarder, neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Battalion, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it. And when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to March with their Pikes Charged, and that the Muſqueteers are ready, the Ranks are to be cloſed forward to one ſmall Pace. Aſſoon as the Battalion comes to thirty Paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Enemy, let the Muſqueteers Fire, the manner of which Firing ſhall be ordered them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The Captain Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rere, is to obſerve
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172436:42"/>
that the Battalion March ſtill, to cauſe the Souldiers to cloſe forward eaſily, and without noiſe or confuſion: His chief care ought to be to Command the Pikes ever to March even with the Wings of Muſqueteers; For it often happens that in Marching any conſiderable time in Battel, the Wings Advance, and form a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon, and the Pikes in the middle being extremely preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, the Battalion is broken. Provided the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pikes be equal on the Right and Left, the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:172436:43"/>
cannot be diſordered by its March. Above all, we are carefully to preſerve the diſtance of Ranks and Files, according to what hath been ſaid already.</p>
            <p>The Grenadeers (when there are any) are to be drawn up on the Right of the Battalion, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, without intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, or troubling the Order of it, they being a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate number of Men that are to be always ready for whatever ſhall be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them.</p>
            <p>The Commander of a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172436:43"/>
Battalion may be on Horsback at the Head of it, when the Captains are on Foot with their Pikes in their hands, in conſideration that he is to be ſtirring to all parts, to ſee that the diſtances be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and above all, that none ſpeak, except himſelf, or the Major by his Order.</p>
            <p>The Commander of a Battalion is to alight when the Muſqueteers make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and is to March with his Pike charged againſt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>When an Army is Drawn up for Battel, the diſtance
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:172436:44"/>
between the Lines muſt be of three hundred Paces, the ſame as is in a Camp.</p>

            <p>TO paſs a narrow De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, the readieſt way to perform it, and draw up again in Order aſſoon as paſt, is to make the Ranks File, if to the Right, the Right-hand man Files firſt, and the reſt of his Rank follow him, till the Defile be paſt, then they Rank again as they were; this ſeems better then Files
