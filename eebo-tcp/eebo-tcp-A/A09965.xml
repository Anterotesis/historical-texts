            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ovetousnesse which is Idolatrie, that must be mortified as well as the other earthly members. Now this Covetousnesse is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; <hi>but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and sinfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of getting or keeping Wealth or Money.</hi> The inordinate lusting after Honours, that is stiled Ambition; too much affecting of Beautie, is called Lustfulnesse; and Lust is an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, which when it propoundeth Riches for its object, is called Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>which is Idolatry.</hi> Now Idolatry consisteth in one of these three things: First, in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the true GOD in a wrong manner, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending him as a Creature, giving that to him that agreeth not with him. Secondly, when


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15448:10"/>
as wee make the creature a God; that is, by conceiving it under the notion of a God: so did they which worshipped <hi>Iove, Mars,</hi> and those Heathens that worship the Creatures as Gods. Thirdly, when as wee attribute that unto it, which belongeth unto GOD: as to trust in it, to delight in it, to put all our trust and confidence in it: when as we thinke, that it can performe that unto us which God only can, this thought is Idolatry. Now that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse is Idolatry, is meant onely in this sence when as wee thinke that riches can doe that for us which God onely can; as that they can doe us good or evill. <hi>Esay,</hi> 41 23. <hi>If they are Gods,</hi> saith God, <hi>let them doe good or evill.</hi> God onely doth good and evill, therefore hee is distinguished from Idols because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it. Affections follow opinions, and practise followes affections. Therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 6. <hi>He that will come to God must beleeve that he is, &amp; that he is a rewarder of all those that seeke him.</hi> None will worship God, unlesse they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God can comfort and releeve them in all their distresses; So no men will earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeke after wealth or riches till they have an opinion, that riches and wealth will yeeld them comfort, or be a strong tower of defence to free them from inconveniences; this makes them to trust in them, and this thought is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. There are two Points of Doctrine that arise from these words: The first, is this.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That covetousnesse which is Idolatry,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the first; That to seeke helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from any creature and not from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is vaine and sinfull: It must needs bee so, because it is Idolatry. Now in Idolatry there are two things. First, Vanity and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8.4. <hi>An Idoll is nothing in the world</hi>; here it is Vanitie. Secondly, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, there is no greater sinne than it. It is extremely vaine, because we attribute that to it that doth only belong to God; To think, that if I am well, if I am strong in friends, have a well bottomed estate, that then my mountaine is strong on every side, I shall not be removed, this is sinfull and vaine; yee shall not live a jot the better or happier for it; A strange Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, contrary to the opinion and practice of most men. If wee consult with our treasures, doe not we thinke that if we have such wealth and such friends, that wee should live more comfortably and happily? There is no man but will answer that hee thinketh so: But yet my brethren yee are deceived, it is not so: It belongs to God onely to dispense of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, good or evill.<note place="margin">Psal. 33.17.</note> 
                     <hi>A Horse is but a vaine thing,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, to get a victorie</hi>:


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15448:11"/>
That is, though it be as fit a thing as can bee in it selfe, yet if it bee left to its selfe without God, it is but vaine and can doe nothing. So I may say of Riches and other outward things; riches are vaine, and honours and friends are vaine to procure happinesse of themselves. So Physicke of its selfe is vaine to procure health; without God they are nothing worth: hee that thinkes otherwise erreth. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>It was the folly of the rich man that hee thought so; and therefore</hi> sang a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his soule, <hi>Eate drinke and be merry, O my Soule, thou hast goods laid up for thee for many yeares:</hi> hee did not thinke himselfe happie, because he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God and his favour, but because hee had abundance of outward riches; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you see the end of all his happinesse, <hi>Thou foole, this night shall thy soule be taken from thee,</hi> and then what is become of all his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse? Yet such is our folly, that most of us reflect on the meanes and on the creatures, and expect happinesse from them. But Christ tels us, they will not doe the deede; <hi>this night shall they take away thy soule, and then all thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is gone.</hi> The rich man thought before that he had beene secure as long as his wealth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him, that he needed not to expect any calamity; but now hee sees that he built upon a sandy foundation. <hi>David</hi> though an holy man, being established in his kingdome, having subdued all his enemies, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15448:11"/>
himselfe with wealth and treasure, hee thought <hi>that his mountaine was then made so strong that it could never bee moved</hi>; that <hi>to morrow shall bee as yesterday and much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant</hi>; but, <hi>no sooner did God hide his face, from him, but he was troubled, Psal.</hi> 30.7. To shew, that it was not his riches and outward prosperity that made him happy, but God onely: So <hi>Daniel,</hi> 5.23. <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>shazzar</hi> when as he thought himselfe happy, being environed with his Wives, Princes, and Servants; when <hi>as hee praised the gods of silver and the gods of gold,</hi> abounded with all outward prosperity and reposed his happinesse in it, is counted but a foole by <hi>Daniel</hi> for it; <hi>Because hee glorified not God, in whose hands his breath and all his wayes were</hi>; and therefore he was destroyed.</p>
                  <p>These things of themselves will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with us, nor yet make us happy. Wee take not a step to prosperity or adversity, but Gods hand doth leade it. My brethren that heare mee this day, that have heretofore thought, that if ye had such an estate, such learning, such ornaments, and such friends, that then yee were happy; to perswade you that it is not so, it would change your hopes and feares, your griefes and joyes, and make you labour to bee rich in faith and in good workes. It will be very hard to perswade you to this, yet we will doe what we can, and adde certaine reasons which may perswade you to

beleve it to bee so, if God shall adde a blessing to them, and joyne the operation of his Spirit with them to perswade you.</p>

                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note>First, this must needs be so, in regard of Gods All-sufficiencie; hee alone is able to comfort without the creatures helpe: else there were an insufficiencie and narrownesse in him, and so hee should not bee God. If hee could not fill our desires every way, hee were not All-sufficient; Even as the Sunne should bee defective, if it needed the helpe of torches to give light. God is blessed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in himselfe, but makes us also blessed; it is the ground of all other Commandements; <hi>Thou shalt love and worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou feare:</hi>

Deut. 6.5.</note> Wee <hi>must love him with all our hearts, with all our soules</hi>; let not the creature have one jot of them, because all comfort is from God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God all-sufficient, walke before me, and be perfect</hi>: that is, love me altogether, set your affections on none but me, yee neede not goe unto the creature, all is in me. If the creature could doe any thing for to make us happy and not God, then wee might step out to it; but the creature can adde nothing to it, God onely is all-sufficient to make you perfect every way; though the creature be used by God as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, yet it is onely God that makes you happy and gives you comfort, and not the creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:15448:12"/>Secondly, it must needs bee so because of the vanitie and emptinesse of the creature: It can doe nothing but as it is commanded by God; he is the <hi>Lord of Hoasts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 59.5.</note> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the creatures, as the Generall doth his army. A man having the creatures to helpe him, it is by vertue of Gods command. It is the vanitie of the creature that it can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it selfe, except there be an influence from God. Looke not then to the creature it selfe, but to the influence, action and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it hath from Gods secret concurrance with it. What it is to have this secret concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and influence from God unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you may see it expressed by this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; Take the hand, it moves because there is an imperceptible influence from the wil that stirres it: So the creature moving and giving comfort to us, it is Gods will it should doe it, and so it is applied to this or that action.

The creature is but empty of it selfe; except God put into it a fitnesse to comfort you, all is vanity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, and this vanity is nothing but emptinesse. And this serves to correct the thoughts of men, who thinke that if they had such an estate, all their debts paid, if they had such and such friends, then all would bee well with them: and who is it that thinks not thus? But let those that entertaine such thoughts, consider the vanitie of the creature: all our sinnes proceed from the over-valuing of the creature; for sinne is nothing but an aversion of the soule from the immutable God to the creature.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Consider that you seeke your happinesse, the wrong way, in that you seeke it in worldly things, they are not able to helpe or make you happy; because they reach not to the inward man: The body is but the sheath and case, our happinesse lies not in it: so in the creatures, their happinesse consisteth not in themselves, but in something else: It lies in observing the rule that God hath appointed to them: the fire, observing the rule that God hath given it, is sure; so is it of water, so of all creatures animate and inanimate, their happinesse consists in observing the rule that God hath prescribed to them. The Law of God is the rule that we must walke by, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it as a rule we are happy: hee that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Commandements shall live in them: hee that departeth from them is dead.

If you seeke for this comfort from God, all is in one place, but if yee seeke for it in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yee must have a multitude of them to comfort you; yee must have health, wealth, honours, friends, and many other things; but one thing will doe it if yee goe the right way: yee shall finde it onely in God.<note place="margin">Luk. 10.41.42.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Consider, that that comfort and happinesse which you have from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is but a dependent felicity, and it is so much the worse; because it depends on the creature, which is mutable and uncertaine: how much better is it to depend on God, in <hi>whom is no shadow of variety or change.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames 1.17.</note> Every creature is weaker by how much it hath more dependency on another creature: and so are yee weaker by how much more yee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on outward things. If yee depend on

friends, they may change their affections, and become your enemies, or death may take them away, and then your happinesse is gone: If yee depend on riches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou set thine eye on that which is not? For riches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely make themselves wings, and flie away like an Eagle towards heaven</hi>; and then your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is gone: But if yee seeke and place your happinesse in God, in whom is no change nor alteration, then it is perpetuall. A dependancy on things that are mutable will yeeld no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, because God will have all to depend on himselfe: therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Christ of God is made unto us, Wisedome, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Sanctification, and Redemption. That no flesh might reioyce in its selfe, but that he that glorieth, might glory in the Lord.</hi> For this end, God conveied Christ unto us; that hee might make us beleeve, that we fare not the better for any creature, that so wee might rejoyce onely in the Lord: therefore hee hath made Christ redemption from all evill, that hee might furnish us with all good: Christ hath redeemed us from hell and misery, from want of good things: seeke not then a dependancy on the creature, thinke not that it will better you, and this will make you to depend on Christ. Therefore for these regards correct your opinion of worldly and outward things, and judge of them with righteous Iudgement: depend onely on God if you will have him to


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15448:17"/>
be your portion, as hee was the <hi>Levites</hi>: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him not as the Israelites did, depend on him in good earnest. A little you say, with Gods blessing will doe much. Labour not therefore, neither toile yee to leave great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your children (the common pretence that men have for their covetousnesse) though you leave them never so much, if Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing bee not on it, it is nothing, it can yeeld them no comfort; yea many times it is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of their hurt. If then Gods blessing be all in all, if that onely can administer comfort and make us happy, I would aske you this question? What if ye did leave your children onely Gods blessing, would it not be sufficient though you leave them little or nothing else? Yee thinke not so: and yet whatsoever ye can leave them without Gods blessing, is nothing worth. Preachers labour much in this, to draw you from worldly things, and all to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: It must be Gods teaching that perswades within, that must effect it: yee must therefore take paines with your hearts, the generality of the disease shewes that it is hard to be cured; Labour therefore to finde out the deceipts which do hinder your practise of these things; which are these.</p>
                  <p>One Deceipt that deceives men is, that they are ready to say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deceipt.</hi> 1.</note> that these things are the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of God. Why then should not wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in them? As for afflictions they are


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15448:17"/>
crosses, and therefore wee grieve for them: if these then did not adde to our blessednesse, why count wee them blessings, and account Povertie as a crosse?</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, that if yee take them as blessings yee may rejoyce in them, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments by which God doth you good. Blessings are relative wordes, they have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto God: if yee consider them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference unto him, they cease to be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: therefore if yee consider them meerely as blessings, yee may rejoyce in them. Now yee receive them as blessings:</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, if yee depend on God for the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, continuing, and want of them, if yee thinke yee shall enjoy them no longer than God will. If yee thinke this with your selves, wee have Wives, Children, Friends, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, 'tis true we have them, but yet they shall not continue with us an houre or minute lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than God will: If ye thinke so in good earnest, then yee rejoyce in them as blessings. A man that is relieved when he is in danger, lookes more to the will than to the hand of him that helpes him: wee looke more to the good will of our friends, than to their gifts: so we should looke more to Gods Will and pleasure, than to the benefits which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes on us. The consideration of these things as blessings, must raise up your thoughts to heavenly thinge, to consider that whatsoever


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:15448:18"/>
is done in earth, is first acted in heaven; the Sunne is first eclipsed there, and then here: so your estates are first eclipsed there, before that they are here. Looke therefore on GOD, and on these as meerely depending on Gods will, and then you enjoy them meerely as bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, yee looke on them as blessings, if yee looke on them so, as to know, that yee may have them in aboundance without any comfort. Instruments have nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; whatsoever they have is put into them. A man may have wealth, friends, and all other outward things, his mountaine may seeme to be strong, yet without Gods blessing on them, he may want comfort in them. When as yee thinke thus, that yee may have these things without comfort, it is a signe that your eye is on God, that yee looke on them onely as the Vehiculaes or Conduit pipes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay comfort. The aire yeelds light as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, though it hath no light of its owne: the water may heat, but not of its selfe, but by that heate which is infused into it by the fire: So if a man drinke a Potion in beere, the beere of its selfe doth not worke, but the Potion worketh by the beere: So it is with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blessings, they of themselves can yeeld you no comfort at all, but if they yeeld you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is by reason of that comfort which God puts into them.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, yee doe then enjoy them as bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, if you thinke that you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort without them: the ebbing and flowing of outward things doth not augment your comfort or diminish it: Those that have not any outward blessings, <hi>may have more gladnesse and comfort in their hearts, than those whose corne and wine are increased, Psalm.</hi> 4.7. Those who have but a small Cottage and a bed in it, are many times more happie, more healthy, and sleepe more quietly, than those rich men, <hi>whose wealth will not suffer them to sleepe: Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 5.12. Many there are, that seeme to want outward things and comforts, yet are full of inward comforts and delights: Many there are, who like <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apostles,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.10.</note>

It is advantage to us to have bloud taken away in a Pleurisie: it is good sometimes to lop trees, that so they may bring forth more fruit; so it is good many times for us to have crosses to humble us, and to bring us nearer to God: yet yee may sorrow for the losse of these things, and take it as a crosse, if yee can say this from your hearts, that yee are not afflicted, because ye are made poore, because your wealth is taken from you but because it is Gods pleasure to take it from you, either for the abuse of it, or else to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you for some other sinne.

You may see this in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> God purposed to make him a great man, see with what facilitie he was made the <hi>Governour of Egypt next to Pharaoh without his owne seeking, and beyond his expectation</hi>: So it was with <hi>Mordecai</hi>; so with <hi>David</hi>: God appointed to make them great, and therefore they became great notwithstanding all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. On the contrary, let man goe on in his owne strength, and he shall labour without any profit at all: Hence it is, that many times we see a concurrencie of all causes, so that we would thinke that the effect must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and yet it followes not, and if it doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we have no comfort in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because God makes an insutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a disproportion betwixt the man, &amp; the blessing; as betweene <hi>Iudas</hi> and his <hi>Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> A man may have tables well furnished, Riches in aboundance, a Wife fit for him, and yet have no comfort in them, because God puts a secret disproportion betwixt him and them.</p>

If wee have so joyed in these, or loved them so as to love God lesse, it is adulterous love and joy.

                  <p>Now least we bee deceived in our love to the creature, I will give you these foure signes to know, whether your love to it bee right or no.</p>
                  <p>First, see if your affections to the creature cause you to withdraw your hearts from God. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Cursed bee the man that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth flesh his arme, and whose heart departeth from the LORD:</hi> It is a signe wee make flesh, our arme, when as wee withdraw our hearts from God; we make the creature our

Consider what your conversation is, whether it bee in heaven or no: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our conversation is in heaven</hi>: the neglecting and not minding of earthly things in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse, shewed him not to be of an earthly conversation.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, consider what choise yee make when as these things come in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God and spirituall things: what Bils of Exchange doe you make?<note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> Doe ye make <hi>yee friends of the unrighteous Mammon,</hi> not caring for these things when they come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a good conscience, or doe yee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake GOD, and sticke to them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, consider what your obedience is to GOD, whether his feare be alwayes before your eyes; or whether riches set you on worke or no: what mans obedience is, such is his trust; if yee obey God, then yee trust in him, if yee obey riches, then yee trust in them, and not in God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, consider what your affections are: nothing troubles a holy man but sinne, which makes him seeke helpe at Gods hands, and not

                  <p>Thus much of the first generall Doctrine; we come now to the second, which is this.</p>

                  <p>Covetousnesse may be defined, <hi>to be a sinfull desire of getting or keeping money or wealth inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, it is a sinfull desire, because it is a lust, as lusting after pleasure is called Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse; it is also inordinate, the principle being amisse, and likewise the Object: The principle is amisse, when as wee over-value Riches, set a greater beauty on them than they have, and seeing them with a wrong eye, we lust after them, by reason that we over-value them; And thus to over-value them, thus to lust after them, and to thinke that they can make us happy, is Idolatry. The object of it is as bad as the principle, when as the end of getting riches, is either to raise us to a higher condition,<note place="margin">Luke 16.19.</note> or to <hi>fare deliciously every day</hi>; or


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15448:24"/>
else to <hi>spend them on some lust,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, it is, of getting or keeping mony; of getting it inordinately, when as wee seeke it by wrong meeanes; or of keeping it inordinately; and that in two cases. First, in not bestowing it on our selves, as wee ought. There is tenacity of this sort among men, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.13. <hi>There is a great evill under the Sun; namely, Riches kept by the owners thereof to their hurt</hi>: When as it <hi>is comely and good for a man to eate and drinke, and to enioy the good of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that he taketh under the Sunne, all the dayes of his life which God giveth him, for this is his portion</hi>: And thus to <hi>take his Portion and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in his labour is the gift of God. Eccles.</hi> 5.18.19. Then secondly, in not giving to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too straight handed, having goods and seeing othrrs to want.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The last and chiefe thing in the definition is, Inordinately, that is, besides the rule of Gods Word. A thing is said to be inordinate, when as it is besides the square, and in doing thus, we doe amisse.</p>
                  <p>Now this affection of seeking money is said to be inordinate, in these foure respects.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note>I answer, by the event: see in what estate and condition God hath set you, see what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state he hath given you, this is your Portion, and with it you must bee contented. GOD hath a Soveraigntie over us, wee are but his subjects, and must be contented with what he gives us: you are contented with that which your Father or your Prince gives you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must receive that which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes upon you, with all humility and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. If we be soundly humbled, wee <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our selves worthy to be destroyed, Ezech.</hi> 36.32. We confesse with <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>That we are unworthy of the least of Gods mercies</hi>; that the least Portion is more than we deserve.

desire or seeke for more, this desire is sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as we ought not to seeke wealth more than is our due; so we ought not to seeke it by unlawfull meanes; not by vsury, gaming, oppression, fraud, deceipt, or any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes. I adde this of gaming, because it is unlawfull (though it be little considered:) for it is no meanes that God hath appointed or sanctified for to get money; because it is neither a gift nor a bargaine. I dispute not now; whether playing for trifles, to put life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the game be lawfull, but of gaming with an intent to get and gaine money or wealth; this I say is an unlawfull meanes, and such as have gotten money by these unlawfull meanes, are bound to restitution.</p>

If we make this our end, to bestow it on our lust, and not on necessaries onely, not contenting our selves with so much as shall serve our turnes; if wee seeke it thus, wee seeke it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.

So in other things: hee that is sicke,

desires as much Physicke as will cure him, and no more: so wee ought to desire as much as will serve our necessities, and no more. But if we desire it for ambition, pleasures, or any other by-respect, this desire is sinful and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</p>

Secondly, there is a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory will, which is mature ripe and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: with this latter will wee may not desire them, but with the former we may; for in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>If we have food and rayment, let us therewith be content:</hi> If any man have a desire to be rich; yet having food and rayment let him not so desire more riches; but that hee may be content with it; yea having, or having them not, ye must be content.

up to feare him: and therefore wee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them as his blessings, with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse and subordinate desire as this; when as we set bounds and limits to the sea of our own desires which are in themselves turbulent, and submit our selves wholly to <hi>Gods</hi> will. <hi>Christ</hi> being to die had a will to live, yet not a full and resolute will, but a will subordinate to <hi>Gods</hi> Will. <hi>Father if thou wilt,</hi>

                  <p>Now there is a threefold necessitie.</p>
                  <p>First, there is a necessitie of expedience, as if a man hath a a journey to goe, 'its true, hee may goe it on foote, yet he may desire a horse

ride on, because it will be more expedient for him: so you may desire with a remisse desire, so much as is expedient for your vocation and calling, so much as it requires.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is a necessitie in respect of your condition and place; as men in higher ranke and calling neede more than men of an inferiour degree, to maintaine their place and dignity; so may they desire to have more than they; so as they desire no more than will bee sufficient to maintaine them in that ranke and degree wherein they are placed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, there is a necessitie of refreshment, and you may desire as much as is needfull for your necessarie refreshment, as much as hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie requires, so that you doe not goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. And in these three respects, you may desire God to give you as much as shall bee expedient for you, because it is no more than nature requires.</p>
                  <p>Now besides this desire of things necessarie, there is a desire of superfluitie and excesse: this desire proceeds not from nature but from lust; because we desire such a degree of wealth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raise our estates, or that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on our lusts and pleasures; that like the rich Glutton, <hi>Luke,</hi> 16. <hi>We may be well clad and fare deliciously every day.</hi> Many mens lives are nothing else but playing and eating, eating and playing, and are led alwayes in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: To desire wealth to this or any other


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15448:28"/>
superfluous end is very sinfull, and it must needs be so for many reasons.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note> because mans life stands not in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance &amp; excesse: therefore <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.13, 14, 15. verses. <hi>When as a certaine man spake to Christ to speake to his brother to divide the inheritance with him: he said unto him, Man who made mee a Iudge or devider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ver you; and then bids the multitude to beware of Covetousnesse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that a mans life consisteth not in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things that hee possesseth</hi>: That is, though yee have never so much wealth, yet ye shall not live the longer for it; your life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not in it, no more doth your comfort: for they will but please the sight of your eye, they will not make you more happier than you are; seeke not therefore superfluitie, for your life consists not in abundance: He is but a foole, that thinkes that these things will make him happy, that these will make him rich: all they that are not <hi>rich in God,</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the desire of superfluitie is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because it proceeds from an evill roote: the fruit cannot bee good that proceedeth from an evill and bitter roote; but this desire proceeds from such a roote; That is, from lust; it comes not from Gods spirit, which bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth every man to <hi>be content with food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: Nor yet from nature,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8.</note> which seekes not

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, what yee may not pray for, that ye may not desire to seeke after: but we may not pray for superfluities. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches, feed me with food convenient for me,</hi> not with superfluities: And in the Lords Prayer we are taught not to pray for superfluities,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.11.</note> but, <hi>Give vs this day our daily bread,</hi> that is, as much as is necessarie for us, and no more: therefore we may not desire it. The seeking of more than is necessary doth hinder us, and not further us; a shooe that is too big, doth hinder a traveller, as well as one that is too little.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is dangerous, for it doth choake the word, and drowne men in perdition: therefore it is <hi>Agurs</hi> Prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8.9. <hi>Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for mee; least I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord?</hi> Fulnesse and excesse is alwayes dangerous: full tables doe cause surfeits, full cups make a strong braine giddy. The strongest Saints hath beene sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with prosperity and excesse, as <hi>Dauid, Hezekiah, Salomon</hi>; they sinned by reason of excesse in outward things. It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to bee rich, therefore it is <hi>Davids</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.10. <hi>If riches increase, set not your hearts upon them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 10.23.24, 25.</note>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, to desire superfluity must needs be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note>I answer, that the end of mens callings is not to gather riches, if men make this their end, it is a wrong end; but the end of our calling is to serve God and man.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15448:30"/>
which must not lie idle: every man hath some Talents, and must use them to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters advantage; and how can that be, except hee doe good to men?

                     <hi>He that hath an office must be diligent in it, and attend on it</hi>: every man must attend his calling, and bee diligent in it. If riches come in by our calling, that is the wages, not the end of our calling, for it lookes onely to God: wee must not make gaine the end of our callings; there are many that make gaine their godlinesse, and the end of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions:<note place="margin">Rom. 16.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Some preach onely for gaine</hi>: others use all other callings onely for gaine: but if any man wil make gaine the end of his calling, though he may conceale and hide his end from men, yet let him be sure that hee shall answer God, the searcher of the hearts for it: on the other side, if a man by diligence in his calling have Riches following him, hee may take them as a blessing of God bestowed on him,<note place="margin">Pro. 10.4.</note> and as a reward of his calling. <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hand maketh rich</hi>; that is, GOD will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reward it; not that we must eye riches and make them our end:<note place="margin">Pro. 10.22.</note> GOD <hi>makes a man rich,</hi> and man makes himselfe rich.

riches on us: Man makes himselfe rich, when as he makes riches the end of his calling, and doth not expect them as a reward that comes from God. I shall expresse it by <hi>Iacob. Iacob</hi> he serves <hi>Laban faithfully,</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15448:32"/>
and therefore gives way unto them. A man is not a covetous man, nor yet an ambitious man, which hath covetous and ambitious thoughts; for these the holiest men have; but hee that hath such thoughts, and strives not at all against them, or else strives but weakely, hee is a covetous or ambitious man. A godly man may have these thoughts and desires, but he strives strongly against them, gets ground of them, and gives them a deaths wound: but the covetous man he yeelds unto them, the godly man he gets the victory over them.</p>

He proves what he had said by this argument: He that is able to give life to the dead is God, or the Sonne of God; But I am able to give life to the dead; (<hi>The houre is comming and now is, when the dead shall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and those that heare it shall live</hi>;) Therefore I am the Sonne of God. In briefe, these words shew Christs Divinity by the effects of it, that he can quicken the dead.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>

out of Christ, for this will make you to prize him more. And the point for this is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That every man out of Christ is in a state of death, or dead man</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">

Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi> The meaning is, that all men are spiritually dead.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First of all, what this death is.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the first; what this death is; it consists
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>


                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:15448:36"/>
in two things. First, in death there is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life: then a man is dead, when as the soule is separated from the body: so a man is spiritually dead, when as the soule is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the quickning spirit of Grace, and righteousnesse:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> This is all our cases, <hi>In us there dwels no good,</hi> there is no Spirit of life within us: the Soule is so out of order, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is weary of it and forsakes it. When the body growes distempered and unfit for the Soule to use, then the Soule leaves it. Even as when the instrument is quite out of tune, a man layes it aside; whiles it is in tune he plaies on it: So a man dwels in a house as long as it is habitable and fit to dwell in, but when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unhabitable he departs: so, as long as the body is a fit organ for the soule, it keepes it; when it becomes unfit, it leaves it. Even so the holy Ghost lives in the soule of man, as long as it is in good temper, but being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered by sinne, the holy Ghost removes. You may see it in <hi>Adam</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as soone as hee did eate of the forbidden fruite, the holy Ghost left him, and he lost his Originall righteounes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, in this death as there is a privation, so there is also a positive evill quality wrought in the soule, whereby it is not onely void of goodnesse, but made ill. In the naturall death when a man dyes, there is another forme left in the body; so in this spirituall death, there is an evill habit, left in


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15448:36"/>
the soules of men: This you may see <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. where the workes you doe before regeneration, are called, <hi>Dead workes</hi>: there would be a contradiction in calling them <hi>dead workes,</hi> if there were not another posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evill forme in man, beside the absence of the quickning Spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.18. Chap. 8.1.4. to 10.</note> which forme is called <hi>Flesh</hi> in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi>
                     </note>But it may be objected, that sinne is a meere privation of good, that it is a <hi>Non-ens</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flesh cannot bee said to be an operative qualitie and forme of sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note>To this I answer, that though all sinne be a meere privation, yet it is in an operative sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and thence it comes to passe that sinne is fruitfull in evill workes. As for example, take an Horse and put out his eyes, as long as hee stands still there is no error; but if he begins to runne once, he runnes amisse, and the longer hee runnes, the further hee is out of the way wherein he should goe; and all this because he wants his eyes, which should direct him: So it is with sinne, though in its selfe it be but a meere privation, yet it is seated in the soule, which is alwayes active: <hi>Anima nunquam otio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>; The goodnesse that should inlighten it is taken away, and there is a positive evill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie put into it, that leades us on to evill.</p>
                  <p>Consider farther whence this death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, the originall of it, is the understanding &amp; mind of man, which is <hi>primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vivens, &amp; ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15448:37"/>
moriens.</hi> That which lives first and dies last. The cause of life is the understanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened to see the truth; when the affections are right, and the understanding straight, then we live; when it is darkened, all goes out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4. speaking of Christ, it is said, that <hi>in him there was life, and the life was the light of men</hi>: he was life because hee was light, he did inliven men, because he did inlighten them. therefore <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.4. the Apostle speakes thus to men; <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light</hi>: because light is the beginning of spirituall life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>Iames</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will begot he them, by the word of truth</hi>: that is, the word rectifies the understanding and opinion, which is the first thing in this spirituall birth: <hi>and Ephe</hi> 4.22.24. <hi>Put off the old man which is corrupt, according to the deceitfull lusts thereof; and put on the new man, which after God is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in holinesse, and perfect righteousnesse.</hi> The old man is corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts: that which is here called deceitfull lusts, &amp;c. in the Originall, signifies, <hi>lusts proceeding from error,</hi> and <hi>holinesse proceeding from truth</hi>; Lust proceeds from error, in mistaking things; for lust is nothing else but affection misplaced, proceeding from error: and that holinesse in which God delighteth, in which his Image consists, comes from truth. When <hi>Adam</hi> was alive, hee judged aright, because


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15448:37"/>
then the wheeles and affections of his soule were right: Being dead by reason of his fall, he lost his sight, hee saw no beauty in the wayes of God; and this is the case of all unregenerate men: but when the Spirit recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the judgement and convinceth men of sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and righteousnesse, then they beginne to revive. To be dead is to have the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding darkned, the judgement erronious: to be alive is to have the understanding inlightened, and the judgement rectified; And thus much for the first, what this death is.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the kindes of this death,<note place="margin">The kindes of Spirituall death.</note> which are three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there is a death of guiltinesse: one that is guiltie of any offence that is death by the Law, is said to be but a dead man. So every one by nature is a dead man, bound over to death though he be not executed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is a death in sinne that is opposite to the life of sanctification, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in trespasses and sinnes</hi>: and there is a death for sinne that is contrary to the life of Glory.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, there is a death that is opposite to the life of joy: in hell there is a life, man is not quite extinguished, but yet men in hell are said to be dead, because they have no joy. This death consists in the separating of God from the soule; when God is separated from the soule; then man dies this death of sorrow.


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15448:38"/>
God joynes himselfe to the soules of good and bad: to those that are not sanctified, he joynes himselfe in a common manner, and thence it is, they have common joy, common comfort, common civility; to the godly he joynes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in an extraordinary manner, by which they have extraordinary joy: now when God is separated from the soule, then comes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect death; see it in the separation of God from Christs humanity. God withdrawing himselfe from him but for a time,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.46.</note> he crieth out, <hi>My God my God, why hast thou forsaken mee</hi>; As God withdrawes himselfe more or lesse, so is our joy, our sorrow more or lesse.

Now yee must know that there are no degrees in the privative part of death, but they are onely in the positive. The lowest step in this second death is to have <hi>enmity to the wayes of God,</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, those who are naturally dead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand nothing at all; but in those who are spiritually dead, there is a life of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by which they themselves may know that they are dead; men who are naturally dead, cannot know they are dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, those who are spiritually dead, may understand the wayes of life: though they relish them not, yet they may heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, which those who are naturally dead cannot doe.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, those who are spiritually dead, may come to the meanes, to the poole in


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15448:40"/>
which the Spirit breathes the breath of life; whereas naturally dead men cannot come to the meanes of life.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Lastly, this death is a voluntary death. Men who are naturally dead cannot put life into themselves; no more can those who are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead when they have made themselves dead. Men die this death in a free manner; I cannot better expresse it, than by this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. A man that is about to commit the act of murther or treason, his friends perswade him not to doe it, for if hee doth, hee is but a dead man; yet notwithstanding he will do it; we say of such a one that hee is a dead man willingly.

                     </note>To this I answer, that there is a difference betweene the externall binding, and the bonds wherewith a man is fettered by sinne; There is an externall impediment, which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove, as when he is fettered in the well; but there is no externall impediment, when as men are bound in the chaines of sin. When wee command you to doe thus and thus, all the businesse is with the wil, we rather say men will not, than they cannot come. There is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when as a man hath <hi>eligibile</hi> or <hi>non eligibile</hi>; when hee hath a thing in his owne choise, when there is no impediment, when hee may argue both wayes: If a man out of the pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his nature doth it not, it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsory, but free; a beasts action is not free because hee cannot reason on both sides, but


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15448:43"/>
man when hee considers arguments on both sides, when hee can say, doe not doe such a thing, but doe such a thing; when he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive arguments on both sides, he is free; there is no such externall impediment in him, as to bid one in darkensse, to doe a thing of the light, or one bound hand and foote in a pit, to come out; since the chiefe impediment here, is in the depraved wils of men, which God doth rectifie and change by his grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, through the use of meanes.</p>
                  <p>If then every man out of Christ bee in an estate of death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note> let every man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and consider whether he be a dead man or no; this is the great <hi>quere</hi> or question in this mutability and incertaintie of things. Let us make the life to come sure; our life is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine here; but have we this spirituall life, are we living men? then wee are happy: but are we dead? then he that is not partaker of the first resurrection, shall not be partaker of the second. It is too late to begin to live, when we are dying, certainely the time of our naturall death is a time of spending, not of getting or inquiring after life: If yee deferre this search while yee are in health, when ye lie on your deaths bed, when ye shall see heaven and hell immediately presented unto you, this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion will hold you solicitous, and then you shall see that this spirituall life, is the life indeed. The time of this naturall life, is


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15448:43"/>
not long; the candle burnes not long if it burne out; yet it is oftner blowne out than burnt out; men oftner fall downe than come down from the tree of life: this Tabernacle is often throwne downe before it fals downe, therefore in this short life make your selves sure of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two things which hinder this search and inquirie after spirituall life.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is, men are not at leasure; there are millions of businesses in their heads, so that they cannot hearken to the whisperings of conscience; they have no spare time to be wise unto salvation; <hi>It will be our wisdome therefore to consider our end, Deut.</hi> 32.29.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, are yee made alive againe? Is there such a change in you as if yee were other creatures, as if yee lived an other life? Where this life is, it works an alteration and a change, gives us another being, makes us to bee no more the same men; <hi>Who ever is in Christ,</hi>

Now if ye desire to know whether Christ live in you or no, or whether you are in an estate of death; you must see whether you have these two things which are in every one in whom Christ liveth: first see whether you live to him: <hi>He died that we should not live to our selve,</hi>

What ever our life is, we cleave to it: Some place their life in their credit, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way it, and they die: others in riches; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way them, and they perish.

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:15448:45"/>The first are those, <hi>who have a name they live and yet are dead, like the Church of Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3.1.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first of these, are like the Angels that take bodies, and doe actions; they are not truly living men, though they appeare to be.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, Angels that take assumed bodies, eate and drinke, and are not nourished:<note place="margin">The characters of thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>as the Angels that came to Lot, and Abraham,</hi> and had created bodies. So these dead men doe all the actions that living men doe; they heare, they pray, they reade, but they turne it not into flesh and bloud, because there is no life in them: they are not the stronger for hearing, or any thing they doe; they thrive not, as those that have the <hi>Boulimia,</hi> they eate and drinke yet they grow not, because there is an <hi>Atrophy</hi> in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. We preach to men, yet they are the same this yeare as they were the last: they have a name to live and yet they live not, they turne not the meanes to flesh and nourishment; it is a signe of a living man that he growes. That which is said of a good wit, that it makes use


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15448:46"/>
of every thing, may be said of grace; it turnes all the passages of Gods providence into nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment; stormes as well as faire gales, helpe a living man to the haven. Affliction, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, all put him on and helpe him forwards. Take one not having this life, doe what yee will, hee thrives not; as an unthrift, put him to what trade you will, he thrives not, hee is still on the losing hand; so these men, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, adversitie, helpe them not: put any thing to a dead man to doe, he doth it not; so these men, the Word and Sacrament helpes them not, because they are dead.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the motion of the Spirits that take assumed bodies, is not from any inward principall, nor from the motion of life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: so the actions of men that are not alive, are not from the principles of life, they are not vitall motions; but as in other actions, the Wheeles goe as long as the spring is up that moves them: so the actions of men that are dead, as long as the springs are up and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence continues, they move. When they are sicke and apprehend death, then they will doe many things; but these being gone their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is ended: whilst they deepely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend some accident, they will be good, that being gone and forgotten, their goodnesse ends· Many whiles they have good acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and are in good company, will be good, but when they are gone, their goodnesse cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.

These men have golden outsides, they seeme to have the Kings stampe upon their actions, yet they are but counterfeit; they pay God in counterfeit coine, not in currant mony; their actions have a <hi>forme of religion,</hi>

                     <hi>but yet the power is wanting</hi>; all they doe is but a meere formality; their Prayers, their Sabbath kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping are but in shew; those actions and duties that have most power and life in them, they doe least of all relish, they tast them not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have no life in them. In generall, all the actions that men wanting life doe, they are but dead workes, they may bee deceived with them for a time, but when death comes, they shall finde them to be but dead. <hi>Remigius</hi> a Iudge of <hi>Loraigne</hi> tells this story, that the divell in those parts did use to give money to Witches, which did appeare to be good coine, seemed to be currant money at first; but being laid up a while, it then appeared to be nothing but dried leaves: so the divell deceives men now, he makes them to doe outward actions, which have a faire shew, but when they need them, they then appeare as they are, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dead leaves, because the principle of life is wanting.</p>
                  <p>A third propertie of assumed bodies is this, that they are taken up onely for a time, and then are laid downe againe, as the Spirits that take them listed: so in these men which seeme to live, there is an inconstancy and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability

                     </note>I answer, though sometimes they want it, yet they are quickly made hot againe, because there is life in them; as Charcole is quickly kindled, because it hath beene in the fire, so the Saints are soone kindled, brcause they had fire in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. Others are as greene wood, or rather as matter that is not combustible, as the Adamant, that will not bee made hot with fire; Living men, admonitions and the

fire of good company will heate againe, so wil it not the others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ye shall know them by their stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and hardnesse. It is a signe of death to be inflexible: Wicked men are as hard as flint to Gods commandes, but as soft as waxe to that which humors them. Are yee tractable? Do you delight in your owne wayes, and yet continue the same men, keepe the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Doe yee abide still in the same place, or goe on in the same tract? then ye are dead: In many things you may be tractable, but the maine is, whether yee are flexible in those things that are connaturall unto you. These deale with us as <hi>Iohanan</hi> did with <hi>Ieremiah, Ier.</hi> 42. He said he would goe downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee would doe any thing, <hi>that God should hid him, whether it were good or bad</hi>; but when <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> had told him and the people that they must not goe downe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> then they <hi>say that he spake falsely, God did not send him with such a message</hi>: If Gods will had suted with his, hee would have done what hee would have had him to doe: your triall is when you must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up your <hi>Isaacke,</hi> when you must part with those things that are most sweete unto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, dead men are sencelesse, like Idols that the Psalmist speakes of: <hi>they have eyes and see not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 115.4.5. Psal. 135.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>eares and heare not, mouthes and speake not, feet and walke not, they have sences to</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne, but there is yet an inward eye, they


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15448:49"/>
want; they see no beauty in the wayes of God; therefore they thinke there is no such matter, because they have eyes and see it not, they have mouthes and taste it not, they relish it not, they smell no sweet savour from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints, when as the graces of the Saints have a sweet savour, <hi>like an ointment powred out, Cant.</hi> 1.2. So for feeling, they feele not, they are not sencible of the judgements or threatnings; the Law nor the Gospell move them not, they have hard and insensible hearts; the more insencible they are, it is a signe, they are more dead: the more sencible wee are of the threatnings or promises, the more life is in us.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, dead men are speechlesse;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.34.</note> there is no breath in them. <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</hi> The drie and empty channell drives not the mill, but a full streame sets it on worke. If the heart bee full of life, the tongue is full of good speeches, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. <hi>The words of the righteous are as fined silver,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is a treasure within them; <hi>but the words of the wicked are nothing worth,</hi> because their hearts are evill. As it is said of evill men, <hi>that their tongues are set on fire of hell</hi>; so the tongues of the righteous are set on fire by heaven. <hi>Esay</hi> 19.18. <hi>they speake the language of Canaan.</hi> In hypocrites there is loquacity as bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing meteors, and in Saints there is sometimes an indisposition by reason of some sinnes,


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15448:50"/>
which make them like to springs that are dammed up with stones and mudde. Yet judge not of them by such fits, but take them as they are in their ordinary course; the mouth speaketh out of the abundance of the heart. Every man is delighted in some genious operations, in things that are sutable to him; if there be aboundance of life, aboundance of grace within a man, he delights to speake of it: as all men are severally disposed, such are their speeches. Now all these are privative signes of death, I will adde one more that is positive.</p>

                     </note>I answer, when a man ceaseth to maintaine warre with his lust, and resists it not; when a man layes downe the weapons, when he seeth his lust is naturall to him, and therefore yeelds unto it, then it reignes in him. There is no man that lives the life of grace, but hee hath this propertie, that hee strives against all sinne to the utmost, not in shew, but in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; he strives against the occasions of sinne though they foile him; hee still maintaines warre against them, and so they live, and reigne not in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If every man out of Christ be in an estate of death, let us not deferre repentance,<note place="margin">

excellencies in naturall men, are but dead.

                  <p>Fourthly, if all out of Christ are dead,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 4.</note> learne to judge of the Ordinances of God, and the meanes of salvation, let us not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue nor over-value them; the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot bring life of themselves, no, not the Word, nor Sacraments; If yee are sicke and send for the Minister, hee cannot quicken you; the Ordinance is but a creature, and cannot give life.

are but dead Trunkes, as Pens without Inke, or Conduit-pipes without water.

same Equitie remaines still in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the cause of that was, because he was to come up with the rest, to remember the death of the first borne of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from their bondage, hee being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over thereby: It is now the same sinne to neglect the Sacrament, the Equity still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. Are yee so strong in faith as ye need it not? To bee absent from the Word, yee thinke it a sinne: so it is to be absent from the Sacrament; nothing can excuse you. If a master bid his servant do a thing, and he goes and is drunken, so that he cannot doe it, will it excuse him? If you have made your selves unfit to receive the Sacrament by commiting any grosse sinnes; the unfitnesse will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you. If a man hath an occasion to ride a journey, if he misse one day, hee will take the next: so ye if ye misse the Sacrament once, be sure to take it the next time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is <note n="*" place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred twice every Terme, and sometimes thrice.</note> devided here, that so if ye misse once, yee may receive it the next time; take heed therefore how yee neglect it. The end of the Sacrament is to worship God, to set forth Christs death, it is the chiefest part of God worship; therefore give it the chiefest respect. Now from hence see the necessitie of this life of grace: how can yee come to the Sacrament, if yee are dead men? Labour therefore for this life of grace. And thus much for the first point, <hi>that all men out of Christ are in a state of death.</hi>

The Scriptures you will not deny, yet you will be as hard to beleeve them, as you will be to beleeve that there is such a life; Wee will therefore say something, without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to perswade you that there is such a life as this.</p>
                  <p>First, there is a life which the foule and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits lives; as the Angels they move, act, and understand; though they eate not; there


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15448:54"/>
is therefore a life, besides this common life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, consider the matter of the soule, then yee shall see, that the soule lives such a life, as Angels doe; The soules of good men, leade such a life as good Angels doe; the soules of bad men, such a life as bad Angels. The life of beasts depends on the compacture, and Temperature of the substance, as the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doth upon the true extent of every string. With the soule of man it is otherwise; the soule lives first, and then causeth the body to live; it is otherwise in beasts, their soules and bodies live together. Besides it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the soule shall live, when as the body is laid aside; then it lives another life from the body: therefore it lives another life in the body. The higher faculties of the soule, the Vnderstanding and Will, are not placed or seated in the body, as other faculties are: the visive facultie must have an eye to see, the hearing facultie must have an eare to heare, and so the rest of the faculties must have their organs; but the Vnderstanding hath no such organ, it onely useth those things that are presented to it by the phansie. Our sight, feeling, and hearing perish, when their organs perish; but the superior faculties of the soule, weare not away, but the elder the body is, the younger they are. The soule lives now in the object, now in the subject: it lives in the things it is occupied about: As the Angels


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15448:55"/>
are said to be, where they worke, because they haue no bodies as we have, to make them bee locally there: so the soule it also lives, where it is occupied; as if it be occupied about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> then wee are said, <hi>to have our conversation in heaven.</hi> Take the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and faculties of reason, they sway not men; but the Ideaes, truthes and opinions that dwell in the understanding, sway men. There are three lives in man, there is the life of plants, of beasts or sence, and the life of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; I may adde a fourth, and that is this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, which is an higher life of the soule; Where there is an evill life, there is death, but where there is a good life, there is this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life: See it in the effects, for these are but speculations.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, yee see by experience, that there is a generation of men, that live not a common life, delight not in vaine pleasures, sports and honors (there is no life without some delights) their delights and life is not in outward things abroad; therefore they have a retired and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life at home.</p>

                     </note>I answer, that it is true, that superstition doth worke much like Religion, morall vertue doth many things, like true holinesse; and Common grace, doth much like true grace; yet it is no good argument to say, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a dreaming man dreames that he sees, therefore a living man that doth see, doth but

as hee: A picture is like a living man, yet it followes not that a living man is dead, because the picture is dead; it is no Argument to say, that because morrall vertue doth many things like true holynesse, therefore true holinesse doth them not: They may be like in many things, yet not in all things; the cause of all deceit is, because we cannot discerne of things alike, therefore I will shew you how these differ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, superstition makes men suffer much, as well as true Religion, yet they doe it out of a false opinion, the other from faith: the one doe it being helped by the holy Ghost, the other have a supernaturall helpe from Sathan that extendeth nature beyond his spheare; the one doth it from grace, the other from delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: the outward acts are alike, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles differ.</p>

A man is made a living man sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, though there are some previous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, yet the soule is suddenly infused; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner the Saints passe from death to life.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in morrall men the change is never generall, there is no new birth in them; but in the Saints, <hi>All things are new,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.18.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, morallitie doth never change na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but grace doth: the most wilde man in a country, the unlikeliest man of all others, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion makes him a Lambe of a Lion, though it were unprobable.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, what did mortall men? they went by divers wayes, to the same center; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were their end; <hi>Epicures</hi> thought one way the best, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> another; but the Saints seeke a happinesse, in <hi>denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> which helpes to perfect them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Lastly, common and true grace, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things alike, yet they differ in this; true grace doth things as a man doth naturall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving actions; as a man eates and drinkes with willingnesse and propensivenesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally, and readily; so doth not the other. Those who have onely common grace, doe all from respects and by-ends, their holinesse is but by flashes and by fits, it continues not; they are like violent motions, quicke in the beginning, and slower in the end; the higher they goe the weaker they are; but the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions of the godly, are as a stone falling downewards, which moves faster and faster, till it falles to the Center, where it would be.</p>
                  <p>Now we have done all this, there is not yet sufficient said, to make it sufficiently appeare, that there is such a life of grace; these and an hundred other Arguments and reasons, will


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15448:57"/>
not make naturall men beleeve, that many men live other lives than they. But when they see the life of holinesse blase in their eyes, they say it is but guilded over, it is but hypocrisie. These reasons may prepare and confirme, but they cannot perswade; we must therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there is such a life. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, Christ treates of this, that there is such a life; he <hi>tels Nicodemus,</hi> that hee must live it, and <hi>be borne againe</hi>; He wonders at it, how it can be, Christ therefore concludes in the 12. verse: <hi>If I have told you earthly things and yee beleeve not, how shall yee beleeve if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> that is, it must be beleeved, that there is such a life: sense beleeves it not, yet it is easier to beleeve it, because it is wrought on earth; others things are harder than this to beleeve, because they are wrought in heaven; though this be wrought on earth, yet it is hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and must be beleeved. And thus much for the first part of the doctrine; that there is such a life.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, in this common life of nature there must be temper of body, disposition of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: so in this life of grace; there is a frame of heart, a composition of soule, on which it doth depend; there are humors and ingredients of this life, and they are the things yee know: there is a realitie in this life as well as in the naturall life.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, as in the other life there is hunger and thirst, so is there in this; men who live it are sensible of paines, and refreshings, they

                  <p>Thirdly, this life of grace is a prevailing life, swallowing up the other 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

desired death: <hi>not to be uncloathed, but to be cloathed upon, that mortality might be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of life</hi>; that is, desiring death, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to be deprived of the comforts of this life; then I were unwise: I would not put off my cloathes, but to be cloathed with a better suite; I desire a life to swallow up this life; not as a Gulfe swallowes that which is cast into it, or as fire swallowes up the wood, by consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, but a life that swallowes it up, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection swallowes up imperfection, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of a picture swallowes up the rude draught, as perfect skill swallowes up bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or as manhood swallowes up childhood, not extinguishing it, but drowning or rather perfecting it that it is not seene. The life of grace being perfect, swallowes up imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he that lives the life of grace, hath the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of this naturall life swallowed up: For example; before wee live this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie riches, honours, and Gugaes; but the list of grace comming, wee have other kindes of comforts then: as a man that is to be made a Prince, contemnes the things hee before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. The weakenesses we are subject to, are swallowed up in this life: al sicknesse and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ar swallowed up in this: so are all our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and imperfections. This should teach us to set a high prize upon this life of grace; that we dye no more if we live it; that it is a life indeed, that it swallowes up this other life; compare it


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:15448:62"/>
with other lives, it far excels the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should move us to desire and seeke it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this life of grace must needes be more excellent than the common life, because it makes a man a better man, much better than he was, this puts man into a better condition: elevates and puts him into a condition equall to the Angels, and beyond in some respects. That yee may understand this, yee must know that every thing is made better, by mingling it with things that are better than it selfe, as Silver being mixed with Gold, Water with Wine, are made better than they were before. There are two things required to make a thing better. First, that that thing with which it is mixed, be of a better nature than the thing it selfe. Secondly, that there be a good union. Nothing puts so high a degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency into us as this, that we are united unto God; this uniting to God is the chiefest good. Secondly, this union betwixt God and us is a perfect union. There are many unions; as first there is a relative union, such as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and wife. Secondly there are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall and natural unions, as when two peeces of bords are put together, so that one touch the other: so when graine, and graine of another sort are mixed together; there is a nearer uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than this, when as water and water are mixed together: nearer than this, is the union that is betwixt the soule and the body, Such a


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15448:62"/>
union as this, is there betweene us and Christ: <hi>we are in him, as the branches in the vine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.1.2.</note> wee are incorporated and knit to him, this puts us into an higher degree of excellency: silver mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gold is better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if we could take the spirits out of gold, and make silver take the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of it, it would be much better. Wee put on the Spirit and quality of Christ, when as we live this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lusts which are most contrary to this life, puts us below men, and makes us worse than Beasts; this life puts us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond men, and makes us equall with Angels. All men desire some excellency which is done by adding something to them; some desire wealth, some learning, some honour. Consider then if yee live this life, yee goe beyond all others: nothing beyond Gods Image; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better to be united to than God: let this set the life of grace at a high rate in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; men do it not, and therefore they despise religion in its selfe, and in those in whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, yee have this advantage in this life of grace, it addes liberty to you, it makes you to doe those things that otherwise yee could not doe: it makes yee to pray, to repent, to beleeve, and to doe those things without which there is no salvation: looke on Christ. There are but few that can doe this: there are few that can delight in God, relish the word in its purity, take pleasure in the company


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:15448:63"/>
of the Saints: comfort themselves in the Lord their God; this life gives liberty, which is an addition of some perfection: it makes us to do things, that we could not doe before, and to doe them in another manner. A man having gotten an Art, hath liberty to doe those things which before he could not: as one that hath gotten the Art of logicke or geometry, can doe that which before he could not doe: as one in health hath liberty to doe that which he could not doe being sicke: water being hot, hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no liberty to doe holy actions, but this liberty of the life of Grace: the Spirit of life addes liberty to doe the actions of life. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spirit of God is, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> to doe things which before we could not; as one having an Art can doe things that hee could not doe before: This, though you prise it not, whiles your mountaine is strong, yet the time will come when yee will need liberty to pray, repent, and trust in God; and then ye will find the preciousnesse of it: this then sets a price upon this life of Grace, and should make you to desire it.</p>

of the soule, and the meanes to quench this life: take heede of estranging your selves from God, who is the principle of this life, take heed of dejections of mind, the cloudings that damp this life. This life is to be active, to act much in the wayes of God; when a man is cheerefull and vigorous, he lives a life of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so he that hath a quicke and nimble sence, and is forward and busy in good workes, lives most this life of grace: He that rejoyceth most in God, hath most comforts, most life; Take heed of the contraries. Idlenesse, sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessenesse, and barrennesse are contrary to life; take heed of them; take heed of sadnesse that rusts the wheeles of the soule, whereas joy doth oyle them. Doe all to further this life; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all that hinders it. Labour now to bee translated from death to life; that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us, is, that we thinke we are in a state of life, when we are not. Now yee may know whether ye are alive or no, by seeing whether yee are dead or no; But because yee may be certaine whether ye are alive or not; I will give you some positive signes of life to know it.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15448:64"/>
living men will converse with living men. Not loving the brethren, wee are in a state of death. Every creature must have an element to live in; a new life must have a new ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: evill men out of their companies are as Fish out of the water. Every life hath likewise a taste and appetite; a new life hath a new taste and judgement. <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.27. <hi>An unjuste man is an abomination to the just: and he that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way, is an abomination to the wicked</hi>: that is, one hates the thing that the other loves: he that is alive, the things which before he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he now hates: he abhors the things, that evill men delight in.

                  <p>Now seeing this life is so excellent, I will adde certaine motives to make you to desire it.<note place="margin">Motiues to stirre men up to desire and seeke this life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it is a happy life; and it must needes be so, because it is the life of God and Angels: it is that life which wee shall live hereafter; ye may live this natural life, and want happinesse. This life of grace and the life of glory differ onely in degrees, not in kinde; the competent judges of this are the Saints, who have tryed both. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15.16. <hi>If they had beene mindfull of that countrey from which they came, they had liberty to have returned; but now they desire a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contrey, that is, an heavenly.</hi> In a Heard of Swine, if some stray away from the rest, and returne not againe, it is a signe they have found a better pasture: so when men leave their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and returne no more, it is a signe,


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15448:69"/>
they have found some better things. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not then of this life as many doe; to be onely a privation, or a melancholy thing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meere mortification; this is a life, which hath its comforts, eating, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and delights; yee loose not your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures if yee live it, but change them for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: he that leades this life, dies as the corne doth; from a seede it growes up into many stalkes, hee gaines by this bargaine. Christ doth make an hard bargaine with none, he that deales with him, <hi>gaines a hundred fold.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 10.30.</note> If yee part with temporall wealth, yee have spirituall treasures for it: if you part with your worldly pleasures, ye have joy in the holy Ghost: have yee crosses, yee are sanctified in that which is better; loose yee this life, yee have eternall life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this life of grace hath that which every man seekes, it hath much pleasure. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. <hi>All her wayes are wayes of pleasure.</hi> Those who walke in the waies of God are full of pleasure; this life brings a double pleasure; first, the reward of it, secondly, the comfort in performing the actions of it. Every good worke as the <hi>Hebrew proverbe is,</hi> hath meate in its mouth; the living of this life, hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sufficient in its selfe, as appeares by this. All pleasures follow some actions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men desire life, because it is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of action: so men delight in new things


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:15448:70"/>
because as long as they are new, the intention remaines: The actions of this present life are full of change; and therefore of discomfort: but the actions of this spirituall life are constant and perfect; and those actions that are perfect, there is pleasure following them, as beauty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a good constitution, or as flame the fire. The actions of this life are perfect actions, &amp; the perfectest actions have the most perfect delight; the actions of this life are most perfect acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, therefore they have most perfect delight, because they are the actions of the best faculty, about the best object. All actions have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of their perfection from their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: these are actions of the soule, they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about God, therefore they are the best and highest actions. He that lives about the best object, greatest content doth follow: hee that lives this life, lives about the best object; therefore he hath greatest content, all the waies of it, are waies of pleasure. There is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Assiduity of consolation in this life, than in any other. In other lives, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humour hath his delights, but yet they are not permanent, because hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in transitory things; but hee that lives the life of grace, delights in things that are truly delightfull at all times: other delights are but delights at some times, in some places, they are not alwaies so: but he that lives the life of grace, pitcheth on those that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:15448:70"/>
so. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. <hi>A good conscience is a continuall feast.</hi> Other comforts may faile; a man may fall into affliction; riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures may be taken away, then the dayes are evill; but a good conscience is a continuall feast, that is, be a mans case what it will, his comfort is never interrupted. All other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are about sence, or things of this life, which are subiect to alteration; but this life and the comforts of it, admit no change. A man being sicke, hee cannot doe actions of health, they are restrained: so one in prison is not at liberty to doe what he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the actions of this life are assiduous, they cannot be interrupted: ye may <hi>pray continually, rejoyce evermore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.16.17.</note> yee may alwayes have communion with God.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this life is a life that is least indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of all others: it needeth least. Take a man that leades any other life, hee needs many things. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.41.41. this is shadowed in that of <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary: Martha busies her selfe about many things,</hi> she wanted many; but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had one thing that was profitable for all things,</hi> that removes all evills, brings all happinesse; and that is <hi>Godlinesse which is profitable for all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the comforts of this life are pure comforts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.26. <hi>I walke purely with those that walke purely.</hi> This is not onely to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the consolations of grace, but also of


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:15448:71"/>
common blessings, being the fruites of this life: there is no sorrow with them, there is a pure comfort without any mixture of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. God giving these blessings in mercy, they are free from mixture of discomfort; but being not the fruites of this life of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reached by sinne and sinfull meanes, or God giving them in his providence, not in his mercy, there is sorrow in them: yee may have riches, honours, friends, and all outward things, and yet they are not pure blessings, because Gods blessing is not mingled with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, it is a life most capacious of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: yee may give all the faculties of the soule comfort. Every creature according as his life is, feeles more or lesse comfort. Plants as they feele no hurt, so they feele no sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: beasts that have a sensible soule, feele more evill and good: a man that lives a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, not knowing the life of grace, is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of more good and evill, than sensible beasts; hee apprehends Heaven and Hell: but a man that lives the life of grace, is more capacious of comfort: here you may suffer your facultyes to runne out to the utmost. If ye desire wealth or pleasures, your affections must not runne out, yee must hold them in; else they <hi>drowne you into perdition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and pierce you thorow with many sorrowes.</hi> If ye affect hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treasures, if yee affect praise with


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:15448:71"/>
God, yee may be as covetous of them as you will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, let this move you to seeke this life of grace, because it is the most excellent thing of all other. All other things are subordinate to it; the utmost end is still most excellent: the end of warre is for peace, therefore peace is better than it; yee plow for harvest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore harvest is best: the end of all actions is for this life of grace. Why labour yee for foode, but to maintaine life? Why live ye but to serve your soules? Prudence is a steward to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life: as the steward provides for the family, that the master be not troubled with those meaner things; so prudence is a steward, that the soule may be occupied about things that are agreeable to it;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> 
                     <hi>that it may have its conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven,</hi> and with God. Pervert this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it destroyes the creature. Beasts living the life of sence, it doth perfect them, for that is their utmost end: man having reason, living as a beast, destroyes himselfe, because that is not his end; he that perfects himselfe as a beast, destroyes himselfe as a man: <hi>perfectio mentis est perfectio hominis.</hi> Let this stirre us up, to live this life: it is the utmost end of all. To be Lawyers, Physitions, and other callings, helpe us in the living of this life, yet they are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to it: drowne not your selves in subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate things; if ye doe, it is your destruction: therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that which is best in the end, (I take end now in another sence) is to be chosen above all things else. That is well which ends well. In this life of grace, yee have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which yee have no where else. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.4. <hi>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,</hi> that is, this life disposeth us to thinke of death the end of all, which to doe is wisedome, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29, <hi>O that they were wise, then would they consider their latter end.</hi> In other things the beginning is good, the end is bitter; but the actions of the life of grace are sweet, yee fare the better for them; the very remembrance of them is pleasant, and the reward of them comes not long after: All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>things are called perishing meates, Iohn</hi> 6.27. There is a parable in it: that is, they are as perishing meats, that are sweete in the palate, yet they passe away; but this endures unto eternall life, it continues. The worst thing in this life yee never repent of: as it is said of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for sinnes;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10.</note> 
                     <hi>that it is sorrow never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of:</hi> but the best things that yee doe in the other life, ye repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All other things that yee doe they may be sweet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; yet as it is said of drunkennesse, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.32. so may it be said of them, <hi>that they bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder,</hi> though they seeme sweet. The strange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is sweet: yet <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.4. <hi>her end is bitter as wormewood, sharpe as a two-edged sword.</hi> Goods

evill gotten are sweet for the present, yet <hi>their mouthes shall be filled with gravell, that got them.</hi> But on the other side,<note place="margin">Prou. 20.17.</note> the end of all the actions of this life is good: as it is said of <hi>Iob, that his latter end was more than his beginning, Iob</hi> 42.12. So may it be said of all those who live this life: <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Marke the perfect man and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> If a man being to die, and having ended his daies, should put all his honours, wealth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures into one ballance, and his good workes, all his faithfull prayers, all the actions of the life of grace into another, he would find them to be best. The bad man doth as the Silkeworme doth, winding up himselfe into his ill workes, he perisheth; the other winding up himselfe in his gracious actions, enters into salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, choose this life before all others, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause God is pleased with it, it being like himselfe;<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> as the creature is pleased with that which is like it. <hi>God is a Spirit and will bee worshipped in Spirit, and truth</hi>; he is a living God, and doth delight in a living man: wee our selves delight not in dead men, no more doth God: therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>We are exhorted to give up our soules and bodyes a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sacrifice to God.</hi> God regards not dead bodyes; bee yee living sacrifices, which is the act of your will, acting the duties of this life.

is to be in his presence, to goe his way, and to maintaine communion with him: this is when as men doe, <hi>audire et reddere voces:</hi> when there is naturall delight: when as they are in presence one with another; and therefore <hi>walking with God,</hi> and <hi>pleasing of God,</hi> are used promiscuously for one and the same thing: For, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22. <hi>it is said of Enoch, that he walked with God,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>It is said, that he pleased God.</hi>

God disposeth of all things in the world; is it not wisedome then to have him your friend? <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Iacob</hi> being to take his journey, <hi>Isaacke</hi> said unto him, <hi>God all-sufficient be with thee.</hi> God is all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; if yee have him, yee have all: In the creatures there is no such thing, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity in them, they are but as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, or as Starres to the Sunne. God is all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: all the happinesse of the creature, makes not men happy: All men seeke happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet they never finde it, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: All happinesse is in Gods favour; In outward happinesse you must have other compounded things. Christ rebuked them that counted her happy in the creatures, saying; <hi>Blessed is the wombe that bare thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 11.27.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Paps that gave thee sucke</hi>; No, saith Christ, these will not make a man happy; but <hi>blessed are they which heare the word of God, and keepe it</hi>;


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15448:73"/>
having God ye have all things; God disposeth all things, and giveth the comfortable fruition of them. Ye may have all outward things, and yet want comfort; Gods curse makes all mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, though yee have all that the creature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords; therefore give your selves no rest, till yee have got this life, without which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> losing Gods Image was not happy, because God was gone from him; yet hee had all the creatures which he had before. This life of grace brings us to that state, that <hi>Adam</hi> was in at first; this restores us to it; seeke not then your happinesse where it is not to be found. We all doe as the <hi>Prodigall did,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 15.13. to 20.</note> we get <hi>our portion into our owne hands, and goe from our Fathers house, and seeke for our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse elsewhere</hi>; but yee shall finde at last, that all else is but <hi>huskes</hi>: Thus the Saints have found it. This life of grace gives rest to the soule, all else in the creature is but <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi> Vanity is nothing else,<note place="margin">Eccles. 1.14.</note> but an insufficiency in the creature to give that content that wee looked for in it: as when we looke for water in an empty well, seeke for that in the creature that is not in it; wee see its vanity in the absence of the good wee looke for, and presence of the evill wee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not for. In God yee finde rest and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, such a tranquility as is in the Sea, when it is without waves; as is in the upper region

of the ayre, where no tempests are. Looke on the lives of men, who are taken up with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles when they are young, when they come to a riper age, greater things move them; when men are wiser, they feele the apprehension of higher things; when ye lift up your soules and keepe them on the wing, yee are freed from troubles and cares. <hi>Paul</hi> had a greater measure of this life than other men, his Epistles which doe <hi>transcribere animam,</hi> transcribe as it were his soule, declare as much: and hence was it that in all his troubles and afflictions he was full of constancy and comfort: the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly we live this life, the greater gainers shall we be.</p>

in the habit, and a knowledge in the act, which produceth actions: these are set downe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely.

The first knowledge is as sparkes raked up in ashes, the other as sparkes blowne up: the first is as the sap in the roote; the later like the sap that fills the branches with leaves and fruite: the first is a generall knowledge gotten by contemplation; the last is a practicall and actiue knowledge, a knowledge to practise.

that are sutable to them; We live in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements by well doing, as the creature doth by food: Good actions mainetaine life, it receives strength from well-doing: Set there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your selves to pray, to doe holy duties, be still praying, doing more and more; the more ye doe, the more life increaseth.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third meanes to get this life is to get faith. Faith helps this life; it is a life of faith, and it makes us to live this life by three several waies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, it gives a reality to the priviledges of life, and makes you see they are priviledges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: therefore is it that yee act the duties of this life, because ye beleeve that God is such a God, that ye have such priviledges, that yee are heirs of all things. If yee thinke that God is such a one as he is, in wisedome, power, and mercy; if ye intend, and minde the priviledges of this life, then will you live the life of grace: If ye doubt, and question with Atheists, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these things be but dreames, then ye intend them not and live not this life. He that beleeves saith, let me have God sure: the other saith, let me have that I touch and feele; but the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary things consisting in faith and hope I care not for. The more ye beleeve these things, the more ye are occupied about them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, faith drawes you on to action: and this life is but the acting of the duties of new obedience. Faith and perswasion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other things: as if one be perswaded that


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15448:78"/>
such a thing will hurt him, it produceth an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will, abstinence: if a man be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he shall dye without the Physition, he sends for him. So in all other actions, perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that which sets a man on worke. So in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actions, if we are perswaded that such a sinne committed wil not make our bodies sicke but our soules, we will not doe it; if we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded our soules shall fare the better if wee doe such a thing, this make us to doe it: being perswaded wee shall have a recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it produceth action, and the more action the more life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, faith doth it by fitting us for Christ, from whom our life comes: 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>he that hath the Sonne hath life.</hi> First, the Sonne of God infuseth life into him, to whom he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; the conjunction betwixt Christ and us is but relative: as betweene the King and the subject; when the subjects resolve to take such an one for their king, they are conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him; so when a woman resolves to take such a man for her husband, shee is conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him. The action of taking Christ, is to take him as a Lord, to serve him, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to have all comfort by him: hee that hath the Sonne in the relative union, shall have him in the reall union: the Sonne will quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you, as the soule doth the body. A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath the life of the Sonne of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me</hi>: all


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15448:78"/>
that I doe, Christ doth it in me: all that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth, the soule doth it: the body lives not, but the soule lives in it. After that manner Christ lives in us: not a good thought or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor any resolution or motion of the soule, but comes from Christ: being united to Christ by faith he lives in us. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.43. <hi>he that eates my flesh, and drinkes my blood, shall live.</hi> As flesh gives life to the body, so the Sonne gives it to the soule; To eate the flesh of Christ, is to prize him, to desire and long after him, which is after the spirit of bondage; to eate him, is to take him, to come to him, to have him for your God: In these two things stands the eating of Christ, First in prising him exceedingly, so as to part with any thing for him; and to take up his Crosse with all losses. Secondly, in beleving him to be yours, and you his: this eating and drinking of the body and blood of Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth our relative union with him, and then followes our reall union: the Spirit immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives this: he that doth the first, shall have the second.</p>

                  <p>I answer, yee see the old <hi>Adam</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted corruption to all his posterity, because they were borne of him; so those who are borne of the new <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, those who take him and beleeve in him, have grace communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by him:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45. to 50.</note> this new birth makes you <hi>as capable of Christ, as the other doth of the first

As in the actions of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, those who are to marry will not part upon any condition; they take one another for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, for poorer, for better for worse: after this manner must wee take Christ, the more yee take Christ thus, the more yee have the Sonne, and so yee live more the life of grace. All grant that this life comes by the Spirit; and there is no way to get the Spirit but by the Sonne. Yee must first eate ere yee can bee nourished; yee must fixe your eyes on his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as the wife doth fixe her eyes or her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: yee must seeke this life from the Spirit ultimately, but yee must first have the Sonne, and then yee have life: He must have the Sonne that will have this life; he must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth meanes to get and increase this life, is the communion of Saints. <hi>The mouth of


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15448:79"/>

The life of the body doth not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it selfe to others; it is otherwise in the life of the soule; the life of it makes others to live more: as Iron sharpens Iron, so one holy man doth another. See it by the contrary. In evill men who are dead there is an aptnesse to dead others, their words are as continuall drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings to put out this life; <hi>their tongues are set on fire of hell, Iames.</hi> 3.6. The tongue of good men is a cole fetched from the Altar, they have fire within them. When two lie together they keepe one another warme; there is action and redaction; which ingender heate: so it is in the communion of Saints; it is a powerfull meanes to get and increase this life. The tongue, the example and communion of the righteous is full of life, it is powerfull to make men live. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to <hi>Peter,</hi> saith, <hi>why compellest thou the Gentiles to live after the manner of the Iewes</hi>? he used not outward compulsion, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and life was a compulsion.

drawes out our secret corruption: He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to live this life, must resolve to withdraw himselfe from evill company, who are a strong temptation unto evill, and betake himselfe to the communion of Saints.</p>
                  <p>There is a difference betweene leading our selves into temptation, and being led into it: when you leade your selves into temptation, (as you doe when as you rush into evill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) you are out of the pale of Gods protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>If you touch pitch yee cannot but bee defiled with it,</hi> wherefore make your company good: this is an effectuall and powerfull meanes to beget this life in you.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.10.11.12.</note>

There is a speaking that comes neare this life, and is not it: that is, when as men heare and understand the way, and apprehend the things of God, but practise them not. Here is a proximity to this life, yet it is not this life. Let a man come so neare as that he thinkes he acts it, yet he is dead if he act it not: when he acts it, then he is made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man; and then hee thinkes and beleeves,


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15448:81"/>
that the wayes of sinne are evill, and that they are evill to him. When God doth convince us that such a thing is evill, and that it is evill to us, then we live and not before. A man having a businesse to doe, if all be done but one thing, the not doing of this one thing crosseth all the rest; but that being done, his busines is brought to passe: so in this life of grace; if a man have many offers of grace which doe not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him, this is not enough, if Gods helpe be absent: but when once he speakes, he doth fully convince and perswade us, and makes us to continew. As Sathan having leave, from God never gives over vexing man; so the Spirit of God doth never cease to keepe us in good things; and where there is this life, there the Spirit dwels.</p>

the understanding, Luk.</hi> 24.45. <hi>Hee opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures.</hi> When we speake to men, we sow as it were upon fallow ground which will beare no Corne unlesse God plow it. Those that saw the <hi>miracles of the Loaves, esteemed them not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.26.</note> because their hearts were hardned. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.18. <hi>They are alienated from the life of God, thorow the ignorance that is in them, because of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their hearts,</hi> that is, they are not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of sinne, and death, the word or the threatnings: when God takes away this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they are fit to harken; then comes light the beginning of life, which is the informing of the understanding, to judge righteous judgement.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15448:82"/>
there is no voyce but this that is able for to doe it: that's the scope of this Text. This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition may bee resolved into two parts. First, nothing else is able to translate men from death to life. Secondly, this is able for to doe it. As it is sayd of faith, that it justifies, and nothing else but it can justifie: so may it be said of this voyce, that nothing else can translate men from death to life, and this can doe it. To translate from death to life is nothing else but effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to perswade and change the heart: now nothing else can thus perswade and alter the heart, but this voyce of the Sonne of God. God himselfe frames the heart; it is as a curious framed locke; none can picke it, but hee that knowes the turning of it. God onely fits the perswasions to the turnings: mens perswasions are as one that will unlocke a locke with a wrong key. <hi>God onely can perswade Iapheth to dwell in the Tents of Shem</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 9.27.</note> Ministers cannot doe it. <hi>Esay.</hi> 57.19. <hi>I</hi> saith God, <hi>create the fruite of the lippes</hi>; that is, I make them to bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <hi>I create the fruite of the lippes for peace by my power.</hi> That this is so you may see by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reasons.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reasons of the point.</note>First, that it is so, see it by this; we speaking to the quickest, often times they beleeve not, but then others doe: the same sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, sometimes not. If man were the sole cause, the word would have the same effect at all times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:15448:82"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this is life, and God onely gives life: it is as the breathing of life into a clod of earth. It requires an almighty power to worke this in those that beleeve. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.19.20. <hi>The same power that raised up Christ from the dead, raised us up</hi>: it is an almighty action to give this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if it were not proper to Christ and his voyce to translate men from death to life, hee should loose his chiefest soveraignty:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.21. Rom. 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>hee quickens whom hee will: hee hath compassion on whom he will have compassion</hi>: If men could tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate men from death to life, then it would not be proper to God to doe it:</p>
                  <p>Lastly, as nothing else can doe it, so the voyce of the Sonne of God is able for to doe it. At the first creation all was made by the voyce of God; hee saith, <hi>Let there be light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and there was light:</hi> let him say to any man, follow mee, and he doth it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.9. he saith <hi>to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican sitting at the receipt of Custome, follow me; and hee left all, and rose up and followed him.</hi> Christ speaking to his eare and heart, made him to follow him; his speech was like the speech of <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Elisha, he followed him,</hi>

men effectually to turne from darknesse to light, and from the power of Sathan to God. It must be understood of the effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Spirit, because who ever doth heare it, lives: this voyce reneweth and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth men, translating them from death to life. Now this effectuall speaking consists in two things. First, in propounding the object, the truth to the heart. Secondly, in the perswasion of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the Gospel must be laid open to the heart, all things necessary to salvation must be manifested to it: then there must be light in the heart to apprehend those reasons which are propounded. The Scripture propounds things by authority: and when as things are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the holy Ghost doth kindle light, to apprehend them, which another doth not. Marke how <hi>Moyses</hi> beginning his booke, saith, <hi>that in the beginning it was thus, and thus God did</hi>; he doth not perswade them by arguments to beleeve it:<note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note> so <hi>Iohn</hi> begins his Gospel without perswasions, <hi>In the begining was the word, &amp;c.</hi> so the Apostles commission was, <hi>Goe and preach that Christ is Come;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.1.</note> 
                     <hi>he that beleeves shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 16.15.16.</note> 
                     <hi>he that beleeves not, shall be damned</hi>: The word of it selfe is sufficient authority: when the Gospell it selfe is thus propounded, then the holy Ghost kindles light in men. And when as the Gospell is propounded, and light kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, then this life is wrought. Now there


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15448:83"/>
are three degrees of working this life by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there is a stirring up of men, to attend to the voyce of Christ: many there are that heare, yet attend not. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The holy Ghost opened the heart of Lydia, to attend unto Pauls prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> We sow on fallow ground till the Spirit opens the heart to attend to the things that are spoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second worke of the Spirit is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and perswade effectually and fully. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Spirit shall convince the world of sinne</hi>: that is, it shall convince and perswade tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly: none can doe this but the Spirit. It doth also farther perswade men, that it is good for them to be convinced, and this is when the knowledge is full; when as all the corners of the heart are answered, and the minde resolved to practise: Hypocrites and civill men are perswaded, yet not fully; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never practise; if one objection of the heart bee unanswered, yee never come to practise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The last worke of the Spirit is to keepe this voyce on the heart, that it vanish not. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.21. <hi>The ingrafted word is that which is made able to save your soules,</hi> and none else. Men may attend for a flash, but the Spirit must ingraft the Word into the heart; which as a sprig ingrafted, growes bigger and bigger, and hath fruit from the sap: other men having


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15448:84"/>
truthes not fastned on them, they grow weaker and weaker.</p>
                  <p>To understand fully what this voyce of the Sonne of God is; ye must know that there is a double voyce. First, an outward voyce of the word which all heare. Secondly, an inward voyce of the Spirit. This I collect out of <hi>Esa.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Goe to that people and tell them, heare ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not understand; see yee indeed, but not perceive,</hi> that is, they shall have an outward hearing, an outward knowledge, but not an inward. There is a common knowledge which all those have, who live in the Church: and there is a knowledge that is onely proper to the Saints, which saves them. The differences twixt these two knowledges; that of hypocrites, and of them in sixth of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>; twixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge, and effectuall knowledge that is wrought in the hearts of the elect, are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, common knowledge is confused and generall; this is distinct, inward and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: that is, the voyce of the Sonne of God, speaking in the Ministry to all, may breed a knowledge of truthes in men; yet they apply them not to their hearts, and the turnings of them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. <hi>The Word is sharper than a two edged Sword, discerning the thoughts and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, piercing even to the dividing asunder the soule and spirit, and of joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>: that is, that Word of God that is lively


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15448:84"/>
indeed; that voyce of God that is effectuall to salvation, it is sharpe, it strikes not in gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall, but enters the inward parts. A staffe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter the flesh, it may bruise it; but the voyce of Christ enters like a two edged Sword, discerning twixt morrall vertues, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall things wrought by the Spirit; it distinguisheth exactly twixt the rectitude and obliquity of mens hearts: this is proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the saving knowledge of the Word. As <hi>nothing is hid from God, but it is naked to his sight</hi>; so it is to his word: See if the word be distinct to you, else you know nothing. A man never knowes any thing, till he knowes the Elements, parts and grounds of it; the voyce of the Sonne of God onely makes you know things thus particularly. So in other things yee know not till you know particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith; a man is not a Physition, that knowes things in generall, in the grosse, but he that knowes them in particular. This is not to be a Physition, to know that such dry meates are good for a moyst stomacke, unlesse he also know dry meates and the Symptomes of a moyst stomacke: so it is in the knowledge of the Word. To know what regeneration is, is not enough, except yee know the parts, the kinds and signes of it. To know that <hi>none are translated from death to life, that love not the brethren,</hi> is not enough,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.14.</note> except yee know the brethren and love them. To know, that <hi>hee


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15448:85"/>
that is in Christ hath crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts thereof,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> is nothing, except yee know that yee your selves have crucified it. This particular knowledge is that which makes manifest to a man the secrets of his owne heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. that is, the voyce of the Sonne of God, discerneth the secrets of the heart, to know things particularly that are in it.<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>The sheepe distinguish the voyce of the sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, from the voyce of a stranger</hi>: when men come to heare, they heare the voyce and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish not the sound, because they want this particular knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this hearing of the voyce of the Sonne of God workes a quicke sence, in the hearts of those that heare it, which the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward voyce doth not: and this followes the former. Let knowledge be particular, it workes quicke sence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. the word is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>lively in operation</hi>: now life consists in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and motion; the voyce of Christ speaking effectually breeds quicknesse. <hi>Sola individua a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt et sentiunt,</hi> A knife in generall cuts nothing, the particular knife cuts. To know in generall you are sinners, have corrupt natures, offend in many things, workes nothing; it is the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on your particular sinnes that workes, this makes men tremble. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36.37. <hi>Peter having told the Iewes that they had crucified Christ, that pricked them at the heart.</hi> As it is of sinnes, so is it of comforts, particular comforts only worke.


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15448:85"/>
If one can say, I am thus and thus, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort followes: so particular threatnings make men sensible. When God said to <hi>Adam, Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I said thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not eate</hi>? this made him feare.<note place="margin">Gen. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </note> The word doth breed a quicke sence: they who have not this true voyce sounding to them, (<hi>Esay.</hi> 6.9.) <hi>In hearing they doe not heare, and seeing they doe not see; their hearts are fat, their eares heavy, and their eyes shut. Rom.</hi> 11.8. <hi>God hath given them the spirit of slumber</hi>; that is, when as men heare his voyce in a common manner, they are as a man in a slumber: it stirres them not: their hearts are fat; that is, they are sencelesse: for fat is without sence. The property of them that heare in an ineffectuall manner is this; they have a spirit of slumber, they are as one hearing a tale, when as his minde is otherwhere. If the things propounded were naturall, they would heare them well enough; but they are spirituall, therefore they are dull of hearing them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, which followeth the second; those that heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, have experimentall knowledge, the other is but speculative. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.9. <hi>Wee preach wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to those that are perfect: such wisedome, as eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man; but God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth it to us by his Spirit</hi>: that is, the cheefest in knowledge, have not seene with their eyes,


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15448:86"/>
or heard with their eares; but those that heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge which others have not. This experimentall and saving knowledge hath triall. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>I write unto you fathers, because you have knowne him that was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>: expound this by the 33. of <hi>Ezekiell,</hi> 33. <hi>When this commeth to passe, then shall yee know that a Prophet hath beene amongst you</hi>: that is, when I shall doe this, they shall know expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally that there was a Prophet amongst them. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>wee know that wee are of God</hi>; that is, wee know it experimentally; they can say of this, as it is said in the 1 of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>That which we have heard, that which wee have seene with our eyes, that which wee have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the words of life, delare we unto you. David</hi> takes it as peculiar to himselfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name will trust in thee, for thou Lord hast not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken them that seeke thee:</hi> that is, they that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally know thee will trust in thee: for thou never faylest them that trust in thee: they know it by experience. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Desire the sincere milke of the word that you may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: if yee have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> We find in the Saints a longing after God: they desire him, which others doe not: thus did <hi>David</hi>: Moreover they have assurance of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which others have not; and this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance comes from sence: <hi>optima demonstratio


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15448:86"/>
est a sensibus</hi>; the best demonstration is from sence; as he that feeles the fire hot knowes it best; tasting breeds longing; assurance from experience breeds certainty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, effectuall knowledge that is bred by the voyce of the Sonne of God, makes men approve and justifie the wayes of God, makes them to relish them: this followes the other; when men have tryed them they approve them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>The Spirit quickens, the flesh profiteth nothing; the words then that I speake, they are Spirit and life.</hi> Christ having spoken, <hi>that his body was meate indeed; many were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it</hi>: then hee said, <hi>The Spirit doth quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> that is, yee accept not my words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause yee have not the Spirit, yee have but flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, a common knowledge; my words are spirituall, and you are carnall, therefore they doe not relish you. These words are otherwise interpreted by some: that is, these materials profit nothing without the Spirit; but the other is undoubtedly the meaning, for so it is through the Scripture: the Spirit profits, that is, saving knowledge wrought by the Spirit: men not having it, doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. It cannot be otherwise; where the voyce of Christ doth sound effectually, there they justifie this: <hi>Wisedome is justified of her children, Luk.</hi> 7.35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the feete of them tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wayes of God, that they are beautifull to them, they are vile to others. The Scripture often toucheth this, that when as there is but a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon knowledge, men relish not the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. they tast not the word: the spirituall part of the word crossing them, is bitter to them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The word is compared to a sweet savour; to many it is not so, to some it is the savour of death to death</hi>: it is a savour diffused through the house, many there are who abhorre it, and being guilty of death it leades them to death: In others it is the savour of life; that is, they smell a sweetnesse in it, it brings them to life, to heaven; the word being powerfully taught, there comes a savour: some smell sweetnesse in it, others doe not so. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35. <hi>When Christ shall come, the hearts of many shall be opened to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or disapprove him: therefore he is said to be set for the fall and rising of many</hi>: So when he came <hi>some said he was a good man,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first, is selfe-wisedome; this is a great impediment from hearing the voyce of the Sonne of God: selfe conceitednesse hinders men much, because it breeds a despising of the wayes of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse with him</hi>: therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any man seeme to be wise in the world, let him become a foole that he may be wise</hi>: that is, let him lay aside that wisedome which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth pride in his heart. <hi>Michals</hi> disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in every one of us more or lesse, <hi>shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised David</hi>: so men chalke out a way to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in which they will goe, they will seeke their owne wayes, and will not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15448:90"/>
to the Law of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnall mind is enmity with God, for it is not subiect to the Law of God, neyther indeed can it be.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, the Apostle speaking of imaginations, saith, <hi>that men with them build up themselves against God, and will not alter their courses.</hi> The greatest opposition is in mens minds: take a man that hath a true opinion, it is easy to remove his lusts, but false iudgements are as bulwarkes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods wisedome. Men will doe thus and thus because they thinke their state is good. <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees come not to Christ, Luk.</hi> 15.1. but Publicans and sinners came: so it is with men now, doe we lay open their sinnes unto them, yet they will not bee perswaded: men will bee righteous of themselves, and will not bee perswaded that Christ must <hi>bee made unto them righteousnesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> 
                     <hi>and redemption, and wisedome.</hi> This opinion of our selves is a great impediment, this contemnes the Way of God, and fashions out our owne wayes; this contenting of our selves with our present estate makes us to erre: therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.21. <hi>Cursed are the proud that are alwayes erring from thy Law</hi>: Selfe conceit makes men erre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second impediment is custome: men have beene used to such wayes, and will not alter them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.12. <hi>the woman of Samaria was much held off with this argument.</hi> Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to teach her the doctrine of salvation;


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15448:90"/>
                     <hi>Art thou greater,</hi> said shee, <hi>than our father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob that gave us this Well</hi>? This opinion that our fathers have gone this way, and it is transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, hinders men much; men cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure newnesse. <hi>Lot</hi> is taxed for this by the <hi>Sodomites, Gen.</hi> 19.9. <hi>This fellow came in to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorne here, and will he now bee a Iudge?</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>Paul preaching at Athens, the Athenians asked, What new doctrine is this that thou preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est?</hi> Men being accustomed to a way, it winns their opinion; men having once judged, are loth to judge againe: custome winnes their affection. Change is troublesome: men having gone long in a course they will still plod on in the same tract. Custome of our fathers, or country, or place where wee are, our owne custome makes us loath to forsake it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Similitude is a great hinderance. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Pharaohs heart was hardned because the Magicians did the same miracles, that Moyses and Aaron did</hi>; So similitude hinders men from imbracing the wayes of Christ, and God. Men seeing Papists austerity like our mortification, their suffering like true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, they are perswaded of their wayes, as we are of ours; so for civility, when as men see it so like religion, as a sparke is like the fire, they imbrace it: All deceit is from simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, false wares having the same dye that true have, deceive the buiers: so falling starres


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15448:91"/>
are like other starres. When wee see some men that professe religion to be false hearted, we thinke all are so: wherefore <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. The Apostle prayes, that <hi>They might abound in all knowledge, and iudgement to discerne of things that differ</hi>: This proximity makes us decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, false experiments hinder us much; some experiments of the workes of God, that should draw us nearer to him, if wee make false use of them, separate us farther from him; As if God afflict and restore againe, or keepe us from affliction, our hearts are hardened. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.15. <hi>When as the Frogges were removed, Pharoah his heart was hardned</hi>: rest made him harden his heart: so many times it makes men slight the word, and afflictions which God layes on them. We may see this in Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Mariners; none more ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne dangers than they, because they have often escaped; they delude the workes of God that should draw them to salvation. Rootes will make the weeds grow againe, not being taken heed of.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The long suffering of God should draw us to repentance,</hi> but it doth not so. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>In the last time shall come mockers, walking after their owne lusts,</hi> and saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Where is the promise of his comming? for all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation</hi>; that is, men shall feele nothing, apprehend nothing that God doth; iudgements being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15448:91"/>
they second the Word; being eluded, they hinder us and it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fift impediment is ignorance; men know not the wayes of God, therefore they doe not imbrace them. <hi>Ioh</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou hadst knowne the gift of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who it is that speaketh to thee, thou wouldest have asked of him.</hi> There is enough in religion to make men love it, if they knew it: there is vertue in it, there is beauty and profit in it. <hi>Esa.</hi> 57. <hi>There is a peace in it;</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The sixt impediment is in consideration: men doe not consider the things they might know: if men would deduce one thing from another, and doe that they know, they might be brought to God. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2.3. <hi>Yee have seene,</hi> saith <hi>Moyses, all that the Lord did before your eyes, in the Land of Egypt, upon Pharoah and his servants: yee have seene those great signes and miracles which hee did, yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and eares to heare untill this day</hi>: that is, yee have not profited because yee have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. We thinke if that we had lived then, wee had beleeved, yet wee see how few of them did beleeve: we beleeve the Scriptures, yet what inconsequence is there in mens lives, because wee doe not consider things. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration helpes to perfect mens actions; it is as a circular line; one part helpes the other. If wee looke backe and examine our actions, it helpes; want of it hinders.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The seventh impediment, is a certaine stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and obfirmation of minde, whereby a man is setled to continue in such a course that is pleasant to him, and all that crosse him in it are enemies to him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>the flesh is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Spirit,</hi> it crosseth it: one reckons not a man his enemy unlesse hee crosse him.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15448:97"/>
abide in you, ye shall aske what yee will, and it shall be done unto you</hi>: When ye attend to the Word, if yee are affected with it but for the time, it is nothing; except it continue with you it will not profit you; you must <hi>doe as Mary did; shee layed up all the sayings that shee heard of Christ, and pondered them in her heart, Luke</hi> 2.51. The Disciples often questioned of Christ: which proves, that they pondered his Words in their hearts: So the Nobles of <hi>Berea, they searched the Scripture</hi>:<note place="margin">Act. 17 11. Gen. 37.11.</note> so <hi>Iacob hee noted the saying of Ioseph and laid it up.</hi> Yee doe not heare thus if you doe but lend your eares for the time, if yee worke it not upon your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ye profit not. The reason why there is so much preaching, and so little profit, is for want of this. There are two kinds of ill hearers: the first are such as heare as Swine, and trample all they heare under feete; the second, such as heare as Dogs, snarling at the doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if yee offend in eyther of these, yee heare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse. Of all the foure grounds that was worst which received not the Word. When men heare the Word there is more than a naturall forgetfulnesse in them, the Divell helpes it. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.23.24. <hi>He that heares the Word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals</hi> it not, or practiseth it not; <hi>is like one that beholdeth his face in a glasse, for he beholdeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and goeth away, and straight way forgetteth what manner of man he was</hi>: yee must recall it before yee can practise it, else yee will be like

to those that behold their face in a glasse, and wipe not away their spots.</p>
                  <p>Be not therefore forgetfull hearers: and for this, first recall and repeate what yee have heard when yee are gone: Secondly, practise it afterwards; there is a blessing promised to mindfull hearers, there is a curse denounced against those that are forgetfull, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.15. <hi>If yee know these things, happy are ye if you doe them,</hi> but there is a curse for you if you doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; God will make you to heare, and will not give you his Spirit. Regard to prize the Word if ye will not be forgetfull. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. <hi>those that did not like to retaine God in their knowledge,</hi> those that did heare the Word and not regard it, <hi>God gave them up to a reprobate sence,</hi> to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciousnesse <hi>to doe those things that were not convenient,</hi> not being able to profit by it. The ancient Fathers much pressed the repetition of Sermons, and one of them useth this similitude: A man that comes into a pleasant garden, will not content himselfe with the present sent only, but he wil carry some of the flowers home with him; So in a cold day, a man will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to heate himselfe at anothers man fire, but he will carry away some fire with him to keepe him hot at home.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15448:98"/>
in performing of holy duties as will not warme your hearts.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee have formerly propounded three things unto you; the first was, to shew you what wee are out of CHRIST; and that is, wee are dead men: the second is, what wee gaine by CHRIST: and


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15448:102"/>
that is, Life eternall, with all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and these two wee have finished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third is, what wee must doe for CHRIST; And that is, <hi>Wee must deny our selves, take vp Christs Crosse and follow him:</hi> and for this end I have chosen this Text. <hi>And hee saide unto them all, If any man will come after mee, let him deny himselfe, and take vp his Crosse daily, and follow mee.</hi> As if hee should have said, all expecting any benefit from me now, I looke for this from them againe, to deny themselves, to take up my daily crosse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</p>
                  <p>The occasion of these words, was this. CHRIST told them before, that the Sonne of man must suffer many things, goe through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles and drinke this Cup: now from this, he makes this consectary: Hee that will bee mine, must doe the same things that I doe, though not in the same measure; <hi>He must deny himselfe, hee must take up his</hi> daily crosse, as I doe dye on the Crosse, and follow mee. The maine Poinct intended is this: Who ever will have benefit by mee, must follow mee. Now there are two maine impediments that hinder men from following me; The first is Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or any thing that a man lusts after; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee that comes to me must deny himselfe. The second is crosses; hee that followes mee meets with many troubles, crosses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Divell and the world; now hee


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15448:102"/>
must not bauke the way or decline them, when as he meeteth with them, but hee must goe thorough with them, and every day beare them; therefore hee addes, that <hi>hee that will come after him,</hi> must not onely deny himselfe, but <hi>likewise take up his Crosse daily and follow him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first point of Doctrine that ariseth from the words is this.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>must deny himselfe.</hi> Hee that comes after mee, that is, he that will bee saved by me, united to me, made one with me, must deny himselfe; that is, though there be no precedent condition required of those that come to Christ, (wee Preach, that if any man will come in, hee shall be saved, what ever hee hath beene; there is no antecedent condition required but to desire CHRIST, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is athirst come, let whosoever will come and taste of the waters of life freely.</hi> That is, none will take him, none will come in but such as thirst: there is nothing required before hand but to take him:) yet yee must know, that when yee have taken him, you must bee his; hee must bee your Lord, and you must bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to him: this none can doe without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying himselfe.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For first, if we looke into our selves, there is great reason to deny our selves, because if we doe it not, wee destroy our selves. The flesh is to the Soule, as a disease is to the body; If ye give one that is sicke of a Dropsie, drinke; or one sicke of a Feaver, Wine; you please the humour well, but ye kill the man; so it is here. <hi>Galath.</hi> 6.8. He <hi>that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reape Corruption</hi>; that is, by satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it wee reape Destruction: hee that soweth to the flesh reapes destruction; that is, destruction comes not presently, it is as seed that is sowne, it comes for the most part after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And this answers an objection that might be made, that we see the contrary. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>God</hi> sayth, <hi>Why will yee dye O yee house of Israell?</hi> That is, though you see not present death, yet your sins will bring death. As it is said of uncleannes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.18. <hi>That it leads to the Chambers of death</hi>: so may it be said of any other sin, it leades to death. But now to deny your selves, is life, because by so doing ye sow to the spirit. <hi>And he that sowes to the spirit; shall of the

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in regard of <hi>God</hi> there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we should deny our selves. For what is it to have a <hi>God,</hi> without worshipping him as <hi>God</hi>? If we doe not deny our selves, we set not <hi>God</hi> above our selves. Looke upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, &amp; you shall finde, that <hi>God</hi> hath none above himselfe. <hi>GOD</hi> may doe all things for his owne ends; but looke to your selves, you are made for another end; keepe the order of nature, doe as the order of things requires, you must be subject to him, your desires com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in competition with what GOD requires, you must deny your selves.</p>

                     </note>To this I answer, first, that in every man there is a naturall selfe-love, therefore we doe not destroy it, but say, that a man may seeke himselfe, because God hath planted it in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the plants which hee hath planted we must not root out; we have Gardens in our hearts, and we must weed them: grace destroyes not nature but elevates it. Nature is the Worke of GOD: (<hi>Opus Naturae est opus Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, GOD will not binde us to that which is simply impossible, therefore GOD will not have us not to seeke our selves; yea he hath commanded us not to kill our selves,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the motives used in Scripture, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for the Kingdome of God is at hand:</hi> and <hi>Feare not him that can kill the body and doe no more,</hi>

                     <hi>but feare him that is able to cast both soule and body into Hell</hi>: shew that a man may love himselfe. Wherefore wee doe not take away this selfe-love but rectifie it; wee doe not dry up this streame, but turne it into it's right Channell: wee extirpate not this plant, but guide it into the right way; as Musicians breake not the strings, but rectifie and tune them. Wherefore wee affirme, that a man may and must seeke himselfe so farre as it is good for himselfe, and no farther: This religion doth, it rectifies our love, teacheth us to deny inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections, and to serve God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart. Before regeneration, a man seekes himselfe by doing things that are pleasant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh, he doth the thing he sees and handles. But a man that is sanctified, seeks his happinesse in God, though he looseth his goods, his life, and all that hee hath, his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse is in God, he is resolved to doe or suffer any thing for God.</p>
                  <p>If none can have any interest in CHRIST without denying himselfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> then joyne not both together: make no conjunction whereas God hath made an absolute disiunction; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all that is in you, the whole body of sinne,


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:15448:105"/>
all it can desire; deny every request of the flesh, every desire of it without all exception: Christ saith not, deny your Covetousnesse, every such particular sinne, but <hi>your selves,</hi> every sinne, stocke and branch, both cannot bee joyned: if there be any pleasure, any thing that yee delight in, have yee any commodity in such a thing, yee cannot be saved without a Divorce from it, when it comes in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with GOD. So if there be any Crosse that yee will not suffer for GOD, yee cannot be saved. Put case a man will not endure Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie; if he will endure this, yet he will not loose his estate: if this, yet he will not loose his liberty and life, such a man as this denyes not himselfe. Those who would follow CHRIST, must doe as the Apostles did, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.28. <hi>Forsake all and follow him</hi>: GOD will try us all one time or other, whether we will forsake all and follow him. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.22. Hee that will follow CHRIST, <hi>must have a single Eye</hi>: that is, if the eye be fixed onely on <hi>God,</hi> without joyning any thing with him, then it is single; it is said to be single, in regard of the object; when as that is single. When wee can be content with GOD though we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, then is our eye <hi>single, and we are light</hi>: but if our eye be wicked, that is, eyeing of our credit and estate and the like, all <hi>the body is darke</hi>; that is, we are Vnregenerate. <hi>Iames,</hi> 1.8. <hi>A double-minded man, GOD hates</hi>: the

This joyning of both together, makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands loose their Soules. Many that live in the Church will not abandon all, they will doe many things to satisfie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Considerations; this doth destroy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, having eyes to GOD and themselves too.</p>

When ye deny your selves, (<hi>Suppositio nihil ponit.</hi>) yet suppose that a man could cast himselfe into hell for Gods sake, he would be a gainer by it. Our good is in our GOD more than in our selves, even as the beame is more in the Sunne, than in its selfe. The perfection of every thing is the end of it. Take all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, mixt bodies and the rest, let them have their end, and they are perfect: God is the end of every man, we are made, redeemed, and live for this purpose, that wee might be his alone: We cannot then be miserable whiles we have our end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.

If it were not so, GOD should contradict himselfe, in bidding us love him above our selves: Therefore our good and happinesse is more in GOD, than in our selves. Let a man therefore deny and lose himselfe, for Christ and the Gospel he gets by it.</p>

In your selves it cannot bee; for how many things doe yee want? Wee are so indigent in our selves, that wee are faine to step out to other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In the Creatures it cannot bee; because they are inferiour to us, and worse than our selves: They were not made for that end, for to make us happy, but to helpe us. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the mutability of the Creature, shewes that wee have no happinesse in it: it is like brittle Glasses that are soone broken. Againe, if they did continue, there could bee no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in them; for they are but Vanity. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.21. <hi>Turne not away from following the LORD, for then should you seeke after vaine things, which will not profit; for they are vaine.</hi> Goe through all things: Men, women, riches,

honours, any delights pleasing the fancy, there is nothing but vanity in them: that is, there is an inability in them, to give that satisfaction that is expected. From this wee say, a Well is empty, because wee looke for waters in it, and finde none. What needs there a change and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of things, if there were not an empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Creature? What needed there such a multitude of them if they were not empty? Besides, consider that GOD can make you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py without them. If yee have the Sunne, no matter for the Starres: though yee have them without the Sunne, yet it is night. It were an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie thing to deny our selves, if we were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this. Were wee in SALOMONS case (who saw all that is under the Sunne, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of outward things himselfe, yet in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.2.3. he saith, <hi>They are all but vanity</hi>:) it were an easie matter to perswade us to deny our selves. If a chast wife were perswaded, that there is no worth in him that solicites her to uncleannes, it were easie for her to deny him. Now adde this to the rest, that all we have said perswades not, but when God sendeth a light into the heart; and that is the reason that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny speake of this, but few practise it.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, there is much equity in it, that you should deny your selves; because <hi>Christ</hi> hath redeemed and bought you of your selves.

Paul</hi> considered that <hi>Christ</hi> gave himselfe for him, so that hee stood upon nothing, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himselfe in all things, that hee might live to him. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Wee thus judge, that one dyed for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves, but unto him, which dyed for them and rose againe.</hi> Consider this yee that come to the Sacrament; ye must not doe all for your selves, but for CHRIST, and what advantage will this bring to Christ? Let men examine themselves and yee shall finde, that few live to Christ, most to themselves: Otherwise, why are not men more affected to Gods glory, and the Churches good? Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der CHRIST will have his end; yee must live in him, else yee shall have no interest in him.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, consider what yee doe, when yee yeild to your selves; and when as you deny


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15448:109"/>
your selves; When as ye yeeld to your selves, ye strengthen the flesh: denying your selves, you strengthen your selves, and the inward man: the more ye yeeld to the Spirit, the more beauty ye have; the more ye yeeld to the flesh, the more deformity. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The fruits of the flesh, are adultery, fornication, uncleannes, and the like,</hi> which bring death: but <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, are joy, peace, long-suffrings, gentlenesse, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance; against which there is no law.</hi> Looke to your selves; the fruits of the flesh, are shame, misery, corruption, death; the fruits of the Spirit, are life, grace, and glory: yeelding to the flesh yee strengthen the disease: the wisest way is to strengthen that which will sticke by us. Yee must maintaine the Spirit, crucifie the flesh, which is as the sea; having gotten ground, it is hardly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: therefore snib not the Spirit, quench it not, lest it speake lesse and lesse, till it speake not at all: yeeld to the whisperings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and quench it not: deny not any request the Spirit makes.</p>

The desires of the Spirit doe not easily rise; wee must take paines with our hearts for good desires; fleshly desires are hasty.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, know it by the satisfaction you give it: doth satisfaction of your desire, make you more heavenly minded; it is right: but doth it make you earthly minded, and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to holy duties; then the desire is from the flesh.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, know, if there be some selfe-respect that doth carry you, so farre yee goe and no farther: that respect being taken away, ye end. Doe you it in secret and constantly; even then when ye are sequestred from all other respects, and have nothing else but Gods glory to stirre you up to doe it? If the heart be iust, wee doe it when we have no other end in it. Are yee angry with your selves, when ye neglect Gods businesse? Are ye angry with a Sonne, because he neglects God, or is it because of his loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and dissolutenesse; because hee takes ill courses, and would waste your estates? Many men are zealous for sinnes against themselves, for sinnes that preiudice themselves: As Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are angry with such as rob the Church, and have Impropriations, and sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly too; but when the Pulpit rings of nothing but this, it is a signe that it is onely out of Selfe-respect.

An humble man is willing and content to bee translated from one estate to another: hee wonders he hath so much; hee will be trampled on for GOD.

After a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, he reckons another thing himselfe, than he did before; the Spirit is now predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, he is himselfe: doing Spirituall things, the Spirit is Lord of the house; the flesh may come in as a theefe, but there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, when as it comes thus, and when as it comes as a Lord: When as the Spirit is a mans selfe, his hold is in heaven.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, learne to know CHRIST aright, that will make you deny your selves. Christ is worthy all love; this knowledge of Christ will make you deny your selves, not of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but out of a love to him. A friend that adventures his life for us, is worthy of all wee can doe: Is not CHRIST then worthy of all you can doe and more? 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Paul</hi> reasons thus with the <hi>Corinthians; Is Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? Was Paul Crucified for you?</hi> Or, <hi>were you Baptized in the name of Paul</hi>? If Christ doth all for us, wee must deny our selves for him. Looke on all that he hath done for you, and what priviledges you have by him; learne to beleeve, it will make you to deny your selves. <hi>Paul</hi> went through many things, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he trusted in the living God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Moses cared not for the wrath or favour of Pharaoh, because hee beleeved, Hebrews,</hi> 11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and know, that there is a realitie in the things wee have by Christ: let them not bee as things onely in the fancy, but bee affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with them. We rejoyce in an estate which we possesse, and in honours we injoy; because wee have them. By Christ <hi>wee are Kings, and Priests, and heires of all, Revel.</hi> 1.5, 6. If you beleeve this, then Faith begets Love in us, which makes us willing to part with all. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Paul</hi> complaines, <hi>That every man seekes his owne, and not the things of Iesus Christ</hi>; that was for want of


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:15448:115"/>

So as wee love Christ, it is no matter what wee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the last meanes to helpe us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selves, is the manner how wee should deny our selves: Bee peremptory in denying the requests of the Flesh, barre up the doores, give the flesh no audience; nothing is better than a peremptory will, if it bee well set; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse, if it bee ill. When <hi>Ioab</hi> would have perswaded <hi>David</hi> to slay <hi>Abner, David</hi> gives him a peremptory deniall; saying, <hi>What have I to doe with you, yee sonnes of Servia</hi>? So Christ gave <hi>Peter</hi> a peremptory deniall, when hee would disswade him from his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; hee saith to him, <hi>Get thee behinde mee Sathan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 16.23.</note> The flesh is of your old acquaintance, that hath bin borne and bred with you, and therefore is ready to deceive you; wherefore looke to it. <hi>Act.</hi> 21. <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>to them that would disswade him from going vp to Ierusalem. What doe yee weeping and breaking my heart?</hi>

their expostulation with him weakned the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of his intention, and softened his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Bring these meanes to particulars, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasion, let them not remaine in general: You that heare me now, examine your selves; none that heare me this day but had need par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to deny himselfe: some humours hee hath that he must deny; give not over till thou hast done it. This will scowre out the staines out of your Soules, labour therefore for to doe it: Put case, that satisfying such a desire is pleasant, yet denying of it will bring you more pleasure and profit; there are none that gaine by sinning, and none lose by serving God: You are gainers while you lose your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit for God, or your riches; he will either give you more, or else hee will give you more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the little which you have. Are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained? God will give you longer and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger liberty from the yoake of Sinne: lose you a momentany delight? God will give you a stronger delight. A lust being removed, there is a blemish wiped away, every lust is a spot on the soule; If yee suffer a lust to continue, that yee are indulgent to, it defiles you, it makes you indigent: Lusts cause want. Beeing brought under the power of a lust, yee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Tyrant. Againe, what ever your hearts are set on, and you will not deny your selves in it; if yee belong to God yee shall bee cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in it: your strong affections will bee your


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:15448:116"/>
strong afflictions. <hi>David</hi> was crossed in his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solon; Absolon,</hi> in his Kingdome; <hi>Amnon</hi> in his <hi>Tamar.</hi> Againe, if you will satisfie your lusts, there is no end of it, yee must be alwaies adding fuell to them, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the fire. Consider, that in this, our heart is deceitfull: wee being minded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in things, though it bee but for a time, wee will not easily be brought to judge aright of them afterwards, wee judge not then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bribe: and our judgements being bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, they are then easily corrupted. Take heed therefore of Custome: this is hard to be resisted: the flesh will expect the same enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment from us at the last, as it had the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third time. Custome doth prejudice us much; it intends the originall Corruption; it leads us captive with violence: being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to any lust, know that it is hard to renounce it, because custome addes unto its strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When we have judged already of a thing, we are loath to iudge againe. But now my Brethren, consider, if yee erred once, that will not excuse the second errour: Custome is, but <hi>Vetustas erroris,</hi> the antiquity of errour; Gods Spirit must bee the rule of our lives: Custome is an ingagement to us, to continue in those things wherein wee should deny our selves: So the opinion of men, is a hinderance to Selfe-deniall; having used such a course we will not alter it; if we doe, men wonder at


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:15448:116"/>
it; this keepes men off from selfe-deniall. Wherefore that your hearts deceive you not, remember this caution; Take heed of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, God will have it so, that wee may beare witnesse of the truth: Words are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God will have men tried; and that they cannot bee without Crosses: Therefore 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Heresies must needs come, that those who are faithfull may be tryed</hi>; that the good may be distinguished from the counterf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this must needs be so, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thinges themselves. Men cannot run on in obedience to Christ without oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A faithfull Christian man must reprove others as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did, and then it may cost him his life. It may cost us our lives and losse of favour, (as it did <hi>Moses, Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>Who endured Pharaohs wrath,</hi>) for stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out in good causes. In many actions wee may and shall be censured; for wee must be just to men, and upright to GOD, and not be byassed a wrong way; and for this we may bee opposed. The Sabboths must bee kept though some losses may come by it; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other actions must be done, wee must speake for Christ, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did, which cost them Imprisonment, and so it may doe us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, looke on the world, and there is a necessity that wee should have crosses, if wee will follow Christ. For, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.19. <hi>The world loves her owne, and hates them who are Christs</hi>; they are resisted, and cannot resist


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15448:117"/>
againe. The world puts crosses upon the Saints, and as if they were not forward inough of themselves, the Divell helpes them forwards: Hee sets their tongues on worke, <hi>Iames,</hi> 3.6. <hi>Their tongues are set on fire of Hell</hi>; hee sets their hands on worke, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Divell shall cast some of you into Prison</hi>; that is, men by the Divels instigation shall doe it.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it must needs be so, in regard of mens conditions and themselves; they must have crosses to prevent sinne: Christ the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard sets Dogs on his sheepe sometimes to barke at them, and if that will not serve the turne, to bite them too: Partly, for sinnes present which they contract.

                  <p>Now as the wayes of God are full of crosses, so they have much difficulty in them; and that for these reasons.</p>

What is in man, in common or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature? The wayes of God are above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, above our reach and up the hill; they are more difficult to corrupt natures: all Gods wayes are contrary to it, and it to them; there is a contention, a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety betweene them, and so a great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Lastly, looke to the variety and change wee must run thorow: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.21. <hi>Wee must want and abound, beare good report, and bad report</hi>; It is hard to beare prosperity; as hard as it is to drinke much wine, and not be giddy: It is hard to beare adversity and not to stoope; hard to beare scorches without shrinking; some can beare want, but aboundance makes them leave God: many can beare good report, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with bad report: some can doe both, but yet they will not loose their wealth: some can indure that, but not imprisonment: to goe through thicke and thin is hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                  <p>But now you may aske mee two questions.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 1.</note> If this bee so, how comes Christ to tell men; <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.30. <hi>That his yoake is easie and his burthen light?</hi> how is that true, <hi>Prover.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That all the waies of wisedome are waies of pleasure?</hi> Why promise yee so much joy and peace in Religion, if there be so many crosses following it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:15448:119"/>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> 1</note>To this I answere, First, that the wayes of God are pleasant to any man that is right, to one that is renewed. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Wee preach wisedome to them that are perfect</hi>; that is, to them that are upright. So the wayes of God are pleasant to those that are upright, and able to judge of them: yet they are not so to others. If I say that good meate and drinke are pleasant, it is true, and you will all agree to it: yet it is not so to a Sicke man: So the light is very comfortable, yet to sore eyes it is burthensome: So Gods wayes are pleasant, yet to men having sore Eyes, sicke Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and distempered affections, they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Gods wayes are pleasant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whereas other wayes are bitter. Gods wayes bring pleasure and content, they are pleasant in themselves; therefore they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so: but things that are pleasant by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, are not alwayes so: As the pleasure of Sinne, <hi>is but for a season, Hebr.</hi> 11.25. and by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of satisfying the lust; but <hi>a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a continuall feast</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. 15 15,</note> at all times Gods waies are a burthen and yoke to the flesh, but to the Spirit they are easie.</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Object.</hi>
                     </note>But you will object, If the wayes of God are difficult and full of crosses, it will discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men to be religious; how shall wee runne the wayes of Gods Commandements with cheerefulnes, seeing they are so full of crosses?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:15448:119"/>I answer, that though the wayes of God are in themselves difficult, yet they are easie to those that come after Christ, and that in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First; every one that comes to Christ hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other spirit and heart given him, that makes him with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>To delight in the Law of God concerning the inward man.</hi> I will say of this as Christ answered <hi>Peter,</hi> when as he asked him, who should be saved if rich men were not: <hi>this is impossible</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>with men, but it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible with God; Matth.</hi> 19.26. That is, such a man cannot change his owne heart, but God can, and then the wayes of God will bee pleasant: God can give you another nature, and they will bee easy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, though they bee difficult in the crosse, yet take altogether, then there is pleasure: take therefore the reward and gaine with the labour. The merchant indureth much, yet the hope of gaine sweetens all: a covetous man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures much labour, hath a hard lodging, fasts much, but yet the gaine contervailes all. <hi>Finis dat amabilitatem medijs,</hi> The end sweetens the meanes: the hope of harvest makes the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans labour pleasant. So it is with Christ; he is pleasant if you put all together; if you looke to the joy and reward as well as to the crosse: looke on them as on weights in the ballance: if the weights be equall, they stirre not; but put more weight into one scale, then the other


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:15448:120"/>
though it seemed heavy before, yet now it is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> light. So it is with these crosses; in themselves they are heavy, but compare them with the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, the end and reward, they are but light; <hi>Our afflictions, which are but for a moment, purchase us a far more exceeding weight of Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to runne the wayes of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements with our owne strength, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; but having another strength more than our owne, it is easie. It is hard for a Child to goe up the staires himselfe, but if a strong man takes him by the hand, it is easie: though these wayes be hard, what if the Holy Ghost helpe you, then they will be easie. A man that lookes on an artificiall thing, he wonders at it, and cannot tell how to turne his hand to doe it; but if he once get the art, it is easie; so it is with us; before we are in Christ, all is hard to us: but if we are once in him, all is easie. Looke to the Apostles, they are shie at the first of every thing, of suffering for Christ; but afterward they indured any thing, even whipping, and death for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, it is hard to part with that which we prize and love much; but when as we are perswaded; that there is no such thing in it as we thinke there is, then it will be easie for to part with it. No man grieves much, that the flowers that he hath in his hand, wither: that he loseth counters or shadowes: such are the things that we see and have, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.6. <hi>they are


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15448:120"/>
but as flowers</hi>: our eyes being opened to see that these things are so, it is an easie thing to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteeme them; to one that is humbled this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; he that hath felt the burthen of sinne to bee heavy, will find Christs yoake to bee light; the Divels yoake is a hard and heavy yoake, he that hath felt the bitternesse of sinne will thinke Gods wayes to be pleasant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, consider to whom we doe all that wee doe: <hi>as David sayd to Micol.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Wee doe it to the Lord</hi>: this makes all easie: this made all easie to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 21. <hi>When as Agabus told him, that he should be bound at Ierusalem,</hi> he tels them, <hi>that he is not onely ready to be bound, but likewise to dye at Ierusalem, for the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> A souldier doth much more, when as he seeth his Generall looking upon him; a good servant wil worke out of his heart, when as his masters eye is upon him, especially if his master hath a good eye: consider then that we doe all for Christ, and this will sweeten all.</p>
                  <p>If this be so,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> that the wayes of God are full of crosses and difficulty, then learne from hence, to account of so much beforehand, and prepare for it, before ye enter into those waies of God: take heed of <hi>Baruchs</hi> fault, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 45.5. <hi>Looke not for great matters for your selves: in the world ye shall have affliction; Iohn</hi> 16.33. <hi>but in Christ ye shall have peace</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looke therefore for all in heaven. Remember ye must not take


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:15448:121"/>
Christ onely as a Saviour, but you must take him as a Lord, as a husband; you must have a wedding garment, a conjugall affection, and be divorced from all other things, that so you may take him thus: yee must take him as your husband, for better, for worse, with losses, and crosses; your will must be subject to him in all things. If to be Christs Servant were onely to give him a cap and a knee, he would have many that would serve him; but you must obey him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>His servants you are to whom yee obey, Rom.</hi> 6.16. There are servants which you call Retainers; which doe their owne worke on the weeke dayes, peradventure on the Sabbath they come to their Master and serve him; thus most are Christs Servants; they will serve him on the Sabboth perchance, but at no time else; but as on the Sabboth, so at all times else you must deny your selves. In other marriages <hi>error per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonae,</hi> doth nullifie the marriage; so doth it when wee take Christ: it is an error in our judgements, not to know what he is; and that is the reason why wee so quickly fall away from him: wherefore every one that lookes for any interest in Christ, must consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before hand, and cast his eyes on all his comforts, on that which is pleasant to him, and resolve to part with it for him; yea, hee must looke on bitter things, on the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of others, and make account of disgraces and persecutions if hee will follow Christ: If


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:15448:121"/>
better come, doe you <hi>reputare in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ucrum,</hi> count it over-plus. <hi>Caesar,</hi> when as hee was goeing to fight, would usually tell his Souldiers, that the enemies were as many more as they were, that so he might make them more resolute and audacious; If you meane to follow Christ, looke for a rainy day. It may bee it is a faire morning, but yet we know not what the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will be: <hi>Nescis quid serus vesper vehat.</hi> Shall a man goe to sea, and not looke for stormes? Shall a Souldier goe into the warres, and not looke for enemies? Forecast this therefore, lest going with 2000. you are met with 20000. and overcome, your resolutions being too weake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if the wayes of God are full of crosses and difficulty, then it is not the way to heaven that most men goe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that common road of pleasure and jollity which most men treade in, is not the way: the true way is <hi>per diverticula,</hi> a by, a narrow way which few men follow. If we finde our waies full of jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wee have cause to suspect them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Woe unto you that laugh now, for yee shall weepe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: ye that are full here, shall hunger hereafter:</hi> This loosenesse in following Christ is not the way. My brethren, if yee are going to any City, and yee are told before hand, that in the way to it, there are many narrow brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, many brakes to goe thorough; that there are many vagrants to devoure you, many sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15448:122"/>
to allure you; if ye find no such thing, ye may well suspect that yee are out of the way; So if ye find no such opposition, no such crosses and difficulties, no such strong lusts in the way to heaven, it is a signe yee are out of the way: <hi>Whoever will live godly in Christ Iesus, shall suffer persecution:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tels <hi>Timothy</hi> here, that he <hi>hath knowne his persecutions and afflictions</hi>; and then he concludes, that <hi>Whoever in this present time,</hi> or in succeeding generations <hi>will live a holy life, must suffer for it</hi>: A man may suffer and do much for Christ; but <hi>Paul</hi> tels him, hee must goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>suffer persecution,</hi> for Christs sake and the Gospel.</p>

Many would be willing to doe much, but it may cost them their estates: then they favour themselves, and will sleepe in a whole skin: But if a case comes, that yee must stand against Popery, and for justice against indirect courses, stand to it though persecution and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment come; turne neither to the right hand, nor to the left hand: that is, there are many stops and lets in the way which God hath chalked out unto us; yet though there be Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it, ye must not step out of it; ye must go on, yee must grapple with the crosse and not goe out of the way: if yee balke those crosses or if yee sit still and do nothing, yee provoke God against you, as much as for your evill deeds. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I know thy workes and suffrings,</hi> (saith Christ.)

this obedience which you owe to Christ is not simple obedience, but passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hath more difficulty and excellency.

Consider, that in Gods cause if ye suffer not for wel doing, ye shal suffer for ill doing; else there were an inconsequence in that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. <hi>It is better to suffer for well doing, than for evill doing.</hi> If ye suffer not evill with men for well doing, yee shall suffer of God for evill doing.

proportion our labour to the worke: wee tell you of this not to deterre you from comming to Christ, but to excite men to take paines an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearable to the worke. Christ told his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they <hi>must deny themselves,</hi> that they must take paines if they will follow him; and this we tell you in his name: wee would have yee know the worst before hand: many thousands lose their soules, because they thinke that lesse will serve the turne, that there needs no such strictnesse: no fallacy of Sathan deceives men more than this. If a man come to buy a Iewell that is worth 500 l. if he bids but 400 l. for it; he goes without it, as well as if he had bid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, because hee comes not to the full price of it: So he that will purchase heaven, he must bid the full price of it, else he goes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: as good never a whit as never the better (as we say.) If a man be to lift a burthen which is as much as hee can doe with his whole strength, if he put but part of his strength to it, he cannot stir it, hee were as good never to touch it: so it is here. It were better for you to doe nothing, than not to doe enough; for if ye lived still in wickednesse, it might parhaps humble you; but when as men doe but a little, but yet not enough, they see not their misery: better not to do at all, than to do things thus by halves. Sathan deales with men, as men with children: they take away gold and silver from them, and stop their mouthes with rattles and


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15448:125"/>
counters, so Sathan, because mens consciences must have something to satisfie them, suffers them to doe something, but yet not so much, as they should. Pitty it is to see so many lose their labours: they come very neare, within a step or two to heaven, and yet misse it: many there are which do much, like the young man: yet some thing is wanting, that also must be had, els there is no Salvation. Why is there so little change in men, but because they thinke that lesse will serve the turne? This cold, overly and customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry performance of holy duties marres all; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider but this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that it doth you no good at all: what good did the <hi>Laodiceans luke-warmnes doe them</hi>: they had as good bin cold: yea, <hi>God wisheth, that they were either hot or cold: Rev.</hi> 3.15. What good did all that <hi>Amafiah</hi> did to him; seeing that he did it not with a sincere &amp; perfect heart? These dowbaked services (as I may so stile them,) these carkases without life; these slight services profit not: therefore there are conditions added to them in the Word: prayer prevailes, <hi>If it be fervent: Iam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>If thou beleevest with all thine heart, Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Effectuall faith; diligent hope, and fruitfull love:</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.3.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 1.3.</note> It is a good observation of Divines, that God loves <hi>adverbs,</hi> better than <hi>verbes</hi>; well doing, above doing: those that <hi>came to the wedding, not having wedding garments, were shut out, Math.</hi> 22.11.12.13. as well as those that came not: those that offred strange fire, as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and their company, were consumed,

as well as they that did not offer at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, consider the nature of the thing, what it is to be religious. Is it an easie thing to turne nature? to worke a change? Is it easie to get ground of a raging lust? It is as hard as to get ground of the Sea. Consider the difference betwixt the Law and us; <hi>That is spirituall, wee are carnall: Rom.</hi> 7. Consider the distemper of your affections and know your selves; all that we have in us is either common or corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Gods graces are beyond the one, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the other: must we make these duties of religion to be onely in the by? Prayer, keeping of the Sabboths, are to most men but as things in the by, the streame of their affections runs in an other channell. There is another thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us than this; <hi>we must love the Lord with all our hearts, and strength, Deut.</hi> 6.5. This is it which all must do; they must love God with all their strength, else they are not worthy of him. There is a qualification required of all that are saved, he is not worthy of Grace or Heaven, that seekes them not with his utmost indevour. The difference twixt <hi>Cains</hi> &amp; <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifice was this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3, 4.5. The one did it negligently: brought the worst of his fruits; the other brought the best he had.<note place="margin">Ier. 48.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Cursed is every one that doth the worke of the Lord negligently</hi>; that is, contenting himselfe with the outward performance of it, doing it as a taske, and being glad when it is done and over: to doe it diligently, is to worke with an eye to that which it tends to, and to obtaine the


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15448:126"/>
end. The end of prayer, is to quicken you to performe holy duties; when you obtaine this end, then is your prayer diligent. To do things onely for shew is nothing, the effect and end is all: you esteeme not your servants works unlesse they obtaine their end: there is nothing that you esteeme, the end of it being not done: What is it to pray, the end being not done, men not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built up by it? <hi>Iude</hi> 20. <hi>We must build up our selves in our most holy faith, praying in the holy Ghost.</hi> A cold formall performance doth but hurt us, breeds more coldnesse and deadnesse in us. In habits, the more imperfect the acts are, the more they weaken the habits: the duties of religion coldly performed, weaken grace. Let a man accustome himselfe to write carelesly and crookedly, it marreth his hand. Let us therefore do all we do to God with diligence and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: consider that those whom you thinke least needed for to do it, did so: their diligence should stir you up. You know <hi>that Iacob wrestled with God all night; Gen.</hi> 32.24. and so should you wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle with him with strong prayers: <hi>Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe spent many nights in prayer</hi>:<note place="margin">Luk. 6.12.</note> looke upon the prayers of <hi>David,</hi> the fastings of <hi>Daniel</hi>; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove all others, looke upon <hi>Paul,</hi> you may see him in <hi>watching, in prayers and in fastings often</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.27.</note> he had a continuall strife with his heart, <hi>to bring his body,</hi> that is, the deeds of his body, into subjection, <hi>I keepe under my body</hi> (saith he) <hi>and bring it into subjection,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. My body, that is, the sinfull lusts of my body, must bee brought


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15448:127"/>
downe; I must go thorow fighting till I have the victory, <hi>else I shall be a cast-away</hi>; I shall else have onely an outward shew, but yet bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing accounted of with God. Consider this, if a little diligence will not serve the turne, adde more; if prayer will not doe it, adde fasting to it.<note place="margin">Matth. 17.21.</note> 
                     <hi>As there are some divels that will not be cast out without fasting and prayer</hi>; so also are there some sinnes. Make the plaister fit to the disease. Complaine not with the sluggard, who puts his hands in his bosome, and doth nothing at all; or doth not proportion his labour to the worke. Lesse labour would serve the turne, if our soules were as dry wood, but they are as greenwood; there must be much blowing ere they will bee kindled. It is hard to get our soules to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hard to keepe them on the wing; we must <hi>continue in prayer, and that instantly too.</hi> Men are ready to give over,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.12.</note> and to sit downe, but you must continue. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>We must watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with perseverance</hi>; there must every day be a new winding up of the soule; there is a spring of sin in us, so there must be a spring of holy duties, we must doe them constantly: you have daily new crosses, and impediments, therefore you must mend your pace in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bee more diligent; you <hi>must be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, and not slothfull. Rom.</hi> 12.11. Doe your owne worke, <hi>up and be doing, and the Lord shall be with you,</hi> 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 22.16. God will deale with you as he did with the Eunuch,

It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it comes from heaven, because it is not a whit agreable with our natures. It is a pure and no leaden Lesbian rule; it is a straite rule opposite to us in all our obliquityes: It is not from the policy of men, for if it were, what end should they have in it? There is no content in it, a man must deny himselfe, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie every member, and hee must have crosses too. Againe, a man must not thinke to have many following him, not to bee Captaine of Companies; here is nothing that will draw men after him. If Christ had done as <hi>Cyrus</hi> did, who proclaimed, that if any man would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, if hee were a husbandman hee would make him a Gentleman; if a Gentleman, he would make him a Noble-man; then men would have flocked to him. This justifies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion against the dunghill gods of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15448:128"/>
against the Mahometane religion, that tels men, what women, and what pleasures and rewards they shall have if they follow it: this argument therefore is a marke of the holinesse and purity of our religion. Miracles they do but excite us, they do but as the Bels that call us to the Sermon, they cannot worke faith within us; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.17: <hi>That comes onely by hearing and reading this Word</hi>; there is nothing in this that doth sute with our nature: these inherent markes are they by which we know it to be the Word of God. Wee propound onely the object, we doe not propound sillogismes: wee tell you onely what it is. <hi>Moses</hi> in the beginning of Genesis propounds only what God hath done, he propounds no arguments to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it: so the Apostles come with a naked message; <hi>He that beleeveth shall be saved, he that beleeveth not,</hi>

                     <hi>shall be damned.</hi> In other sciences, and so in all things else, there must be principles else wee should run into infinites. If one should aske you, how know you colour?

So if one aske you, how know you whether such a weight bee true, you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare, by the standard: but how know you the standard to be true? Onely by it selfe. But this is an argument that the Scripture comes from Heaven, because there is nothing in it, that pleaseth men. <hi>Nihil hic humani,</hi> there

Whence is it that religion is so hard? All difficulty is from some disproportion and disagreement; and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty here, is from the disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Law and us: wee cannot bend the Law to us, but wee must winde up our minds to it. As we say of griefe, that it is a reluctancy of the will; so there is a reluctancy here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the corruption of our nature, and the Law; and this breeds the difficulty: One of them must needs yeeld. If you put fire and water together, there is no quiet but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall strife, till one of them get the victory; then all is quiet: So it is in sicknesses; Let a man have a strong disease, and a strong body, hee shall never have any rest, as long as they both continue in their strength: But let one of them get the victory, then there is rest and ease: If nature get the victory, then we have our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health: If the disease get the victory, yet we are at quiet: and hence are those, <hi>lucida in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalla,</hi> before death. So it is here; if lustes get the victory, then there is peace indeede, such a peace as it is; men have rest and content in their forlorne estate: but if grace get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, then there is a perfect peace. To have quietnesse and sweetnesse in religion, is to


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15448:129"/>
come to an agreement; and without this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there will be no facility: the way to make it easie, is to heale your natures.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:15448:131"/>
to do or suffer with all our hearts, or willingly, what ever he commands, at all times, and all manner of wayes. Thete are foure things in this definition, which expresse what it is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ.</p>

The reason for which we <hi>were deliuered by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from the hands of our enemies, was, that wee might serve him without feare, in holinesse and righteousnesse before him all the dayes of our lives, Luke</hi> 1.75. Let the passage be what it wil, safe or dangerous, pleasant or difficult, by poverty or aboundance; let Christ leade us thorough good report &amp; bad report, we must follow him. I put in the definition, to do or suffer; suffering is but an higher kinde of action, to do, though you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it: Suffering of it selfe, (as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher well observeth) is not commendable; but to suffer in doing Gods will in simple obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is to obey without any difficulty.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, you must doe this with all your hearts, and willingly: this is expressed in the Scripture in 3. tearmes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>to love, serve


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:15448:132"/>
or follow God with all your minde, with all your soule, and with all your strength.</hi> I chose this Word, with all your hearts, the rather, because it comprehends all the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, to serve God with all your mind, is to search his will, to plant on it, and to know it: some there are that follow <hi>Cephas,</hi> others that follow <hi>Paul</hi>; addicting themselves to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: there are diverse opinions of men; Some thinke this good, others that, without looking to Gods will: this is not to follow Christ with all our minde: When we submit our minds to his, and make his minde to be ours, then wee follow him.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to follow God with all our hearts, is to affect that which he doth, and all that hee doth affect; when as all that he doth is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us; when as we see his Image in his word, and in his Saints, and follow it: men follow the actions in which they see a beauty and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to follow God with all our strength; (by which we must note the executive powers and faculties) is to do all that we do with all our might, and by Gods direction, nothing against his will or liking: he that serves God thus with all his heart, when any thing is suggested con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods will, hee saith; I know my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will, I depend on him, I will follow his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and nothing else: this is to follow him with all our hearts.</p>

                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:15448:132"/>I adde, to follow him willingly: it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe the action commanded, but we must follow him, as the sheepe doth the bough, with readinesse and willingnesse. Being right, it comes from the regenerate part, every rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man findes a disposition to Christ, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging after him, inclining to him as the yron doth to the loadstone, or the stone to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Many there are that follow Christ, and hold not out, because the Principle is not good.</p>

True it is, that he went to the stake willingly, else his death wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he glorified God had bin no Martyrdome; true it was, his flesh was unwilling for to do it, yet his spirit overcame it; remember this, that you must doe it cheerefully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Christ would have men know what he expects: as the proclamation was made


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:15448:133"/>
to the Iewes, that <hi>if any mans heart fainted, hee might goe backe, and returne to his owne house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; (Deut.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.3.) So Christ deales with us; hee tels us the worst before hand; to see whether wee will goe backe or no. Christ deales with us, as <hi>Naomi</hi> did with <hi>Ruth</hi>; when shee had intreated and perswaded her to leave her, and goe backe to her owne Country againe, <hi>Ruth·</hi> 1.28. When all would not doe, and when shee saw that shee was stedfastly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to goe with her, then shee left speaking. Christ tels his followers what they must looke for: If they are willing to undergoe it, then hee takes them, else hee takes them not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, wee must follow him all manner of wayes; that is, inwardly and outwardly: In both these there is a difficulty.</p>
                  <p>There is a difficulty to serve him in the spirit; many an action commeth, that if it were to be done in the outward appearance onely, it might be well put off: but to doe it in secret, this is hard: when as the Conscience saith, such a thing must not be got; such a thing must be done, such a lust must bee subdued; such a duty must not be omitted, this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but you must professe Christ, weare his livery, and shew whose you are: In many things it is easier to doe the spirituall, than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act: As <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whosoever is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>even in this adulterous


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:15448:133"/>
and sinfull generation, of him shall I be ashamed when I shall fit in my glory.</hi> To professe what a man is in such company, in such a place, is not much; but you must professe Christ at all times, in all places: In <hi>the midst of an adulterous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> You must thus follow Christ, else all is nothing. And thus much for the first thing; what it is to follow Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wee come now to the object and example which wee must follow, and that is Christ. And here; first, we must follow his Example. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee must follow his precepts.</p>
                  <p>First, you must follow his example; doe as he did, set him up as a patterne of Imitation. It would be infinite to shew you all his graces: yet I will name some particulars wherein you must follow him, that so we may not be all in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, he abounded in love, which he shewed in his readinesse both to give and forgive. Hee shewed his love in giving, in that hee loved men so, that hee gave himselfe for them. (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.35.) Hee saith, <hi>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</hi> For his love in forgiving, he forgave those that did him the greatest wrong, hee had compassion on the soules of men, and on their bodies too; For their soules, he groaned to <hi>see them as Sheepe without a Shepheard: (Math.</hi> 9.36.) So for their bodies hee fed many thousands of them often times.</p>

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:15448:134"/>Secondly, <hi>For the glory that was set before him, he endured the Crosse, and despised the shame. (Heb.</hi> 12.2.) that is, hee saw God and his glory, and then the good and evill speeches of men were nothing to him: hee eyed the glory of God, and despised the glory and shame of men: as you may see, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 23.8.11.) by comparing them both together. <hi>When as Pilate sent him to Herod, Herod was exceeding glad when hee saw him, for hee was desirous to see him of a long time; because hee had heard many things of him, and hee hoped to have seene some Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle done by him; (Luk.</hi> 23.7. to 12.) But Christ despised that glory which hee might have gotten, hee would neyther doe nor speake any thing before <hi>Herod; Therefore Herod and his men mocked him:</hi> Here hee despised the glory, and the shame too: when as much was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from him, hee neglected all; and so must we.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thridly, hee was exceeding humble and meeke; <hi>Learne of mee, for I am meeke and lowly in heart</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> This his humility appeares in this: First, that he excluded none, no not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Secondly, hee did <hi>not render rebuke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi>; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. Hee endured all. Thirdly, in that hee was ready to part with his right and his life. Fourthly, in that he <hi>washed his Disciples feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, he was diligent in his calling pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and privately; hee went abroad, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15448:134"/>
upon all publike and private occasions, ready to take all opportunities to doe good: hee takes occasion to comfort the woman of <hi>Samaria at the Well; (Iohn.</hi> 4.) so when as hee saw them striving for the <hi>upper place at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hee takes occasion to discourse of humility: (Luk.</hi> 14.) He did consider the end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee came. This was the end of all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to doe good. It was his delight to doe Gods will: all hee did, it was Gods Worke, hee did it to glorifie him: and for the good of men, which was an other end wherefore he did it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, hee was ready to suffer any thing, to be despised, to undergoe any thing at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleasure: he subjugated his desires to his Fathers, and hee did rejoyce in it. (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>I thanke thee O Father, Lord of heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these thinges from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to Babes and Sucklings, even so Father; for so it seemeth good in thy fight.</hi> It had beene more for <hi>Christs</hi> honour, to have had wise and great men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, but hee rejoyceth in this; that <hi>God had hid him from those, and revealed him vnto Babes, for that was his Fathers will.</hi> So we must rest contented with any thing, if it bee Gods will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Christ likewise <hi>fulfilled all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; (Math.</hi> 3.15.) he was full of zeale for his Fathers glory; follow therefore his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15448:135"/>
in all these. And not onely his example, but his precepts too. First, beleeve in him; this is <hi>the great Worke of God, this is the worke hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, (Ioh.</hi> 6.29.) <hi>To beleeve on him whom the Father hath sent.</hi> This is the first precept. The second precept is, <hi>Repent for the Kingdome of God is at hand: (Math.</hi> 3.2.) The third is, to <hi>abound in love unto one another</hi>: Follow Christ then in these his precepts, and in his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>If then all that looke for any interest in Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> must follow him; then in the first place, learne from hence not to bee auricular but reall Disciples; doe not make a profession, get not knowledge in the braine onely but act it too. This is the difference 'twixt Christs and other mens Disciples; if a man follow <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> or any others, it is enough to know and hold his tenets: but he that will follow <hi>Christ,</hi> must follow and doe his precepts, must imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him. The difference betweene Divinity and other Sciences, is this: in other Sciences if you understand them it is enough; but in this it is not enough to know it, you must doe it. This is like lessons of Musicke, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know them, but you must practise them: it is like a Copy of writing; you must not onely reade it, but you must act it, and learne to write after it. Wee must not onely know what temperance, patience, and love are, and the like; but you must act and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15448:135"/>
them: wee must beleeve and undergoe the Crosse, if wee will belong to Christ: <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and hath learned of the Father, commeth to me.</hi> God makes us fit to follow Christ, hee declares the truth, and bowes the will: he teacheth the Creatures, the Bee, and the Storke to do thus and thus; he puts a secret instinct into them, which makes them doe that they doe; and so hee doth with his Children: hee makes them of Wolves, to become Lambes; hee makes a thorow change in them: It is doing, that makes you Christs Disciples; if it were but to know, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Consider what yee practise, and how farre yee doe <hi>Gods</hi> will: we looke not onely for the knowledge, the remembrance, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what wee preach, (though it be good to repeat what wee heare, and it is ill to omit it;) but wee looke you should practise what you heare; we would see the Milke, and the Fleece, not the Hay againe: we would see your defects and weakenesses amended, and those duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that you neglect.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if you follow <hi>Christ,</hi> is the same <hi>mind in you as was in Christ, (Phil.</hi> 2.5.)

As it is betwixt Princes that are at Peace, though Pirates of eyther nation rob the others subjects, yet it breakes not the peace; it being done without the will of the King: So it is with sinne in Gods Children, it breakes not the peace betwixt God and them, because it is but a rebell, and they agree not to it.

Therefore for the finding of this, whether Christ be thy life and thy chiefe joy, consider what it is that thy thoughts feede upon; every wicked man, every man that is out of Christ,


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:15448:155"/>
there is something that his thoughts feed upon, some things there are, in contemplation of which the soule solaceth it selfe; some pleasures that are past, present, or to come; the very thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of these are the greatest joy of his heart, he roules them under his tongue; even as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that hath got some dainty bit out of his Masters presence, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See (as <hi>David</hi> exercised it) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be they <hi>thy songs in the night time</hi>? All car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men have something past whereby they comfort themselves,<note place="margin">Psal. 42.8.</note> something present where by they cheare up their hearts, something to come, something in hope. So every man that is in Christ, he hath the comforts of the Spirit, the meditation of the priviledges that he hath in Christ, the hope of Gods favour; These are his appointed food, these are the things that his soule feedes on in secret; yea the very workes that he doth, that seemes to be the hardest part

of a Christians life, the very workes that hee doth in serving the Lord from day to day, even that is his meate and his drinke; that is, it is as sweet and acceptable to his soule, as meate and drinke is to the hunger and thirst of his body. Now consider with thy selfe whether it be so with thee; whether that which is thy continuall feast, without which thou canst not live, bee Christ; or the assurance thou hast, that he is thine and thou art his; whether it bee the priviledges thou hast in him; and the things that belong to the kingdome of God; See whether these be thy life, the things without which thou couldst not live; or whether it bee some thing else, some stollen delights, some unlawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, some thing else that thy soule and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are set upon. This is the next thing by which thou maiest try thy selfe whether thou belong to Christ or no, to consider whether he bee thy chiefe joy, whether thy soule bee most filled and satisfyed with him.

Now consider what is thy refuge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy heart runnes in all such cases, to what wing, to what strong hold: In daungerous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, you see every creature hath some refuge or other: The Child runnes to his Mother.

refuge. The Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iuda</hi> when they were distressed, they fled to <hi>Egypt</hi> and to <hi>Ashur,</hi> to this or that helpe, which (the Lord said) were broken reeds to them, but yet that was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. This is the maner of every man being out of Christ, of every unregenerate man, that is in his naturall estate, some refuge he hath; friends, or wealth, or credit, or the favour of the Prince, something or other it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if hee be destitute and have no refuge (as sometimes it so fals out) then his heart is shaken as the leaves of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, Their <hi>hearts were shaken even for feare of the king</hi> of <hi>Aram,</hi>

                     <hi>as the leaves are shaken in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>; and why? Because they knew not how to defend themselves: they had no refuge to fly to. So you see it was with <hi>Belshazars</hi> heart; so <hi>Achitophel</hi>; and so <hi>Saul</hi>; when he sees that hee must die the next day, and that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for him: then I say their hearts sanke and dyed within them. And now consider how it is with thee, what is the refuge to which thy heart flyeth, and which thy heart makes most account of (for every man thinkes with himselfe, change of time may come, &amp; what shal be my comfort what shal be my strong hold at that time.) Dost thou fly to Iesus Christ? is he thy succour when thy heart is dejected at any time &amp; faints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee? from which fountaine dost thou fetch thy comfort? Dost thou fly to Christ, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy selfe in him, when thou art in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case, that concernes thee as much as thy


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15448:158"/>
life? whither dost thou goe for counsell and direction? is it to Christ, to beseech him to guide thee, to direct thee, when thou art pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hard? whither doth thy heart goe for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and for helpe to keepe thy selfe safe? Is it to Christ, or to some what else? My beloved, I assure you this, that a carnall man that is not in Christ, in these times of distresse knowes not whither to goe; hee dares not goe to Christ, for he feares that it shall be asked him, upon what acquaintance? for he hath been a stranger to the Lord, he was never acquainted with him: but a carnall man that is out of Christ, hee goes to his muses, he goes to his farmes, hee goes to his bushes, as the hunted hare was wont to doe, to goe to the places that shee used when shee lived quiet, thither shee flyes when shee knowes not how to escape: so in that fasho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i it is with men, looke what things they were wont, to which their hearts had recourse in time of prosperity, and what their haunts have beene; to those bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes they fly: But alas! they are but bushes, such as will not defend them. But now the Christian on the other side, the muse, the farme as it were (it is but to expresse it to you) that his soule is acquainted with, the strong hold that hee was wont to fly unto, upon every severall evill, upon every ordinary doubt, upon every dejection, discouragement and fainting of heart; hee was wont to fly to Christ, and there he was wont to finde comfort, and thither hee goes in time of


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15448:158"/>
greatest difficulty in the day of death, and there hee finds comfort. Consider if hee bee thy chiefe refuge, for if thy heart hath taken him as he is thy chiefe excellency, thy chiefe joy, thy chiefe treasure; so he wil be thy chiefest refuge, yea when all things else are taken away, yet that cover remaines safe: Suppose thou be in prison, suppose thy credit bee taken away, (I meane) thy worldly credit (for the other credit cannot be taken away from any man that hath Christ:) suppose thy life be taken away, suppose thou bee stript of all that thou hast; yet thou hast Christ for thy chiefe refuge, and thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest so, and thy heart is satisfyed with it. As <hi>Paul</hi> saith, when hee was a prisoner, when he was naked, when hee was destitute, when he was stript of all,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.12.</note> yet (saith he) <hi>I know whom I have trusted</hi>; As if he should say, yet I have him safe, yet my cover is over my head, yet I am safe in my castle, I have chosen him, I have him in death, yea then Christ he is advantage, he is a cover, a castle, and a refuge.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15448:159"/>
observant of him. Art thou so to Christ? take all the things in the world, if thou set up him, as him whom thou most fearest and lovest, thou wilt most obey him: So againe, he whom thou thinkest can doe thee the greatest good, and the greatest hurt, him thou wilt most obey; if thou thinkest in good earnest that Christ is able to do it, certainely then thou wilt most obey him. As for example, if thou looke to any man in the world, a man that is out of Christ, he thinkes that the favour or the wealth of the King, can doe him more good and more hurt, than the favour, or the losse of the favour of Christ; He thinkes that wealth, or credit, or something else, (many thinges there are that hee thinkes) can doe him more good and more hurt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee more respects their command, than the command of Christ; but a man that sets up him for his chiefe <hi>Commander,</hi> hee regards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else when it comes to crosse it, when it comes to thwart any command of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee saith thus to himselfe in his heart in secret: It is the Lord that can doe the greatest good, and the greatest hurt, therefore I care for no more. So <hi>Naboth</hi> hee cared not for <hi>Ahabs</hi> wrath. So <hi>Mordecay</hi> cared not for <hi>Hamans</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:<note place="margin">Hest. 3.2.</note> so did the Apostles, they cared not for the High Priests, nor what they could doe, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.

                     <note place="margin">Dan. 3.16.17.18.</note> nor for all that hee was able to doe; and why?


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:15448:159"/>
because they thought that Christ, that God was able to doe them more hurt, and more good. Now take any Commander in the world, when you regard not the punishment, nor the reward that he is able to inflict or to give you, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is gone; Now when you set up Christ, and thinke so of Christ, you are ready to obey him, and obey him rather than any other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consider with thy selfe this, and consider seriously: aske thy heart the question, what is that thou settest up to bee thy chiefest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander? For there are three great Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders in the world, that divide all mankind betweene them almost: And that is wealth, and estate; worldly credit and honour, to live in esteeme; pleasures, and delight. Now thinke with thy selfe when any of these three great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders come with any command, contrary to that which Christ commands, thinke with thy selfe what thou wilt doe in such a case, what wast thou wont to doe, looke to past experi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence; looke backe to thy former wayes, see what thou wast wont to doe; thinke with thy selfe when such a Command comes, what thy heart reasons upon; if concupiscence, if a strong lust, if a strong impetuous desire come, and bid thee to doe something, which is contrary to that which Christ would have thee to do, what art thou ready to doe in such a case? If thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, the mainetenance of thy estate, thy liberty, thy wealth, thy convenience in this world come


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:15448:160"/>
and command thee to doe one thing, and thy conscience (which is Christs vicegerent) come in his stead, and command thee another thing, what art thou ready to doe in that case? So when thy credit, thy honour, and reputation, thy vaine glory shall come and bid thee do one thing, and Christ shall bid thee doe another, what is thy resolution, what art thou wont to doe? By this thou shalt know whether thou set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test up Christ, as the chiefe Commander in thy heart or no, whether thou givest him thy chiefe throne, whether thou exaltest him for God in thy heart; you know when you exalt him for God, every thing then yeelds, if in truth he be set up for God in thy heart: Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is that thy heart sets highest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou exaltest him most, whether (when any of these threatning, crying commands come) thou canst give them an absolute denyall, and say with thy selfe, I will not obey you; and if they threaten imprisonment, or disgrace, and losse of life, and if I doe not obey such a lust, I shall be wrung and pincht for it, I shall lose such delights: well, I am resolved to beare all this. On the other side, when they shall come with faire proffers, you shall have this honour, and this advancement, and this convenience: If thy heart can say now, I will have none of you, for I see it is a command contrary to his that is above, whom I have set up for my chiefe Commander, whom I resolve to obey, whom I


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:15448:160"/>
take to be greater than all the friendship in the world, than all the profits, pleasures, and credits in the world; I say thus examine thy selfe what thy heart is toward Christ, what it is to his command; and (let mee touch that by the way) thou must also shew thy obedience to Christ, in thy obedience to others. My beloved there are indifferent things, that are in themselves not of moment one way or other, whether we doe them or not doe them; and though the omission of them in themselves be nothing, yet when it shall bee of contempt, and neglect of those that are set in superiour place over you, in such a case you ought not to doe it: this is a rule, and a true rule in divinity, that indifferent things may be omitted except in two cases, in case of scandall, and in case of neglect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of authority: therefore when there is neglect, when men shew contempt, for that cause it is to be done, though for the other it is not to be done. This I touch but by the way, that you may consider it in your particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                  <p>Now my beloved, you see these five things, by which you may know if you have tooke Christ, or no: yee know when a man comes to examine himselfe whether he be a fit man, a man that hath any right to come to the Lords table, hee must consider whether hee bee in Christ, otherwise hee hath nothing to doe either with this priviledge, or with any other. Now to bee


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:15448:161"/>
in Christ, there must (as I said) goe a double act, there must be one on thy owne side, there must be one act on thy part to take him; and there must be an act on his part, there goes out a strength and a vertue from him by which hee takes thee and comprehends thee. The time is past, &amp; I cannot proceed further; onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this that hath beene said to you, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your selves by it, whether you bee in the truth, whether you make Christ your chiefe <hi>Excellency,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Treasure,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Ioy,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Refuge,</hi> your chiefe <hi>Commander</hi>; if thou finde that thou hast done this, if thou finde thy heart wrought to such an act as this, to take Christ in such a manner, then thou hast Christ, thou art in him, then thou hast a right in him, and maist come with comfort: but if thou have it not, then I must charge every one of you in the name of Christ Iesus (in whose authority we come) that you meddle not with such holy mysteries. My Beloved you know what I have often told you, there is a necessity laid on men to come to the Sacrament: you know hee that neglected the <hi>Passeover was to be cut off from the people.</hi>

And as you must examine it by your owne act, so in the second place you are to examine it by this; consider whether there hath gone out any such power from Christ to take and comprehend thee: For you must know this, that when once we are in Christ, then there goes forth an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall almighty power from him, which doth not make a little light alteration on the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

                        </note>I answere: that certainely there is a mighty power that goes out from God and Christ, that enables thee to beleeve with efficacy; so that when the object is set before thee, there goes out a power from Christ to worke faith in thy heart, whereby thou truly beleevest it, and so it appeares in thy life: We think we beleeve those things, but our lives do manifest the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;

namely, That there is not a powerfull faith wrought in us; for all the errours of our lives (though we observe them not) arise from hence, that these Principles are not throughly beleeved: if they were, it could not bee, that there should be such inconsequences in the lives of men. Therefore consider if this faith bee wrought in thee, whether such a power hath gone out, to worke such a faith, that hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thy whole course, as it will doe, if it bee once wrought in thee, by the power of Christ: So also consider, whether there hath a vertue gone out from him to worke love in thy heart to the Lord; for otherwise it is certaine that there is no man in the world that is able to love God, or to come neere him, for all love riseth from <hi>Similitude,</hi> there must bee an agreement and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude betweene those two that love. Now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man by nature is as contrary to Gods pure nature, as fire is to water, &amp; without an almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power to change his nature, and to worke a particular affection of love in him, he can never be able to love God: therefore its the baptisme of the holy Ghost; which workes this,<note place="margin">Math. 3.11.</note> 
                        <hi>He will baptize you with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> that is, with the holy Ghost which is fire: <hi>I will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply thy sorrowes and thy conceptions,</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.1</note> the sorrowes of thy conceptions. Now love is as fire in the heart, and one fire must beget another; And therefore you have it in the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>Love is a thing that cannot be bought with


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15448:167"/>
mountaines of gold and silver</hi>; yet if thou bee in Christ, there goes out a vertue from him, that stampes upon thy heart this holy affection, that breedes in thee this holy fire of love, so that thy heart cleaves to him, thou lovest him with as true, with as genuine, as naturall, and as sensible love, as thou lovest any friend; as thou lovest any creature in the world. Consider if this be wrought in thee or no. And so for thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; there is also a power in it, consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any such vertue hath gone out from Christ to make the knowledge which thou hast, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

onely, but to mortifie and subdue them.

The world hath many things to worke upon us, and to resist and oppose us: It hath persecutions, it hath disgraces, it hath slanders and reproches, which it casts upon holy men, &amp; upon the holy wayes of God. And the men that are actours in this, are the divels factours, though they thinke not so, as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> expresses it; <hi>Their tongues are set on fire of hell,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iam. 3.6.</note> to devise slanders and false reports, and to fasten them upon holy men, especially upon the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and so upon all the wayes of God: I say they are the divels factours, though they thinke not so: and those that beleeve them are the divels receivers; the one hath the divell in his tongue, the other in his eare. But the Lord hath appointed this. This is one thing whereby the world fights against the wayes of God, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men and to hinder them, that they might be stumbling blockes to them.

and reproaches that are cast upon the wayes of God; and notwithstanding that, to thinke well of them, and to walke in them, and practise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So to shut up this point &amp; prosecute it no further, thus you shall know whether you be in Christ: for that is the point; <hi>Wee have assurance in him; that if we aske any thing, we shall be heard,</hi> but first we must be in him; now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now for the second; if a man will apply or take to himselfe the priviledges wee have by Christ, as this particular priviledge of being heard in our prayers, of comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other; know this, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be in Christ only, but there must be a certaine qualification, a certaine immediate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioning, and preparation of the heart, or else though thou have a right to the priviledges, though they belong to thee: yet thou art suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the use, benefit, and comfort of them. And this is considered in these Five things. (I will but name them very briefely.) First, when a man comes to receive the Sacrament, it's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to be in Christ, no nor when he


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:15448:168"/>
is come to do some other duties, but moreover there must be this also; those grace thou hast, this change, this new creature that is wrought in thee, which is but a heape of particular graces these must be <hi>acted and stirred up</hi> upon such an occasion: It is true, no man ought to come except he have the graces of Gods Spirit wrought in his heart, that they may lye there in the habits, that they may be in the heart as fire raked in the ashes. But if a man will come to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and suffer these habits, these graces he hath to lie still there, he comes not as a worthy receiver; (there are indeed degrees of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse) he comes not as a worthy receiver ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee stirres them up, except they be acted at that very time: as for example; when we come to receive the Sacrament, wee ought then to have an especiall humiliation and sorrow for our sinnes; we ought then to have an especiall love to Iesus Christ; we ought then to have a special rejoycing in him, and in all the Priviledges wee have by him; we ought then to have a speciall love to our brethren, the men with whom wee converse, and among whom wee live: now if a man come and receive, and do not stirre up and act these graces, he receivs unworthyly, and my ground for it, is this; You see in the feast of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> the Tenth day of the Seventh moneth, the Lord tels them there, <hi>you shall come, and you shall keepe it, &amp; you shall not do worke, &amp;c.</hi> But is this enough? no, <hi>He that doth not actually


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:15448:169"/>
afflict his soule</hi> (saith he) <hi>that day, he shall be cut off from his people,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Levit 23.27, 28.29.30.</note> 
                        <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.27. This is, though they had a habitual disposition, and their hearts were prepared to sorrow for their sinnes, and to take them to heart and bewaile them, this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (saith hee) at this time you must afflict your soules, that is, there must be a stirring up of that sorrow. So likewise you finde this in the feasts, in more places than one, that when they come to keepe the feasts, at that time they shall eate and drinke, and refresh themselves, but in any case rejoyce, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12, and <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. I will not stand to repeate the places: That is, it's not enough for you to have thankfull hearts, to have hearts prepared for these things in the habit, but you must then rejoyce, for it is the season of it,<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.11.</note> (for every <hi>thing is good in it's season</hi>) and the Lord requires it at such a time. Therefore thus thinke with thy selfe whensoever thou comest to receive the Sacrament, this is the time that the graces I have, the habituall graces, must be new pointed as it were, they must bee new whetted, new scowred, that they may be bright and shining upon such an occasion, when the Lord cals for it, you must then quicken and stir them up, that they may bee all acted in your hearts.</p>
                     <p>And this is one thing, that it's not enough for a man to bee in Christ, to take the priviledges that belong to him, but there is a certaine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification required that must be done at that


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:15448:169"/>
time, when the Covenant is renewed: And this is one, to have the graces thus acted.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there must be a new <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> For the Saints, those that are within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, those that are regenerate men, (you must marke it well, for it's a point of much use) when they commit sinnes against God, the guilt of their sinnes is retained: though they are within the covenant, and are not cut off from Christ, but are in him; yet (I say) when they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the guilt of that sinne continues, and is continued till they be reconciled and renewed by faith and repentance; as you see it was with <hi>David:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Nathan</hi> would not have said when hee came to him, <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> if there had not beene a new thing, if there had not beene a thing done at that time; and therefore it intimates so much, that before his sin was not forgiven: that is, the Lord was angry with him. You must know therefore this, that when a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man sinnes, there is only a particular guilt; the universall guilt of sinnes returnes not, (for that would cut him quite off, that would put him absolutely into the state of damnation,) but it's a particular guilt, for every particular sinne; that is, even as a father is pleased well with his son, and knowes him to be his sonne, hee is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him as to his sonne, yet hee hath done such a particular action that hath offended him, and for that particular offence, hee withdrawes himselfe from him, hee carries not himselfe to


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:15448:170"/>
him as he was wont to do, being offended with him for such a fault; now till the sonne hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled and humbled himselfe for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular action, though the father hath an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred gifts to bestow on him, yet hee shall have none of them, till hee hath reconciled himselfe; So thinke with thy selfe (if any sinne lye in the way) when thou commest to partake of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to receive the Sacrament, or when thou commest to call on God for any particular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or to have any request granted; thinke then with thy selfe, such a sinne I committed, I must humble my selfe for it, I must labour to make reconciliation, labour to have this taken away, that my Father may bee reconciled to mee; then come and take the priviledge, for now it belongs unto me; therefore there is a necessity of renewing our repentance and reconciliation most exactly, and to take a very particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of our wayes when we come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, or when wee draw neere to God upon such speciall occasions, least our Father, (though he be a Father to us) have some particular quarrell against us; for even he whom we call Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, <hi>iudgeth every man,</hi> (even his owne sonnes) <hi>without respect of persons,</hi> that is, he did not beare any ill in them: thus you see did he with <hi>Moyses,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> and others, and the like he doth with all the Saints. This is the second qualification that is required before you can have any part in any of the priviledges,


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:15448:170"/>
before you can attaine unto this assurance, to aske and have; therefore it is not without use, and that not in the Sacrament onely, but also in that which we have to deliver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, suppose there be no particular sinne, suppose the grace you have, be acted, when you come to receive the Sacrament; yet there is a third thing required, a third qualification that must be found in the heart of him that will be a worthy receiver, and that is, to observe well <hi>what distance is growne</hi> betweene the Lord and him ever since the time, that he hath in a more particular manner beene reconciled to him. This is another thing than what wee named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to consider what rust hath growne upon his soule, what soyle his heart hath contracted, by conversing in the world, and by medling with worldly and earthly things; for the soule ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers soyle with medling with them, even as the hands doe; now thou must thinke with thy selfe, when thou commest to the Lord; and drawest neere to him in this, or any other duty, thou must recover that distance againe, and bring thy heart neerer to the Lord, thou must draw neerer to him, thou must get thy heart to a more close, a more neere, &amp; inward conjunction with him; thou must labour to have that hardnesse that thou hast contracted (as it will bee in a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time) thou must labour I say, to have that tooke away and removed; to have thy heart softened, to have the rust rubbed off;


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:15448:171"/>
thou must labour to have all these things done. For thou must know this, That though there be not a particular sinne committed, yet as we see, the outward man is subject to a wasting, though there be no wounds, though there be no sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; though a man be in perfect health, and all is well with him, and he observe all the rules of dyet, yet (I say) you see the outward man is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to wasting, to fainting, to weakenesse, and decay; and therefore there must be a renewing of dyet, and of strength, or else it cannot bee able to hold out: So it is with the inward man; though there bee no particular sinne, though a man did keepe some good course in the wayes of godlinesse, without running out eminently or evidently, yet he is subject to a secret decay, so that sometimes hee must have some speciall meate, some speciall feast, which the Lord hath appointed for that purpose, (for he doth nothing in vaine:) And if this Sacrament could be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that a man might keepe the strength of the inward man without it, the Lord would not have put you to this trouble; but he seeth it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and therefore he hath appointed it to be received, and that often, that you might feed upon the body and blood of Christ, that you might eate his flesh and drinke his blood, and gather new strength from it; that when there is a decay of grace in your hearts, you may goe to this Fountaine, and fill the Cisternes againe to recover strength. For when a man comes to the


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:15448:171"/>
Sacrament as hee ought, hee gathers a new strength, as a man doth from a feast; his heart is cheered up as it is with Flagons of wine, he is refreshed, his hunger and thirst is satisfied; That is, the desires of his soule that long after Christ, after righteousnesse, and assurance, are quickned and refreshed. And this is the third thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, besides all this; First the stirring up
of the graces, and the acting of the habits; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, making thy peace and reconciliation with God, and remooving of any particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that is betwixt God and thee; Thirdly, this scouring off the rust, this remooving the distance betweene God and thee, the softning of that hardnesse which thy heart hath contracted; this recovering the strength that thou hast wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; There is besides all these a fourth thing required, which is, that there be an <hi>Intention, a particular increase of thy will,</hi> in taking Christ, of thy desire to Christ, and of every grace that knits thee and Christ together; For there are certaine cementing graces, certaine glewing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that joyne Christ and thy soule together, as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; these are the two maine graces; there are a great traine of graces that follow them, but these are the chiefe, and these I say must bee intended, For what is the end of the Sacrament? Is it not to knit the knot stronger betweene Christ and us, to make the union more full and perfect? is it not to increase our willingnesse to take and receive Christ? for you


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15448:172"/>
know all the acts of the soule may be intended. Put the case there be a resolved act in the heart and soule of any man, whereby he saith thus with himselfe: I am resolved to take Christ, and to serve and love him for the time of my life, yet this resolution of his, though it bee perfect and sincere, may receive intention; when a man is willing to doe any thing truly, there may bee degrees added to that will; when there is light in a roome (when thou bringest in more candles) that light may be increased: so it may in this, so may your faith and love; (by faith I meane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the resolution of the heart to take Christ; I meane not the beleeving part, but the taking part, the act of the will taking Christ, or receiving him, which is nothing else but the choise of the will that resolves to take him.) I do but touch this by the way, because it is a point I have handled already at large; the thing I ayme at is this; I say the glewing graces are these two; <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> wherby you thus take Christ for your Lord and Saviour; Faith is like the part of the compasse that goeth about and doth the worke; and love is that cementing grace wherby we are more knit unto the Lord; they have both their office and their place; You know love is an uniting affection, therefore this is the definition of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>It is a desire of union with that it loves.</hi> Now when thou comest to receive the Sacrament, or to pray, or put up any special request, when thou comest to have to do with God, to make use of


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15448:172"/>
any priviledge thou hast in Christ, thy chiefe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines is to intend this faith &amp; love, at such a time to draw thee neerer, to make the union perfect.</p>
                     <p>You will say, how is this increased and how is it intended?<note place="margin">

                        </note>I answer; Two wayes in the Sacrament, one way is the very repetition, the very renewing the covenant, the very doing it over againe, the resolution of taking him, (for there is a mutuall covenant, you know, betweene Christ and us,) it is confirmed to us in the Sacrament, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes his, and wee confirme ours, as the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betweene <hi>Ionathan</hi> &amp; <hi>David</hi> was increased by the renewing of the covenant, or else why was it repeated? The very repetition of the act intends the habit, the habit is increased by the repetition of the act, though it were no more; so the renewing of the covenant exerciseth thy faith, it sets a work thy faith and thy love, when thou comest to receive the Sacrament, the very intention is increased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this is not all. There is another thing in the Sacrament that much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth it, and that is a thing I would have you chiefely to take notice of; That is the very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament it selfe, the elements of bread and wine delivered to thee, with the very words of the minister, <hi>Take and eate, this is my body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 24, 25.</note> 
                        <hi>that was broken for thee; Take and drinke, this is my blood, that was shed, &amp;c.</hi> For when these words are spoken to us, if wee did consider well of them, and thinke thus with our selves; These words


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:15448:173"/>
that the Lord himselfe hath appointed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to speake (for therein is the force of them that they are of the Lords owne institution) therefore the strength of every Sacrament lies in the institution; That is a rule in Divinity: the Papists themselves, who have added five other Sacraments, cannot deny, but that every Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must have an immediate institution from Christ himselfe, even from his owne mouth, or else there is no strength in it; so that even as it is with all things that are symbols of other things, (as take markes in feilds that stand for the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of severall mens rights; take counters th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> stand for Thousands and Hundreds; the very essence of these things stands in the very insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of them;) So in the Sacrament, except these words were from the Lords owne mouth that delivered it, this very delivering of the bread and wine, being a signe to you of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenes of your sinnes, except the Lord had thus instituted it, there had beene no force in it. I say consider, they are words that the Minister speaks not in an ordinary course, but he is appointed by the Lord himselfe to speak them; and now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these words make a new impression upon thy heart, it addes an intention to thy faith and love. For example, (to make it a little more cleare to you, that you may understand it distinctly.) The Lord hath said this, he will forgive the sinnes of all those that come unto him, hee will forgive them that forsake their sinnes, and take Christ


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:15448:173"/>
Iesus, and love and feare him for the time to come. The Lord might have suffered it to goe thus in generall, that hee hath delivered it unto you and no more; But hee thought good to goe further and say thus to mankind: Its true, I have said it, but I will not content my selfe with that, but will adde certaine seales and symbolls, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine externall signes, that thou shalt see and looke on; and I say to thee, this covenant have I made with thee, and when thou seest the bread and wine delivered by the Minister, know this, that the thing that thou seest is a witnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and me: That as it was said by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> when they made a covenant, <hi>This stone be witnesse betweene us</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 31.48.</note> And God said to <hi>Noah, when I looke upon the rainebowe,</hi>

                        <hi>it shall bee a signe that I will destroy the earth no more after this manner</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Lord hath said it and hath appointed this outward Symboll that thine eies looke upon, I remember the covenant and this as a signe betweene us, this shall bind mee to it and him likewise. Now when this is done anew, (it may be every month) this is a wondrous great mercy, this is a marvellous great helpe (if it be rightly understood) to strengthen our faith. Doth it not helpe us, when wee see the Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe which the Lord hath appointed to put him in mind of his covenant?<note place="margin">Gen. 9, 14, 15,</note> 
                        <hi>I will remember my covenant, when I looke on the Bowe in the Cloud it shall confirme me, and I will not breake my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to destroy the world with a flood</hi>; So this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:15448:174"/>
of the Sacrament, when the Lord lookes upon it, hee cannot but remember his promise and his covenant, of pardoning our sinnes; And when thou lookest on it, thou art assured of it, for hee hath said it; it shall bee a signe and a witnesse betweene us; Now I say that new impression that these words (thus contrived and understood, and delivered by the Minister) make upon the heart, intends our faith and love; as indeed it is a great matter to have it spoken to us by a Minister of the Gospell, sent from Christ, from his owne mouth; <hi>Take and eate, this is my body that is broken for you:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 24.25.</note> 
                        <hi>and this is my blood that was shed for you and for many, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes.</hi> This is the fourth qualification that is required, that our faith and love be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and our union increased; that the will, resolution, and purpose of taking Christ for our Lord, receive more degrees; that so we may be more fast and firmely united and knit to him; which I say is done partly by the repetition on both sides (for the very repetition doth it;) and partly by a new impression that these words, (<hi>take, eate, &amp;c</hi>) make on the soule. Now I adde the last thing which is required, (still remember the maine thing wee are upon, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for thee to be in Christ, but if thou wilt bee a worthy receiver, thou must have these foure qualifications in thee, that I have named already, Thou must reconcile thy selfe anew, thou must rub off the rust from thy soule which


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:15448:174"/>
it hath gathered, thou must recover the distance that is growne betweene God and thee; Thou must adde an intending and an increase; Thou must adde more degrees to thy faith and love, and after all these.)</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, and lastly, this is also required (which is much for our benefit and comfort) namely, to put up thy request, when thou comest neere to the Lord in the Sacrament: Now thou must not onely do this, but thou must also make some use of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with thee for his part, so that thou mayest think this with thy selfe; When I come to receive the Sacrament, I have but two workes to do, one is to recovenant with the Lord, &amp; to renew my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to set all eaven; and the other is to remember the Lords covenant.</p>
                     <p>You will say, what is the Covenant?</p>
                     <p>It's a Covenant that consists of these three things or points; <hi>Iustification,</hi>

Now thou art bound when thou comest to receive the Sacrament, not onely to remember this Covenant, <hi>Doe this</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in remembrance of Mee,</hi> and not barely of me, and of my being crucified for thee, &amp; of all the love


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:15448:175"/>
that I have shewed unto thee, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Covenant, and of those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises, which are the particulars of which that Covenant is the summe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus a man is to do. What? hath the Lord vouchsafed mee this favour, that I may come to his Table, I may come and renew the nuptials and my covenant with him? Surely, then I will looke about and consider what I want, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shal put up unto him; for there is nothing that is wanting, but it is within this Covenant; and thou art to put up thy request in a speciall maner, whatsoever it be, be it concerning things belonging to thy soule, to have a strong lust mortified, to have thy hard heart softned, to have some sin that lies upon thy conscience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, &amp; to have that forgivenes assured to thee: be it any thing that concernes thy particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, if it be to be delivered from a potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or whatsoever it be, put up thy request, and that largely, open thy mouth wide, that is, make thy request full, feare it not. Put the case (againe) it be somewhat that doth not concerne thee, but that it concerneth the Church abroad, or the Church at home, it is a case that much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes any of these in the Church, put it up to him, and put it up with confidence. For this is a marriage day (as it were) it is the time when he reacheth out his scepter (as you know the things I allude to) and thou maist come to his presence: You know,<note place="margin">Ester. 5, 3,</note> when <hi>Hester</hi> was admitted to the

If thou hast not any particular argument in this case, say, If I have found favour in thy sight, do this: so I say, when thou hast this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise confirmed, that Christ hath given himselfe to thee, and the symboll of that promise is the bread and wine which he hath given to thee, put up thy request: O Lord, if thou hast vouchsafed to give mee Christ, <hi>wilt thou not with him give mee all things else</hi>? Lord,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 32,</note> if I have found favour in thy sight, to do so great a thing for me, deny


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:15448:176"/>
me not this particular request. Thus we ought to doe, especially when we come to things that are beyond nature: when we come, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with our selves; Indeed I have a naturall disposition that carries me strongly to evill, I shall never be able to overcome it, there are such duties to doe, I shall never be able to performe them: In such a case thou must doe it the more earnestly, thou must sigh &amp; groane to the Lord. <hi>Elishah</hi> when hee comes to doe a thing so much above the course of nature,<note place="margin">2 King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.34.</note> as to raise a dead child to life, hee sighed unto the Lord, that is, he prayed earnestly.<note place="margin">Iam, 5.15.</note>

So must thou do in this case: and know this for thy comfort, that though thou thinke thou shalt never be able to doe these things, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such lusts, such hereditary diseases, yet the Lord is able to helpe thee: though these are past naturall helpe, yet they are not past the helpe of grace;<note place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> though the spirit in us lust after envy; yet as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>The Scriptures offer more grace,</hi> that is, the Scriptures offer grace and ability to doe more than nature can doe; nature cannot heale a spirit that lusteth after envy; or any other thing; a spirit that lusts after credit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter money, after the sinne of uncleanenesse, or whatsoever is presented: now the Scriptures of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that grace, that will overcome any of these sinnes, be they never so strong, or so old; Christ healed hereditary diseases, he healed those that

                     <p>WE have already made some entrance upon the words: I told you what the Apostles scope is in them, which is, to make knowne to all Christians to whom he wrote, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother great priviledge, besides that which hee named before: that is, <hi>That he that hath the Son, hath life</hi>; this (saith he) is another priviledge, <hi>that whatsoever you aske, you shall have</hi>; onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you have <hi>this assurance in him,</hi> that is, in Christ Iesus; That point (what it is to be in him, that it may be the ground of all the benefits and priviledges wee injoy) we handled the last day. Now wee come to the priviledge it selfe, <hi>If we aske any thing according to his will, hee heareth us.</hi> The words are so plain, I shal not need to spend any time in opening of them, but deliver you the point that lyes so evidently before us:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Doct.</hi>
                        </note> which is this, [<hi>That all the prayers of the Saints made upon earth, are assuredly heard in heaven</hi>] whatsoever


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:15448:177"/>
we aske, (saith hee) according to his will hee heareth us, onely the conditions must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. When you heare such a generall as this, it must be limited, there are certaine bounds set to it, which we will name unto you: which are these foure conditions. First, all the prayers that are made upon earth shall be heard in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;<note place="margin">Cond.</note> if they be the prayers of a righteous man, and are faithfull and fervent. The <hi>person</hi> must be <hi>righteous,</hi> that must first be remembred: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, although the prayer be never so good, yet except the person bee accepted from whom it comes, the Lord regards it not: you know in the old Law, the <hi>blood of Swine</hi> was reckoned an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Sacrifice,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Esay. 66.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> yet if you take the blood of sheepe, and compare them together, you shall find no difference; It may be the Swines blood is the better: then whats the reason the Swines blood is not accepted? even because of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, it was the blood of Swine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you see it was put downe, that it was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Sacrifice. So it is with prayer; Take the prayer of a Saint, and the prayer of a wicked man; it may be, if you looke upon the petition, or whatsoever is in the prayer it selfe, you shall finde some time the prayers of a godly man more cold, and lesse fervent: the petitions are not so well framed as the wicked mans: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this comes from such a person, the Lord regards it not; you know the condition is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Iames fift: The prayer of the righteous

man availeth much, if it be fervent.</hi> Now as this is required in the person, so there is somewhat required in the praier also, that is, that it be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and faithfull; that it be fervent, you have it in the same place, <hi>The prayer of a righteous man availeth much if it be fervent</hi>; that is, it must be a prayer made from the sence of the misery that is in us, &amp; from the mercy of God, when a man takes a thing to heart, that he prayes for, and comes with confidence to bee heard, for that makes him fervent. This the Lord will have, and also he will have it faithfull: <hi>Iames</hi> the first, when the Apostle exhorts them to praier, <hi>if any man want wisdome</hi> (saith he) <hi>let him aske it of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iames 1, 5.6,</note> but then marke, he carefully puts in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, see that <hi>He pray in faith,</hi> that is, beleeve that it shal be done unto him: now this faith includes repentance, for no man can beleeve that he shall be heard, except he make his heart perfect with God: If he allow any sin in himselfe, he cannot beleeve upon any good ground: therfore when I say it must be faithful, that also is included, we must <hi>regard no wickednes in our hearts,</hi> for in such a case, <hi>the Lord heares not, hee heares not sinners.</hi>

It is true, that this life is the time of grace, but God in his secret counsell hath appointed a certaine time to every man, which is the <hi>acceptable time, the day of grace</hi>; therefore he saith unto them, <hi>This day if you will heare</hi>: this day if you will come and seeke unto mee, if you will pray unto mee, I will heare you: when it's past, the Lord suffers not the doores to stand open alwayes, his eares are not alwayes open: therefore that condition must be carefully remembered, you must aske in time; It is a condition that should be carefully thought on by us. For, for the most part, we fly to prayer as <hi>Ioab did to the Altar,</hi> hee went not

to it for devotion (for then he would have done it before) but when <hi>hee was in distresse,</hi> when hee was in extremity, then hee fled to it, and therefore you know what successe hee had by it, it saved not his life. So we goe not to prayer for devotion, that is, out of love to God, to doe him that service; but (for the most part) wee do it out of selfe love, when we are in extremity or distresse, wee passe the acceptable times he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and we goe to him in a time of our owne: For there is Gods time, and there is our owne time; Gods time is to come to him when wee may do him service in our youth, in our strength in the flower of our graces: Our time is to goe to him when we need him: Will not a friend say (when we never come to him, but when we have extreame need of him) why do you come now? you were not wont to visit me before, this is not out of love to me: Even the very same answer the Lord giveth;<note place="margin">Iudg. 10.14.</note>

that time, in that manner and measure, as best pleaseth the Lord: For the truth is, we know not our selves what is meete for us, we are unto the Lord just as the Patient is to the Physitian. The patient is importunate with him, for such things to refresh and ease him; But the Physitian knowes what best belongs to him, and when to give him such things, in what manner, and in what measure: So the Lord knowes best what to doe: Many times hee doth the same things that we desire, though he doe it not in the same manner: Even as the physitià he quencheth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the thirst with <hi>Berberries,</hi> or with such kind of conserves; what though it be not with drinke, is it not all one so the thirst be quenched? Is it not all one whether a man bee hindred from striking me, or if I have a helmet to defend the blow? sometimes the Lord keepes not off the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; but then he gives us a helmet to keepe off those blowes, to beare those injuries and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills that are done to us: he is a wise physitian, he knowes what manner, what measure, and what time is best, therefore that must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him: now these conditions being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, you must know that this great priviledge belongs to every Christian, That whatsoever prayers he makes on earth, he is sure to bee heard in heaven, it is a wondrous priviledge, that which wee have all cause to stand amazed at, that the Lord should so farre regard the sonnes of men, to grant them such a Charter as this; no

more but aske and have, and what so ever you pray for, it shall be done to you. But a man is ready to say secretly in his heart when he heares it, This is too good to be true, That whatsoever I aske, I shall have. My Beloved, I confesse, it is a hard thing to beleeve it as wee ought to doe: and therefore before we come to apply this, we will spend a little time in endevouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the truth of it, that you may not doubt of it, that what prayers you make to the Lord hee is ready to heare them.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, consider that whatsoever prayer you make, he takes notice of it, he observs every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, there is not one petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you make to him at any time, but he lookes upon it, he sees what the prayer is. And this thing although you thinke it common, (and who is there that know not this?) yet (my beloved) to beleeve this, to thinke that God is present where I make my prayer to him, to thinke he stands and heares it, even as I speake to a man that stands and heares me, and understands what I say to him; This is a great helpe to us. That this is true, see in 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>Hee is in all, and through all, and over all,</hi> That is, the Lord is in every man, hee passeth through every thing, <hi>his eyes runne through the earth,</hi> and he is over all,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16.9.

must needs see what thoughts he hath, what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions hee putteth up secretly, even then when his mouth speakes not. And lest that should not be enough, saith hee, <hi>He is over all,</hi> you know one that stands on high, and lookes over all that is below, hee easily can see whatsoever is done; So the Lord, he is in all, he is through all, he is over al. But this is enough for that; only I would have you remember, that he takes notice of all, he knowes thy prayers.</p>

in all the Scriptures. but it hath beene heard. Now when we have such a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, it is a strong reason, when it is said to us that there were never any prayed but were heard.</p>

                        </note>My Beloved, Its true, they were not heard for the particular, but yet I dare be bold to say, that <hi>David</hi> was heard at that time, though (I say) not in the particular; for though his Childe was taken away, yet you may see the Lord gave him a Childe of the same woman, with much more advantage; he gave him a Childe that was legitimate, which this was not: he gave him a Childe that exceeded for wisedome, <hi>Salomon</hi> was the Child that he had: So that the Lord did heare him, and gave him this answer, as if he had said to him, <hi>David</hi> I have heard thee, I know that thou art exceeding importunate; thou shalt not have this, but thou shalt have another Childe which shall be better. And so he saith unto <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Christ reveals this unto him; <hi>Paul</hi> (saith he) though I grant thee not this particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, in the manner that thou wouldest have me, (<hi>To take away the pricke of the flesh which thou art troubled with</hi>) thou shalt bee a greater gainer by it, thou hadst better have it than want it; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>


                        <pb n="332" facs="tcp:15448:181"/>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> understood that it was a medicine, and not a poyson as hee tooke it to be, hee was content and resolved in it; And a man resolveth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be a gainer. He saw that <hi>Gods power was manifest in his weakenesse,</hi> and hee saw himselfe humbled by it; and when he saw that God gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory and himselfe humiliation by it, he was content to be denyed in it; So I say, whosoever asketh findeth, you shall never finde any exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but that whosoever sought to the Lord as he ought, he was certainely heard, or else he had somewhat that was better granted to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of it. And this is the first reason that is used heere.<note place="margin">Math. 7.9.10.11.</note> The second reason is this; <hi>What man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, if his Son aske bread, will give him a stone; or if he aske a fish, will give him a serpent? if you then that are evill, know how to give good things to your children, how much more shal your heavenly Father give good things to them which aske him?</hi> (saith hee) you bee not able to perswade your selves of this truth, because you know not the Father, for he dwells in light inaccessable, you are not acquainted with him, saith our Saviour: I will helpe you out with an argument that you better understand; even upon earth (saith he) take but a father here, a father that is ill (but the Lord is full of goodnes; fathers have but a drop, but a sparke of mercy in them, whereas the Lord is full of mercy, as the Lord is ful of light, he is the God of all comfort;) Yet, (saith hee) this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (when his sonne comes to aske him bread)


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:15448:181"/>
he is ready to give it him, he is full of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion and tendernes toward him; doe you not thinke that our heavenly Father is as true a father as he, that hee loves you as well as he whose compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and pitty is much greater? doe you not thinke hee is ready to heare his Children when they call upon him? O this is a strong and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable Reason, and this you see is backed in 16 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 27. you see there the love of the Father how it is expressed to us; <hi>I say not unto you that I will aske the father</hi> (saith he) <hi>the father himselfe loves you</hi>; Marke, as if he should have said, let this be one ground to you to think your petitions shall be granted, and that they are not onely granted for my sake, for (saith hee) the Father himselfe loveth you, and hath a great affection to you, that is in naturall parents, there is a naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to their Children; So if I were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to present your petitions (though that be not excluded) yet (saith hee) the Father hath such an affection to you, that he cannot choose but heare you; <hi>I say not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I will aske the father, for the father himselfe loves you.</hi> So that this is the second reason which this promise is there backed with, the love of the father, That hee cannot find in his heart to deny us, even for that affection that he beareth to us. Wee will adde a third Reason that wee meet here in the same <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 23. <hi>In that day you shall aske in my name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verily, verily, I say unto you, yee shall aske the father in my name, and he will give it you</hi>;

It is brought in upon this occasion, when our Saviour Christ was to goe from his Disciples, they were ready to complaine, as we see in the verses before, they were ready to say with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, alas, what shall wee doe when our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster shall be tooke from our head? Our Saviour answers them, you shall doe well enough, doubt you not, for though I be not with you; yet (saith he) go to the father in my name, and whatsoever you aske of him, you shall have it: So that hee answers that objection, when a man is ready to say:</p>

                        <hi>that al flesh might come to him,</hi> even for this cause he heares, that men may be encouraged to come and seeke to him; for if the Lord should not heare, then no flesh would come unto him; that is, men would have no encouragement, no helpe; therefore he saith, he is a <hi>God hearing prayer,</hi> doubt ye not, hee will doe it for this purpose, that hee might have men to worship him, that men might come and seeke unto him.

to him on earth, (So the conditions be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) they are surely heard in heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note>Now to apply this: First, if the Lord bee so ready to heare, then this should teach us to bee more fervent in this duty of prayer than com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly we are; for to what end are such promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as this, but to encourage us to do our duties? when wee heare that prayer is of so much effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, that it prevailes with the Lord for any thing, shall we suffer it to lye by (as it were) and not make use of it? If a drug, or a pretious balme were commended to us, and it were told us, that if wee made use of it, it would heale any wound, it will heale any sickenes, and this and this vertue it hath: Will a wise man suffer it to lye by him, will he not use it, and see what vertue it hath? And when it is said unto us, that praier is thus prevalent with the Lord, that it is thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that it is thus able to prevaile with him for any thing, shall wee not make use of it, when we are in any distresse, when wee need any thing: when we have any disease, either of soule or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to heale? Let us flye to this refuge that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath appointed. If a King of the earth should say to a man, I will be ready to doe thee a good turne, make use of me when thou hast occasion; he would be ready enough to do it. Now when the Lord of heaven saith, aske what you will at my hands, and I will doe it; shall we not seeke to him, and make use of such a promise as this? Beloved we are too backward in this; we


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:15448:183"/>
should be more aboundant in this duty than we are, we should make more account of it. For whatsoever the case be, if you doe but seeke to the Lord, if thou doest but set downe thy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with thy selfe: Well, I see it is a thing (if I looke upon the creature and the meanes) I have little hope of, but the Lord is able to doe it; and therefore I will goe to him, I will weary him, and I will not give him over, I will not give him nor my selfe any rest, till I have obtained it: I say it is impossible thou shouldest faile in such a case. Onely remember to be importunate, for an importunate suiter hee cannot deny. You know the <hi>parable of the unjust Iudge.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18, 2, 3, 4. Luk. 11.7.</note> You know also the <hi>parable of the man that is in bed with his children; when the widdow was importunate,</hi> when she knockt and would give him no rest, he gives her redresse; the other riseth and giveth his friend <hi>as many loves as he will,</hi> saith the Text; yea <hi>though she were not his friend,</hi> (for this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it:) If, saith he, the Lord had not much love to you, if hee had not such an affection, if you did not come to him in the name of Christ whom hee loves, in whom he is ready to grant whatsoever you aske, if hee were not a friend to you; yet for your very importunity, he is ready to do it. As the unjust Iudge (for that is the scope of the parable) hee had no minde to grant the widdowes request, hee had no Iustice in him to move him, he had no mercy nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, yet for very importunity he graunted it.


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:15448:184"/>
Remember and observe the condition, for this is commonly a fault among us; when we goe to prayer, we thinke that the very putting up of the prayer will doe it. No, there is more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than so. As it is the error of the Country people, when they heare say, that such an herbe is good for such a disease, they are ready to thinke, that (howsoever it be tooke or applyed) it will heale the disease; No, it must be applyed in such a manner, it must bee used in such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion. So it is with prayer, you must not onely doe the duty (and therefore when wee exhort you to it, not onely to call upon God, for men are ready enough to doe that, especially in the time of distresse,) but with these conditions I have named.<note place="margin">2 King. 4, 29.31</note> You know <hi>Gehazi</hi> when hee had got the staffe of <hi>Elisha,</hi> hee went to the Child, but it was not the staffe that could raise the child from death to life, there was something more required. So in prayer, it is not meere prayer that will doe it, there is something else, there must be other conditions that must bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For wee are wont to doe with it, as those Conjurers were wont to doe with the name of Iesus; they thought if they used the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, it was enough: but yee know what answer the Spirit gives them, <hi>Iesus we know, and Paul we know,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 19, 15.</note> 
                        <hi>but who are yee</hi>? So I say, we are wont to doe in this case, we thinke it is enough to make our request, and that is all. No, there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more required, you must make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:15448:184"/>
in such a manner as ye ought. Then I adde this further, that when thou makest them in such a manner, yet thou must not thinke to be heard for thy praiers sake: that is another thing we are apt to faile in. When wee have made fervent prayers, and have beene importunate with the Lord, wee thinke now surely we shall not faile. No, you must know this, the promise is not made to the prayer, but to the person praying. You shall not finde throughout the whole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any promise is made thus, because wee pray fervently wee shall be heard: but it is made to the person praying, the prayer is but the instrument, but the meanes by which the blessing is conveyed to us, is a meanes without which the Lord will not doe it, for the promise is made to the party. A cold prayer (so there be no neglect in it, so a man seeke the Lord, and pray as well as hee can,) it will prevaile some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as well as a fervent prayer: Who indites the petition, who makes the prayer fervent? Surely not thy selfe, but the <hi>Holy Ghost: he makes request in us,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 26.27.</note> sometimes hee makes thee more fervent, hee enlargeth the heart more: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe the heart is more straitned in the performance of this duty: but both may come from the same Spirit. Not but that wee have cause of much comfort, when wee are able to pray fervently, for this is a ground of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that when we pray fervently, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> dwels in our hearts, and


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:15448:185"/>
that our prayers are dictated by him; it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that our prayers come from a holy fire within. And therefore fervent prayer may give us hope of being heard, but yet it is not meerely the prayer, but because it is an evidence that it comes from a right principle, that it comes from the regenerate part, and is made by the assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> it is not the very fervency that prevailes. And therefore when you heare this, that the Lord is ready to heare, I say make that use of it, bee fervent in this duty, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the conditions: and yet withall know, that you are not heard for the very prayers sake, but for Iesus Christ his sake. He makes every praier acceptable, hee mingles them with his sweete odours.</p>

So (saith hee) should every one of you, if you have the promise, you may goe and urge it, as wel as <hi>Eliah</hi> did: though you be subject to many infirmities, <hi>Eliah</hi> was even so. You know there


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:15448:185"/>
are infirmities and passions expressed in the Scriptures that he was subject to. And this is the first use we are to make of it, to be frequent and fervent in this duty, since wee have such a promise.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if wee have such a promise, then wee should learne hence (when we have put up our prayers at any time) to make more account of them than we doe: for the truth is,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vse.</hi> 2.</note> that we pray for the most part for fashion sake, many a man saith thus with himselfe: I will seeke the Lord, if it doe me no good, it will doe no hurt; but if wee made that account of our prayers as we should, we would performe this duty in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; but we doe not make that account of them as wee ought. Wee thinke not with our selves that the prayers that wee make are surely heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ther be many evidences of it; what is the reason, that when wee seeke the Lord, we doe it so remisly that wee have scarce leasure to make an end of our prayers: we are so ready to hasten and goe about other businesse, wee are ready to turne every stone, to use all meanes to seeke the creatures with all diligence: but who prayes to the Lord as he ought, to worke his heart to such a fervent performance of that duty as hee should? men have scarcely leasure, for it is usuall with them when they have businesse to doe, and enterprises to bring to passe, they are exceeding diligent to use all meanes; and yet are remisse in the chiefe: what is the reason els, that


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:15448:186"/>
wee see the doores of Princes and great men so full of suiters, though there bee porters set on purpose to drive them away; but the gates of heaven are so empty? It is indeed because wee doe not beleeve our prayers are heard, wee do but make our prayers for fashion. What is the reason likewise, that we use prayer in the time of distresse (if it will be an effectuall meanes to helpe us, when all other meanes faile,) why use we it not before? But that is an argument that wee trust not to it, seeing we use it, onely in the time of extremity: for if it be not effectuall, why do we use it then? If it be effectuall, why do not wee use it till that accident? Therefore this use wee must further make, when wee heare that the Lord heares our prayers, to make more account of them than wee do, to thinke that our prayers when they are put up to the Lord shal be heard. Say thus with thy selfe, Well, now I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I expect that the thing should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I have prayer for, when I seeke to the Lord. It's true, I deny not but wee must use the meanes too, wee must lay the hands upon the plough, and yet pray; both ought to be done, as sometimes we use two friends, but we trust one; wee use two Physitians, but we put confidence in one of them: In like manner wee must both pray and use the meanes, but so as wee put our chiefe trust in prayer, it is not meanes that will doe it. But the truth is, wee doe the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: It may be, we pray and use the meanes,


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:15448:186"/>
but wee trust the meanes, and not the prayer: that is a common and a great fault among us, it is a peece of Atheisme, for men to thinke the Lord regards their prayers, no more than hee regards the bleating of sheepe or the lowing of oxen, to thinke he heeds them not. And its a great part of faith to thinke that the Lord har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to them and regards them, as certainely he doth.</p>

agoe, I found no fruit of it; for be sure, the Lord remembreth thy prayer, though thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it, the prayers that thou madest a good many yeares agoe, may doe thee good many yeares hence. May not a man pray to have his Child sanctified, to have him brought to better order? It may be hee lives many yeares, and sees no such thing, yet in the end, the prayer may be effectuall: So likewise it may be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cases, you see there are many examples for it: <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, he stayed long; but you see it was a great blessing that he had, when he prayed for a Sonne, you know what a Sonne hee was, he was a Sonne of the promise, in whom all the nations of the earth were blessed. So <hi>David</hi> when the Lord promised him a kingdome, hee staied long for it: Many such examples there are. Therefore comfort thy selfe with this: though I stay long, this is my hope, this is my encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that sustaines me, If I seeke the Lord, and waite upon him, Hee will come with a great blessing, the gaine shall bee heavier and greater, though the returne be not so quicke and sudden.</p>

lose by it; and those that are, may understand the happines of their condition, that they may learne to magnify it, and to blesse themselves in that condition, that they have such a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge as this: It is no more but aske and have, therefore that which in the third place I exhort you to, is this, namely to spend time in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of it, to consider what a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it is; <hi>David</hi> cannot satisfie himselfe enough in it: In 18. and 116. <hi>Psalmes; Lord I love thee deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>: hee cannot prayse enough, and why? <hi>I sought to thee in distresse, &amp; thou heardest me; I called upon thee, and thou inclinedst thine eare to my praier.</hi> I say, consider this mercy as you ought to doe, it is part of the thankes we owe to the Lord for so an exceeding priviledge, That whatsoever our case bee, it is no more, but put up our requests, and wee shall bee heard. When there was a speech among some holy men (as you know that man that was named in the story;) what was the best trade, he answered, Beggerie; It is the hardest, and it is the richest trade. Now he understands it not, of common beggery (for this is the poorest and easiest trade, that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he puts in) but (saith hee) I understand it of a prayer to God, that kind of beggery I meane; which as it is the hardest, nothing more hard than to pray to God as wee ought, so withall there is this comfort in it, it is the richest trade of all others; there is no way to inrich our selves so much, with all the promises that belong ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:15448:188"/>
to this life, or to that which is to come: Even as you see among men, a Courtier, a Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in the Court, get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You have heard of a noble man in this Kingdome, that had a Ring given him by the <hi>Queene,</hi> with this promise: that if he sent that Ring to her, at any time when he was in distres, she would remember him and deliver him; This was a great priviledge from a Prince, and yet you see, what that was subject unto; he might be in such a distresse, when neither King not Queene could be able to helpe him; or though they were able, (as shee was in that case) yet it might be sent, &amp; not delivered: Now then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the Lord doth to us. Hee hath given us this priviledge, he hath given us prayer, as it were this Ring, he hath given us that to use, and tells us whatsoever our case is, whatsoever wee are, whatsoever we stand in need of, whatsoever distresse wee are in, doe but send this up to me,

(saith hee) do but deliver that message up to me of prayer, and I will bee sure to relieve you. Now certainely what case soever wee are in, when we send up this, it is sure to be conveyed, whersoever we are: Againe, whatsoever our case is, we send it to one that is able to helpe us, which a Prince many times is not able to doe.

may be excused, that he might be freed from it; In this Case, the father will not heare him, for hee knowes the Child is but mistaken.
