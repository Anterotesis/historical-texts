            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> It may, and doth stand with Gods iustice very well: for first, when <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, all his posterity &amp; ofspring was in his loines, from whom they were by the course of nature to issue,<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, God by afflictions &amp; crosses doth seasonably make known the glory of his power, truth, &amp; goodnes in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and eternall helpe and deliuerance.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, God doth bring all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to a finall, and to a most blessed is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and conclusion: for hee doth bring them through the red sea of affliction,<note place="margin">

But seeing that the most wicked and reprobate doe suffer the same euils and troubles that Gods children doe in euery particular (griefe for sin, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for Christ his sake, onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) why should not the ends, effects and euents be the same in them as in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and elect?</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, God did neuer in his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting counsell, purpose and intend to refine and reforme by afflictions the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of wrath (for who then could resist his decree?) neither doe the reprobates at any time, by pure meanes, and in an holy manner, endeauour the same.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the reprobate being void of the spirit of grace and sanctification, doe neuer in right manner acknowledge

                     <p>Secondly, the enemies rage and fury is not of a boundlesse extent, but limited, restrained, &amp; ordered by the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence for our good.</p>

For as the nights darkenes maketh the light of the Sunne more desirable; as vallies set out the mountaines, &amp; the champion coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try commendeth the woodland: so doth warre declare and make knowne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of peace.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, the experience of our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes in battaile, will make vs more expert and aduised for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, (though for the time) we haue lost the day; yet we must comfort our

                     <p>Sixtly, it is better for vs sometimes, to haue the ouerthrow in warre, then to triumph ouer our enemies: for if all things fall out according to our desires, wée would soone put out of our hearts all feare of God, and grow secure, proud, and arrogant, ascribing all the glory of the victory not to God the onely cause, &amp; the only author of it, (for he alone is the Lord of hostes) but to the instrumentall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to our selues onely, and therefore God will by some foile and ouerthrow preuent this erroneous arrogancy.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, we must not be carelesse and secure in the greatest peace and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, seeing that wars come many times when they are least dreaded or doubted.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it is a common euill, and therefore the more patiently to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God hath defined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the beginning, maner, and end

                     <p>Fourthly, if wée must, or néeds will take parts, then it is our wisedome, and iustice to take part with the best cause &amp; persons, and to pray vnto God for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and assistance:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 14.11</note> and then God can &amp; will giue victorie (when it pleaseth him) as well by a few, as by many.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, let vs beséech the almighty to grant repentance to the authors of it, and to saue our country.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25490:22"/>
haue béene so kept by physicke preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues; and many infected persons haue béene cured by medicines and plasters; but if God had immediately strucken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from heauen,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.15</note> (as he did 70000. of <hi>Dauids</hi> people) they had all died without reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, all persons are not (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their naturall constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) apt to take the infection. Secondly, God so ruleth and restraineth the plague, that it shall touch none, nor in any further degrée then God hath appointed.

flight, so that he nothing hurt another, A man may shun dangers of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as warre, famine, waters, fires, and why not then this iudgement?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> They must not bee secure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate (for oftentimes, Gods most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent seruants are not onely tainted &amp; infected with, but also die of the plague) but humble themselues vnder Gods hand, and endeauour by prayer &amp; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to pacifie and put away Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they ought not censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to condemne, but charitably to iudge of them that flie from infected places and persons: for, many of them are not tied to be resident by any speciall calling, and many (specially those that liue by their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25490:24"/>
labours and by their trades) haue no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meanes at home to maintaine them and theirs withall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Why doth God sometimes in one Country, or other, cut downe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy so many thousands of men, by the sword of plague and pestilence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, if God, now and then should not take this strict course, the number of men, (especially amongst Turkes, Papists, Pagans,) would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: for ordinarily men are faster borne then they die, and heereupon God thrusteth in his reaping hooke, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down certaine thousands, when the places where they liue and are resident, could not otherwise well containe, much lesse maintaine them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to snib and controll the pride and presumption of such, who (with <hi>Dauid</hi> when he numbred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) glory and rest in their multitudes &amp; millions:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</note> hereupon he to represse their vaine confidence, and to cure generall and desperate sinnes, abateth and lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth those numbers and multitudes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What meditations are meete for to comfort Gods children in the time of a generall infection by the plague or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25490:24"/>
pestilence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the plague is not casuall &amp; contingent, but is from God and in his disposition, so that none die and depart this life, sooner or latter, in greater or smaller number then God permitteth and hath preordaianed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the time of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, in the time of the Apostles, and in euery age since, (in one place, part, prouince or other) Gods dearest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants haue felt the contagion and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse of it, and sundry of them haue died of this visitation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is a more milde, gentle, and sufferable chastisement, then either warre or famine: for in the beginning, progresse and disposition of it, God rather worketh by himselfe then vseth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of men, and who in iudgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth mercy; but men when they are made the instruments to chastise vs, so follow the violent streame of their owne corrupt affections, that they shew themselues destitute and depriued of all mercy and moderation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, when God doth by the plague correct vs, he will trie and proue our faith in his powerfull and gracious
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25490:25"/>
prouidence: our tender compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our distressed brethren, and our thankefulnesse towards them that either by publike authority, or, of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table disposition attend vpon vs, and that minister to our necessities.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God doth in the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection when the plague most rageth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue very many, and especially those that are imploied about charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which concerne the visited.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Gods children that die by this visitation are as blessed as they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the common course of nature; for the Angels carry their soules into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> bosome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What duties are the visited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to performe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they must commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to God, who will for Christ his sake, be mercifull vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they must (whiles that there is any hope of life, and whiles they haue opportunity) vse preseruatiues, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, physicke, restoratiues, (for so did <hi>Ezechias:</hi>) but if they perceiue the fatall houre to be come, they must willingly, and confidently commend their spirits into Gods hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:25490:25"/>Thirdly, if they be parents and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of families, they must exhort their children, kinsfolke and seruants, to the profession and practise of godlinesse and vertue: for the last words that such vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doe (commonly) leaue the deepest impression in the harts and minds of their chlidren, friends and seruants.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it they recouer of the plague, they must bee thankfull vnto God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note> pay vnto him the vowes which their lips haue promised and their mouth hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in affliction; and for the time to come they must feare afterclaps, and beware lest a worse thing doe heareafter befall them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, there is naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, which deserueth this chastis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, especially when (as sometimes it commeth to passe) it breaketh out into blaines and grosse sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God by correcting them in their bodies, preuenteth in them more greeuous enormities, and saueth them from eternall destruction.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> These (or the like) following. First, we must know that it is Gods hand, and that it commeth not by the will of man, much lesse by chance: and therefore we must repent and patiently endure this correction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God by dearth and scarsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doth preuent his children from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting many sinnes; such as are riot, excesse, gluttony, drunkennes: for as a Physition letteth his patient bloud, to preuent diseases in him: so dealeth God with his children in this chasticement.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, we must, whatin vs lieth, and what wee may with the testimony of a good conscience, defend others fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrong and oppression, and then God will stirre vp them that shall defend vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. How shall a Christian in pouerty, and in want of outward necessary things, resolue and comfort himselfe?</hi>

                        <hi>A.</hi> Albeit pouerty is in it selfe, a vile and miserable state of life, by reason of the want of necessary money and riches, yet there are manifold meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the child of God is to comfort himself, as for example.</p>
                     <p>First, pouerty is to Gods child not a bane, but a blessing, not a curse, but a correction: for Christ himselfe our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour was borne poore,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.</note> liued poor, died poore, and that to make vs rich; and shall wée take that lot grieuously, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may bée made conformable to Christ, and grow rich in grace?</p>

                     <p>Fiftly, wee want many occasions of infection, and prouocations vnto euill: for many men are no longer good then they are poore, and therefore God deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs riches which wee would abuse to pride, vanity, couetousnes, oppression, and vsurie.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, if wee be content, few things are wanting, for nature is content with a little, it desireth onely bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and he is not poore that liueth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature; but a couetous worldling alwayes is bare and néedy, and wanteth that he hath.</p>

                     <p>Eightly, pouerty is a touchstone, and discouereth who are faithful friends, and who are false: who are hollow, and who are holy: for a poore man is commonly contemned, and he will soon shrink from vs, that séeketh not vs but ours.</p>

these are like so many arrowes to shoot at their parents enemies, and so many pensioners to defend and guard thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, good children are the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and ornament of their parents, the ease of their labours, the renewing of their age: and what if for the present they be poore, they may in time arise to such dignity and promotion, that they (after the example of <hi>Ioseph</hi>) may reléeue and nourish their parents, brethren, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the children of Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great potentates, liue not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, longer, more contentedly, nor more safely, holily, &amp; happily then poore mens children: for gentry and greatnes doth not make them better, but many times puffeth them vp, and maketh them more loose and licentious.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, thou being a poore man, must liue within compasse, and cut thy coat according to thy cloth, and then the lesse will suffice thée.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if thy daughters haue no ioyntures, thou must endeuour to bring them vp in vertue, learning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25490:34"/>
qualities in Arts, that not so much their mony, as their modesty, their riches, as their religion, nor their wealth, as their wisdome may be desired: for vertue maketh their marriage happy, and then they shal be matched with good men, where they shall liue more honestly and contentedly, then if they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Kings and Princes.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, thou must ioy in the number of children, for they are the renuing of immortality, and the preseruation of thy name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What comforts are there against basenesse and meannesse of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, God doth call to the state of grace, yea and (many times) to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour in this world, as well the meane as the mighty, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>asely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended as the honourable and noble: for he is no respecter of persons.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a man meanly descended, if he be learned, religious, vertuous, is <hi rend="margQuotes">the cause of nobility to his posterity, which his parents neuer gaue him; he is the founder of their glory, and his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are more conspicuous and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:25490:35"/>Thirdly, vertue only is true nobility, and therefore wee must not séeke from what roote a man springeth, as of what disposition he is of.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, our baptisme and new birth by faith and repentance, maketh vs tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noble and honourable before God, as it did the Prophets and Apostles and others, and it taketh away all note and imputation of meane birth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, some basely descended haue béene blessed and great instruments of good, as <hi>Iudas, Iepta,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> the great.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he must liue well, and then he shall die well.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, his first deformity is washed away in the beginning of life, by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred water of Baptisme; for he hath God for his father, and the Church for his Mother.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, his parents sinne doth not corrupt him, except he bee guilty of the same; for they shall answer for their own sinnes:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.20.</note> for God doth not impute the iniquity of the father to the child, nor the

iniquity of the child to the father.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, he must seeke for good things in himselfe, and not out of it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, let him liue more holily and chastely, and he shall couer his parents shame.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, hee being borne against the lawes, let him doe nothing against them, but doe all things according to them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, let other men iudge of his descent, he onely shall render a reason of his behauiour and life; therefore let him beware that hee adde no worse thing to it.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, the sweetnesse of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the renowne of his life, shall wipe out, not onely the spots: but also all remembrance of his vnhonest birth: for if vertue extoll him, his meane birth cannot depresse him.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, seeing that his parents haue blemished and stained his birth, let him liue well and he shall die well: he hath reason to be more humble and not more heauie; for his owne vertues and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous behauiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will make him more glorious then the imputation of base birth can make him reproachfull.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> First, to frée them from the loue of money, and of these outward thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, God heereby preuenteth many sinnes, into which otherwise they would sinke: for as a father taketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, he would not haue them to trust in these transitory trifling and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine things,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</note> but to trust in him only, who giueth his all things aboundantly to enioy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they (many times) suffer, their money to be idle and vnfruitfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and do no good with their present riches, but make them instruments of euill, and therefore God doth iustly depriue them thereof.</p>

                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 12, 15</note> to weane and withdraw them from worldlinesse and couetousnesse, for it choaketh the seede of the word; and as for worldly riches, though a man haue aboundance of them (yet) his life stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in them.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to chastice, and correct them, and to cause them to see and be sorry for their error, for that they in their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, were puffed vp and withall slacke and negligent in reléeuing the necessities of their brethren; and also (as all earthly things are changeable and vaine) to make them more seriously to séeke the things aboue,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> By considering, first, that all these outward things (to speak properly) are none of our own,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.11.12.</note> and none of the true &amp; spirituall riches which can neuer be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs: for they are subiect to the

                     <p>Thirdly, by the losse of them, they are fréed from all thoughtfull care in getting and in keeping them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he that enioyeth them the longest, must of necessity part with them in death, and then he knoweth not what will be come of them, nor into whose hands they will fall.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God can make vs gainers by our losses, and restore our goods double vnto vs,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob</hi> 42.10.</note> as he did vnto patient <hi>Iob.</hi>

                     <p>Sixthly, al necessities and wants shal be abundantly supplied at the day of the general Resurrection, and therefore they must in the meane time possesse their soules by their patience.</p>

                     <p>Fiftly, the losse of our pretious time, (which wée ought to redéeme) and of our good name, should more trouble vs then the losse of our worldly wealth; and wee must much more bewaile our sinnes, the causes of our miseries, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and losses.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, it is better to be deceiued, then to deceiue, and to bee a patient in this point then an agent: for it is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, rather then sinne, to be deceiued in outward matters.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal</hi> 32.1.2.</note> as it is a signe of a man truely regenerate to haue his spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guile, viz. in duties towards God &amp; men: so it is the brand of a wicked man,

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, we must striue against the streame of the worlds corruption, our hearts and words must accord, we must not make shew of one thing, and doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, like him that roweth in a boate, that turneth his face one way, and goeth and is carried another way.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, we may, &amp; must conceiue good hope of procuring naturall sléepe, and rest; for if sicknes take it away, health may restore it; and if feare depriue vs of it, hearts ease and quietnes of mind will make vs againe partakers of it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we are by our wakefulnesse, and want of sléepe freed from the terrour of dreames, and from many illusions, doubts, feares, wherewith men in their sléepe are assaulted.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, God will haue vs to estéeme more highly of the blessing of sleep when we obtaine and enioy it; and to shew our selues more thankefull for it.</p>

                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> men die, seeing that their sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, because the remainders of sinne are left in them, which cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, but by changing corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incorruption: and this cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the last day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the law of nature must bèe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:25490:50"/>
fulfilled, as well in them, as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the quality of death is changed in the beléeuers:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.13.</note> for it is not death, but a sleepe, and not a punishment, but a fatherly correction, yea and a spéedy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Seeing that the soules of the Saints are immediately after their departure out of the body glorified, why are the bodies so long kept vnder the power of death, and not iointly glorified with their soules?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the body did sinne last, and therefore is glorified last, <hi>for this stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the proportion of iustice</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God in detaining the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a time in the earth, which is the first death, doth hereby declare his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in deliuering both soule and body fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the second death.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</note> wee must by death bee made conformable to Christ our Sauiour, that wee may raigne with him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 19.</note> God will hereby shew the truth of that his threatning, Thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou returne.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Christ their head and King,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:25490:51"/>
who is the resurrection,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.</note> and the life, and the first fruits of the dead, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be glorified before the members.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the bodies of the Saints, though lying in the graue and consumed there, yet are without sinne, and sense of paine, and they shall arise againe in glory at the last day, and be reunited to their soules, &amp;c. and both together inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite eternall happines through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob. But the bodies of Henoch, before the law, and of Elias in time of the law, neuer died, but were rapt and translated into heauen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, these examples are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and therefore they are no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule to others. For God did not onely hereby signifie to the world in what account he had them, (though the world distasted and despised their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and blessed doctrine;) but hee made them types and figures of the generall resurrection.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, some Diuines hold, that their bodies (though rapt vp into the aire) were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed in the aire, because Christ in regard of his bodily ascension is said to be the first fruits of the dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:25490:51"/>Lastly, they died an extraordinary death, such as we the Saints that shalbe found aliue at Christ his comming shall tast of, for their bodies were in a moment changed from mortality to immortality,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.</note> and from corruption to incorruption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. But why doe Infants (that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Innocents) die, seeing that they doe not, and cannot sinne with consent of will, nor of knowledge, as doe men of yeares?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Albeit they want, (as yet) the power, meanes, instruments, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Actuall sinne, yet they haue the bitter and poisonfull root of originall sinne,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</note> in them, and in it they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and borne, and the wages euen of it, is death,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God will sometimes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally punish or ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sten the parents in the death of their children, because they are flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bones, and who (perhaps) would (if God granted them longer life,) match and equall their parents in sinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q What are we further to consider in prosecuting this argument of death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A</hi> Foure chiefe branches or partes.</p>
                     <p>First, some of the (principall) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:25490:52"/>
and supposed euils of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the benefites of it, both Priuatiue, and Affirmatiue, or Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the right preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, a right disposition in death it selfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q What are some of the principall (and so reputed) euils?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Thrée: First, the suddennes of it in many.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the violent death of many.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the vncomfortable, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable effects of it, in that it bereaueth vs of the benefite, company, gifts, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, gouernment of many notable, and worthy persons in Church, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and family.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Now (to handle euery member of the diuision in his right place and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) is sudden death, simply euill, and a curse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> I must néeds distinguish of sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death; for, <hi>qui non distinguit, destruit artem.</hi> First in it selfe it is not euill; but because it commonly taketh men vnrepentant, and vnprepared; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:25490:52"/>
the last iudgement should be simply euill, because it is sudden, seeing that the sonne of man will come in an houre, when wee looke not for him: but this sudden comming of Christ is not euil,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.17.</note> but good, and happy for Gods children. Againe, the manner and time of euery mans death, is not in his own dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in Gods power and hands onely.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must distinguish of it, according to the persons, vpon whom it seazeth: they are either irrepentant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and thus die; and to these death is hel-mouth, &amp; the beginning of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting torment;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</note> or <hi>repentant,</hi> and to these it is no curse; for Christ hath (by his death and passion) taken away the curse; but it is a short and vnsensible crosse, and correction, which freeth them from the feare of death, and doth speedily conuey them into the hauen of eternall rest.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is not sudden to the godly, that long before foresaw it, and waited for it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the sooner that they die, the sooner are they blessed:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apo.</hi> 14.13</note> for <hi>they rest from their labours, and their works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, many of Gods children haue
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:25490:53"/>
died suddenly, yet they were not hereby defrauded of eternall glory: of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were <hi>Iobs</hi> children; <hi>Meph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as for wicked, vnbeléeuing, and vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant persons, they liue not out half their dayes, but sudden, (yea &amp; ordinary) death is to them a curse, and a swift posting of them into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, (as we may see in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Nabal,</hi> and the rich churle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we reade in the 12 of <hi>Luke.</hi>)</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Seeing that death many times stealeth and encrocheth vpon vs so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for; wée ought daily to prepare ourselues against it, by prayer, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the practise of good works, and to thinke euery day to be the last; for (as an ancient Father saith) <hi>vtiliter latet vltimus dies,</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, wee must daily commend our soules and spirits into Gods hands, as vnto a faithfull Creator, not doubting but that hee will receiue and glorifie them; but as for the time of death, and the warning that God giueth vs of it, we must refer it wholy to his heauenly disposition.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. But sudden death cannot preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his saluation, &amp; there is no expresse forme of prayer against sudden death in all the scripture; why then should any Christian man pray against it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, because sudden death more often befalleth to the wicked,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.19.</note> then to the good.</p>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:25490:54"/>Secondly, because fewnes of daies, and suddennes of death is wished to the wicked in way of imprecation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may pray for some warning of death approching, that the wicked and prophane doe not rashly censure, iudge, and condemn vs, as though wee died ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, and out of Gods fauour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee cannot otherwise (by our good confession and prayer) glorifie God before men in our death, nor giue at all a good example of dying well to our family, or others.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if we being of ability) die in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate, and without making a will, the poore may be defr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What shall wee iudge of Gods children that doe perish by the enemies sword, and (by consequence) are this way cruelly and suddenly massacred?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> It hath beene the lotte of Gods Saints in the old and new Testament, and in all ages sithence, thus to end their liues,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 5.2.</note> and they blessed, yea blessed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:25490:54"/>
with a further addition of glory, because they died for Gods cause.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this kind of death cannot kill the soule,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32</note> nor separate soule or body from Gods fauour and loue.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they had no (special) promise to die quietly in their beds, or in their friends hands, and (as for their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) they haue preuented themselus fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing any further power ouer Gods children, for they haue done their worst. Finally, <hi>non nocet bonis (si subito) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidantur, vel si subita morte pereunt.

For they die not suddenly, who alwaies thought that they should die.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, right many haue béene by the sword not knighted in earth, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred here, and crowned in heauen; &amp; this besides the pregnant testimonies of sacred scriptures,) the experience of all times and ages euinceth and verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. How shall wee arme and resolue our selues against the feare of perishing by the enemies sword, or any such kind
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25490:55"/>
of violent death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First it skilleth and mattereth not, whether a burning feauer, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the sword kill vs, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prison be set or broken open.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we are not so much to feare the hand as the wound; <hi rend="margQuotes">but death doth not so much wound as cure and salue the godly from their sinnes and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee may hereby bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented of a more lingring and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, as to die by famine, and by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> By marking and meditating vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these (or the like) propositions and grounds following. First, no man dieth before his time: for it is appointed for all men once to die,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.</note> and this time not man, but God hath in his eternall certainty appointed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are loosed from the bonds of sinne and this earthly misery, and how can this be out of time?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:25490:56"/>Thirdly, they as well as any others, owed a death vnto God, and were (at Gods call) to make present paiment: now this death is due euery day, how then demanded before the day?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, these worthy instruments in Church and commonwealth, these pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in Gods house, these noble Cedars in Libanon, these starres in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, these Phen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ces, and déere saints and seruants of God, were fitter for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then earth and therefore, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were vnworthy of them, and vnthankfull to God for them,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.20. <hi>Esay</hi> 57.1.2.</note> partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they should not see the euils to come, and partly, that they should not be changed and infected with the worlds wickednes, God hath iustly depriued vs of them, but crowned them with the crowne of euerlasting glory.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, a long life is a long labour, and a suspension (as it were) of their life from immortality; and hee that liueth long, what hath he but increase of sins, manifold cares, griping griefes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastefull discontentments? and will he count these his gaines, gettings, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and aduantages?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, they die not suddenly, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25490:56"/>
soone haue growne old, and haue spéedily sailed ouer the troublesome and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous sea of this world, into the blessed Canaan.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if God sée vs truly humbled for the losse of these glorious lights, and earnestly to sorrow for our sinnes and vnthankfulnes, that haue bereaued vs of them; God can and wil raise vp a new succession in their stead; he can cause <hi>Iosua</hi> to succéed <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> to succéed <hi>Aza; Salomon</hi> to follow next after <hi>Dauid; Elizeus</hi> to execute the office of <hi>Elias</hi> his predecessor, &amp; can (as he did) cause very many worthy and vigilant Bishops, and faithful Pastors to succéed the Apostles: and therefore in this, though we ought to be humbled, yet we must hope well, and know that Gods arme is not shortned, nor his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What vse are we to make of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, either in regard of others, or else in respect of our selues?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, in regard of others, we must lament and bewaile our sinnes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, whereby we haue depriued our selues of them, and that we did not more praise God, nor better serue him
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25490:57"/>
when we enioyed them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must not enuie at, but congratulate their aduancement and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting happinesse, <hi>sed eodem animo ferenda mors,</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, it is our duty to pray vnto God to raise vp new in their place; and if their equals, or those that doe in some good measure resemble them doe succéed, it is our duty more to esteeme them and haue them in the higher account, <hi>nam bona nostra, carendo magis quam fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo cognos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, in regard of our selues, if we (as we ought) purpose to doe well, let vs doe it quickly, lest we be preuented; and if we haue begun to doe some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy acts,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron</hi> 39.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, when he made preparation for the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. God the righteous Iudge, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and reward not onely our action, but our affection, and our desire as well as our déed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, let vs, laying aside all other works, intend and study this one thing,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:25490:57"/>
which is, to die well; for this is <hi>instar om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> that is, this instead of all, (for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the antient Prouerbe) All is well that ends well.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, their vertues are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and for thy practise and imitation, and the remembrance of them is swéete, delightsome, and comfortable vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it may be when we enioied them, we did not (as our duty required) honour, reuerence, and esteeme or them.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, if our friends be remooued hence, and translated into heauen, we must labour by our godlinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humility, and weldoing, to gain &amp; get new friends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:25490:58"/>Lastly, if all our chiefe friends and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nofactors on earth, be flowen vp into heauen, it must abundantly suffice and content vs, that the whole holy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuideable Trinity, God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost are our friends, fauorites, benefactors, vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for they are all in all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs as well trust in God when our friends faile, as when they abound.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, children and young men are but as flowers in God his garden; and we must suffer God the soueraigne Lord of it and them, to crop and gather them when he will.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the yonger that they died, they were the lesse defiled with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20.</note> and they departed being not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the burthen of many sinnes, which longer continuance of time would haue drawne them into. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Fifthly, if there be a decay, mortality and change in <hi>Okes and Cedars,</hi> much more in man, that hath rebelled against his Creator.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, it may be, that when wee inioyed them, that either wee were too tender and fond ouer them, and so would haue corrupted them, or else were not contented with them, nor thankfull to God for them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God (to remedy and correct both

these extremities) hath bereaued vs of them.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, if our children led a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and so died, then they are in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and forth comming; their life is not vanished but changed: and though we haue lost them, yet God hath found them, and at the generall resurrection we shall finde them, know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them: wherefore let vs in the meane time rest content, and <hi>comfort our selues</hi> in this blessed expectation:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, we must remember that we being mortall our selues, begat them mortall, and that all men must die (sooner or latter) though the time, place, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be vnknowne vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if we bewaile them being dead, we should (in some sort) haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed them as soone as they were born, for then they began to die.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we must out of heauinesse conceiue matter of happinesse, and kéepe a measure in lamentation, and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for euery losse, lest our whole life be filled with lamentation.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we must instruct them, and pray for them whiles that they liue: but when we perceiue death to approach, we must not in vaine striue against God, but willingly suffer him to take his owne.</p>

First,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iob</hi> 14.1.2.</note> that their parents were borne mortall, and must néeds die: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children comming of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be immortall.

The earth their common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must receiue them all, and at the last day yéeld vp all againe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, their parents are not lost, for God hath found them, and fréed them from all miseries and molestations: and therefore they in this regard must bee content.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23.</note> that they shall not returne to their children, but their children goe to them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they were borne first, and therefore must die first, and they are not forsaken, but sent before them to blisse.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, God hath depriued them of their parents, either to correct their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring against them, or their vndutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards them, or (at least) to try how they will depend vpon him, when all earthly meanes faile and are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they must patiently vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe Gods correction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they must heartily repent them of their sinnes, the cause thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they must follow their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous example, and immortalize their memories.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they must more highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme Gods benefits when they inioy them.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, death is a common corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Gods children, and no person must looke to be fréed from it.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, though their bodies be dead and interred, yet their soules liue, and their vertues (like so many children left behind them) are immortall, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression hereof (as of their kindnes and indulgence towards them) must neuer be blotted out.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, though they want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable company of their brethren and sisters, yet they are not alone, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vpon and guarded by so many

                     <p>Secondly, let vs giue God all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks and praise, for that hee will by death thus ease and disburden vs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, let vs in the certaine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of so great deliuerance at the year of Iubily, be willing to goe to God, (as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were) and in the mean time to sustaine all crosses patiently.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, we must before hand thinke on our latter end, and not foolishly accuse old age, or nature: for death commeth, &amp; is inflicted from God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, me must betimes thinke on on the right composing and ordering of our liues, namely, whether that wee haue ceased to doe euill,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, we must know that Christ hath abolished eternall death, and made our temporary death an entrance to the Father.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> He must séeke to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and for this end, he must repaire and renue his faith and repentance, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because (many times) in temptation, hee looseth somthing; and partly because hee daily slippeth or committeth new sinnes, which require a new act of faith, and repentance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he must constantly confesse Christ, and proclaime and publish how many wayes God hath beene good to his soule and body.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, hee must by the eyes of faith, view, contemplate, &amp; looke vpon Christ,

the brazen serpent, and then death shall neuer sting him.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Because (ordinarily) sicknesses, paines, and diseases are sent and inflicted of God for a punishment, and for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and amendment, as most clearely appeareth in many places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.2, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.74.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Hee must performe all duties of piety, loue and righteousnes: and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Ministers must not onely commaund and exhort their people, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, hearers, to listen to, and obey sound doctrine,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, he must aduise, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to constancy, and to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

of the sauing truth; for his words spoken at such a time leaue the greatest impression in the minds of them that heare him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he must (for the peace of his owne soule, and for the preuenting and cutting of many (néedlesse) suites and contentions in law that might arise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death) in equity and conscience make his last <hi>Will and Testament,</hi> and bequeath his goods, lands, liuing, to his wife, children, kinsfolke, friends, and to the poore, as the law of God and man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> He must by faith in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su arme himselfe against satans assaults, and against the feare of death and the last iudgement; and he must not so much feare death, as looke on euerlasting life.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, touching the body, he must be carefull to vse physicke, and all other good meanes to preserue and continue life and health, vntill it shall please God to take it away.</p>

                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.5.</note> hee must continually resigne himselfe, and commend his soule and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into Gods blessed hands.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, God will honour such as feare and honour him; he (I say) will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, as well in life as in death. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he will make the name and memory of them pretious after death:<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, death is to Gods children a gaile deliuery from all sinne, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of this life, and a passage vnto the euident and manifest sight and presence of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in death God is not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with his children, by his spirit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, comfort, and assist them, but also sendeth his holy Angels to attend vpon them and to saue them,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>A.</hi> By marking and meditating vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these conclusions following.</p>
                     <p>First, bodily deformity doth nothing preiudice the estate of Gods Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, (as the examples of <hi>Iob, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Mephibosheth, Ezechias, Aza, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> &amp;c. and of innumerable besides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> demonstrate.)</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they endure but for a time, and (at the furthest) end and determine with this life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, though the bodies of Gods Saints be (for the time) neuer so loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and deformed, yet are their sinnes couered by the roiall roabes of Christ his righteousnesse,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ps.</hi> 32.1.2.</note> and the soule in the meane time is most holy, perfect, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, at the general resurrection, this vile body of ours shall be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Christs glorious body:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20.</note> it shall be no more mortall, but immortall; no more vise, but honourable; no more weake, but alwaies strong, no more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, but light and nimble; no more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but holy: and in a word, no more earthly, and néeding these outward meanes and helps of meat, drinke, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, rest, sléepe, physicke, recreation,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:25490:75"/>
marriage, &amp;c. but they shall be alwaies spirituall, i. immediately supported by Gods omnipotent power, and absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subiect and obedient to the spirit.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God doth not hate the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the body, but of the soule, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of sinne, contracted and committed by it and in it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we must remember, that our bodies are earthly and mortall, and not heauenly and eternall: and therefore we must not be discontent,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16</note> if rottennes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into them; onely let vs prouide, that as the outward man dieth, so the inward man may be renewed daily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What comforts against lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, lamenesse is naturall, and is caused by sicknes, old age, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and therefore it is to be endured with the greater patience.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 9.33. <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
                        </note> the children of God (as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aza,</hi> the créeple, whereof we reade in the fifth of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, and a daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi>) haue béen,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, though the bodies of Gods Saints (for their correction,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16</note> trial, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise)
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:25490:76"/>

                     <p>Fourthly, death and the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the time of the restitution of all things, will put an end to it and the body shall rise againe in farre greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie then euer it appeared in, when it was in the best plight.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, physicke or surgery may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in time recouer the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meanes are not to be neglected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.22.</note>Lastly, let our faith &amp; hope be in God, and our soules purified in obeying the truth through the spirit, and lamenesse shall not hurt vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Wherein shall a blind man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and solace himselfe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> In many things. First, that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is a great part of innocency: for the eies (since <hi>Adams</hi> fall) are the windowes of concupiscence, and the porters to let in all vices, from which enticements vnto euill, and blind are fréed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the blind sée nothing to distaste their stomackes, to offend their eies, or to grieue their minds, whereas iust <hi>Lot</hi> endued with the sense of <hi>seeing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.</note> 
                        <hi>vexed his righteous soule from day to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:25490:76"/>
day, in</hi> séeing the vnlawfull deeds of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> &amp;c. And so it fareth with Gods children that are blind, who sée not the euill obiects nor wickednes of the world.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, blindnes is naturall and contracted by old age, sicknes, and the like infirmities, and therefore <hi>Isaac, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timaeus,</hi> and the blind man in the ninth of <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, and diuers Saints of God in all generations haue borne their parts herein; therefore this correction is so much the more patiently to be borne.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, though the godly haue no bodily eies to behold the heauens, the earth, and the creatures, which eies the beasts, birds, and creeping creatures haue common with them, yet they haue spirituall and Angelical eies, whereby they behold God their Creator, and looke vpon Christ sitting on the right hand of God his Father in heauen.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the eies are not simply neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for godlinesse, for God requireth the heart and vnderstanding: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they shall be restored, yea and glorified at the generall resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore let vs cléere the eies of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25490:77"/>
our vnderstanding, and cast out of them all beames of selfe conceit, and all dust of error. And because our memories are then most sharpe and retentiue, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no outward obiect to blunt their edge, let vs apply them to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the best things, and with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wait the time of the restitution of all things.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q Propound some comfortable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations for a deafe man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the deafe person cannot be infected with lies and errors, he cannot be deceiued and gulled by flatterers, nor bee possessed with the ingredients of griefe, he cannot be prouoked to wrath, he séeth nothing to disturbe and disquiet him, and (that which most contenteth him) he cannot heare Gods blessed name blasphemed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by reading the scriptures, sermons, treatises, catechismes, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God speake vnto him: for God hath no néed of eares, but only requireth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26.</note>Thirdly, that which he formerly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the holy Ghost bringeth to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, his perfect hearing shall, (if
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:25490:77"/>
not before) be restored vnto him at the day of iudgement, and his deafenesse in the mean time cannot separate him from Gods loue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q What vse must a man make of his deafnesse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, whiles we inioy the benefit of our hearing,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.71.</note> let vs attend to Gods voice in the scriptures preached vs, and let vs treasure vp the word of God in our hearts to bestead vs in time of néed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, though we cannot heare nor discerne the notes of musicke, and the sounds of men and birds, yet we haue the vse of our eies, to behold the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and God the Author of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Comforts for a dumbe man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Men by reason of this want and affliction, are kept from many sinnes, euils, dangers, which many that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not temper and gouerne their tongue runne into, for they cannot lie, slander, deceiue, they cannot blaspheme God, nor stirre vp the coales of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ention, the séeds whereof an euill tongue doth cherish.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are not vndone by their rash &amp; vntemperate words, much
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:25490:78"/>
lesse are they in danger to lose their liues, as many lewd and slanderous speakers are.<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is a labour to speake truly: and in silence there is rest.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if thou hast lost an il tongue, thou art a great gainer by it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, if thou canst not speake with thy tongue, then speake to God in thy heart; for God can and doth heare as well when thou art silent, as when thou speakest.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if thou doe but groane, sigh, and cry vnto God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.7.</note> he heareth thée, and that thou shalt féele and finde. For as he that heareth God speake and answer,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For <hi>Abigail</hi> was crossed by <hi>Nabal</hi> her husband;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</note> and many innocent wiues in <hi>Moses</hi> time,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, if their husbands in the flesh be euill and shrewd, yet Christ their spirituall husband will alwaies intreat them kindly, and louingly visit them by

his spirit, if so be that they feare him and beleeue in him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they must be of pure conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and reuerence their husbands, the hidden man of the heart must be vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.2.4.5.</note> with a méeke and quiet spirit, and subiect themselues vnto their husbands, and then they shall either win them, or (at least) leaue them without iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themselues, or excuse.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, (it may be) they were rash in their choice, and did not consult with God by praier, and with good men by conference about it.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, they must acknowledge that they are thus crossed for their sins, and therefore they must the more willingly beare the burthen of their offences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:25490:79"/>Fourthly, if they can endure raine and smoak in their houses, why not then their wiues?</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, goodnes and vertue in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is not naturall, but from aboue, &amp; commeth not from their first birth, but from their second: for that which is borne of the flesh is flesh,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6.</note> &amp; that which is borne of the spirite, is spirit; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many good men haue had euill children, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had his <hi>Ismael, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saacke</hi> had his <hi>Esau, Dauid</hi> his <hi>Absolon,</hi> and <hi>Amnon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hezechias</hi> his <hi>Manasses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, sometimes Parents are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25490:80"/>
punished in their children, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue beene disobedient to superiours, and to their owne parents, and partly, because they haue béen neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in teaching, correcting, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them vp.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all children are not predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to saluation, (as we haue <hi>Elies</hi> sons, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> for examples) and therefore we must not looke to haue all good and holy: for iustification and sanctification followeth onely election, and is not common to all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, parents must giue their children holy example,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1.</note> and when they are young bend and bow them, &amp; bring them vp in the nurture and information of the Lord, and then if they proue not good, their vngodlinesse shall neuer bee imputed to the innocent parents.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, though for the present they be euill and desperate, yet hope wel of them, and pray for them, and vse all meanes constantly for their amendment, &amp; then leaue the successe to God the changer of the hearts.</p>

                        <hi>Q. How shall vertuous children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselues that are crossed with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, euill, and irreligious parents?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:25490:80"/>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, sometimes seuerity in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is for their childrens good, who if the parents should not sometimes grow vnkind, they would forget God and themselues.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must beare, with &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their infirmities, (as farre as wee lawfully and honestly may) attributing it to old oge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, the more degenerate, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious that they be, the more by our humility, dutifulnes, good exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they must sée and consider whether that they haue giuen them good example, and haue béene carefull to traine them vp in true religion, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, otherwise they are as much in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, they must partly by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle admonitions, and partly by seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corrections, labour to reforme their misdeamenours; if this will not serue, if thou haue hired many seruants, lessen the number of them, and they will the better agrée, and thou shalt not bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to put them away: but if thou haue few, and they be incorrigible, put them away,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What comforts and instructions are meete for diligent and dutifull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that either are wronged, misused, or (at least) vnkindly entreated by euill Lords, and Masters?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, many right good and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty seruants haue béene not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, but also cruelly entreated both of ancient &amp; of latter times. Thus was <hi>Hagar</hi> seuerely handled by <hi>Sarah. Iacob</hi> collogned withall, and deceiued by <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban: Joseph</hi> put out of seruice, &amp; wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imprisoned by <hi>Potiphar; Dauid</hi> persecuted by <hi>Saul</hi>; and therefore no strange matter hath befallen them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the more griefes &amp; wrongs they endure for conscience towards God
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25490:82"/>
and for well doing the greater praise and reward shall they receiue from God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, their hard seruice or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, will one day end.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, that they are Gods fréemen, for his seruice is perfect freedome.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that God in time will right their wrongs, and requite them that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used them; for he is no respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What duties are they to performe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Seruants must feare God &amp; vse all good meanes to gaine their fauours, and obey them (as well in their absence as in their presence) in all lawfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 5 6.7.</note> and doe them seruice, as vnto the Lord: &amp; if their masters wil not yet relent they must comfort themselues in their innocency, and recommend their cause to God, whose freemen they are.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they must content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this, that they haue an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and good Father in the flesh, and that they haue the Church of God for their mother.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, she is a woman, and of the weaker sexe, and therfore it is not a part of a valiant man to resist a woman.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that it is a matter far more glorious and acceptable to God and good men, to passe by &amp; pardon wrongs, then to offer them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it must suffice, that the step-mothers loue their Fathers, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25490:83"/>
therefore they must for their fathers sake beare with them, and reuerence them.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the more insolent that their stepmothers are, the more innocent and humble they must be; they must reuenge the wrongs (that their stepmothers offer them) ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, it is arrogancy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption ambitiously to desire to obtain all things that wee néede. For mighty Emperours haue béene denied in many things, yea God himselfe (albeit hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them for our good, and not for his owne, for hee néedeth nothing) hée requireth many things of vs, which we yéeld him not.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they must perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that if their petition had been condescended vnto, it (perhaps) had not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25490:83"/>
béene for their good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they must not be ouermuch aggreeued, if men denie vnto them small thinges, seeing that God gratiously granteth them thinges of farre greater worth, vse, and excellency.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if Gods children should haue no deniall in worldly things, they would affect the world rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods word, and rather trust in men then in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, in this world, the mighty are preferred ordinarily before the meane, and great men before good men.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, though they receiue a deniall the first, second, or third time, yet if they be patient and constant, they may spéede at last.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What vse are we to make hereof?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, if wee would haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, we must craue things honest and possible.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, wee must be ready to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure others, if wee would haue them to gratifie vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What counsell and comfort is fit for them that are decayed or vndone by rash suertiship?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, it déepely concerneth them
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25490:84"/>
to repent of their former vnaduisednes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.15.</note> and be wiser for the time to come.</p>

                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.1.2.3.4.5 6.</note>Secondly, they must humbly sue to their creditors for fauour, patience, and forgiuenes, or (at least) for abasement.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that which their pouerty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay, they must lay it, and put it on Christ, and then God will neuer exact it at their hands.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it fel out through their selfe-will and voluntary disposition,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.37.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must take it patiently.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, they shall learne by their own hurt, how profitable and pleasant a thing it is to owe nothing, and to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bonds and yrons.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if they be onely decaied, and not vndone, it wil make them (when the worst is past) alwaies to dread the like daunger, and to feare the like fals.</p>

                        <hi>Q. What vse are wee to make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, it behoueth vs to be wary, for whom we become sureties,<note place="margin">

the debt; yet wée full little know what losses and empouerishment may befal vs in the meane time.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, other mens decaies by suer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship must bee our discipline, and their woes our warnings.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if we be disposed to doe good, let vs rather impart our goods to the poore, then (otherwise) to loose our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with our liuing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What comforts against discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment conceiued by reason of good seruice towards Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, neither respected, nor rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> They must take notice of these rules and directions following. First, this procéedeth from mans weakenesse, and forgetfulnesse, and therefore this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence must not bee ouermuch aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, many worthy men of good parts and seruice, haue béene neglected &amp; reiected in the world; <hi>Ioseph</hi> was forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler; <hi>Dauid</hi> an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petitioner vnto <hi>Nabal</hi> was repelled, and reproched: good <hi>Iacob</hi> a faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant was euill entreated of <hi>Laban: Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> life was sought of <hi>Saul,</hi> and Christ

the Lord of all, (yet seruant to all) was forsaken of all Unthankefull men are vngodly vnwise and wicked; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must the lesse regard them; for can men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we must alwayes doe good, and looke for our guerdon and reward from God, and not from men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the lesse hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that wee haue of reward from men, (who are many times vnthankefull, the more reuerend and regardfull is our good seruice before God.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Gods children are plaine and simple, and cannot begge, flatter, nor dissemble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéemed in the world, much lesse promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preferred.</p>

                        <hi>Q. What duties must wee performe herein?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, we must render to no man euill for euill, but good for euill, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens vnthankefulnes must not hinder vs from doing good.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let vs beware, lest whiles wee complaine and crie out of other mens vnthankefulnes, we bee found vnthankefull our selues, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25490:85"/>
God.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the vnthankfulnes of men must not barre vs from doing good, lest that we forgoe the comfort of a good conscience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. How shall a man comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe whose wife is barren, and how shall likewise the woman quiet her selfe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, they both are freed from euil children, and from the feare of sinne and danger, that they might otherwise fall into.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are fréed from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of nurses, and the yelling of infants.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the husband shall bee sure neuer to nourish and bring vp another mans children for his owne. And this is a great benefit; for if an adulterous wife be a great euill, much more is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, the reproch of barrennesse, maketh the wife more diligent and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for shee with <hi>Hannah</hi> weepeth, and is silent, when many other women are insolent and imperious. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, God will hereby correct coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and worldly affections in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which by the number &amp; multiplication of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Secondly, it behoueth Gods children neuer to presume of outward security from any temptation, but to prepare and arme themselues against it; and if Satan by his instruments at any time (by Gods permission) afflict and torment them, they must know that it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the triall of their faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, they must shew forth by hearty praier and fasting, their faith whereby they rely on Gods méere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and herein they must pray absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the pardon of their sinnes, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally for deliuerance from the hurts and torments of witches and sorcerers, for they are but temporall euils.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, they must comfort themselues in this, that the diuell and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are but Gods executioners, who directeth their practises to his childrens good, and that he being a most wise God, and a louing father in Christ, will not suffer them to be tried and exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their ability, but will in his good time, either in this life, or in the end of this life, by death eternally deliuer them, and put them in present possession of euerlasting ease and happinesse.</p>

                           <hi>Q Whether those that were vexed by euill spirits, in the time that Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the earth, or in any age sithence, were onely obsessed and outwardly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Satan, or possessed by the

                           <hi>A.</hi> (No doubt) they were tormented both waies. Touching obsession, there is no question; and touching possession, it is apparant by these and the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. First, by a distinct voice heard out of the person possessed, differing from his owne naturall voice.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by the speaking of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest languages, which the party posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed neuer formerly vnderstood.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, our blessed Sauiour Christ cast out a diuell out of a man, and bad him enter in no more.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, (a few words satisfie men not conceited or contentious) the experience of most ages, and the iudgement of the most Orthodox Diuines proueth it.</p>

                           <pb n="179" facs="tcp:25490:92"/>Secondly, Satan by Gods permission, had power ouer the blessed body of our Sauiour Christ, and transported it from place to place,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, Satan infected <hi>Iobs</hi> body with lothsome and pestilent botches and boiles, yea and ouerturned the house wherein <hi>Iobs</hi> children were vpon them, and so crushed and squéesed them in péeces.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, holy and blessed <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted by satan.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7</note> a daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> was troubled eightéene yéeres with a spirit of infirmity; for Satan so bowed her, that she could not lift vp her head.</p>

                        <p>Seuenthly, the child of a true beléeuer was by satan possessed.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, the experience of all ages and times (more or lesse) verifieth and iustifieth the truth of this assertion.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First Satans both nature and power is restrained, limitted, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for touching his nature, he is but a creature, and finite both in knowledge and power. And as touching his power, (though it be very great) yet he is so bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and restrained by the decrée, &amp; will of God, that he cannot put in execution all his naturall power, to the hurt and annoiance of any whatsoeuer.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, sundry of Gods saints, as <hi>Iob,</hi> and a daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was bound by satan eightéene yéeres: yea and our blessed Sauiours body, was subiect (for the time) to satans malice, and yet all happily escaped, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: Christ by his owne power foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and the other were conquerors in and through Christ.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that in Gods children, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session by satan onely annoieth the body, which is as it were the outward wall or the circumference; <hi rend="margQuotes">but he can neuer win or ouercome the castles of our hearts, nor attaine vnto the center of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>

                        <p>Lastly, that possession by euill spirits,

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> They must heartily pray vnto, and call vpon God in Christ, to checke satan, and to restrain his power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and (consequently) to deliuer them and theirs: and in the meane time, they must patiently beare that particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and wait Gods leasure vntill he deliuer them. <hi>Iob</hi> 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they must haue recourse to God in his word, in which he promiseth them his presence, and protection in their greatest dangers. <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.10.11. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.51. <hi>Esay</hi> 66.12. <hi>Num.</hi> 23.25.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, they must to their holy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, ioyne practises of good works and newnes of life, and then all things will goe well with them in the end.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p>Lastly, because in possession, God doth either correct some euill in the party pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, or make triall of his faith, his friends must endeuor to bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for his sinnes, and this being done, to perswade the said party to wait constantly and patiently for the good time of his happy deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> We must remember and weigh diuers things. First, that in these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions, the Saints of God in all ages, share and are copartners with vs.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Thirdly, that if they bee weyed in a ballance either with the horrours and torments of the damned, from which Christ hath deliuered vs, or with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ioyes of heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein our Lord hath slated vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.</note> they are as nothing, and therefore wee are more patiently, and ioyfully to vndergoe them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if these temptations, bee great &amp; grieuous, then they (like strong purgations) will worke our greatest peace at length.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, we must note, that <q>the way to heauen is not strawed with flowers, and roses, but set with thornes, and therefore we ought to be well shod with the preparation of the Gospell of peace, <bibl>

                        <p>Sixtly, God will not long leaue vs comfortlesse, but as the temptation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, so shall the consolation much more, and the euent shall bee alwaies good.</p>
                        <p>Seuenthly, God doth sometimes forsake vs, so that wee sinne greatly, and sometimes that we are hopelesse in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25490:102"/>
our troubles, that Gods fauour recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, should be more estéemed of vs. For as the morning light is more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after the darkenesse of the night, as walking after sléepe, health after sicknes, a calme after a storme, and peace after war: so is Gods loue more admired after, and his fauour more desirable &amp; acceptable, when sundry temptations and desertions haue gone before.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, God in due season will bring these dolefull desertions to an excellent issue, and to a blessed conclusion.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, wee must neuer promise to our selues any immunity from these troubles and trials, but arme and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selues against them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, we must not pine away in our troubles, nor despaire, but wee must

liue by faith, and waite vpon our God, vntill he gloriously deliuer vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. With what comfortable directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rules, are the consciences of Gods children to bee relieued that are vexed in soule by reason of some grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinne committed?</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, they must know that God (in the matter of our saluation) worketh by the contraries,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh</hi> 3.16.</note> they must remember that Christ his satisfaction to Gods iustice is of infinite value and worth, and that if they doe by the hand of a liuely faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to their soules, it will cure the wounds of their soules, be they neuer so great.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if they debase themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and strip themselues of all

opinion of their own worthines, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all truely desire to be reconciled vnto God, then God will giue grace to the humble, and accept the will for the deede.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, they must meditate vpon Gods swéet mercies, past, present, &amp; to come, &amp; laye his pretious promises close to their harts, and they will be so many flagons of wine and apples of comfort to reuiue their fainting soules.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, that the longer that our temptations endure, the more easie will they be; and that the more violent they bee (like the blustering and stormie windes) the sooner they will end; for <hi>nullum violentum est perpetuum</hi>; and God will not (such is his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and indulgence) haue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren tempted aboue their measure and strength.</p>

the whole man; but melancholy troubleth the imagination only.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, distresse of conscience ariseth from the knowledge of sinne, and from the feare and féeling of Gods indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the feare and distresse that is occasioned by melancholy, ariseth from pretended and supposed causes.</p>

                           <hi>A.</hi> First, the melancholick person must be brought not only to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his sinnes in generall,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.10.</note> but of some speciall sinne in particular, that so his melancholike sadnes may be turned into a godly sorrow.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, hee must bee distinctly acquainted with the precious promises of God,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, hee must touching the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                        <p>Fourthly, he must suffer nothing to enter into his heart that may vex and disquiet him.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the ordinary meanes of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke must be vsed; for it serueth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the euill humor of the body, and to cure the distemper of it.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, in this temptation a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man must by the <hi>feet</hi> of his faith, and the <hi>wings</hi> of his affection come,<note place="margin">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25490:105"/>
then he shall finde rest vnto his soule.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, let him looke and long for the Lords gracious and fauourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, no otherwise then the sea-beaten traueller longeth and looketh for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and euen as the eies of seruants looke vnto the hands of their masters, and as the eies of a maiden vnto the hands of her mistresse:<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, he must with <hi>Iacob</hi> wrestle with God by praier, and not cease to vrge and importune him, vntill he blesse him, and then he shall (at length) preuaile with him, and haue his <hi>quietus est.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, he must consult and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised by the Ministers and Preachers of Gods word,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Fifthly, the greater that his vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse is, the more must he fasten and fixe his minde vpon Christ, in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he shall finde peace.<note place="margin">

so the more that a man is oppressed with heauinesse, the more earnestly should he fix and fasten his mind vpon the Lord Iesu.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, hee must turne and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his worldly sorrow into a godly sorrow; for then his sadnes shall end in gladnes, and his sorrow in singing, no otherwise then after raine commeth faire weather, and after stormes calmes.</p>
                        <p>Seuenthly, he must not so muse and thinke vpon sorrowfull and displeasing obiects, much lesse yéeld vnto that sorrow whereof he can render no certaine cause, for then his sorrowes will become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable, and kill him:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.10.</note> but it is his part to study and ponder vpon the swéete promises of God in Christ,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6.7</note> made to humbled and repentant sinners; he must also ioy in, and be thankefull for Gods graces and gifts conferred vpon him, which will feast and refresh his soule.</p>
                        <p>Eightly, he must vse and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Gods good creatures,<note place="margin">

him with vnutterable pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, when he is recouered, he must be truely thankefull to God; and pity and kindly entreate them that are in like extremity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q What comforts are to be applied to them that are disquieted with feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dreames?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, few dreames are true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are either equiuocall, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily false, and therefore not to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beléeued; and as for all Propheticall dreames, they are now ceased.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is better to dreame of things that are dreadful vnto vs, then those that are delectable and desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Petrarch. de remed. vtrius. fort.</hi>
                           </note> for the deceit of a dreadful dreame is pleasant, and the issue of a delightsom dreame is many times sorrowful.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iob Dauid,</hi> and others haue beene this way afflicted.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if wee dreame of any euill that may befal vs, as we may not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it, because it is a dreame, so it is good we should beware of it, and the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, and preuent it by praier.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, disquiet and feareful dreames procéed ordinarily from cares,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.2.</note> vexation and distraction of mind in the day time,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25490:107"/>
and therefore wee must disfurnish and vnlade our selues of them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What practises are necessary to preuent fearfull dreames?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A</hi> First, moderate and spare diet; for from a full stomack arise noisome fumes which trouble the braine.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, a quiet disposition, and the following of quiet studies in the day time, which will be the cause of quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the night.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, a carefull and conscionable execution of the works of our Christian and ciuill calling.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, before we goe to sléepe, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent examination of our selues,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.4.8</note> and a sorrow for sinne committed, and good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the exercise of reading, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, praier.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if our dreames be troublesome, terrible, and from Satan, wee must by earnest praier resist him, and bid him anaunt, and we shall finde maruellous comfort after it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How much a Christian quiet and pacifie himselfe that is weary of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life, by reason of many crosses, toils, troubles, and discontentments?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, hee must remember that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25490:107"/>
euery man is borne to many crosses, and that no calling is fréed from them: and therefore he must learne to take vp his crosse daily,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.</note> and to follow Christ.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he must as well looke to be chastised of God,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob</hi> 2.10.</note> as cherished, and to be as well crossed as comforted; for he must by many afflictions enter into Gods kingdome:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22.</note> and therefore hee must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with these euils, and vse no vnlawfull euasion to ease himselfe of them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, hee must reade much, yea muse and meditate vpon the swéete and sugred promises of God, contained in the scriptures: <hi>if he delight</hi> herein, hee shall <hi>not perish in his troubles: Psal.</hi> 119.92 but be reuiued.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, hee must be often conuersant with Gods children, and desire their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, praiers,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</note> counsell, direction, and then they will be like so many <hi>Ionathans</hi> to comfort him, and so many <hi>Simons</hi> to helpe him to beare his Crosse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What is desperation?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> It is when a man in his owne sense and féeling, is without all hope of saluation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How doth this come to passe?</hi>

                           <hi>A.</hi> Thus, when a man being preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, falleth into some offence, which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan doth maruellously aggrauate, both by accusing the offender, and affrighting him with the iudgements of God. <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.3, 4, 5.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. With what comforts and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions shall Gods children arme and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish themselues against this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, that Christ came into the world not to call the righteous, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance, and that they that sée not, might sée: and that they which sée, (namely,<note place="margin">

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> The consideration of these medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations following.

                        <p>Lastly, that by doubting of, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the truth of Gods goodnesse, &amp; swéet promises into question, we offend God as much almost as by any other sinne; for hereby we rob God of the glory of his mercy,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.10</note> and make him (what in vs

lyeth) a lyer, because we will giue no credite to his promises, nor apprehend &amp; lay hold on them.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> It is good and profitable, euen for the regenerate oftentimes to speake, thinke of, and stand in feare of hell, that they may hereby bee preserued from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and confirmed in goodnes.

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, that he should know, that faith, and a ful perswasion of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is not naturall, or procéeding from the power of a mans owne frée will, but spirituall, and inspired of God by his spirite.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, that hereby God might traine

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, God that hath giuen thée
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25490:117"/>
thy calling and fitted thee for it, wil blesse thee so long as thou walkst in his waies,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.17</note> hee will prosper thy handy worke, and perfite his power in thy infirmity, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>

                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15</note> and the labours thereof; for he obserueth a Geometrical proportion in distributing his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to his seruants strength, and in employing them in seruices an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</p>

our desire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. But the sacred Scriptures are so diuersly, yea and contrarily in sundry points and places expounded, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perswaded that they are Gods word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the diuersity or variety of interpretation doth not preiudice the truth of Scripture: for many scriptures, as for example the Canticles, diuers Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as the 2. the 45. the 73. the 91. &amp;c haue both a literall and an allegoricall sense.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, diuers places may bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly expounded, and yet nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded against Faith, Hope Charity, and then the exposition is not euill.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they that expound the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in an absurd or contrarie sense, are but meere naturals and carnall men, who (for want of spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) cannot discerne the things of the spirit.
For as the eye in the body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see without the light of the sunne: so the naturall man, (be he neuer so acute and criticall) <hi rend="margQuotes">cannot without the light of the spirit iudge of heauenly thinges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, though many parts of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be hard &amp; obscure to the most rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate

man:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.105.</note> yet this darkenes is not in the scriptures, for they are light it selfe; but in our blindnes, ignorance, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, no man vnderstandeth all things, but some man one thing, &amp; some another,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13.</note> according to the measure of grace receiued, and euery day the truth is, and will be more fully reuealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. But how can the scriptures bee Gods vndoubted word, seeing that by the preaching, interpretation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them, many are offended, and made worse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the pure, powerfull, eternal, and holy word of God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</note> is not the cause hereof, for it is in it own nature the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and power of saluation, the immortall séed and food of the soule; but the fault is altogether in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who either doe not vnderstand it, or belieue it not, or else contemn it: to them alone it is the <hi>sauor of death vnto death</hi>:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.</note> they are owles, and <hi rend="margQuotes">cannot endure the light of the sunne; they are sicke of a burning feuer,</hi> and cannot abide the wine of the Gospel; they are filthy swine, and therfore cannot abide this delicious muskadell, but are thereby swelled vnto death.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:25490:118"/>Secondly, the vaine and Atheisticall hearers, doe conceiue of the Scriptures as of a mans inuention, and not (as it is indeed) the sauing word of God, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they being offended at it, are (acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally) made worse. And herein they are like to <hi>Samuel,</hi> who when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call him, as he did seuerall times heare the voice of God and not knowing it so to bee, but supposing it to bee the voice of <hi>Elie,</hi> returned to his naturall sléepe and rest: So the greatest sort of them that are outwardly called, because they heare Gods word as the word of men,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22</note> and so estéeme it; they like dogs and swine returne to their former filth and vomit of their sins.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as we must not contemne nor condemn Iewels, pretious stones, artes and sciences, because the ignorant know not their worth, and so regard them not, so though some, or many, ignorantly or contemptuously refuse to be bettered by Gods word, we must not be offended at their abusing and despising of it, but rather condemne their madnes, &amp; make benefite of it, and thanke God that hee hath giuen better light and more grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Why doth God suffer the faith of

his children to labor of so many doubts, wants, and imperfections?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, to bring them to a true touch and sense of their sinne, &amp; that they may perceiue in what need they stand of Christ, and of euery drop of his bloud, that so they may sue &amp; seeke vnto Christ for recouery.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to correct, abate, and pull downe pride, humour, and selfe conceite in them, to which they are so lyable, and enclinable.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, to traine and practise them, in the daily fight and battaile against sinne, and to make them such expert sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 31.32.</note> that Satan though seeking an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to sift them, shall be wholy disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his expectation.</p>

                        <hi>Q. What vse are we to make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, wee must bee thankefull vnto God for the seedes and beginnings of grace,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Lastly, the more imperfections that he findeth and perceiueth in his praiers, the more earnestly must hee labour for the remouall and reformation of them.</p>

                           <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for he doth acknowledge his infirmity, and would faine be cured of it, and this is a print of the seale of Gods blessed spirit in him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, all Gods children are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25490:123"/>
to this sinne, for either they forget, neglect, or losse esteeme Gods benefits, then their worth and excellency requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: but yet they are reuiued and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by preaching, doctrine, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, admonition, and Gods fatherlie corrections in depriuing them of, or in diminishing his blessings formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What restauratiues are there for a mans recouery?</hi>

                           <hi>A.</hi> These meditations and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses following. First, that he by nature is depriued of the life of God, and vtterly destitute of grace, and therefore vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the least of Gods mercies.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that the benefits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the graces of saluation, do far excell and excéed (in vse and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) all earthly blessings: for they are transitory, they cannot quiet the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, much lesse saue him, or any man, from the wrath to come, or from death &amp; euerlasting destruction: but these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces &amp; blessings make the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of them truly blessed in this life, and perfectly blessed in the life to come.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that thankesgiuing vnto God is more excellent and acceptable

then praier for it sometimes is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and constrained;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.</note> but thanksgiuing is a frée will offering, a swéet smelling perfume in Gods nostrils, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall exercise of the Church triumphant in heauen, and therefore we must herein imitate it, and giue God all the glory of it.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the forgetfulnesse of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, whether in sauing vs from euill, or in leading vs into good, is a brand of a prophane man, and a thing most distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Diuine Maiesty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q What practises are good for our helpe and furtherance herein?</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, we must sundry times and seriously meditate vpon our vowes of repentance and new obedience which we made to God in our baptisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thanksgiuing is a part.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we must renew our thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing by the often and holy receiuing of the Eucharist or Sacrament of the Lords Supper: for herein is a liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of our redemption, and of the heauenly blessings of Christ bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon vs, and wrought for vs.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we must wonder at, extoll, and admire Gods gracious gifts and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25490:124"/>
blessings; for this practise wil make vs more thankfull for them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, we must note that many, yea and most kingdomes, countries, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prouinces, cities, townes, villages, and in them many millions of people, haue not so much as the outward means of those graces of saluation, wherewith we are (or may be) richly adorned: and therefore how thankfull should we be?</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25490:125"/>
.i. the renewing of our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will, affections, are vnperfect; <hi>ergo</hi> the whole must needs bée vnperfect, and therefore no meruaile that a Saint of God falleth once, againe, yea, &amp; the 3. time, into one and the same sinne.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> lyed twice, and <hi>Sarah</hi> consented: <hi>Lot</hi> was twice drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so twice committed incest: <hi>Peter</hi> (through feare) thrée seueral times deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his good Lord &amp; Master: and (to omit more examples) <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist, twice fell downe to worshippe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, taking him for Christ: but all these were Gods deere seruants and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God would heereby correct presumption of our own strength in vs, and make vs more to pitty our brethren when they fall, because we are subiect to the like infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, our gracious Sauiour is ful of mercy and will infinite times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them that repent and turne to him.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, wée in our anguish and distresse of soule, must set before our eyes the examples of those that haue through infirmity often committed the same sinne, and yet haue béene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, wee must not yéeld to the enticements of sinne, (as <hi>Adam</hi> did to <hi>Eua</hi>) but we must resist them, as <hi>Iob</hi> did his wife prouoking him to sinne.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, seeing that few such are recouered, let vs willingly make no trade,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Lastly, if wee bee cladde with the glorious garments of Christ his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted holinesse and righteousnesse, wee must beware that wee staine

and defile it not by sinnes of knowledge and presumption; and we must (for the time to come) be carefull to auoid all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and allurements vnto sinne.</p>

                     <p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, the wicked and prophane are the greatest in number, they know not the law of God and are accursed, and therefore we may not in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion make their example a rule &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our faith and practise.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Christian magistrates must maintaine the truth, and banish error and false Teachers (if they can.) And all faithfull Ministers must by the word of truth refute all infectious doctrine, and exhort them earnestly to be constant in the profession and loue of sound and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere instruction; and they must more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by the preseruatiue of wholsome doctrine, to preserue the sound from the pestilence of error, then to cure the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which are (commonly and for the most part) vncurable.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we must beware of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Apostasie, for, <hi>nemo repente fit turpissimus.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, if the Pope and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents excommunicate vs, we must note
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25490:137"/>
that they are hereticks, idolaters, and no true members of a true visible Church, and therefore their excommunication i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and a moat is made a beame, their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, like spots in white paper, or fine linnen, are soone espied and noted: but prophane people are not obserued, and their grosse sinnes are silenced and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if any, or many, vnder the cloake, and maske of zeale, labour to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their practises of deceit, couetousnes and iniustice, &amp;c we must know that the visible Church of Christ is compared to a field,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Thirdly, their suffering is of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3</note> for they want chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: which appeaeth in this that they are vtter opposites and aduersaries to the Gospel of Christ and the sound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they being no true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Christ, but rather incurable persecutors of it, and being slaine out of the Church, doe not winne

                        <hi>A</hi> First, wee must distinguish and rightly iudge betwéene true martyrs and false ones, which wee shall be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to doe by obseruing these rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. First, true martyrs die in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the substance of pure religion: but false martyrs suffer and die in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of error heresie, and idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, true martyrs at their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution shew sorth singular patience in their words, testimony, behauiour; but false martyrs either are outragious and impatient, or (at least) by Art doe stupifie and dead their flesh, that it may become insensible of paine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, true Martyrs die holily, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously, ioyfully, without all feare and doubting of the truth of their cause, or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:25490:142"/>
of the certainty of saluation: but popish martyrs die (many times) irresolued and astonied.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, true and Euangelical mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs are holy, chaste, innocent, feruent in praier, and diligent in their ciuill and Christian callings: but the like cannot be verified of the popish martyrs.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, God at the death of true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, hath sometimes wrought strange and wonderfull works, as to speake when their tongues haue béen cut <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, the Church of Corinth was a notable Apostolicall Church,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5, 6.</note> and yet there were many factions in it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee must not separate our selues from such a Church, except it erre in the fundamentall points of faith and true religion; but we must herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our selues, that this schisme is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heresie.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>Secondly, if wee be but priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we must beware of pride and selfe-conceitednes, lest we rashly condemne a true and notable visible Church for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections in the doctrine and practise of discipline or Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, and so without sufficient cause make a rent from the same, and hereby disturbe the common peace; for we must not depart from it, vntill it depart from Christ.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, if we would dwell néere no ill neighbours, we must get our selues into some wildernesse.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, it may be that a man hath

béen harsh and sharpe to his neighbour, and therefore he is iustly plagued with such an one himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, let vs be innocent as dones, giuing no iust occasion of oftence vnto him,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. How must they arme and comfort themselues that are forsaken, beguiled, abused, and betrayed by their (reputed) friends?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First they must remember, that the world hath not wanted such euill examples, and pernicious presidents: was not the caitiffe <hi>Cain</hi> false and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous to his innocent brother <hi>Abel.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, vnfaithfulnesse and true friendship are incompetible, and can neuer suite nor consort together, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the losse of such fained and false hearted friends is rather to bee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, such fawning, and yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and faithlesse friends are infamous and loathed of all well disposed persons.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, such deceitfull friends more hurt themselues then them that trust them: for they onely betray those that put affiance in them, but they vndoe themselues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. What vse are we to make hereof?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, wee must neuer put any confidence in men, who are lighter then vanity it selfe:<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, they that resist Gods depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and vicegerents, procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues destruction and damnation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, though their subiects and people vnder them may be stubborn and disobedient to them, (as they were to <hi>Dauid</hi> in the beginning of his raigne, and somtime afterwards) yet they may proue louing and loiall at the last, and therfore they are to hope well of them.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Secondly, they must not so much look to find their people good, as to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good

and if they doe shew all possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence herein, God will accept and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper their studies and endeauours.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that Ministers of Gods word must labour to perswade them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and if they cannot preuaile, the Magistrate must by the sword correct them (and when néed is,) cut them off, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the sparing of the wolte is the death of the shéepe.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, if the Ministers teach well, and diligently, and yet liue lewdly and vitiously, then they must know that God sends them such a scandalous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for their triall or punishment: and therefore wée must repent vs of our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar sinnes, and waite the good time, vntil either God or his deputies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue or reforme them.

                        <hi>A.</hi> First, we must constantly, and chearefully goe forwards in our good purposes &amp; proceedings, much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the kéeping of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and a good conscience then the imagined and pretended scandal and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that the wicked vniustly take:

wherefore let their offence taken, rather hearten vs then hinder vs, and more driue vs forward in good actions, then discourage vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the more clamorous and enuious that they are against vs, the more let vs endeauour by all good meanes to draw them to the practise of holy duties.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the wicked were falsly and vniustly offended at the excellent person,<note place="margin">

For in this case we are bound onely to auoide the offence of our weake brethren, and not of our incurable enemies, who will neuer be pleased nor satisfied.

                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:25490:151"/>Secondly, we must not for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of mens humours, and to decline an offence taken (and not giuen) temporize with Gods enemies, nor frame our selues to all companies and professions: for better it is that all the wicked in the world should be offended at vs, then that we for the preuenting of their (vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) offence should be iniurious to Iesus Christ, or preiudice any part of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed truth; and therefore we are not to communicate with such in the least things.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5.</note> When therefore the omission of our Christian liberty doth either renue errour, or confirme men in it, wee must then neuer dispense with it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in matters of faith, and in cases of conscience,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16</note> wee must walke by the Canon and rule of Gods word, &amp; not by vnperfite examples:<note place="margin">

                     <p>Lastly, it shall be our wisedome to vse our liberty with aduised discretion, and (what in vs lyeth) to minister no matter nor occasion of (iust) offence to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but, if notwithstanding wée can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:25490:152"/>
for if they were without all correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they should be bastards and no sonnes.</p>

                     <p>Fifthly, the enemies of God, and of his children, either want iudgement, and the spirit of discerning, or else are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported with humour and malice, and therefore wee are not to regard their rash censures, nor their vniust of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the afflictions of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full come not by chance, but by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and prouidence of God, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth all things in a most excellent sort, for their profit and saluation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.45. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16 10. <hi>Psa.</hi> 119.71. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.21.</p>

and highly rewardeth our seruice and sufferings, and therefore though wee bee in no grace and request with the wicked world, whose fauour and friendship can neither helpe vs, nor their false iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contempt preiudice vs, let vs not be moued, nor amated at it.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> They must note and consider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things: First, that these Tyrants and oppressors doe not raigne and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minere without Gods holy and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent disposition, and that either for the exercise of the good, or for the plague and punishment of euill doers; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must seeke either by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent carriage, and dutifull obedience to pacifie and please them, or else they must learne to endure with patience their tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that austere and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing rulers, are sometimes necessary for the common wealth, to restraine vice, &amp; to curbe and kéepe downe insolent and wanton people, who by security and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch liberty grew to this height of prophanenesse; and therefore, they that know not how to loue, must know how to feare.</p>

licentiousnesse in the multitude, who delights more in pleasure, then in piety, in goods, then in goodnes, and in loue of money, then in true liberty, doth (if not cause, yet) increase tyrants and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors.</p>

                        <hi>Q. But why doth God punish some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with visible and manifest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some euill doers, and not all?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ro</hi> 20.21.</note> God is an absolute Lord, and his will is iustice it selfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must rather reuerence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Gods iudgements, then rashly to require a reason of them: for shall an earthly Prince disdaine to be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his subiects concerning all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
                        </note> and shall a Master of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scorne that his seruant shall exact an account of him? how much more will the diuine Maiesty refuse that his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and counsels should bee called into question?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a few punished, are a purgation for, and a warning to the rest: so that it is a mild iustice towardes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which séemeth cruelty to a few.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if God should visibly, and manifestly punish all euill doers, then nothing would bée thought to bée reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the last iudgement, and if none should bee here punished, men would thinke that either there were no God,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25490:156"/>
or (at least) no iustice and prouidence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. How shall Gods children in the execution of publike iudgement, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the equity of Gods proceedings, or practise patience: when they tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally smart for the sinnes aud idolatries of their fore-fathers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> Many wayes they are to stay and comfort themselues. First, (to speake properly) God doth punish the idolatry and sinnes of the children, and not of the parents: for if they tread in the footesteppes of their parents, and doe not repent of their sinnes, it standeth with Gods iustice no longer to put off their correction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; though in the vniuersall deluge,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.4.</note> and in the destruction of Sodome, and in the sacking of Cities the very Infants perished with their Parents: yet wee must note that they were not sinnelesse and innocent before God, but borne and conceiued in sinne, the children of wrath, &amp; subiect to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting damnation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, albeit God correct good men for the bads sake, &amp; inuolue them in the common calamities of warre, famine, pestilence, shipwracke, fires, &amp;c. yet
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25490:156"/>
these afflictions are rather preseruatiues then punishments: for as Physitians doe by bitter medicines preserue and restore a mans health: so God doth turne the punishments that they haue deserued into a medicine, a trial, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Gods children though they resist sinne and wickednes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5.6 7.</note> yet they in hearing Gods word, in praier, and in the performance of the duties of pietie, iustice, charity, faile and are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and therefore they cannot say that God offereth them any wrong, if they with the wicked be included in the same outward and publike euils, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathas, Iosias,</hi> &amp;c. were.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, we are all of vs the children of rebellious and traiterous <hi>Adam,</hi> who hath tainted our bloud, and forfeited his and our estate to God almighty, &amp; there is a chaine of faults reaching from <hi>Adam</hi> to vs, which though wee repent of, yet God may in his iustice punish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of them in our posterity.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, there is (if not alwaies) a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of speciall fins from the forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the posterity, yet there is a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25490:157"/>
of punishment, and therefore God doth afflict herein the Parents, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity as one body.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, as in one and the same person a fault committed in youth,<note place="margin">

                        </note> is iustly punished in old age: So God in kingdomes, empires, persons doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish old and inueterate sinnes, for they are before God ioyned together by an outward fellowship, both in time and parts.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if wee will bee heires to the commodities, and rewards which are due to our ancestors, it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that we should refuse their burdens and afflictions.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, God suffereth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to stumble at the life, or profession of his children, and to runne themselues out of breath,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2</note> that they may fulfill the measure of their iniquities, and so incur

                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11 12.</note> God by the patience of his children, and by their constant death, &amp; sufferinges, appalleth, and inwardly tormenteth the minds and consciences of the persecutors, and leaueth them without all excuse and defence of their doings, before his iudgement seat.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he sometimes by the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular patience and sufferings of his saints ouercommeth the enemies harts, and gaineth them to himself, and so they that séemed conquerors are happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to Christ, and of his foes are made his friends.</p>

                           <hi>Esa.</hi> 10.1</note> God (against the wicked mens intentions) turneth their persecutions to the good of his children: for as an arrow attaineth vnto the Archers mark without any sense of his owne: so the wicked though blindfolded, execute Gods secret decree: they are Gods <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> to whiten his children; God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them as the Goldsmith doth lead, to melt and purifie his gold; for hereby God doth perfite them, and purge them from the drosse and dregs of earthly corruption.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, because there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enmity betweene the wicked, who are the seede of the Serpent,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19.</note> life and practise, and God hath chosen them out of the world, and therefore the world hateth and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Gods children professe, preach and confesse Gods sincere truth,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.9.12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19.20.</note> which the wicked men doe distast and detest, and doe also by the light of their holy life and example checke the deedes of darkenes in the wicked.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the godly weaken the diuels kingdome; hence he by his imps and instruments, purposeth and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth continually their death and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Q. Is it not lawfull for the godly to vse all lawfull meanes of preseruing their liues in persecution?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for, first they are not bound to make confession of their faith to all persons, as namely, to scorners, open

                     <p>Thirdly, wee may decline the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of persecution by modest answeres, by concealing part of the truth, when wée are not required thereunto: yea, sometimes by our mony and goods, by the change of our apparrell, by the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our haire, and by setting our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries and enemies at difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues.<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> First, it is a glorious matter to be contemned for vertue &amp; well doing; for in this case wee are like vnto Christ our blessed Sauiour, who was derided of <hi>Herode</hi> and the Iewes for his holy life, doctrine, zeale, miracles, &amp;c. and therefore we haue cause to reioice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we must note, who they are that commonly contemne vs; they are either enemies of the truth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane worldlings, who cannot discerne of our worth and excellency, and that haue no knowledge and practise of true religion and vertue, and therefore wee are the lesse to care for their censure: for euen as pretious pearles being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed and hidden in base earthen shels, are not seene; and therefore they being not discerned, are not esteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their price and excellency: so the wicked and prophane, looking onely at the contemptible condition of godly

mens persons, and not discerning the grace of God in their hearts, take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to despise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or else they are scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; contemned of hypocrites factious &amp; schismaticall persons, who being more humorous then truely holy, and more haughty then humble, and wiser in their owne eyes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> then worthy in Gods sight, doe distaste and falsly censure their brethren, that are better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and hereof blessed S. <hi>Paul</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ience amongst the Corinthians.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is the practise of Satan and his impes, thus to depresse and keep vnder Gods children, that they who are famous and illustrious by the brightnes of their holinesse and vertues, should bée sullied and obscured by misreports and contempt of their persons: but neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, they hereby loose nothing of their inherent excellency: for as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious iewel, albeit by hogges and swine troden and trampled vnder féet,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Secondly, it behoueth vs by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well of all men, by interpreting things doubtfull in the better part, by contemning no person without cause, and by our good seruice and offices to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                           <hi>Q. What vse are we to make hereof?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, let vs leaue enuious men to themselues, and suffer them to torture and torment their soules and bodies.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the more that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied and maligned for zeale in pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for well doing, the more let vs bée stirred vp to the practise of religion &amp; vertue; for wée shall by no meanes so much vexe and torment enuious persons as by our well doing.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if wee cannot otherwise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the tempest and storme of enuie, let vs auoid it by modestie: let vs auoid

all ostentation, and for the time separate our selues from the company of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious, and suppresse &amp; hide whatsoeuer might make vs to bee noted: for some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are no better ouercome then by our humility and obscurity.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if wee would approue our selues good men,<note place="margin">

                        <p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, the world &amp; the wicked hate vs vniustly; for they hate vs not for our sins &amp; imperfections, but for the better pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Secondly, the world is addicted to traditions, and little estéemeth Gods blessed Word, it is in loue with earthly thinges, and neglecteth those that are heauenlie; no maruaile then that it so distasteth and maligneth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:25490:167"/>
Gods children, they loue not God, and then how can they but hate his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Abel, Lot, Dauid, Elias, Paul,</hi> the Prophets,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15 18.</note> Apostles, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his Saints in all ages haue béene causlesly hated of the wicked: and this is a pregnant proofe that they were Gods children, and that wee are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.19.</note> if either they or we had been of the world, the world would loue his owne.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, wee must remember, that wee haue deserued greater euils, and therefore we ought more patiently to endure this.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, let it content vs, that we are known, loued and liked of God &amp; good men who loue vs in the truth. And if the losse of the loue of the common people grieue vs, we must note that their loue is light, and without iudgement and discretion: and therefore their loue ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endeth in ill will and hatred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How are we to demeane and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our selues when wicked men ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne and hate vs?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, seeing that malitious men are good neither <hi>actu,</hi> nor <hi>potentia,</hi>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:25490:167"/>
(that is) neither in act, nor in possibility, and that they doe but sucke the greatest part of their owne poison, seeing they are peruerted in iudgement, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to sincerity: let vs beware how we nourish occasions of hatred, and that we be not too sociable and familiar with them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, let vs loue God and his word, for then we cannot hate mens persons, much lesse any vertues in them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, let vs decline hatred (what in vs lieth) by dutifulnes and good seruice; for in so doing, we shall eyther gaine and pacifie our enemie,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20.</note> or (at least) leaue him without excuse; for this is to heape coales of fire on his head.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. May we lawfully hate them that hate vs?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> Wee must not, nor may not hate them in regard of their persons, or as they are Gods creatures, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate respects: but it is lawfull for vs to hate their vices, and to abhorre them, as they are Gods enemies and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Church; but we must not hate them as they hate vs; namely, our persons, and the better parts in vs: but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25490:168"/>
onely hate their errours and vices, &amp;c. which are contrary to Gods nature, will, word and commandements.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What are the persecutions of the tongue?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> Slander and false imputations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How are wee to comfort our selues against slander?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, that the life and profession of the Church and Saints of God hath beene traduced and slandered in al ages; and therefore no singular &amp; extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary matter befalling vs, it is with more contentment to be endured.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wee herein are like vnto Christ, who though he were more holy then all men and Angels, yet he was called a wine-bibber, a friend of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes and sinners, an enemy to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and he was said to haue the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, slander cannot make a man miserable, (for where sinne raigneth there is misery indeed) nay, it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of honour and glorie to be ill spoken of for well doing: for they hate vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that we are better then they, and because wee runne not to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of riot,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.4</note> &amp; the more that wicked men
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25490:168"/>
belie, slander and raile at vs, the more in the end will they make our vertues known.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, false imputations cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, will not continue long, they are as so many blasts and fumes that will soone be dispersed and blowne away; for God will at length cleare our innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as the noone day,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Fifthly, though the wicked doe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly derogate from our good name, yet they doe <hi>addere mercedi nost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>id est,</hi> encrease our reward, albeit against their wils: for blessed are wee when men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile vs,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Sixthly, if the titles and attributes of the iustice, truth, power and mercy of God, bee not frée from slanderous imputations: let vs much lesse looke to be exempt and priuiledged from euill tongues: <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.</p>
                        <p>Seuenthly, if the raskall multitude, or the scumme of the people raile vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, and belie vs, wee must note that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25490:169"/>
they doe it rather of humour then of knowledge, and of an ill affection rather then of iudgement and aduisement; and they will be silent when they haue much barked and bawled: and as for their lying tales and reports, because they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from false grounds, and trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, they will soone be dead, buried, extinct.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, the slanderer doth but hurt and discredite himselfe, and foame out his own shame: for his slander, like an arrow shot against a stone wall, or a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise ball cast against it,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.39.</note> redounds vpon the slanderer.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, God discrediteth his deare children with the world, &amp; letteth them fall sometimes into the mire of wicked imputations, that they should not bee stained with the corruptions of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How shall wee behaue our selues when wee are thus belyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, let vs descend into our own soules,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 10.</note> and if we find our selues inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, then let vs comfort our selues in the witnesse of our owne conscience: neither let vs thinke, that ther is more waight in their detractions, then in our owne
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25490:169"/>
testimonies.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in this case, let vs rather looke vnto God who permitteth them,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Micah.</hi> 7. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10.</note> then at the howling, barking, and biting dogs that annoy vs: this course tooke <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, whereas the rude and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious multitude doth cast false impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vpon vs; let vs not only with the spunge of honest Apologies wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way these pretended spots, but also la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to haue a precious report, and an immortall memory amongst Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if wée desire to be well spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, let vs not rashly thinke euill of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for the better that any man is, the more hardly doth he iudge another to be euill; much lesse let vs secretly bite and sting them, nor take that in the worse sense, that may bee construed in the better meaning.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, let vs lend no eare, much lesse giue any applause to the slanderer; but shew our dislike of him, and then he will not willingly speake that which hee shall perceiue to be vnwillingly heard.</p>
                        <p>Lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> slander is a speciall sinne of the Deuill,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc</hi> 12.10.</note> who is a lyar, and the slanderer
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:25490:170"/>
of the brethren, and therefore let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, and abhorre it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What are the persecutions in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and in deed?</hi>

                           <hi>Q. What comforts against whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, Christ Iesus and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were thus dealt withall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.17.</note>Secondly, as it was the marke of a true Apostle to beare in the body the marks of the Lord Iesu: so it is the Character of a sincere Christian to suffer the like in time of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 24.</note>Thirdly, Christ was whipped, and shed his bloud for vs; and shall wée sinnefull persons refuse to doe the like, that wee may make knowne our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with him in his suffrings?</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, it is giuen vnto Gods children (as a speciall prerogatiue) not onely to be whipped for,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.16.</note> but to die for the Lord Iesu. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the more indignities, and torments that any suffer for Christ,

or for righteousnesse sake,<note place="margin">

                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How are or ought wee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our selues when wee are violently by the enemie despoiled of all our goods?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, wee must remember that many good men haue fallen into the hands of théeues (like that man that went downe from Ierusalem to Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, we want not things (simply) necessary; for <hi>natura paucis contenta.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, though we be spoiled of our goods, yet we haue not forgone our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and we retaine our life and liberty, which is the greater blessing.</p>

                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:25490:171"/>Fifthly, God in his iustice will in due time punish and reuenge our wrongs.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, he must comfort himselfe in the conscience of his righteousnes, which the enemy cannot blot, much lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue him of.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he must at their strict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and enforcement, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish and depart out of his natiue soile, and then his departure shall be rather a pilgrimage, then an expulsion, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite then a banishment.</p>

                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.27.</note> (for it is his voice) and hee must speake, and haue familiar speech and conference with our God by prayer, and then hee shall haue God for his companion, and the holy Ghost for his Comforter.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, it is the greatest bondage to be captiuated and enthralled to sinne and Satan,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</note> from which slauery Gods children are by grace fréede; for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are at peace with God, and they are the seruants of God, whose seruice is perfect fréedome.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this bondage is greatly mitigated, yea sugred and swéetned to Gods children: for God doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restraine and moderate the enemies malice, but also (sometimes) greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, preferre and exalt them: examples whereof we haue in <hi>Ioseph, Jeremie, Daniel, Sidrack, Mesheck, Abednego,</hi> in <hi>Hester, Mardocheus,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, death putteth a terme and end to this bondage, (if wee find not deliuerance long before) and why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we a while expect this yeare of our absolute fréedome, and euerlasting Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biley?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="147" facs="tcp:25490:173"/>Lastly, Gods children are Christs frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Joh</hi> 3.25.</note> and they are free Denizens of heauen, hauing euerlasting life in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and being (by faith) secured of the full possession of it, and therefore though for a time they bee plunged in many euils, yet they can neuer perish: for they are afflicted, but not forsaken, tried, but not tired out.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What is the quintessence or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vse of all these propositions and conclusions?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, hence wee may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the miserable estate of wicked worldlings and vngodly men, who though they enioy outward wealth, ease and liberty, yet are they drudges to the world, vassals and slaues vnto sinne, &amp; cursed caitiffes; for they are locked in golden fetters, and shut vp in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their own sinnefull desires, which is the worst kind of bondage.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, let vs serue the Lord our God, and not Satan, Sinne, nor Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and then we are Gods frée men, &amp; no bondage can impeach, or hinder our spirituall liberty and happines.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, farre bee it from vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25490:174"/>
or misiudge any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their outward seruitude and bondage, vnto which, tyranny and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of times, doe or may enwrappe them; but let vs pray to God to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with ioy, and the spirit of long suffering,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.16. <hi>Esa.</hi> 58.7.</note> and in his good time to ridde and deliuer them: wee must also (by occasion) freely and franckly contribute to their necessities, for they are our owne flesh and bloud, borne of the same both naturall and spirituall seede, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the same aire; and seruants to the same God.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, when we are thus restrained and distressed, it behoueth vs timely and truely to repent vs of our sinnes, for otherwise we are to expect no miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; much lesse a spéedy deliuerance out of our misery.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What comforts against violent nakednesse caused by flight, or the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnmercifulnesse?</hi>

                           <hi>A.</hi> First, Christ our blessed Sauiour was stript of his raiment, and hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified this euill vnto vs, and hath turned the shame of it into glory.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, very many of Gods excellent seruants haue béene thus
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:25490:174"/>
shamefully misused by their enemies. <hi>Basil</hi> saith, that forty Martyres were turned out naked to bee starued in the cold of the night, and afterwards to bee burned.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they must count it for some benefit and blessing, that the enemy doth onely spoile them of their garments, and not of their liues.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, though they endure shame and reproch of the world,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> yet it maketh them not vnhappy: for Christ suffered the shame of the crosse to make them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, the enemie cannot possibly disrobe, dismantle, and despoile them of the garments of Christ, his holines and righteousnesse, wherewith they are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and wherewith their deformities are couered.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38</note> this is but a temporary and fatherly correction, and can neuer sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any of Gods children from his loue.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, it is not the gay garments but godlines, not outward pompe but piety that maketh men honourable: as for the proud mans honour, it is in his garment and not in his person.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What vse are we to make hereof?</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>A.</hi> First, let it be a shame to vs to be called naughty, rather then naked.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, though Gods enemies rob his children of their garments,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay.</hi> 58.7.</note> let vs in our charity cloath them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, let vs by faith put on the Lord Iesu, and then we shall neuer bee found naked; for he onely is naked who hath lost Christ.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. Why doth God suffer so many of his best beloued Saints and seruants to be massacred and murdered by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies sword?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, we herein must rather reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and admire Gods secret, yet iust procéedings, then curiously to diue and enquire into the ground and reason of them; and wée must assure our selues that the end is good, albeit our dulnes cannot so well apprehend it. For Gods purposes and decrees attaine vnto their holy and appointed ends, no otherwise then certaine riualets (though they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish out of our sight, and are hidden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth) are carried and conuey themselues into the sea.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by the effusion and spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their innocent bloud, the number of true professors is both manifested &amp;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25490:175"/>
multiplied, and the bloudy butchers and <hi>Bonners,</hi> either conuerted (albeit most rarely) or else conuinced and left vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, though the enemies thinke to root out the Church, and the name and memory of true Christians; yet God doth and will crosse and curse their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes: for contrary to their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gospell is more published and proclaimed, the innocency of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more cléered and testified; and their madnes and badnes made known vnto all the world.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the sufferings of the Martyrs doth procure vnto them a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of glorie in heauen: but tyrants, heretikes, persecutors runne themselues out of breath, and draw vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the greater damnation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. How are we to arme and comfort our selues against this kind of death?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, they are blessed that die in the Lord,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.13.</note> and for the Lord; they are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Gods sight, and are arayed in long white robes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they do not lose their liues but find them, and incomparably better them: <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="152" facs="tcp:25490:176"/>Thirdly, the sword toucheth the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bodie, but not the soule, nor their faith: for God herein dealeth with his children, as the Persians in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing some noble Personage; for they take away his garment and his hat, and hang them vp in some place, and all to beat them, as though they were the man himselfe: so they (by Gods ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand) doe not touch our soules and our faith, but beate onely the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our persons.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, we must not estéeme, nor thinke the firie tryall as some strange thing,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.</note> but reioyce in as much as wee are (hereby) made partakers of Christ his sufferings, that when his glory shall appeare, wee may bée gladde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, wee must comfort and stay our selues in the expectation of the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end that abideth Gods enemies;<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Esa.</hi> 10.21.22.</note>Lastly, there is no persecution so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and grieuous, but many shall bée preserued in it, and from it; and after long wrestling, God will grant a brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. What if Gods children cannot be suffered to bee buried when they are dead, what shall wee iudge of them, or how shall we comfort our selues against this euill?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> Their dead bodies are members of Christ, temples of the holy Ghost; and they shall rise againe in glory to eternall life; therefore we may not iudge them accursed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the want of buriall doth nothing hurt them, as the performance of it doth nothing profite the wicked: &amp; as for these funerall solemnities, they are rather <hi>viuorum solatia, quam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum auxilia, id est.</hi> Comforts for the liuing, then helps for the dead.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, many of Gods Saints, yea some most blessed Martyres,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.8</note> haue wanted buriall, <hi>Psal</hi> 79.2. and yet haue béene receiued vp into glory. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, other euils, (as death by drowning, by fire, by earthquakes, by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:25490:177"/>
the fall of houses, by the cruell rage of wild beasts, &amp;c.) are as much (if not more) to be feared.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Tegitur coelo qui non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet vrnam,</hi> The skie is to them in stead of a coffin.</p>

                        <p>Seuenthly, the want of buriall (though it is a curse to Gods enemies, who perish both in soule and body) yet it is but a fatherly, and fauourable chastice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his children, and can neuer part, nor diuorce them from him and his loue.</p>
                        <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.13.</note> though sometimes the dead bodies of Gods Saints want buriall, yet they féele no smart; and their soules in glorie cannot, and do not behold the loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes of their vnburied bodies.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, we must not (so much) trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selues about this matter, but commit the disposition of our dead corps to Gods prouidence, and the care of the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:25490:178"/>
liuing.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, let vs bury our sinnes in Christ his graue and sepulchre, and then the want of buriall and funerall solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities shall neither shame vs,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> nor harm vs.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if in the heate of personall persecution the bodies of Gods saints knowne vnto vs, and neare vs, do want buriall, wee must (after the manner of those deuoute brethren that buried <hi>Stephen</hi>) enterre them;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 8.2.</note> for hereby we do not onely testifie our loue and reuerence towards them, but also declare our good hope of their glorious resurrection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q. By what speciall considerations are we to arme and hearten our selues against persecutions?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, wee know it is the lot of Gods children to bee persecuted of the wicked in euery generation,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.17.</note> but most notably in the raigne and rage of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. For they that are borne after the flesh will persecute them that are borne after the spirit,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29.</note> and therefore why should wee bee so offended at persecutions, hauing so many compartners, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions herein.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:25490:178"/>Secondly, that we are hereby made con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ormable vnto Christ our Captaine, leader and guide, and therefore if wee suffer with him, we shal raign with him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that Gods power and his goodnes doth as much appeare in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue blessings as in positiue: for God is with vs in trouble,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psa.</hi> 76.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.</note> he (when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him) represseth the power, &amp; chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the malice of the enemy, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and refineth vs, and giueth a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full issue, euasion and euent to our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, that persecution is a badge, ensign, and ornament of the true church; for hereby open enemies take occasion to oppose themselues against Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and hypocrites; and time seruers are discouered.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.</note> that persecution is a schoole-master to make vs vnderstand Gods will, and a plaine commentary of Gods word; for wee learne that by experience, which we heard by the publik ministery.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, persecution is good for Gods children whether they escape it, or die by it; for God doth order it for their profite and happines, and they are gainers by it many wayes. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.28.29.30.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:25490:179"/>
                           <hi>Q. What duties are wee to performe in persecution?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> First, we are to prepare our selues against it by daily mortification, and by the experience of the swéet and heauenly societie that wee haue with our blessed God that dwelleth in vs,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.30.31.</note> and so we shal learne to die daily.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, let vs be assured that we suffer as Christians,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16</note> and not as malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and then wée are not to bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but to glorifie God in that behalfe. For we are Gods Worthies, and his champions, placed in the theatre of the world, and if we fight stoutely &amp; wisely in our Lords quarrell and cause, he wil honour and aduance vs accordingly both here, and hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, because persecution is not onely a triall, but also a correction for our sinnes, wee must entreat the Lord to pardon them, and then the flame of affliction shall brighten vs, but not burne vs, scoure vs but not consume vs.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, we must possesse our soules and the graces of God by our patience: we must seeke the Lord in our trouble,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15.4</note> and he will be found of vs; and it is our
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25490:179"/>
dutie with <hi>Moses</hi> (for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) more to looke vnto the infinite and transcendent measure of reward in the kingdome of heauen, then eyther the Sunne-shine of present prosperity, or the blustering windes of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, persecution doth only touch the vestment and garment of our body, but cannot reach vnto the fort of our faith, nor the hold of our heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought the lesse to astonish and distract vs.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, let it bee our wisedome and practise in the blustering tempests, and the weltering waues of the worlds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, to adhere vnto, and stand fast vpon Christ the rocke; and then wee shall not néede to feare the waues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, much lesse dread drowning.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if it please God temporally to deliuer vs, let vs receiue Gods precious word with greater ioy: for when men and outward meanes faile vs, it wil be a staffe and stay to vs in all our tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fill vs full of comfort and hope:<note place="margin">

                     <p>First, that man by his first creation, was pure, holy, innocent, and liued in a most happy and blissefull estate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that hee by his voluntarie fall, and apostasie from God, and from his former integrity, hath in soule and body corrupted himselfe and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; and not onely depriued himselfe &amp; all his sucsessours, of all originall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and happinesse; but also, wholly subiected them &amp; himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to all plagues and miseries, both temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:25490:181"/>Thirdly, that sinne is very distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, odious, and stinking in Gods taste, sight, and nostrils; for otherwise the most iust Lord, would neuer so grieuously, nor with such variety of plagues and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments execute his indignation, not only vpon men of yéeres, but also vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infants that haue committed no actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all transgression.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Lord, that draweth light out of darknesse, life out of death, and in iudgement remembreth mercy, hath giuen his onely sonne Iesus Christ to die, to make a perfect satisfaction to his iustice,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> for the sinnes of all the elect, and to be a perpetuall intercessour for them; so that they are not onely freed from the guilt, dominion, and euerlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne, but also entitled vnto, and shall in time certainely possesse euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and vnspeakable glorie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that Christ hath by vertue of faith in his death and merits, transna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and changed to all his elect, the temporarie and eternall plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments of sinne, into certaine gentle, momentanie, &amp; fatherlie corrections and chastisments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:25490:181"/>Sixthly, that God hath not left his people, in their crosses, temptations, and afflictions, without hope, helpe, and remedie; but hath giuen them the sacred and all sufficient Scriptures, to instruct, direct, and to confirme and comfort their soules and cosciences in all distresses, inward and outward; in all afflictions, and against all scandals &amp; persecutions whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, God hath prouided for his people, Ministers, by their pure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and iudicious writings, to resolue them in all doubts; and christian friends and acquaintance, to solace and support them: Wherefore wée must daily blesse God for his infinite mercy in Christ; attend vnto, and consult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, our pastours and christian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, wée must make vse of the treatises and volumes of godly learned men, who haue trauelled to good purpose in this kind.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, wée must in our afflictions and distresses, find out, confesse and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile, our particular sinnes, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly entreat God, for Christ his sake to pardon them; for they are the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

causes of all our miseries.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, we in our miseries and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, must not murmurre and repine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, nor vse any vnlawfull meanes of ease and deliuerance, much lesse despaire of Gods gracious mercy &amp; helpe; but wée ought to commend our soules, bodies, and outward state to Gods blessed gouernment and promises; wee must desire direction, and the spirit of strength and constancie from God, and in hope &amp; patience, waite vpon him, vntill hée haue mercy vpon vs.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, when we are recouered out of any temptation, or deliuered out of any trouble, we must giue God all the glory of it: and in our rest and prosperity, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to performe all these duties, that his Maiestie may haue all the glorie, his Church and children good examples of imitation; and we our selues haue ioy and comfort in this world, and eternall Saluation in the next: Amen.</p>
