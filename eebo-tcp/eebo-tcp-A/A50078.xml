            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Page of the late Queen of <hi>England</hi> came on <hi>Munday</hi> the 9th of <hi>January,</hi> 1689/90, to Monſieur <hi>Leonard,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Bookſeller in <hi>Paris,</hi> and told him, his Miſtreſs was deſirous to ſpeak with him immediately: Whereupon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Leonard</hi> having gone incontinent to

               <head>The DREAM itſelf.</head>
               <p>UPon <hi>Saturday</hi> night, the 24th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> after having heard the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night-Maſs,</hi> I went to Bed very much troubl'd in mind: about four a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there appeared to me in my ſleep four Perſons whom I knew not, and who ſtood a long time before me, without ſpeaking a word; at laſt the Eldeſt of them, whoſe Face reſembled a mixture, betwixt a Mans and Womans, ſaid to me, <hi>Great Princeſs, Yet within three and a half, and the fourth part of a half, and he ſhall be no more.</hi> Two Claps of Thunder having ſet my

But juſt when thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were beginning to ſpeak to us, a Whirlwind in a moment ſeparated us from them; and we were carried thence into a thick dark Wood, where there was no other light but a little Moon-ſhine; here there aroſe a thick and ſtinking Rynd of Miſt, which neceſſitated my Comerade and me to embark ourſelves upon the Ocean, and whereupon we arrived at laſt at the <hi>Elezian Shades:</hi> Juſt at our arrival there, the terrour which was upon me, forc'd me to awaken, and I found myſelf all over in a ſweat, and my Face and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

               <head>The Explication of the Dream.</head>
               <p>BEfore I come to Explain this Exil'd Queen's Dream, it's fit we ſhould know, ſhe is by birth an <hi>Italian</hi> Princeſs, a Bigotted Papiſt, and much devoted to the Pope, and to the Jeſuits: Thence it was, ſhe entertain'd a firm Deſign to Ruine the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to Extirpate the Proteſtant Religion; to ſucceed in this damnable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſhe pretended a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was born, and was the occaſion thereby of that <hi>Tragi-Comedy,</hi> ſo known to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and of her own and the Flight of K. <hi>James</hi> her Husband out of <hi>England:</hi> And as ſhe is the principal Perſon concern'd in this Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it has pleaſed GOD, by this Viſion, to give her the juſt Marks of his Anger and Diſpleaſure againſt thoſe of that Party.</p>
               <p>This Queen, after <hi>having heard Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night-Maſs, went to Bed very much troubled in mind:</hi> This Trouble of Mind was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludium to that terrible Viſion that was to follow. The Prophet ſays, <hi>There is no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61904:6"/>
peace ſays my GOD, to the ſinner:</hi> And thence certainly it was, this Princeſs was diſquieted at going to Bed: Why ſhe had this Dream on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-night, I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>About four a Clock in the Morning, there appeared to me four Perſons whom I knew not, who ſtood a long time before me without ſpeaking a word:</hi> This Viſion happen'd at four a Clock in the Morning, which is the ordinary hour of Dreams coming from God; becauſe at that time the Spirit is more free, and not embaras'd with Vapors, or with the Fumes ariſing from the firſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. The Queen did not know theſe four Perſons, becauſe God had left her to Blindneſs of Mind; otherwiſe ſhe might have eaſily known that it was the <hi>Great Whore</hi> and the <hi>Signagogue of Satan</hi> ſhe ſaw before her: Theſe four Perſons ſtood a long time without ſpeaking. It pleaſed God, this Viſion ſhould ſtay a long time before this Unhappy Queen, to the end, ſhe might be the more aſſured of the truth of that Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At last the Eldest of them, whoſe face re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a mixture, betwixt a Mans and a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61904:7"/>
Womans:</hi> This <hi>Hermophrodite</hi> is no other then the Pope, who feigns himſelf to be GOD's Vicegerent upon Earth, when he is at the ſame time, the <hi>Great Whore</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the <hi>Apocalipſe.</hi> In <hi>Dubritius</hi> his Revelations, the Pope appear'd to him in the ſhape of a Woman with a Beard; which is juſt as much as to ſay, in the ſhape of a <hi>Hirmophrodite,</hi> as here.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hirmophrodite</hi> ſaid, <hi>Great Princeſs, Yet within three and a half, and the fourth part of a half, and he ſhall be no more:</hi> This Expreſſion evinces clearly, that the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> ſince ſhe mentions exactly the time of her own Duration, and the Year in which ſhe ſhall be no more: It's certain by the Sequel of this Prophecy, that this infamous Hermophrodite ſpeaks of herſelf, and of her Sinagogue in the <hi>third Perſon.</hi> We have prov'd in another Book, viz. <hi>The Harmony of the Apocalipſe,</hi> That the three Days and a half, of which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Revel.</hi> chap. 11. v. 11. <hi>are</hi> 1290 <hi>Years,</hi> and which will end in the Year 1714: But here this Viſion adds the <hi>fourth part of a half Day,</hi> for the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Pope; and as every Day
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61904:7"/>
of this Great Year, is 360, or 365 Years, it follows, that the total Ruine of the Pope, and of Popery, muſt be in the Year 1759, for the eighth part of 360 is 45; theſe 45 Years then, being added to 1714, makes up the Year 1759, in which the Pope will be intirely Extirpated. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> does explain this Affair af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, as in this Dream of the Queen's, <hi>Happy is he that ſhall ſee the forty fifth day after the one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety.</hi> We have in the Book I formerly mention'd, cited this paſſage of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, to prove that the laſt Year of the Pope's Reign, when the laſt Viol ſhall be pour'd out upon the Beaſt, muſt be the Year 1759: And the wonderful agreement of all their Propheſies does clearly manifeſt, that this Dream of the Queen's, was ſent her of GOD.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the ordinary way of count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Years at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> is by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> whereof every one conſiſts of fifteen Years, and makes exactly up <hi>the hour of three days and an half</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>; whence we muſt conclude, that it's the Great Whore herſelf, that ſpeaks in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61904:8"/>
Queen's Dream, ſince ſhe follows her own way of reckoning.</p>
               <p>This Hermophrodite does juſtly call the Queen <hi>Great Princeſs,</hi> becauſe the Pope has not a Princeſs within all his Empire, that has done more to eſtabliſh it in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and elſe-where, than ſhe. And it's for the ſame reaſon, that it has pleaſed GOD to make her know, as it were by the mouth of the Pope himſelf, the end of his Helliſh Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two Thunder Claps that ſet the Queen's Chamber on fire, made theſe four Perſons to diſappear:</hi> We have prov'd, that theſe four Perſons that appear'd to the Queen, are the Pope and his Clergy; and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoſe Wretches their diſappearing, does put it beyond diſpute; for all the Propheſies expreſly ſay, <hi>That GOD ſhall extirpate Antichrist and his Synagogue by the most dreadful judgments:</hi> Theſe Judgments are very well repreſented by two Claps of Thunder, which ſet the Queen's Chamber on fire. A great many other Viſions and Revelations, as that of <hi>Kotterus,</hi> of <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius, Chriſtina Poinatovie,</hi> &amp;c. foretels the Deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> by Fire.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Then ſhe ſaw a Woman mounted upon a Camel:</hi> We have proved elſewhere, That the final Deſtruction of the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> ſhall not happen till the Year 1759, and therefore it's no wonder ſhe ſhould appear a ſecond time to this Queen, ſo much her Friend. The Whore is <hi>mounted on a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> becauſe ſhe is to conduct the Queen into a Deſart; that is, the <hi>Deſart of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> deſtitute of all Spiritual Bleſſings, and where the Flowers and Pleaſures of it ſeem to be, and are indeed <hi>Enchanted.</hi> This is the ſame Wilderneſs of which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in the 17th Chap. of <hi>Apocalipſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Woman would needs have the Queen follow her, together with the little Prince of</hi> Wales, telling her, <hi>She would bring her to a happy Place:</hi> But the end of the Dream will evince how fallacious the Promiſes of the Devil and Antichriſt are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I followed then this Woman,</hi> (ſays the Queen) <hi>and ſhe took me through a pleaſant Garden full of Flowers, where all things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Enchanted:</hi> It's no wonder that this Princeſs ſhould give ear to the words of the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> ſince ſhe has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd with her Witchcrafts from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61904:9"/>
upwards, and a Religious Obſerver of all the Maxims of Popery and Jeſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Whore conducts the Queen through an Arbour:</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Court of</hi> France, which is a very conſiderable part of the Deſart of the Whore, as the event of this Diſcourſe will juſtifie: Theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are <hi>full of Flowers,</hi> where all things ſeem to be Enchanted: Theſe Flowers and Delights which the Devil and Antichriſt give to Men, are not real ones, but only Deluſions: In effect, <hi>The figure of this world paſſes away, but the will of GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We here met with a Prince</hi> (adds the Queen) <hi>who look'd as one that had been once very ſtrong, but who now had his right Arm and his left Ear cut off, and whom two Monks helped in his walk:</hi> It's not ſtrange, that this Refug'd Queen ſhould meet <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth in her way, ſince the place where ſhe now is, is the Court of <hi>France.</hi> It is ſaid of this Unhappy Prince, <hi>That he look'd as one that had been once very ſtrong</hi>; but the Misfortunes which the Monks had brought upon him, has now render'd him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61904:9"/>
the Object of the Hate and Contempt of the whole World. That we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Misfortunes the Monks are to bring upon <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth, we muſt conſider, that a King has two Bodies, one a Natural, the other Politick; <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth is not chiefly to ſuffer the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy mean'd here, in his Natural Body, but in his Miſtick or Politick one, which is the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whereof he is the Head: The right Arm cut from him, is the Maſſacre of the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> which ſhall begin this preſent Year 1690, in ſome parts of <hi>France,</hi> and ſhall continue the ſpace of three Years following, as we have prov'd in the Book formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. The Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> were the right Arm of <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth for ſeveral Reaſons: 1. They were more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him than the Papiſts, who would have Dethron'd him, if the Proteſtants had not ſtood by him. 2. Becauſe by them the Commerce and Trade of <hi>France</hi> flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. 3. Becauſe they brought with them a Bleſſing from GOD upon the King and Kingdom, for their ſakes. In effect, when ever the King came to Revoke the <hi>Edict
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61904:10"/>
of Nants,</hi> immediately thereupon he was ſtruck in the Fundament, as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> of old, upon alike occaſion: But as the Crime of <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth was far greater than that of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> ſo much greater was his Puniſhment, for this Unhappy Prince ſhall never be entirely cur'd of his Fiſtula; and becauſe he ſhall never have the Grace given him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>his end ſhall be with Pains horrid and ſtrange,</hi> as <hi>Noſtredamus</hi> has it <hi>Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> 6. It is alſo certain, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all Miſeries, ſhall happen to <hi>France,</hi> and to their King, upon the Maſſacre of the Proteſtants. This is it which was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Noſtredamus,</hi> when ſpeaking of <hi>France,</hi> upon the back of this Maſſacre, <hi>After this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>there ſhall follow the greatest of Woes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Reaſons prove evidently, That the Proteſtants were the right Arm of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> the Fourteenth, and that by their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre the Monks will cut off the King's right Arm. And in this Dream of the Queen's, there is a clear Aluſion to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Expreſſion uſed by that KING, That <hi>to have all his Subjects become Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61904:10"/>
he would let them cut off his right Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſaid in the Queen's Dream, that this Unhappy Monarch <hi>had likewiſe his left Ear cut off:</hi> The cutting off the left Ear, ſignifies upon the matter the ſame thing with the cutting off the right Hand; for the left Ear of <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth ought to have been open to the Complaints of the Proteſtants, and therefore by the left Ear is meant they. Every body knows that Magiſtrates ought to have their right Ears open to the Accuſer, and the left to the Accuſed: In <hi>France</hi> the Papiſts were ever the <hi>Accuſers,</hi> and the Proteſtants the <hi>Accuſed</hi>; and therefore the left Ear of <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th, ſignifies naturally the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>France,</hi> and the cutting off this Ear, their Extirpation and Maſſacre: The Monks ſtand by, for they have brought the King to this Puniſhment, and are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this dreadful Execution; which F. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi> had put in practiſe before now, if not hindered by the late Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> This horrid Crime will be the Price of F. <hi>La Chaiſe</hi>'s Abſolution; and by this Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful SACRIFICE, <hi>Lowis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61904:11"/>
pretends to Attone for His other Crimes.</p>
               <p>The Queen had this Viſion on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-Eve, becauſe it relates much to what was predicted of <hi>Lowis</hi> the Fourteenth, in terms like, and yet oppoſite to thoſe of the Prophet <hi>Iſaias, A child is born, and a ſon to us is given:</hi> Whereas <hi>Noſtredamus</hi> has it, in <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>Quarant.</hi> 42. ſpeaking of <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th, <hi>L'enfant naitra à deux dens en la gorge; A Child ſhall be born with two Teeth in his Mouth:</hi> Which prov'd literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true of him. And indeed within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, this Unhappy Monarch ſhall cauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents to be murder'd in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and for the ſame reaſons, that <hi>Herod</hi> did it long ago</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Whirlwind</hi> (ſays the Queen) <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us from this Wretched Prince, and his two Monks, when they were just going to ſpeak to us</hi>: The Whirlwind that ſhall take this Queen from <hi>France,</hi> ſhall be the <hi>unhappy and fatal Criſis of</hi> Europe, at the time when <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th and his Monks ſhall be on the point of putting in execution the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of the Proteſtants of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And we found ourſelves</hi> (continues ſhe)

                  <hi>in a Wood very dark, where there was only a little Moon-ſhine; and where there aroſe dark and ſtinking Miſts:</hi> This dark Wood, is the Condition of <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhall be abſolute Miſtreſs. This Wood had no light of the <hi>Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> which is Jeſus Chriſt, but only that of <hi>the Moon,</hi> which is the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church: In effect this Antichriſtian Church is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to that of Jeſus Chriſt; which in the 12th Chapter of the <hi>Apocalipſe,</hi> is <hi>cloathed with the Sun, and has the Moon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet.</hi> The <hi>thick and ſtinking Miſts</hi> are the abominable ſtinking and tyrannical Doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and the innumerable Murders which their execrable Clergy ſhall cauſe to be committed in the <hi>black Deſart</hi> or <hi>Wood,</hi> ſpoken of in this Dream, and in all the other Dominions of Antichriſt.</p>

               <head>Madam <hi>La Valiere</hi>'s Dream.</head>
               <p>THis Lady having gone to Bed the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> 1690, after the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> was over, ſhe dream'd ſhe was at <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles</hi> in a Secular Habit, and that ſhe ſaw the King walking by the ſide of the <hi>Canal,</hi> in which ſhe thought there were two little <hi>Iſlands,</hi> very near one another: The King was attended by ſeveral Hunters, and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels,</hi> becauſe he was going to kill ſeveral River-Fowls; Madam <hi>La Valiere</hi> follow'd him: When they came over-againſt the firſt Iſland, a great Spaniel threw himſelf into the Water, and ſwim'd into the Iſland, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with a great many Ducks and Geeſe, whoſe Eggs and young Ones he eat up greedily; after which he came back to Land, and was received by the reſt of the King's Spaniels; who thereupon command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fire upon the Ducks and others Fowls, whereof ſome were killed dead. When they came over againſt the other Iſland, they heard the noiſe of a great many Dogs as a Hunting, which the great Spaniel hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61904:13"/>
threw himſelf into the Water after them, being followed by ſome of the K.'s; as ſoon as he had joyn'd them on this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſland, the noiſe became louder and louder, and continued a good while, and thereafter another flock of Ducks and other Fowls fled out of that Iſland into the firſt, whither likewiſe the great Spaniel follow'd them: The King deſirous to ſee the event, came back upon his tract; the great Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel entring into the firſt Iſland again, fought a long while with the Ducks and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Birds, who after a brisk reſiſtance and noiſe, took Wing and fled away beyond reach of ſight. The King caus'd fire upon them, and killed ſome of them in their flight. As the King was returning to the Palace, he told thoſe about him, that he muſt go and ſee his Orange-trees; in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he ſtumbled againſt the root of a Tree, and fell upon his Face, bleeding at the Noſe; He was immediately taken up and carried into his Bed. M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> ſeeing the Door of the Orange-Incloſure ſtanding open, ſhe enters, and beheld the beautifuleſt Orange-trees ſhe ever ſaw, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Flowers and Fruits of all ſorts:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61904:13"/>
but that which ſurpriz'd her moſt, was that at the foot of every <hi>Orange-tree</hi> there was a <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-de-luce</hi> wreathed about it, and which mixed its Flowers with that of the <hi>Orange,</hi> and which mixture yeilded a moſt fragrant ſmell. In the mean time while M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> was contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all this, ſhe heard a great cry thrice re-doubled, <hi>The King is a coming, the King is a coming</hi>; and the noiſe of the Cry immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaken'd her.</p>
               <p>Every body knows how earneſt the <hi>French</hi> King was to have this Dream of M. <hi>La Valiere,</hi> his Quondam Miſtreſs, explain'd, and that he offer'd <hi>a thouſand Piſtols</hi> to any that would do it: Which is thought is done already by the ſame Author who ventur'd to Explain the K.'s own Dream, which he had about the ſame time; but without any proſpect of Reward, I give him the following and true Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it:</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61904:14"/>
upon the ſide of the Canal, in the midst of which appeared two Iſlands near to one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>La Valiere <hi>in a Secular Habit,</hi> repreſents ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neatly that <hi>Seraglio,</hi> or Houſe of Pleaſure he had at <hi>St. Cir,</hi> when this Lady was his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine:</hi> The <hi>Canal</hi> denotes the Sea that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons <hi>Great Britaine</hi> on all ſides: The two <hi>Iſlands</hi> amidſt this <hi>Canal,</hi> are the two Iſlands of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> and <hi>Noſtrodamus</hi> calls theſe Kingdoms <hi>Iſlands</hi> by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence. In the Dream, the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>two little Iſlands,</hi> becauſe ſhe was to ſee them in the <hi>Canal of Verſailles,</hi> which being of its ſelf but little, the Iſlands repreſented in them, behoov'd to be little alſo; theſe Iſlands are near to one another, becauſe there is but three hours ſailing from ſome parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſome parts of <hi>Ireland.

                  <hi>When the King came over against the first I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, ſhe ſaw a great Spaniel throw himſelf into the Water, to ſwim into the Iſland, followed by a great many Ducks and other Fowls, whoſe Eggs he eat up:</hi> This firſt Iſland is <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; the great Spaniel that threw himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Water, is K. <hi>James</hi>; he is follow'd by a great many Ducks and other Fowls; that is, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; he eats up their Eggs, that is when he began to deſtroy and ruine the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> and their Liberties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The great Spaniel came aſhore, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the King's B. who caus'd fire upon the Fowls, and kill'd ſome of them</hi>; That is, K. <hi>James</hi> fled over all alone to <hi>France,</hi> and the King having aſſiſted him with a Naval Force, has ſince killed ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the preſent War he has declared againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When they came over against the other Iſland, they heard the noiſe of a great many Dogs a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereupon the great Spaniel threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Water, with ſome of the King's Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels to joyn them in the Iſland:</hi> When they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61904:15"/>
were near the other Iſland, that is <hi>Ireland,</hi> they heard the noiſe of Dogs a Hunting; that is, the Army of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Ireland</hi>; the great Spaniel upon the noiſe threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Water to joyn them; that is, K. <hi>James</hi> ſeeing his Party ſubſiſt yet in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he goes thither, and joyns his Army there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Officers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>When the King is returning to the Palace, he told thoſe about him, he would go to ſee his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-trees:</hi> The Viſit deſign'd by the King to his Orange-Incloſure, foretels the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the War of <hi>Lowis</hi> 14th againſt K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> who is here repreſented as P. of <hi>Orange.</hi> This term <hi>to go to ſee,</hi> ſignifying a Declaration of War, is taken from that place of Scripture, <hi>Where Amiſias King of Judah, ſends to the King of Iſrael ſaying, Come let us ſee one another,</hi> or let us look one another in the face: And it's afterwards ſaid, that theſe two Kings ſaw one another in the face; that is, they fought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſaying this, the King ſtumbled upon Cail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and fell on his face, bleeding at the Noſe:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this new Declaration of War, or rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the former, the King ſtumbles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the root of a Tree; that is, he met with a powerful Obſtacle of his Deſign; and God is preparing a great and terrible Vengeance for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61904:16"/>
this Guilty Monarch. In fine, he <hi>falls on his Face, bleeding at the Noſe</hi>; That is, <hi>Lowis</hi> 14th ſhall fail in his Enterprize on <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and this laſt Monarch ſhall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Armies of <hi>France.</hi> Moreover, His bleeding ſhall weaken him, and render him timorous and cowardly. And in the old Dialect of <hi>France,</hi> to ſay a Man <hi>bleeds at the Noſe,</hi> was to ſay, <hi>he is afraid.</hi> The end of the Dream proves, that this Fall of <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th will be mortal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They preſently took up the King, and carried him to his Bed:</hi> The fall of <hi>Lowis</hi> upon his Noſe, muſt be terrible, ſince he fell a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, and was ſo far unable to riſe of himſelf, that they were neceſſitated to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to his Bed: This denotes that <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th ſhall die of this Fall, ſince the Bed is an Image of Death: Thence this Dream is the fatal Fore-runner and Prediction of the miſerable End of this King, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

               <p>The preſent juncture of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> does teach us clearly, that M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> and <hi>Noſtredamus</hi> ſpeak of one and the ſame Event; as alſo the Dream of the late Queen, about the <hi>cutting off the right Arm and left Ear of</hi> Lowis <hi>the</hi> 14th, denotes the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Miſery of that Monarch.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Orange-Incloſure open, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where ſhe beholds the beautifulest Orange-trees, ſhe ever ſaw:</hi> As <hi>Lowis</hi> the 14th is the Capital Enemy of God and of King <hi>William,</hi> it's not to be doubted, but after the Fall of this Unfortunate Prince, King <hi>William</hi> will prove a Glorious and Proſperous King; and which God has been pleas'd to reveal to M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> in this Viſion. The Beauty of the Orange-trees, denotes the incomparable Proſperity of that Servant of God, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> late P. of <hi>Orange</hi>; which we have likewiſe prov'd in our <hi>Harmony of Propheſies,</hi> p. 117. in our Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 38 <hi>Sireain of Noſtredamus,</hi> in that of <hi>Caſſarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> and in our Expoſition of the Dream of <hi>Lowis</hi> 14th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Orange-trees were all covered with Flowers, and with all kinds of Fruits:</hi> Theſe do denote to K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> all ſorts of Bleſſings, both ſpiritual and temporal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what ſurpriz'd M.</hi> La Valiere <hi>most, was her ſeeing that at the root of every Orange-tree, there was Flower-de-luces wreathed about them, and which mixed their Flowers with that of the Oranges:</hi> This part of the Dream is very conſolatory for M. <hi>La Valiere</hi>; and it ſeems God ſhews her by it, that he is pleaſed with the beginnings of her Reprentance, and that he will give her Grace to turn to the living and true God, and to live to ſee the happy Day when all <hi>France,</hi> and their

King, ſhall make profeſſion of the true Religion, in a manner more perfect than is yet to be found among the Proteſtants, the beſt Reform'd: It's for this reaſon, that M. <hi>La Valiere</hi> is ſo pleaſantly ſurpriz'd, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd with Joy and Admiration, which would ſeem to foretel her Happineſs in ſeeing a great Reformation, and the happy Union of a King of <hi>France</hi> with K. <hi>William.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This beautiful Flower-de-luce, which ſhe ſees wreath'd about the Orange-trees, and mix their Flowers with theirs,</hi> does clearly denote the Succeſſor of <hi>Lewis</hi> 14th, who being animated with the Spirit of God, as K. <hi>William</hi> is at preſent, ſhall Unite himſelf in a ſtrict Alliance with him; ſo that the Intereſts of them both, ſhall be one and the ſame, becauſe they ſhall ſeek after the ſame things, <hi>viz.</hi> The Glory of God, and the Good of his Church. There are a great many Propheſies, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of the <hi>Young Propheteſs of Dauphine,</hi> who ſay the ſame very thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This mixture of Flowers, render'd a pleaſant ſmell</hi>; which denotes the marvellous Bleſſings wherewith God ſhall follow the Alliance and Union betwixt the King of <hi>France</hi> and K. <hi>William:</hi> And this ſweet ſmell may be truly compared to that which is called, <hi>The Savour of Life unto Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>While M.</hi> La Valiere <hi>contemplates all theſe things, ſhe hears a loud cry thrice repeated, The King's a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the King's a coming; which cry awakens her:</hi> This great redoubled cry, denotes that <hi>Lowis</hi> 14th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins juſt now to enter into that Action foretold in the firſt part of M. <hi>La Valiere</hi>'s Dream, in ſuch ſort that it may be juſtly ſaid to <hi>Lowis</hi> 14th, as was ſaid to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of old, <hi>What thou dost, do it quickly.</hi>
