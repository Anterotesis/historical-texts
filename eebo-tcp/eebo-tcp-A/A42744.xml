         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>EVER since my <hi>First Thoughts</hi> of writing this <hi>History,</hi> I have frequently consider'd whom I should select, as a <hi>fit Patron</hi> of my Endeavors this way; but these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations still concluded, that you, who on the <hi>firm Foundation</hi> of your own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, have establish'd your selves in the Esteem of the more <hi>solid part</hi> of Mankind, without the <hi>Auxiliary Support</hi> of any great Man's Assistance; that <hi>You</hi> who had no <hi>Richelieu</hi> to cherish your first Essays, or guard your <hi>Rising Merit,</hi> were ablest to Patronize that, which chiefly aim'd at giving the World a Draught, in little, of what it ow'd to your <hi>Incomparable</hi> Performances. If it were not, that most Writers have a sordid present Gain in View, when they design a <hi>Dedication,</hi> I am confident, we should see few <hi>Noblemens Names</hi> at the beginning of their Works, since it must be confess'd, 'twould be more for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Reputation, to chuse one another for Patrons; a Writer being better qualified to defend that, which he has once espous'd, with his <hi>Pen,</hi> than any Great man, with his empty <hi>Name,</hi> or a long <hi>Catalogue of Titles.</hi> At least I am sure, no man will think my Choice improper, when he shall consider, how well able you are to <hi>protect my Failings</hi> with your <hi>Invincible Pens,</hi> against all those, who shall hereafter attaque them. Nor will the <hi>Defect</hi> of what I have writ, make me at all despair of your favourable Reception, since every Action ought to receive its Value from the <hi>Intention,</hi> not the <hi>awkward manner</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. My <hi>Will</hi> design'd your Honor, tho' my <hi>Pen</hi> has not come up to the <hi>Greatness</hi> of <hi>my Aim.</hi> I was no sooner convinced by what you published, of the Possibility of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on so <hi>Noble an Undertaking,</hi> but I resolved to attempt this <hi>History,</hi> which I hop'd to perfect without the knowledge of any of your <hi>Learned Society,</hi> being sensible that your <hi>aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Modesty</hi> would endeavour to stifle that, which might bear the <hi>least resemblance of a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <l>THE Warmth your Beams produc'd you must excuse;</l>
               <l>Your Commendation first inspir'd my Muse:</l>
               <l>Your friendly Praise supports her feeble Wing;</l>
               <l>You both invite, and teach her how to sing.</l>

               <l>Who <hi>Athens</hi> home to us at your own Charge have brought!</l>
               <l>Aspiring <hi>Lewis</hi>'s self must yield to you,</l>

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>I AM sensible, that the more <hi>Iudicious,</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> may, with a great deal of Reason, condemn me, as guilty of an unpardonable <hi>Rashness,</hi> in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a <hi>Province,</hi> so extreamly above my Abilities, as the writing the History of a <hi>Society,</hi> whose Learning and Wit have justly made so considerable a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World; yet I must, with Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough, own, that the <hi>Nobleness</hi> of the <hi>Undertaking</hi> has born me up so far above any Apprehensions, that (like a <hi>Souldier,</hi> who resolves on some brave Action) I cast off all thoughts of those obstacles, which might frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a <hi>cooler Considerer.</hi> And since 'tis confess'd, that to aim at <hi>Noble Ends</hi> is enough to merit Applause, I had rather undergo the Severity of the Criticks (who, I have reason to think, will not be so favourable, as to forgive the Faults of the Performance for the Greatness of the Design) than lose the Glory of having first offer'd at it. I will agree with them, that it is to be wish'd, that the Great SPRAT would oblige the Age with a <hi>Second-Best Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of the <hi>Second-Best Institution,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Learning, and removing that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic</hi> Ignorance; which exercises so incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Tyranny over the more numerous part of Mankind: From such a <hi>Pen</hi> the World might expect Satisfaction, and the <hi>Athenian Society <hi>Iustice;</hi>
                  </hi> the Charms of his <hi>Stile</hi> would engage all to read, and his Wit and variety of Learning give them proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Idea's</hi> of those Excellencies, he would commend to them: And indeed, none but <hi>He</hi> (whose Thoughts are so true and fine, and whose Language so <hi>fully,</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses his <hi>Conceptions</hi>) or a whole SOCIETY learned as themselves, can be thought capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of acquitting so <hi>illustrious</hi> a <hi>Cask</hi> with that <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> it deserves.</p>
               <p>This Consideration would not a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me, if I had not <hi>This</hi> to obviate the Difficulties it brings; That great part of this Book shall be drawn from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Works of this SOCIETY, who are, indeed, their own Historians, and most worthy to be so; for, their whole design is not only to improve KNOWLEDGE in DIVINITY, and PHILOSOPHY in all their parts, as well as <hi>Philology</hi> in all its Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but also to commend this Improvement to the Publick, in the best method, that can be found out for <hi>Instruction;</hi> which is or ought to be the End of every Writer, unless he aim rather at Amusement, than Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>World</hi> would be so favourable, as to admit of what I have said for an <hi>Excuse,</hi> I hope the Gentlemen that compose this SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY, will pardon my Boldness in presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to give an account of their Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, who am not at all concerned in it, and have not the Happiness of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one <hi>Member</hi> of it, since what I shall here advance proceeds from an esteem of their Design, and the great Value I set upon their <hi>Performances,</hi> which are sufficient to convince those (among which number I my self was at first) who were startled with the seeming Impossibility of the <hi>Project,</hi> that notwithstanding it was so difficult, yet they have fully come up to what they first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Design</hi> as well as <hi>Performance,</hi> seems so extraordinary, that when I ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ect on it, I often admire, that the general, nay, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Advantage it brings, should never have inspir'd any one to have thought of it before now; till I consider, that the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was not the aim of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, so much as their own Personal <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> which they built on their own <hi>Knowing</hi> more than the rest of the World, who had not the Leisure and Abilities to spend their whole Life in Disquisitions, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputable Notions; and to maintain this, 'twas necessary for them not to communicate Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to any but their immediate Hearers, who by word of Mouth were to deliver it to their Successors in the Schools. This made all their <hi>Doctrins</hi> confin'd to their <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasia,</hi> their <hi>Porches,</hi> and <hi>Gardens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of them were so fearful of having their Sentiments known, that they wrap'd all their <hi>Notions</hi> up in Mysteries, as hard to be understood by any, but their own Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as those Chymical Tracts, we have now, which treat of the great <hi>Hermetick Work:</hi> This was the cause of the different Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Philosophy of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and I think 'tis not doubted by the Learned, but that most (if not all) of those Absurdities, which are attributed to him,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103661:4"/>
proceed only from the uncertain Guesses of his Opposers, and Enemies, who were never admitted into his School, or had a true knowledge of his Opinions; though perhaps the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> themselves did much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute (notwithstanding their great veneration for his <hi>Memory</hi>) by their Ignorance, to the Ignominy of their Master, for they learned chiefly by Tradition, to which we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably suppose, that every Successor, in their School, (who was an Arbitrary Dispenser of these Mysteries) added, at least by way of Comment, which, in a Generation or two, incorporated with it, and all past for his.</p>
               <p>If we pass from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>Politeness</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> diffus'd themselves into a larger compass there, yet their principal Studies were Oratory, and the Art of War, on which all the Preferments of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth turn'd; for, as for Philosophy, it was built upon the Greek bottom, and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> was the first that brought the <hi>Roman</hi> Language acquainted with it: Both before and after him, they that were that way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd went to <hi>Athens,</hi> then the only Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity (if I may call it so) of <hi>Europe,</hi> or had Masters from <hi>Greece,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Sextus,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> may witness, who were all three Tutors to Emperors, and all three <hi>Grecians,</hi> besides many others which I omit. The Vanity, and great Value these Philosophers, that were sent for to instruct the <hi>Romans,</hi> set upon themselves, satisfies me, that I have no great cause to wonder, that in <hi>Rome</hi> this Project was never thought of, since the <hi>Learned,</hi> whose Province this must have been, would have lost that Esteem they then possess'd, by making what they <hi>knew</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to as many as were capable and willing to understand them; whereas their singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Knowledge gave them Privilege to the highest Insolence: For, when the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Apollonius</hi> was sent for by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> from <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to read Philosophy to his adopted Son <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius Antoninus</hi> (sirnam'd <hi>The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>) after his arrival at that City, never went to wait on the Emperor, and being sent for by him, return'd this Answer; that <hi>It was not fit, the Master should attend the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but the Scholar the Master:</hi> This Pride of his was so temperately born by that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Prince, (in that more a Philosopher than <hi>Apollonius</hi>) that he only smil'd, and said to his Servants, <hi>Does he then think it farther from his Lodging to my Palace, than from</hi> Chalcedon <hi>to</hi> Rome?</p>
               <p>From hence is evident what Honour was paid them (by the highest Powers on Earth) for the Opinion of their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and also what <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> they took in it: So that it is not strange, that they should perswade it as necessary to their Followers, and by consequence deprive them of all Thoughts of making Learning more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But, that a <hi>Project</hi> of this nature would have been very grateful to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> I think, is manifest by the general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of their Youth to Learning, of whom such vast numbers flock'd to hear <hi>Carneades</hi> during his stay in that City, (when he was sent Ambassador from the <hi>Athenians</hi>) that <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> made a Speech against him in the Senate, (to whom his Embassy was already in some suspicion) and told them, That considering the whole Youth of <hi>Rome</hi> were such Admirers of him, it were an easie matter for him to perswade them to any thing. This discovers so great a desire of Knowledge in them, that, I am confident, whoever should have set such a Design on foot there, would have been exalted among their Gods, and had divine and immortal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour paid to his Memory.</p>
               <p>It is less to be wonder'd, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who at first took up the <hi>Platonick</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to engage in the Controversial War, with the Heathens, did not promote any thing like the Subject of my present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, since they were too much employ'd in Disputes, on the old Foundation, to think of any new Progress in Learning; and after they had with success managed this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of <hi>Plato,</hi> to the Downfal of Idolatry, their <hi>Tribe</hi> began to employ it against one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another, till their Contests, as well as Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, found a Period in that Inundation of <hi>Barbarity,</hi> which swallowed both them, and the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> up together. After an Age of universal Ignorance, the Clergy again put themselves upon Learning, at least assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Name of it; but it is not to be wondered, that they, who, out of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood Work of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> composed an absurd Body of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> kept up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Humour of confining the Sciences within such narrow Bounds, that many an Age scarce produc'd one Layman, that knew any thing of Letters, because as it had gain'd the Philosophers Veneration, so it would add to that which the bigotted World already paid to their Character, for by this means the Clergy became undeniable Oracles in both divine, and prophane Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The School-mens Heads were too much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with <hi>Subtilties,</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> deduc'd from these Principles (they too being all of the Clergy) to devise any means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the rest of men wiser than before.</p>
               <p>But that which gave me the greatest cause of wonder, was, that since the benefit of Printing, Books, and consequently Learning, grew more general, and with that an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Inclination of most men to spread it still farther, that nothing of this nature should by none of the Great men, and Virtuoso's of our own, or foreign Nations be found out, before about a year since.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that there is a Book called <hi>Sphinx Theologico-Philosophica,</hi> that bears some resemblance to the <hi>Athenian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> but then it differs so much when you come to peruse it, that if it had not been to obviate some mens unreasonable Fancies, I would not have nam'd it; for, there the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

               <p>From hence we may suppose what Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Reason there was in Systems, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed after this Model; and I assure the Reader, the Author of the fore-nam'd Book falls yet lower, and dwindles into Old-wives Tales, and common Sayings. In short, if any man of Sence shall happen to see that Book, they will find, that it bears no likeness to the <hi>Athenian Mercury;</hi> but the form of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Answer, the Authors of <hi>which</hi> Method, the Gentlemen of this Society, are far from pretending to be, and it was made choice of, as the only way of satisfying every ones <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,</hi> and <hi>Doubts,</hi> when each propos'd his own. I never yet (upon enquiry) could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that any thing like this was ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd either before this time, or in any other Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> has the Glory of giving Rise to two of the noblest Designs, that the Wit of Man is capable of inventing, and they are, the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> for the experimental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Natural Knowledge, and the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> for communicating not only that, but all other Sciences to all men, as well as to both Sexes; and the last will, I question not, be imitated, as well as the first, by other Nations.</p>
               <p>This leads me into a consideration of the <hi>Advantages,</hi> this Undertaking has afforded the World; which are so <hi>many,</hi> and so <hi>evident,</hi> that I may seem to the Judicious to lose time in endeavouring to demonstrate, what every man of Sence must acknowledge: Yet, to silence the Enemies of Reason as well as of the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> I shall instance in some few particulars, as first, the promotion of <hi>Printing;</hi> for, as that <hi>Art</hi> contributed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly to the spreading and progress of Learning, so has this <hi>Project</hi> made grateful Returns already, to the encouragement at least of the Masters of that <hi>Art,</hi> witness the Controversie with the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and with Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> on the Subject of <hi>Usury,</hi> which though it be stretched into too great a Latitude, by the Practices of some, yet is with no Reason in the World absolutely condemn'd by him; as this <hi>Learned Society</hi> have already made evident to any discerning Judgment: Nor has the little Endeavours at an Answer, by some nameless Scribler, mov'd me at all to think otherwise, he having not answered any Proof the <hi>Society</hi> brought (nor indeed do I believe he understood great part of them) but with a canting, inconsistent, Ramble, hastens to the end of his <hi>mighty</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication. I shall say no more of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie now, because it is not yet finished; and the <hi>other</hi> I shall have occasion of speaking of in the Second Part of this Discourse.</p>
               <p>But the Booksellers and Printers are not the only Gainers in this Affair, that Branch of the Royal Revenue, the Post (I mean both the General and Penny-Post) being not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerably improved by it, they having in the first year received some Thousands of Letters: So that it seems to me the Interest of the Government to espouse the Quarrel of this Society, so far as to suppress any Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Result of whose unjust Endeavours must be the Ruin of such an encreasing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Their Majesties Interest. But I shall say more of this in my last Part; and here shall leave the Benefit, that arises from the <hi>Athenian Mercury,</hi> to the Purses of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103661:5"/>
both the Publick, and Private, to consider a little of that which the Mind, the nobler part of Mankind, will reap from it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its chief aim, and design, the others but accidental.</p>
               <p>What an improvement this will be to Learning, I presume, none, that will give themselves leisure to reflect, can be insensible of; for a diffusing Knowledge, among all that Heaven has made capable, must certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the occasion of more Discoveries, in Truth, and Nature, because the number of the Learned will be encreased; of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I say; for, I cannot see any reason why Languages should be thought so necessary an Ingredient for the composing a Scholar, if it were not for the opening the Secrets that are locked up in them; which Prison this <hi>Noble Societies</hi> Undertaking will in time free 'em from; for, indeed 'tis very hard, that those whose Pockets could not arrive to better Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and yet are blest with abler Brains than many who spend their time in Books, should be hindered from thoseadvantages they could so well make use of. The <hi>French</hi> have remov'd in some measure this Obstacle, and made all Authors familiar to every one, that can but read and understand their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue, by translating all Books of any value into their own Language. 'Tis true, we have imitated them a little in that way, but under a different Capacity; for here there are a sort of little Ignorant Foreigners, who understand neither our Tongue, nor that from whence they translate, employed by the Booksellers on this difficult Task, because they murder a noble Author cheaper, than a Man of Parts willdo him Justice, and like a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> will live upon a Clove of Garlick, and work hard for what will but suffice to buy 'em a great Coat to keep 'em from the Cold: This is the cause, we have few good Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations. Whereas the <hi>French</hi> are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, because they who give themselves to Undertakings of that kind among them, are such whose Business is Learning, and who are otherways provided for, than to depend on the Generosity of a Bookseller for their Bread. And whilst a business of that consequence is carried on by such Hands, we have no reason to expect any greater Performances.</p>
               <p>But had we the good Fortune to have all the Arts and Sciences, and all the fine thoughts of all those great men that have writ, they would be so voluminous that many a man of Sence would labour under, as great a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as before, both for time to peruse and Money to purchase them: But this difficulty is quite removed, by the <hi>Athenian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> for One hour in a week is all the time, that is required to peruse them, and Two pence weekly sufficient to purchase those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in which, every one may find the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of what great Authors have writ on any curious Subject, with the improvement of many ingenious, and learned men upon it. Nor is the Reader confined to that silly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterial Argument of some of the old <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goreans,</hi> an <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> but is only desired to yield to the force of Reason it self, and what Authorities are brought, will easily be seen to be supernumerary Proofs, unless about Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fact,</hi> and the verity of any Passage in History, as that of <hi>Iosephus</hi> about our <hi>Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  </hi> which can be decided by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Testimony of all Ages up to the time when such Book was writ; which is a much more natural, and rational way to come to the Truth, than by the conjectural Arguments of some opinionated men of this present Age, who would needs preferr a meer Ghess to a Cloud of Witnesses, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod quite contrary to all the Justice and Proceedings in the World.</p>
               <p>If the Reader will consider what I have said, I am confident he can't but in Justice acquit me of <hi>Flattery,</hi> when I shall say, that all the Endeavours of the great men of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Ages, from the beginning of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this time, have not contributed to the encrease of Knowledge, so much as this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Athenian Society.</hi> What the Ancients did, I have already, in a few words discussed, and tho' I will not deny, that the Advance that has been made, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of Learning, is very extraordinary, yet it must be granted that it falls short of this. 'Tis true, it was great to cast off Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and to have Recourse alone to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Experiment, the only sure Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Learning, without which we spend our Years in painful Study, to fill our Heads with false, and empty Notions, foreign enough from <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the aim of all Study; for, without a pretty good assurance of <hi>that,</hi> the Mind can never be satisfied. But though the Treasure of <hi>Knowledge</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased so vastly, yet the Possessors of this Treasure did not grow much more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than of old; so that the Benefit of it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched only to such, as could go to the expence of Studying at the chargeable places called <hi>Universities,</hi> (few else being the better for this new Revolution in the Empire of Wisdom) most of the rest of Mankind were an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Generation, that bore the Form, the Shape, the Image of Men, and had the use of their Tongue to make known their Thoughts, but it was only to discover, how very little difference there was betwixt them and their Brothers the <hi>Brutes.</hi> The Learned dealt with Mankind, till now, as some bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Clergy-men do, in giving the greatest part to <hi>Ignorance</hi> here, as they do to the <hi>Devil</hi> hereafter. I confess those few, and imperfect Translations we have, did a little refine the Conversation of a great many, who had not the good Fortune to be skill'd in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but those Books are (as I have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before) <hi>too large, too difficult,</hi> and <hi>too dear</hi> for several, that are as willing, and as fit to learn, though they have not so good a Purse to spare, either their Money, or their Time on them, from their necessary Occasions of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Livelihood. But the <hi>Society</hi> have opened an easier way, and set Learning in so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103661:5"/>
fair a light, that won, with its Beauty, every one must with eagerness embrace it, in a form so agreeable to all Capacities; and those, who are so near a Kin to their <hi>Bodies,</hi> as not to care for the Embellishments of the Mind, will have a clearer Mark set upon them, of sordid Ignorance.</p>
               <p>If these, and many more are the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that will accrew to the Public from this Undertaking, I believe the Learned will receive no less, I mean those who are not <hi>so full of themselves,</hi> that they cannot with Patience peruse the Works of any one else; for, all the knotty points of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Divinity, Mathematics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have employ'd the curious part of the World thus long, are form'd into Quaeries by the Inquisitive, and answered with an abundance of Reason, by the <hi>Society,</hi> who are not only men of Parts; but also blest with a Temper that is <hi>Industrious to the highest degree,</hi> and by consequence must give a general Satisfaction in their Performances, to the best of Judges in every Science.</p>
               <p>But here methinks I see some plodding, grave, Gentleman, that has been at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of many a <hi>laborious</hi> Year, to gain the Mastery of <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> with a supercilious frown, condemning this <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> not for falling short of their first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but because they keep up too close to it. For, says he, <hi>What Honour will be due to Learned men, that have spent so many years in the study of Languages, and the Criticisms of them, if the Kernel of that Nut, they are so long a cracking, be given to every <hi>illiterate</hi> Fellow, that understands not what's Latin for the Book he reads.</hi> This desire of Honour, and Veneration, and to be esteemed something more than Men, has been the cause of the small Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Learning in former Ages, as I have already shewn, and therefore ought to be cast away with the other Fopperies of those times, which obstructed the Growth of Knowledge; and the Gentlemen of this Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may satisfie themselves, that the number of <hi>Illiterate Fellows</hi> will be much less, and yet the Skill in the Languages be in as much esteem, as it deserves, as long, as the study of ancient Authors, especially the Poets (which can never be delivered in any other Language with that Force, and Beauty they have in their own) shall be valued by the Ingenious; Criticisms will still be pleasing, though a thousand times repeated, and to be a Critic, 'twill be necessary to understand the original of those Books, that teach them to be so: Etymologies of Words, and Terms of Art will require some Skill in Languages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, this <hi>Athenian Project</hi> will rather contribute to that; for, the nature of many men (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that are very curious) is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see the Author itself, from whence such admirable things are drawn, which will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to study Languages, to be able to understand them. So that that sort of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is in no fear of being lost, since now, it may be, some Hundreds may be excited to it, which otherwise had never thought on it.</p>
               <p>But I cannot imagine, why a man may not be Master of as much Sence, though he understand never a word of Latin, as if he were perfect in the darkest places of <hi>Persius;</hi> nor if his <hi>Sence</hi> can be thus improv'd, can he come under the Contempt of <hi>Illiterate?</hi> But to satisfie these Sparks, that are for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World in Ignorance, let them not be so uneasie, for, I dare engage, there will still be Fools, and Blockheads enough for them, that will not make use of this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pedants found the same fault with <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Design in translating the Philosophy of the <hi>Grecians</hi> into Latin, for fear it should make Learning, or at least its Professors, too cheap. But, as that did not deterr him from prosecuting his Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, so this cannot be supposed to weigh at all with the present <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> who have undertaken a Province of more general Good, and carried it on with no less Force, and Wit.</p>
               <p>Here I must not forget that Great, and Universal Good this Design affords to any Troubles of Mind, <hi>in removing</hi> (to use th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> words of the first <hi>Mercury) those Difficulties, and Dissatisfactions, that shame, or fear of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ridiculous by asking Questions, may cause several persons to labour under, who now have opportunities of being <hi>resolved in any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> without knowing their Informer;</hi> and (I may add, without being known themselves. And that these People might be wholly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the same <hi>Mercury</hi> says farther, thus—<hi>And if at any time, the <hi>Answer</hi> is not so satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory as they could wish, let them, as directed by the <hi>Advertisement,</hi> mention in what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and they shall have a fuller satisfaction in the next Paper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To enlarge upon this would be superfluous, since every man, that is affected with any such Trouble will find, how much Ease, Advice will afford him, especially when he can have it without discovering himself to be grieved. It must stop many a desperate Hand, which unnaturally else might attempt upon the Breast, foolishly imagining, that an end of this Life would put a Period to their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, when it only adds an infinite Encrease to them. Methinks there is something di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely mysterious in this, that I can consult so many able Heads, on my private Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and yet that they should still remain a Secret. Nay, they who propose these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions are not the only that receive the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Answer,</hi> since that may serve for many at the same time, under the same Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and even Posterity that has not yet a Being, will be indebted to it when in the like Cases, which will happen again. With good reason therefore has the Designer of the Emblem of that <hi>Society</hi> placed an Angel dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting such unfortunate Desperado's to apply
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103661:6"/>
themselves to them; for if any thing under a Divinity can avert their Misery, it must be the force of their Reasons.</p>
               <p>Having thus given a rough Draught of some of those Benefits which this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king has, and will produce to Mankind, 'tis fit that the World know its Benefactor; and indeed Justice requires, that <hi>he</hi> who first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd, and propos'd it, should have that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that is due to him, and have his Name known to Posterity, who will not have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle share in the Obligation. He therefore who form'd the first Idea of this great, this noble Project, was Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller, for whom all the <hi>Mercuries</hi> are printed; the Tenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1690/1, he first brought the Embrio into form, and, as I am informed, there were two occasions which gave Life to it, the first upon reading that of the <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 21. <hi>For all the <hi>Athenians</hi> and Strangers that dwelt there gave themselves to nothing else, but to tell, or hear some New: <hi>or rather new things.</hi>
                  </hi>]—This has relation to the foregoing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as I shall observe when I come to speak of the Reasons why they call themselves <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> His frequent reflection on this Text concurring, in time, with some great Injury he had received, gave Birth to this <hi>happy thought.</hi> For, being sollicitous how he should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in that Evangelical Lesson of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Injuries, as it were by some Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct this Method came into his Head, by which both himself and others might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in that, and any other Doubt, without being troublesome to those, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be not very well pleased with resolving Quaeries, and Doubts, unless they saw some Advantage, beside the Good of the Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.</p>
               <p>The Thought seems to be accidental (as we are apt to think all things for which we can give no positive Reason) like the Birth of a great many other great things; for, all the greatest Events have had Rise from some Accident, without a premeditated Design. Were I a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> I should imagine that it was a reminiscence of something like what had happened some Thousands of years ago in some far Country or other, which he had observed in the transmigration of his Soul through all parts of the World; and that, as some things, or words we observe, when we see, or hear any remarkable thing, will bring the whole to ones Memory, so these concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Circumstances had the same effect upon him; but since we cannot find, that there ever has been any such Design set a foot in any Nation, or Age, I must quit my <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi> Fancy, to come to a nearer Ghess.</p>
               <p>I have observed in History, that there are certain <note n="*" place="margin">Accidit in pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus <hi>Martianus,</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> travelling near <hi>Philipolis,</hi> finding a man dead out of a Piety of those days, alighted from his Horse to bury him, which whilst he was doing, some of that City coming by, took him for the Murderer, and being brought to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, by this strange Accident, was delivered by the Confession of him, that was really guilty; and this gave Rise to his low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A more public Turn was that <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who telling his Friend <hi>Tiberius</hi> (who by his means had gain'd the Empire of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>) that he dreamed an Eagle alighted at his Head, was banished immediately into a barren Island, and from thence to the City <hi>Chersona,</hi> where living in great Content, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sollicitous Thoughts about his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, (so far he was from thinking of Empire) but <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s coming against him to take his Life, made him assume a sudden Resolution of taking the Name of Emperour; and the successful Event shewed it was more than an Accident, that put that Thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Head. To mention all the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in History, which were begun by such Accidents, would swell to a Volume, though very little to my purpose. What was the original of the Noble Order of the Garter, but, the accidental falling of the Countess of <hi>Salisburys</hi> Garter, from her Legg, in the King's presence? There is nothing so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine as Music, (for, as <hi>Cowly</hi> says,</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103661:6"/>To omit the Mariner's Compass, and a great many other noble Inventions, the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the new World it self was at first but a random Thought of <hi>Columbus,</hi> from the observation of the setting Sun, with a <hi>quid si.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dunton</hi> has done more than <hi>Columbus,</hi> for he has not only found out a way to discover new Worlds, (for the Industry, and past-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise not a few new Discoveries in Nature) but also how to People the thinly inhabited Kingdoms of Philosophy, with a more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Generation. I have heard some of the Wou'd-be-Wits object against this Design, meerly because invented by a <hi>Bookseller;</hi> but that is so foolish a Flaw to find in it, that it discovered their Ignorance, as well, as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; for first, several noble Inventions have had more unlikely Authors; to instance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that of Printing, designed by a Soldier, (though a certain Writer has dubb'd him a Knight from a Trooper, (<hi>Eques</hi> being an equivocal word) than one that deals in Wit and Learning, and may well be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to converse with many of those Authors he sells. And next, the Learned know, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> was a Bookseller, and <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> a Printer.</p>
               <p>Having thus let the World know to whom it is obliged for this Advantageous Project, 'tis but Justice that it give him that Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the usefulness of his Design de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and not buoy up the Ungenerous, and Unjust Attempts of any Interlopers, who wanting Wit to invent any thing of equal worth, meanly Usurp upon the Right of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aim to live upon that Crop which was manured by his Industry, and Charge. Every considering man, must needs think, that it cost him not a little to establish it, and bring it to the knowledge of the World, and therefore he ought, in Reason, to reap the Profit of it. If the little Inventor of any small Mechanic Instrument, for the public use, have so far a Propriety in it, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that Royal Security, a Patent, that none shall enjoy the Advantage of his Industry for above Fourteen years, till his Labour be in some measure rewarded: With much higher reason ought the Inventor, or Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Noble <hi>Institution,</hi> which contributes, as I have made appear, to all manner of Knowledge, and the general Benefit of all Mankind, since none are so Great, or so In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, but may make use of his Discovery. 'Twould be ingrateful therefore, as well as unjust, in every one, not to defend him in the possession of that, which in Equity is his Due, by discountenancing those who would invade his proper Right. But I shall say more of the Interlopers in the last part of this Discourse.</p>
               <p>Having passed through the Novelty, and Usefulness of the Design of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and given an account who invented it, and by what Accident it was first thought of, not omitting the Charge the Undertaker has been at to bring it to that establishment it is now in: I hope it will not be esteemed a Digression, if I add a word or two in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, of the Difficulties, which might justly have frightned the Authors from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the Importunity of the Booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the performance; for, 'tis evident from their Works, that they foresaw 'em.</p>
               <p>They must be men of more than ordinary Resolution, as well as Learning, as their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances shew, else the great Pains that is required to go through this Undertaking, would have hindered them from entering into this <hi>Society,</hi> which, as themselves well observe, <hi>seems calculated for Objections;</hi> for, it is no easie matter to give a good Answer to the curious Enquiries into Nature, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Knowledge, and nice Reason being the only Guides; as well as the only Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in those Affairs. <hi>Divinity</hi> brings far greater Difficulties with it, since in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial Points (and there is no point of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> but what has been controverted) va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Opinions are endless, and Disputes may be drawn out into Volumes; yet this could not dash their Resolutions of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Publick Satisfaction, what Reason, and the highest Probabilities afforded, and a <hi>reasonable</hi> man can desire no more, since they have often assured the World, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to an Infallibility, and shall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to acknowledg their Errors and, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish any Sentiment, that any of the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, shall send to them upon any Subject, both in Natural Experiments, and Reasons in opposition to their own.

                  </hi> Nay, some of the Quaerists are so full of their own dear selves, that they are restless, till they see their impertinent Niceties satisfied in Print, and think the World is obliged to give way to be entertained with their Follies. As for example; one witty Gentleman, who had a mind to make Love in <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Form, desires to know in the next <hi>Mercury,</hi> for</hi> (adds he most surprizing, and wittily) <hi>Lovers are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, how he may attain to an effectual form of Courtship.</hi>—Another something angry with the haughty port of Indignation, tells them,—<hi>He</hi> (even <hi>he</hi>) <hi>wants to know why those Questions he sent about six weeks since, are not yet answered.</hi> He adds very gravely, <hi>I think my Questions deserve a Thought as well as any Bodies else.</hi> There is nothing certainly more uneasie to a man of Sence, than to be pestered with a Fool; nor for a man of Piety, than to be obliged to hear Blasphemy, Atheism, and other Prophaneness, but this <hi>Society</hi> being composed both of men of Sence and Piety, (though I am sensible some of the Town <hi>Wits,</hi> and <hi>Beaux,</hi> will think the last but a canting Commendation) have had abundant cause to exercise their Patience. <hi>Horace</hi> had never half the Fatigue with the Poetaster, as they must have had, with both Male, and Female Impertinencies. One would know, whether any two men have the same number of Hairs; another is troubled with a squeamish Conscience, and would know if it be lawful to eat black Puddings; a third, a great Enquirer into Mysteries, and I believe very studious of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi>'s occult Philosophy, would know what the King of <hi>France,</hi> is doing at that time. 'Twere endless to run through the Follies they have been troubled with; and I shall not meddle with the other, that fall under Prophaness and Atheism, abundance of which they, in their Prefaces to the first, and second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, have let the World know they have received, <hi>which but to repeat in the Quaerist's words, would be like selling of Poyson in the streets to every one that passes them.</hi>

               <p>Having done the first <hi>Projector</hi> of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, some Justice already, I think my self obliged not to forget that <hi>Great young man,</hi> who first, like <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>'Tis no small difficulty to determine which was the greatest Wonder, the Boldness of the Undertaking, or the Ability he has shewn in such unripe years in the Performance. <hi>Hercules</hi> his destroying the Serpents in the Cradle, has found Work for the Poets a great many Ages. But he has done more than all the <hi>Herculean</hi> Labours, at an Age when the rest of Mankind are but ripening; for, the mighty Sence he writes, will not let me doubt, but that he foresaw what infinite <hi>Hydra</hi>'s he was to engage with: But he has
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103661:7"/>
persued it to a Miracle, shewing the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar without the <hi>Pedant,</hi> the Philosopher without the stiff, and obscure Expressions, and superfluous Repetitions of the School, but every thing he writ in the first Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, had a pleasing genteel Air, and neat Turn through every line, and discover'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Reason could be lodg'd in a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Head, and that it met there with a Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that did not obscure its great, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Ideas. This his Boldness, Learning, and Ingenuity, ought to endear him to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, that pretends to value Excellence. And though I confess my self the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his Conversation, yet I must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Vanity to boast, that no man can value his Acquaintance, and Friendship more, though I have not yet the Honour to know him, having never had but once, and then only, a transient sight of him.</p>
               <p>I am sure, nothing but his Modesty, or the Envy of some impotent Aspirers to the Names of Authors, will say, that what I have here advanc'd about him, has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of Flattery; since I have the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of more than one of the greatest Scholars of the Age, to justifie my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but I will not forestal what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they themselves may some time, or other communicate to the World.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this First part of my Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story with the Reasons, why they assumed the Title of <hi>Athenian,</hi> for even that has faln under the merciless Phangs of the Wou'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-Critics. If they had taken the Name of <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> indeed it would have looked something odd, and as if it were done in spite of Learning, to borrow a Title from that place, which scarce ever afforded a Philosopher, or any Man of Learning; but the <hi>Athenians</hi> were the most curious, and inquisitive People of Antiquity, as that Verse I have before quoted out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> demonstrates, which I shall add here to the two foregoing Verses of the same Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>And they took him,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and brought him into</hi> Mars <hi>street, saying, May we not</hi> know <hi>what this NEW Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou speakest, is.</hi> Ver. 20, <hi>For thou bringest certain STRANGE things to our Ears; we would know, therefore, what these things mean.</hi> Ver. 21, <hi>For all the <hi>Athenians</hi> and Strangers that dwelt there, gave themselves to nothing else, but either to <hi>tell</hi> or to hear <hi>News,</hi>
                  </hi> [or rather new things.] This, as it gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the first rise of the Design, so it is enough to justifie the Title that was chose for it, because the Business, and end of it is to answer the Niceties, and curious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>All that know any thing of History, or have read any of the old Authors, must be sensible, that <hi>Athens</hi> was in that venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Antiquity, that it was the only place of Study in those days, and from thence was all <hi>Europe</hi> civiliz'd, and taught <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Sciences. Cicero,</hi> in the Introduction to his Offices, which he writes to his Son, at that time hearing Philosophy there, that he had the advantage of not only having <hi>Cratippus</hi> for his Master, but even in <hi>Athens</hi> itself, as if the place added to the facility of his Learning, and he adds the reason of it, because the Examples of so many wise men, that had flourished in that City, could not but stir him up to Emulation; for, there <hi>Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and all the great Philosophers, learned, and taught; there were the Schools of every Sect, and scarce any (I might say none) that were received into the number of the Wise, and Learned, that were not beholden for their Education to <hi>Athens:</hi> Thither <hi>Anacharsis</hi> came from <hi>Scythia,</hi> and was so taken with the Laws, as well as Wisdom of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that endeavouring to introduce both into his own Country, he was killed by his Brother, and King: There <hi>Demosthenes</hi> liv'd, and flourish'd in Oratory, and <hi>Sophooles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> in Tragedy: There lived <hi>Eupolis, Curatinus, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stophanes,</hi> (though the last was born in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> yet he lived there, and excelled in their Dialect) and <hi>Menander,</hi> all Comic Poets. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was so great an Orator, that he excelled not only all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but put in for the Palm of Fame with <hi>Tully</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and if he carry it not from him, yet holds the Balance <hi>in equilibrio.</hi> The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Government of <hi>Athens</hi> put upon the Learned in all Sciences, afforded Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Ingenious, to improve them. Both Comedy and Tragedy owe their Birth to <hi>Athens;</hi> and indeed, the Dramatic was more in esteem there than Epic Poetry, being the more immediately useful for Man's Life, Comedy correcting the Vices of it, and Tragedy (by Examples more powerful than Precepts) stirring the Minds of Youth up to Heroic Actions, and keeping Virtue in esteem, by shewing its Reward, and the Punishment of Vice: Though 'tis said of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> that one represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Accidents of Human Life, without regard to that Poetic Justice, as they too often happen; the other, as they ought to have been. The Esteem these Dramatic Poets were in, may appear by two Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one of <hi>Eupolis,</hi> the other of <hi>Euripides: Eupolis</hi> having writ Seventeen Comedies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the old Method, with a great deal of Liberty exposing the Vices of the People, was slain in a Sea-fight betwixt the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians.

When the Death of <note n="*" place="margin">The worst of <hi>Euripides</hi> was, that he hated <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menkind,</hi> so that he was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Euripides</hi> was known at <hi>Athens,</hi> (who some say was killed by the Dogs of <hi>Achelaus</hi>) there were several Embassy's dispatched to <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to obtain leave to convey his Body to his, and their own Country, but <hi>Achelaus,</hi> would not part with the Treasure of his Bones, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

their repeated Importunities. Nay, I may call the great <hi>Homer</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> since <hi>Athens</hi> was not the least of those Cities, that contended for his Birth, which are enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Greek Distic to this Sense:</p>
               <q>Seven Cities strive for mighty <hi>Homer's</hi> Birth, <hi>Athens, Smyrna, Rhodes, Colophon, Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Chios,</hi> and <hi>Argos.</hi>

               <p>Next to Poets, we must remember Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Statuaries, which flourished in <hi>Athens;</hi> of the latter <hi>Phidias</hi> was the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, but consult <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Natural History, 36th Book, and there you will find a full account of both. The World was not more obliged to <hi>Athens,</hi> for <hi>Philosophy, Oratory,</hi> and <hi>Poetry</hi> (to omit Statuary, and Painting, just mentioned) than for History, as <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,</hi> and <hi>Zenophon</hi> may evince (to omit <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who only retired into the <hi>Athenian</hi> Territories, from domestic Tyranny, where the Muses always sound a secure Retreat; and tho' he was not born an <hi>Athenian,</hi> would dye one.) <hi>Thucydides</hi> was the best of the Greek Historians, being so impartial a Writer, that in the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> War, which he was going to write, he paid for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Transactions on both sides, that so he might perfectly find out the Truth, justly suspecting, that as both Parties would palliate their own Losses, so if he knew the Affairs of each only from themselves, he should never arrive at the Truth. And it is to be wish'd, that none but a man of <note n="*" place="margin">For such was <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</hi> deriving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from <hi>Meltiades,</hi> and <hi>Cimon,</hi> two of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Commanders, and they from <hi>Aeacus,</hi> and so from <hi>Iove.</hi>
                  </note> Quality, and Estate, would meddle with compiling of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who are or ought to be above the Partiality, and the weakness of being byass'd by Affection, or Interest, it being more below the Honour of a great man, to falsifie the Truth to Posterity, than to be guilty of a Lye in Conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xenophon</hi> too was an <hi>Athenian;</hi> he took up the History of the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> War, where <hi>Thucydides</hi> left off, and was the first <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> that writ an History: And, 'tis the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Oratore,</hi> that <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in his <gap reason="foreign">

'Twould be endless to mention but the Names of all those that have flourished in every Science, and Art in this famous City. From what I have here produc'd, will sufficiently appear, that since all the Arts, and Learning of the old World owed their Beginning (nay, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Perfection too, though afterward lost in the Inundation of Barbarity which from the North over-run all <hi>Europe</hi>) to <hi>Athens,</hi> with just Reason did this <hi>Learned <hi>Society</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IN the First part of this <hi>History</hi> I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you an account of the <hi>Novelty, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, Inventor,</hi> and occasion of this <hi>Noble Undertaking.</hi> I have touched upon the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that attend it; the <hi>Noble Daring</hi> of the first <hi>Author;</hi> and, lastly, I have advanc'd some Reasons, why this <hi>Society</hi> assumed the Title of <hi>Athenian.</hi> In <hi>That,</hi> I brought you to its beginning; in <hi>This,</hi> I shall (with all the Brevity the Copiousness of the Subject will allow) proceed to its <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Growth,</hi> and from thence pass to the <hi>Manly Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> when established.</p>
               <p>Though the whole design of this <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be gathered from what has been said in the First Part, yet I think it necessary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103661:8"/>
to premise an entire Prospect of it here, since that will not a little contribute to the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Reader, by avoiding Obscurity and Confusion, setting things in as clear a Light as possible, and in that form, which the decency of Order requires.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That, which they first proposed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, was not only to answer all manner of nice, and curious Questions, in <hi>Divinity, Physick, Law, Philosophy, History, Poetry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, Trade,</hi> and all other Questions proposed by either Sex, or in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but also to give an account of the most considerable Books, printed in <hi>England,</hi> or transmitted to them, from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts; and to accomplish this effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, the Undertaker, resolving to spare no Charges to gratifie the Ingenious, setled a Correspondence beyond Sea: And tho' all this were enough to expect from the extraordinary Parts, and Industry of any Society of no greater extent, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to spare no Labour, proceeded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by inserting the Conferences, and Transactions of several <hi>English Virtuoso's,</hi> and whatever the <hi>Genius</hi> of our Nation would relish in the <hi>Acta Eruditorum Lipsiae,</hi> the <hi>Paris Iournal des Scavans,</hi> the <hi>Giornali de Litterali,</hi> printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Universal Historical Bibliotheque,</hi> and other learned and ingenious Essays of other Nations.</q> That so, as our Merchants supplied us with the Manufactures, and Commodities of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, we should not want that Production, so much more valuable in its self, and in the esteem of every wise man, their <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> whatever the <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>brisk Genius</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> the Floridness of the <hi>Italian,</hi> and the Industry of the <hi>German,</hi> the Gravity of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> should from time to time gratifie their several Countries with, this <hi>Great SOCIETY</hi> have generously, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully imported into <hi>England,</hi> and, by that means, made all Nations contribute to the Power and Glory of our Empire of <hi>Wit,</hi> as the conquered World did of old, to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, and Wealth of <hi>Rome; this</hi> a far more noble <hi>Tribute,</hi> and a far more exalted <hi>Glory,</hi> every man in Justice therefore ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them with the august Name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,</hi> above most that stand blustering Candidates for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yet farther, to make their Endeavours the more satisfactory to all men, this <hi>Society</hi> have all along invited every one, that has any Experiment, or <hi>curious Instance,</hi> which they know to be <hi>Truth,</hi> and Matter of Fact, circumstantiated, with time, and place, to send them to them. These <hi>Experiments,</hi> and Instances they not only promis'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in their <hi>Mercuries,</hi> but also endeavour to find out a <hi>Demonstration</hi> for those, which the Senders could not. So great is their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Zeal for the Good of the <hi>Public,</hi> and the Satisfaction of all curious Enquirers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to natural Speculations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All these great <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>Mighty Design,</hi> could not possibly be brought into the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mercuries,</hi> which had not room to contain the hundredth part of the Answers to those Quaeries, which they soon receiv'd; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the speedier satisfaction of Quaerists, and the publication of all these Curiosities I have spoke of, they judged it absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, at the compleating every eighteen Numbers, to print twelve more of Answers to Quaeries, by that means, if possible, to obviate the Impatience of some of those, who sent their Doubts, and Curiosities, to be resolv'd: These made up one Volume, to which as a <hi>Supplement,</hi> that is to perfect their Design, is added, (I mean to the four first) the Abstracts of all Books of value, both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic, and foreign, with curious, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Dissertations upon several nice Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The fifth Supplement, to comply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Quaerists Importunities for speedier Answers, is composed of the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Doubts, as the single <hi>Mercuries</hi> are. What shall be the Subject of their future Supplements, I shall have occasion to speak of in the third, and last part of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
               <p>Though what I have mentioned already may seem the Labour of Ages, yet they still went farther, and we find very early, their Resolution of gratifying the World with a new System of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> a thing as much desir'd, as wanted, that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so false, and that of <hi>Descartes</hi> so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I shall say no more of this Work here, because I shall have occasion to speak of it again in the third part.</p>
               <p>But, that the World might be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this whole Design, they have frequently published it, both in the Mercury, Volumes, and Supplements, and any one that desires, may read it summ'd up all together in their Fifth Supplement: So that none can plead Ignorance, that shall intrench upon their Design, and Method, and none can be dissatisfied, that they have not a full account of so many Advantages they may reap from the several Endeavours of this SOCIETY. Here it will not be improper for me to give some account of the Method they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to themselves for the prosecution of their Design, for that is indeed a necessary part of it: That Order which Justice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they made choice of; that is, that those Quaeries that came first should be first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, unless a greater Good interposed, as the answering any <hi>Popular Quaery, that might be of service to the Government;</hi> for, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Good, is granted by all men, I think, to be preferred to the Private: <hi>Or some curious Accident, or remarkable Providence, that's Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and wants a demonstration.</hi> Here too the general Advantage comes in, and then 'tis but fit that Particulars of less consequence should expect a little, and give way. <hi>Next, some extraordinary Scruple of Conscience, which wants a speedy Answer:</hi> And for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such, I think, no reasonable man, but would willingly admit his less-weighty Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should be superseded a while, since he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103661:9"/>
is sure after that to come in, in his turn.</p>
               <p>Farther, that the Quaerists should not be disappointed in their expectations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, by their faults, they have laid down these excellent Rules.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. To look over the Indexes of their Volumes, to see if their Quaeries are not already answered to their satisfaction.</item>
                  <item>II. That none send obscene Questions, as not fit to be answered by any that pretend not to as great Debauchery as the Senders of them.</item>
                  <item>III. No Riddles, or Equivocations, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (<hi>as they very well observe in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Fourth Volume, whence I have taken this</hi>) they are of no use to the Public.</item>
                  <item>IV. Nothing, the Answer of which may be a Scandal to the Government, or an Abuse to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons.</item>
                  <item>V. Nothing, that may be destructive to the Principles of Virtue, and sound Knowledge.</item>
                  <item>VI. That no Quaerist send above one, or two Questions, at the most, at one time, for then they will be the sooner at liberty to send again, and perhaps something more curious, than what they sent at first.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If every one would but observe these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Rules, they would not meet with those Disappointments, they complain of; but if they will observe no Method, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but their own <hi>Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Whim,</hi> 'tis juster to punish their Vanity with Neglect, and Contempt, than for the sake of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Gentlemen, to break all Order, which is the Life of all Performances. Let them act but regularly, and the <hi>Society desires they may be as Nice, and Curious as they please.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can I omit a Method proposed to the <hi>Society</hi> by some ingenious Well-wisher to their Designs, for a farther satisfaction of the Quaerists, this being the proper place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert it. This Gentleman having considered the Fatigue of the <hi>SOCIETY,</hi> in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so many Letters on one Question, sent them a Project for their Ease, which they have publish'd in the Preface to their Fourth Volume, and there approv'd of it; 'tis thus.——<hi>That every Quaerist set two Letters to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Question he sends, and some number, consisting of three Figures, thus——A. B.</hi> 231, or <hi>A. C.</hi> 312, <hi>B. H.</hi> 132, <hi>H. I.</hi> 721, <hi>R. N.</hi> 472, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it is not likely that any two should light upon the same Letters, and Numbers too; so that if they are publicly acknowledged in the Mercuries to be received, by inserting the Letters, and Numbers, with those marks at the end of each, the Quaerists would soon be satisfied, <hi>viz.</hi> those marked thus (*) will never be answered, as coming under some of the above-mentioned Exceptions: Those marked thus (+) have been answered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Vol. n. Those marked thus (†) will be answered in their order.</p>
               <p>Having thus given the Reader a View of the Design of the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> and the Method they propos'd to themselves, and others, I shall now proceed in that form I have set down in the beginning of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part.</p>
               <p>A Paper entituled the <hi>Athenian Gazette resolving, weekly, all the most nice, and curious Questions, proposed by the Ingenious, dated</hi> Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day March <hi>the 17th,</hi> 1690, was the first Essay of this <hi>Noble Undertaking,</hi> that the World was gratified with: Which, tho' it were the Performance of one only, as I have said, yet gave the critical part of the Town as great a satisfaction in what it contain'd, as it did admiration at the strangeness and seeming-impossibility of the Attempt. This satisfaction was so general, that in the <hi>third Number,</hi> I find Quaeries came in so fast, that publick notice was given to send in no more, till those were dispatched, that were sent already: An evident Argument, that the number of those that sent had some Belief, that the <hi>Society</hi> were able to comply with their desires, else it had been foolish to have been at the Expence of writing, and sending. In the second number the Title is altered, from <hi>Gazette,</hi> to <hi>Meroury,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which they give in their Twelfth, in Answer to this Question.—<hi>What is the Reason of your changing the Name of your <hi>Athenian Gazette,</hi> into that of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Mercury? Gaza</hi>
                  </hi> (says the Author) <hi>signifies a Treasury, and therefore we reserve it for the general Title of our Volumes, designing to entitle them, the <hi>Athenian Gazette,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suistical Mercury:</hi> And <hi>Mercurius</hi> signifying a Messenger, is the more proper Title for the single Papers, which run about, to Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, and elsewhere, to seek out <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as this Undertaking was too great for any one man to go through with (yet if any one man could, the first Author did enough to convince us of his Ability to do it) it was thought fit, both for Ease, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch, and the fuller Satisfaction of all men, to receive in several Members to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a just number, for compleating the Undertaking, by having men qualified with all sorts of Learning, that so all sorts of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions might receive just Answers. I presume it will not be ingrateful to any Reader, if I here give him an account of the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the several Members (though there is scarce one of them, but what might be call'd a Master in every Science) which make up this <hi>Learned Society.</hi> I shall therefore set them down in that order the nature of their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in my Opinion, requires, without any regard to the particular Merit of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to which I must (with a great deal of regret) confess my self a Stranger, though I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103661:9"/>
have had an imperfect account of some of them, from those that did pretend to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them.</p>

               <p>The last four are rather Servants, than Members of <hi>the Society,</hi> like the Interpreters of Princes, to give a faithful account of such Quaeries that may be sent in their several Languages, that the <hi>Society</hi> may come up to the just Thoughts of the Quaerists, and also to give a perfect Translation of those several pieces of Wit, and Learning, which, I have said, were brought from beyond Sea, to be delivered to us in our Mother-tongue: From these the Society can be fully satisfied in the Idioms, and nicest parts of each Language, which few but the Natives (and of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Learned) understand. So careful they are of giving their own Country the genuine Sence, as well as Marrow of all the stranger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Authors they make free of our Tongue.</p>
               <p>The other eight afford so ample and so just a Theme of Praise, that nothing but my <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of them, can hinder me from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World a more particular knowledg of them: And this confines me much against my Will to the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Physician,</hi> and <hi>Mathematician,</hi> tho' I shall have occasion, in the pursuit of this Discourse, to touch upon the Performances of most, ifnot all of the rest.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Divinity</hi> is the most sublime, and sacred of Studies, so I think my self obliged to begin with the <hi>Divine,</hi> and I am satisfied that the rest of this <hi>Learned <hi>Society,</hi>
                  </hi> will subscribe to this just Preference, I give him, if not for the veneration of his Character, yet for his own proper <hi>Merits;</hi> so great is the <hi>Reverence</hi> of his Person, the Profoundness of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, not only in the Holy Scriptures, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Fathers, and the rest, that compose that mighty <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Theology,</hi> but also in every other <hi>Art,</hi> that comes within the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Liberal,</hi> the most barren Subject growing fertile, and divertive, to admiration, by the <hi>Genial warmth</hi> of his <hi>WIT.</hi> How great, and apparent are his Zeal and Abilities in the direction of <hi>Souls:</hi> How extraordinary, and how general is the satisfaction he gives the <hi>Doubtful,</hi> and <hi>Troubled in Mind!</hi> how strong! how invincible is the Reason, with which he confirms the wavering, and confutes the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> of this <hi>Profligate Age!</hi> Then, what can farther contribute to the Progress, of Piety, and Learning, than the <hi>Manly sweetness</hi> of his <hi>Style,</hi> for whate'er he writes is <hi>soft</hi> without <hi>Affectation,</hi> and <hi>Satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> without <hi>Pedantry.</hi> Yet if all these <hi>Vertues</hi> were wanting, the affability, and agreeableness of his <hi>Temper,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> the tender Compassion he has for the Sufferings, of his fellow-Creatures (above the consideration of which all his stupendious Learning, and Parts, are not able to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport him) both in spiritual, and temporal Exigencies, were enough to draw as great a Veneration from all, as is lawful to pay to <hi>Man.</hi> Finally, since <hi>Actions</hi> are more valuable, than Words, his <hi>Deeds</hi> give a nobler, and truer Character of him, than I can presume, with the inability, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my <hi>Pen,</hi> to draw. All that I shall therefore add, is, that if it were possible that any such thing could be, as an UNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAL PRIEST, certainly his <hi>Duty</hi> would be to take care of the spiritual Good of <hi>all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> and then, I am very certain, that <hi>None</hi> would be more <hi>worthy,</hi> and <hi>more justly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> than HE, who has beforehand shewn, in all his <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> so <hi>universal</hi> a Concern, and <hi>Zeal</hi> for all, that bear the glorious Image, of his MAKER. So truly apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical are his Inclinations, that all <hi>Pains,</hi> all <hi>Labor,</hi> all <hi>Watchings,</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> tho for the most inconsiderable of men, are far more delightful to him than <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> to the <hi>Ambitious,</hi> Wealth to the Miser, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the Voluptuous, nay, than the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of his Mistriss to the faithful, and long-sighing Lover: But all these fleeting Joys, which so dazzle, and invite the World, are too little, too inconsiderable to give a just Idea of that of His, which makes a near approach to those, <hi>it has not entered into the Heart of Man to imagine.</hi> It were to be wisht, that a great many of the Clergy would have him in view, as a sure direction of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, since an imitation of his <hi>practical Virtues,</hi> would soon remove the <hi>Odium,</hi> too great a number of them lye under, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the prophane Enemies of that SACRED BODY, by the most prevalent of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, EXAMPLE.</p>
               <p>All these Excellencies were very well known to Mr. <hi>Dunton,</hi> so that he could not imagine any one more fit to propose this Design first to, than him, who being not a little sensible of the Benefit, the generality would reap by it, gave him all the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in the World, that is, a <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Assistance, when he had once set it on foot; for, 'twas fit first to see, whether the Town would relish the <hi>Blessing</hi> with that Justice, and Applause it deserv'd.</p>
               <p>Tho' this Discourse be not designed as a <hi>Panegyric,</hi> but History, yet I cannot prevail with my self to think this short account of some of the Members of this SOCIETY any deviation, or digression; or if it were, yet I cannot (and I am sure all, that love Learning, and Ingenuity will easily forgive, if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it) pass over the <hi>Physician,</hi> tho', I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, it would be more prudent, and pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to say nothing than not enough of an illustrious Subject, but as, <hi>Who was ever in Love, and Wise?</hi> is received as a just Excuse, for the Failings of a Lover, so I hope, the more moderate, will grant me, that it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103661:10"/>
equally hard to admire, and be silent, when the <hi>Object</hi> of ones admiration presents it self.</p>
               <p>It was said of a certain Great man, that if all the Libraries in the World were lost, and not one Book remaining, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Knowledg He was Master of, was capable of teaching Mankind, all the Arts, and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in perfection, the same I can with Truth, and Justice say of the <hi>Physician,</hi> who carries the whole Circle of <hi>the</hi> Sciences in his Head; but that which is most admirable, and rare in one of his Profession, KNOWLEDGE, and WIT, <hi>make him not prophane; Piety,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> illustrate all his actions. Never was any Question propos'd by ingenious <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Curiosity,</hi> however <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>surprizing,</hi> but with all the <hi>readiness,</hi> and <hi>facility</hi> in the World, he gave not only fair, and amusing <hi>Ideas</hi> of it, but full, and most <hi>evident Demonstrations.</hi> It is no satisfaction at all to me to meet with Wit, and Learning, in a man of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>low Soul,</hi> and <hi>ill Principle,</hi> because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand how he, that has a just noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things, should not make a better choice, for the regulation of his Mind; so I am won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ravished, with Delight, when I find the contrary, as here in this <hi>Great,</hi> this <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> this <hi>Good,</hi> and this <hi>Ingenious Man;</hi> for, he is so generous (<hi>a very uncommon Virtue</hi>) that he could never be prevailed with, to admit of any other Consideration, for his Trouble, in this Affair, than the Good of the <hi>Public,</hi> thinking it so much below him to mingle Interest with so <hi>noble a Design,</hi> that I am confident it would be the only certain way to make him forsake it, to press any Reward, besides what it contains in itself, for, <hi>Virtue is its own Reward, in his Opinion:</hi> Yet he is far from condemning those, whose Circumstances (too often the Fate of the Ingenious) will not allow them to imitate him in this <hi>Generosity,</hi> since 'tis confessed very lawful for any man, to live by his PEN, as well as any other way. Besides, many great Divines, who, we may justly suppose, have the Good of many in their Eyes, do yet set no small, or inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value on their <hi>Copies;</hi> tho' it must be granted, that he excells them as much in this, as a free Agent does a mercinary one. I can say no more of him, than that he is a worthy Companion of so great a man, as the <hi>Divine,</hi> I have spoke of just before him.</p>
               <p>All that I have to inform the World of the Mathematician, is, that he is the Person that first put the design in execution, whom I mention'd in the First Part; and I shall only add here, that his Learning is as univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, as his Sence of things is <hi>fine,</hi> and <hi>curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> So that this <hi>Society</hi> seems to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by something more than human Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in selecting able men, since each of them is sufficient to perform this mighty task alone.</p>
               <p>By what has been said of these three <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> we may reasonably suppose, that the rest are not ill match'd. And, as in the search of the Secrets of Nature we illustrate the more obscure, by the more evident, so here we may, by those I have been able to get some account of, ghess at the Excellence of the rest, the greatest part of which will not accept of any pecuniary Gratuity at all.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Society</hi> being composed of <hi>such</hi> pious, and generous, as well as learned men, I wonder what <hi>they</hi> could propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who endeavour'd to tempt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to forsake the first Undertaker, on a poor mercenary Consideration. Could they imagine, that <hi>such</hi> men would be guilty of so much <hi>Baseness,</hi> as to forget that Obligation they had enter'd into (for, I am inform'd, they obliged themselves never to engage in the like Design for any one else) never to desert Mr. <hi>Dunton?</hi> Could they have so weak an Opinion of that <hi>Worth</hi> they courted, as to press an Action upon it, which must necessarily fully all its Glories, and make it of no value? But these men had nothing in their Thoughts, but the supplanting their Neighbor, in his right, they would else have foreseen the Answer, they without doubt receiv'd, <hi>That if it were an Immorality, nay, Injustice for another, though never concern'd with Mr. <hi>Dunton,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with his design, because it was entirely his <hi>own</hi> Project; how much more ungenerous would it be for them, who have enter'd into a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with him to betray that Trust he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in them, when he might (had it not been for the Esteem, and Value he had for their Iustice, and Parts) have engaged those that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would have proved more generous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vast Offers that have been made them, with no Success, shews, that Mr. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> knew his men very well, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver else have had the Courage, through all Difficulties, and Oppositions, to have persu'd the Design, till in spight of all Obstacles he established it; which if he had never done, there had been no <hi>Motive</hi> for Interloping, few being willing to quit the Paths of Just, and Right, where no Advantage invites. Nor is it to be wonder'd in our Age, that, when he had rais'd his Project to a <hi>Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> others have endeavour'd to rob him of his Profit, when they were at no Charge to bring it to perfection, who would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have regarded it, if it had been first proposed to them. Thus, I am confident, few Booksellers in Town would have given Ten pound for the Copy of <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> before it had been printed at all, yet now there is none, but would give an Hundred pound for it: They whose Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness hinder them from venturing upon any thing themselves, are alwaies very eager to pursue, what another with success has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken. But these interloping Gentlemen were extreamly deceiv'd, when they made their Applications here, where they alwaies found men that knew the Obligation, and Value of their Word better than to forfeit it for that which they never osteem'd, that is a little <hi>mean Lucre,</hi> and <hi>trifling Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103661:10"/>Having thus given the World an hasty Sketch, of the Qualifications of the Members, I shall return to their Undertaking.</p>
               <p>It would, I believe, be superfluous to dwell upon the Antiquity, and easie Method of teaching by Question, and Answer, since <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> in his <hi>Tusculan</hi> Questions, approves of it as the most useful, and ancient: And <hi>Plato</hi> practis'd it; nay, we find in the Tenth Chapter of the first Books of <hi>Kings, that the Queen of</hi> Sheba, <hi>went to prove</hi> Solomon, <hi>with hard Questions.</hi> I shall therefore say no more for the Proof of its Antiquity, since every one that considers it, must soon observe how much it will contribute to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowledge, when all the several Heads of the Nation, at least all those that love Enquiries, are busied to find out the most difficult, and least-understood things, for the <hi>Society</hi> to resolve, which could no other ways be effected, but by Quaeries and Answers.</p>
               <p>The Design being form'd into these methods I have describ'd, and the <hi>Society</hi> now establish'd, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ecessary, that they should have a certain time, and place of meeting together, for their mutual Conversation, but chiefly, for consulting altogether, on every Answer before it was permitted to be published: <hi>Smith's Coffee-house,</hi> for the convenience of its situation, in the middle way of all their Abodes, was the first place agreed on for this, and <hi>Friday</hi> the day; but, finding that House too public, by the great number that flock'd thither, on purpose to hear, and see the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that being appointed for the reception of all the Quaeries, the <hi>Society</hi> thought fit, for the greater Privacy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to some other place, since their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty never aim'd at their own Personal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Performances, as is evident by their concealment of their Names all along, with so much Regret to all those whose admiration of what they had writ, would not let them think it sufficient to converse on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their Papers.</p>
               <p>There is such a desire of being known, in most Writers, that they all have that beginning of the first Copy of Verses in <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in their Heads</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>What shall I do to be for ever known,</l>
                  <l>And make the Age to come my own?</l>
               </lg>
               <p>that the Author of <hi>The whole Duty of Man,</hi> was almost the singular Example of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Nominal</hi> Fame, till this <hi>Learned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> put in for his Rivals in that noble Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial; yet neither can, with all their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, avoid that Reputation the World pays, even to themselves, since every one imitates the <hi>Athenians</hi> of old, erecting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Minds Trophies to the unknown Worthies, as they did Altars, in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the <hi>unknown Deity.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Swift,</hi> in his Ode to this Society (printed before the Fifth Supplement) concludes very well;</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>—How strange a Paradox is true!</l>
                  <l>That men who liv'd, and dy'd without a Name</l>
                  <l>Are the chief Heroes in the sacred List of Fame.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But, tho' the World continue ignorant of the Names of these Gentlemen, yet it is highly sensible of the Advantages it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and is still likely to receive from their Performances, into which I shall now enquire.</p>
               <p>There are no greater Enemies to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Learning, than <hi>vulgar Errors,</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> (if they will admit of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and are not the same) as long as the first remain, Men go upon a wrong Principle, rejecting all that may seem to oppose that, which they have received, and settled within themselves, as TRUTH, by so reverend, and awful an Authority, as <hi>Immemorial Tradition,</hi> which they look upon, as the diligent Observations of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, a Name that has alwaies been of too great a Veneration with most Ages, and by that has proved the irresistable Patron of an abundance of Absurdities, especially in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy: And there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that no man can possibly arrive to any true, and sound Knowledge, till such false Guides are remov'd, which led him out of his way. I am confident, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>other</hi> prevails, there is not much likelihood of any considerable Progress in Wisdom; for, 'tis the <hi>Mist,</hi> or rather <hi>Night</hi> of the Mind, in which the Judgment wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders after the deceitful glimmerings of an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or else fears, and shuns every Light of Truth as such, knowing no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt these two Extreams. These Ills are indeed inseparable Companions; for, <hi>vulgar Errors</hi> alwaies beget <hi>Superstition,</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> cannot subsist without <hi>vulgar Errors.</hi> One is the Tree, the other the Fruit: <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Errors</hi> are the Springs which feed the <hi>Stream</hi> of <hi>Superstition,</hi> and till <hi>those</hi> are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, 'tis not to be expected, <hi>that</hi> will cease to flow.</p>
               <p>This Learned SOCIETY seems to have been very sensible of this, by the great care they have taken, in confuting those erroneous Notions, which are commonly received, as often as they presented themselves in any of the numerous Quaeries that have been sent them: And they have very well observ'd, that there are a great many omitted by the ingenious Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> which are, in my opinion, as necessary to be remov'd, as any he has observ'd. I shall mention a few particulars, <hi>viz. That a Coal is to be found under a Plantane Root, at one time of the year, more than another: That these later Ages are more ignorant than their Predecessors, and that we find out no such useful <hi>Arts</hi> as our Forefathers have done.</hi> This the <hi>Society</hi> have very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, and clearly removed, which tho' I cannot omit, yet the Brevity I am confined to obliges me to contract: The most invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103661:11"/>
which they have taken in the decision of this point, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>The invention of <hi>Useful Arts</hi> is either <hi>infinite</hi> or <hi>finite;</hi> if the first, we must conclude (by Experience) that at length growing too numerous, some would be lost, and supplanted by others, which would not be, if the <hi>first</hi> were more useful:—If <hi>finite,</hi> they can be but once invented, and then our Ancestors have only the advantage of having lived before us; for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we see daily made on former Inventions, give us reason to believe, that if we had lived before them, we should have done no less. They prove farther, that none of those Inventions the World enjoys was found out by One, or at once. That the <hi>Myrmecides</hi> of <hi>Aelian,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> with his Ivory Chariot, with Horses, and all in so small a compass as to be covered by the Wings of a Fly, was outdone, in the Twentieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by <hi>Marc Scaliot,</hi> in his Chain of Gold drawn by a Flea, and his Lock and Key made of Steel, weighing but a Grain. And I must add, that the Ship of <hi>Myrmecides</hi> was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by a Gentleman of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who not only made one much less, but also gave a Motion to it.

               <p>'Tis a <hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>general Error,</hi> that <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Deceiver is no Deceit;</hi> which is very well remov'd in the Twentieth Number, and Tenth Question of the Second Volume. 'Tis a no less common Opinion, <hi>That Men dream of things they never thought of;</hi> which in the Seventeenth Number, of the Second Volume, and in the third Quaery, they confute in this manner. <q>They deny it to be possible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in a <hi>Divine Dream,</hi> where both the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Notion,</hi> should be revealed together. They grant, that the Fancy has Power to joyn things together, when they are before in the <hi>Mind,</hi> or to create Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and <hi>Chymeras</hi> out of <hi>real things, sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as well as <hi>waking.</hi> For example I have the Notion of <hi>my self,</hi> a <hi>Horse,</hi> a <hi>Road, Thieves, Water, Air, Fire,</hi> a <hi>House, Day, Night,</hi> or whatever else you'l name, treasured up in my <hi>Memory:</hi> These my <hi>Fancy</hi> may shuffle together, and so represent such <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> as I never thought of in the Day-time. But they deny that there is any Imaginary Transaction that passes in our Sleep, but we have all thought of the several parts, and things which go to the composing of it, though perhaps not in the same order as there.</q> For the Reader's farther satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let him consult the place above quoted, and there he will find full, and ingenious Arguments for a farther proof of this.</p>
               <p>To run through all that they have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this nature, would make my Book swell beyond its designed bulk. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pass over those curious Confutations of that Error, so commonly receiv'd, <hi>That a dead Corps bleeds when touched by the Murderer;</hi> which they have treated of, both in the Second, and Sixth Volumes.

I have not room to repeat all those witty, and ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments they produce to obviate that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notion, That a man cannot be twice in Love,</hi> Vol. 2, Num. 6, and Quaery 3. for the <hi>ingenious</hi> discussion of which, as well as of many more, I must referr the Curious to their Works, only I cannot omit mentioning two, or three out of many which have a nearer relation to <hi>Superstition.</hi> 'Tis true, Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> has taken notice of most of these (tho' not all) but yet the Advantage to the Public is no less, than if they had been the original Remarks of the Society, since they communicate them to the <hi>many,</hi> who are most concerned in them, the Learned being generally now pretty free from those sordid Trifles.</p>

               <p>As to to the second Branch of this Quaery <q>—<hi>Man's Happiness, &amp;c.</hi> 'tis as false as the other, if taken all together: That he had never died without <hi>Sin,</hi> is granted; but it follows not, that if he had not <hi>died,</hi> he had not been <hi>glorified,</hi> since like <hi>Enoch</hi> he might have been translated to Glory.</q>

               <p>But to clear the first Branch of this Quaery a little farther; <q>First, if God ordained not <hi>Sin,</hi> how came it into the World?

               <p>Here I cannot omit the <hi>Millenium,</hi> Volume the Fourth, Num. 6. tho I can say no more of it, but that it was done by the same Hand, and by consequence the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which abounds in this I have touched upon, will be found in that Question; and this I can assure the Reader, he will find no small Pleasure in the perusal of it, there is such a <hi>clearness</hi> of Thought, and Expression, as well as greatness of Learning, and Reason, for he proves it from many places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as well as the Testimony of the most ancient of the Fathers, that is of the first, and second Century, as <hi>Papias, Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Polycarp, Clemens,</hi> and afterward <hi>Iraeneus, Lactantius, Tertullian, Methodius,</hi> and still lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, St. <hi>Cyprian, Nepos, Apollinarius.</hi> Not that the words of all these Fathers are quoted in the Mercury, which would take up a whole Volume, as the Author observes, but he affirms them to be of the same Opinion as <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Methodius</hi> whose words he inserts.</p>
               <p>I would also recommend those that are curious in <hi>Controversial Divinity,</hi> to peruse what another Member of this <hi>Society</hi> has performed against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> proving <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptism,</hi> by the holy Scriptures, and primitive practice of the Church, beyond the weak, and ridiculous Efforts of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to answer. For a confirmation of what I here avow, consult the fourteenth Mercury of the fourth Volume, the eighteenth of the same Volume, and the last twelve Numbers of the fifth Volume, where you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>l find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd what I have said, that this <hi>Society</hi> is composed of men of such general Learning, that each could finish the mighty Task alone; for this Controversie was carried on by the same who first began this <hi>Noble Design,</hi> and this I hope will prevent the Enemies of this <hi>Society</hi> from charging me with <hi>Flattery,</hi> when I shew such weighty Grounds for what I say.</p>
               <p>Tho' this be an Age that delights not much in Accounts of this nature, relating to <hi>Religion,</hi> yet I must so far trespass upon the <hi>Wits,</hi> as to add a word, or two, on their <hi>practical</hi> Divinity, for there is not a greater Vein of Piety runs through all their Writings than in all their Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Endeavours to render other mens actions of the like Perfection: And this will appear from their Mercuries, which endeavoured with Reason, and Argument to second the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Government in the several ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Papers which treat of the <hi>present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Reformation;</hi> as Numb. 2. of the 2d Volume; where not only the reasonableness of bringing such a <hi>Reformation</hi> about is clear'd, but also Methods proposed for the better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it: Though I believe neither they, nor indeed the <hi>Government,</hi> did ever imagine to bring it to that Perfection, that it should affect all <hi>Degrees, Sects,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> for that is a moral Impossibili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Any one that has ever read St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin's Confessions,</hi> will easily perceive (if he be so happy to be free from personal Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) how a <hi>Habit cloggs the Soul, and pinions its Wings,</hi> that it may not fly toward its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Creator, by the help of long abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Virtue. Oh how often did it tugg, and pull back St. <hi>Austin,</hi> with a thousand world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Considerations! How did it lay open all its gilded Baits, and struggle for a long time with the powerful Grace which God sent to his assistance! But as there is no corporeal Disease (if we believe some learned men) for which Nature has not provided a Cure, so much less is there any spiritual Malady, for which God has not provided <hi>an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> Remedy, which our spiritual Physicians (at least those that value their Duty, and know the Obligation of their Character) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to us as our several Distempers require. This the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> have done most admirably well in this difficult point of <hi>Habits.</hi> First, in discovering what a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> is; and next, that it may be overcome, and lastly, the best Methods to do it: For the first two I referr the Reader to the first Number of the third Volume, and shall here only hint upon some of the Heads of the last; as—<hi>An Habit alwaies has its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and may be broke by the use of those Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which constitute its Contrary, or by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Occasions by which it is encreased and continued.</hi> As for example; <q>A Fire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by Water, or by not supplying it with Fuel; for <hi>Drunkenness, Whoring,</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, &amp;c.</hi> the Cure is by practising the constitutive parts of Temperance, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity; or else by flying Occasions, in these cases the <hi>Parthian</hi> Discipline is best, <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by flying;</hi> other Remedies are prèscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the same place, as communicating ones Failings to a Friend, especially a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, whose Advice, and Prayers may not a little assist: And here the prescriptions must be observed unfeignedly, and not used as some do those of <hi>Doctors,</hi> flinging them away, tho they pretend to have taken them, since in spiritual <hi>Sickness,</hi> without taking the <hi>Medicine,</hi> there can be no Cure. As great a Step as can be made in this Affair, is to get <hi>a true-informed Iudgment, the Act of knowing things as they really are in their own Nature, and the business is almost done to their Hands.</hi>

               <p>This I have insisted the more upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of general use, and therefore, I hope, those who have a desire to take to the Paths of Virtue from a Habit of Vice, will consult the <hi>Mercury</hi> I have quoted, which will not a little contribute to their Ease and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Divinity</hi> I shall place <hi>Philosophy,</hi> as approaching next in Dignity. Here their Performances have been no less extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as will appear from the beginning of their Undertaking, where the most difficult, and sublime things have met with a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the very first <hi>Mercury</hi> we find no less than the <hi>Eternity of the Soul</hi> decided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the second, the <hi>cause of the Sea spouts</hi> given, and the <hi>cause of saline quality of the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> In the third, even the <hi>cause of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</hi>

               <p>This is a Question which has given a great deal of Fatigue to the Learned of all Ages, and some will have it, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> died with Grief, because he could not find it out, others, that he flung himself into the Sea, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">Si non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum capere re, tu cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>If I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thee, thou shalt contain me.</hi> The Opinions of it were as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as the Philosophers that handled it; to omit the rest, <hi>Plato</hi> held, that the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> proceeded from certain Gulphs in the bottom of the Sea, which like <hi>Squirts</hi> suck'd in the Water first, and then spouted it out again. <hi>Apollinus Tyanaeus</hi> (who was extreamly well skilled in <hi>Spirits,</hi> if we believe <hi>Philostratus,</hi> in the Life of that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher) will needs have it, that certain <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> at the bottom of the vast <hi>Deep,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually puffing, and blowing, which gives motion to the Waves, and causes the ebbing, and flowing. Others held, that there were some Fires under the Waves, which made it boil like a Pot, and that when that Fire went out, the Sea ebb'd. Some of equal Absurdity, think the Sea to be (or rather contain) a <hi>great Animal,</hi> and that as it turns, and moves from side to side, it causes the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing. There have not been a few that have held the Moon to be the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of this Motion: Others (among which number, if I mistake not, <hi>Galilaeus</hi> is Chief) are of opinion, that the <hi>Sun,</hi> as it gives Motion to the other parts of the <note n="*" place="margin">Dans cuncta m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There is another Opinion built upon this <hi>Systeme,</hi> which is this; That the diurnal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the <hi>Earth,</hi> upon its own <hi>Axis,</hi> is the only cause of the Flux, and Reflux of the Sea; for as other Waters, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in Pipes, will rise to as great a height as the place from whence they first descend; so these of the Sea, upon the descent (if we can term any part of that Motion so, which has an equal reference to, and distance from the Center) of the Earth flow down, as <hi>far</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:103661:13"/>
as the Shore permits, but being there stop'd, rebound up again as much the other way; which is the ebb, and flowing. But this is no less absurd than any of the rest I have inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for, first, if this were the cause, there could be no such variety of Tides, as is well known, since the Earth turns upon its own Axis, in an equal space of time, as well as with an equal, even, and constant motion, without any rub: So that we are to seek in the most difficult part of this wonderful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion still: For, How comes it to pass, that the Tide flows some fathoms more in some places than in others, and that constantly, and therefore not caus'd by any accidental Wind driving in upon that Shore? But there remains, as great a difficulty as to the cause of the seven times flowing of the <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> in a day. Lastly, if there be such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent in the motion of the Earth, as to make the Waters fall down to the brim, as I may call it, then by the same Rule, they would fall out when that part of the Globe came, to be perpendicular downward; for, if there be a descent, there must be a lowest part of that descent, and then what I have urg'd would infallibly follow. 'Twould be endless to run through <hi>all</hi> the Absurdities of this last, as well as those of the other opinions I have related, which might well follow, when they never considered all the Consequences of the Doctrin they advanc'd. The <hi>Society,</hi> in their third Mercury, decides the Question with more Reason, and Certainty, in this manner. <q>—What is the reason of the <hi>Suns</hi> motion, but the necessary Law of the <hi>Creation,</hi> or the first-establish'd Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For; had the Sun been fixt in any one part of the Element, the opposite part of the Earth would have been burnt up, and all the rest frozen, and consequently the whole Globe of Earth rendered unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of fructifying. And as the motion of the Sun was necessary in the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for all those Beings that depend upon it, so it was equally necessary that the Sea should have a particular <hi>Commission,</hi> or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from its Creator (the only efficient Cause) for a <hi>Flux,</hi> and <hi>Reflux,</hi> else it would have stagnated, and corrupted, and by consequence unfit for <hi>Procreation of Fishes,</hi> and Navigation.</q> For the Objections which are or can be raised against this, consult the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and there you will find them answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your full satisfaction.</p>
               <p>But if you require some more immediate cause of this Motion of the Waves, Vol. 5, Numb. 6, Quest. 2, referrs you to an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Book, writ by a Member of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> called, <hi>The Visions of Souls before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Body;</hi> and in the 23d Dialogue of that Book you will find your Curiosity answered in a most witty and surprizing manner, I must needs say, the whole Book is an extraordinary Piece of <hi>refined Notions, entertaining Wit,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>well-digested Learning,</hi> and indeed, too much above the Capacities of most of our English Readers, to sell well; for if it were but understood, I am confident; nothing that this Age has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced would be more grateful to the Curious: And if it were translated into French, that Nation would value it, and be sensible, that the <hi>English</hi> had as noble, and speculative a Genius, as any of them; but the Humour of most men, and some that pretend a little to sence, is to give censure of a thing according to the Vogue, tho' they never saw it themselves, tho' perhaps (as I am sure in this case 'tis true) <hi>that</hi> proceeded from the Ignorant, (which being the more numerous, make up the Cry) or those at least who did not understand it.</p>
               <p>But what can be more fine than their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse upon <hi>Individuation!</hi> A point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd by the great Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> (as they observe) of the most <hi>nice,</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> nature. I shall transcribe it, because there can be no Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation so well done, but it must be an Injury to its Excellence.</p>
               <p>The Question is this:—<hi>What is <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation,</hi> or wherein consists the Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>———It may n't be improper (pursues the Author, for I omit the Preface of it, which is a kind of an Apology, because I think it needs none) to run through the different Orders of <hi>visible Beings,</hi> and search them all for a distincter Idea of it [<hi>than the Schools afford.</hi>] To begin with those Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Body, which are not properly orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd, and have neither Life, nor Sense, as Stones, Metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in these <hi>Individuation</hi> seems to consist in nothing but greater, or lesser: Take the less part of a <hi>Stone</hi> away, you may still call it the same Stone: Like an equal part with the Remains, that <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation</hi> ceases, and they are two <hi>new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals:</hi> Divide a Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as long as you please, every part of it will be a <hi>Stone</hi> still, another <hi>individual Stone,</hi> as much as any in the Mountains, or Quarry 'twas first cut out of, even tho' reduc'd to the minutest Sand, or, if possible, a thousand times less. But when we take one step farther, and proceed a degree higher, to the <hi>Vegetable Kingdom,</hi> the Case is far otherwise, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Nature seems to be still more distinct, and as it were careful in its <hi>Individuation,</hi> the higher it rises, till at last it brings us to that great <hi>Transcendental Individual,</hi>—the only proper <hi>uncompounded Essence,</hi>—the One God blessed for ever. To return to Plants,—their <hi>Individuation</hi> consists in their singular <hi>form, contexture,</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of their Parts, whereby they are disposed for those uses to which Nature has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them, and by which they receive and maintain their Beings. For example, a <hi>Tree,</hi> from whence tho' you take the Branches, it grows, receives Nourishment from the Earth, maintains itself, and is still a <hi>Tree;</hi> which the parts thereof are not, when separated from the rest; for we can't say e'ery part of a Tree is a Tree, as we can of a Stone, e'ery part of a Stone is still a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103661:14"/>
Stone. But now,—if this Tree be cloven in two, or more pieces, or fell'd by the Roots, this <hi>Contexture,</hi> or <hi>orderly Respect</hi> of the Parts each to other, ceases; its <hi>Essence,</hi> as a <hi>Tree</hi> is destroy'd, its <hi>Individuation</hi> peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and 'tis no more a <hi>Tree,</hi> but a <hi>Stump,</hi> or a piece, or pieces of Timber. Let's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a degree higher to meerly <hi>sensible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> who are not so immediately depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on <hi>Earth,</hi> the common Mother, as <hi>Plants,</hi> nor rooted to it, and as it were a part of it, as they are, but walk about, have, in respect of that, an <hi>Independent Existence,</hi> and are a sort of Worlds by themselves: And here the <hi>Individuation</hi> consists in such a particular <hi>Contexture</hi> of their <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Parts,</hi> and their relation one toward another, as enables them to exert, the Operations of the sensible, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life. Thus cut off the Leggs, or any other parts of an Animal, 'tis the same Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal still; but cut off its Head, or take away its Life, and 'tis no longer that individual Animal, but a meer Carcass, and will by degrees resolve into common matter again, or rather be transmigrated into some other <hi>form.</hi> To ascend now to the highest Rank of <hi>visible Beings,</hi> the <hi>Rational;</hi> the Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Man appears to us, to consist in the <hi>Union</hi> of that <hi>thinking Substance,</hi> which we call the <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> with any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Portion of <hi>fitly-organiz'd Matter,</hi> we hope 'tis no <hi>Heresie</hi> to assert, that any <hi>Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Matter</hi> duly qualified, and united to the Soul by such a Union, as we expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, tho' we cannot well explain, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately individuated by it, and together with that <hi>Soul,</hi> makes a <hi>Man:</hi> So that if it were possible for one Soul to be cloathed over and over, at different times, with all the <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>Universe,</hi> it would in all those distinct shapes be the same <hi>Individual Man.</hi> Nor can a man be supposed, in this case, to differ more from himself than he does when he's an Infant, and just past an <hi>Embrio</hi> from <hi>himself,</hi> when of Adult, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit Age, he having in that line changed his Portion of Matter over, and over; has been fat, and lean, sick, and well, lost by Bleeding, Excrement, Perspiration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gained again by Aliment, and perhaps not one Particle, or but very few of the <hi>First Matter,</hi> which he took from his Parents, and brought with him into the World, now remaining.</q>

               <p>There are other Questions relating to the Soul, which I have not set down in this place, the Brevity I am confin'd to not only denying me that, but also room to make any mention of what other Philosophical Questions they have answer'd. I must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desire the Reader to supply this defect in me, by consulting their general <hi>Index,</hi> which will be publish'd suddenly in an alphabetical order, as they have given public notice; there they will not only find what I have omitted, but also all other <hi>Questions</hi> relating to the <hi>Mathematics, Physic, Law, Criticisms, Anatomy,</hi> and all the other Branches of their Promise of answering all manner of <hi>Questions</hi> in e'ery Science, and Art, if of any Use, or Advantage, general, or particular; for, I shall only here give a short Direction to two or three in each Science. For <hi>Mathematical Questions</hi> therefore consult Vol. 1. N. 5. Q. 5. &amp; N. 15. Q. 3, of the same Volume, and Num. 4. Q. 7, of the Sixth Volume. For <hi>Physic</hi> see V. 1. N. 15.

               <p>I am sure the <hi>Wits</hi> will think it high time for me to dismiss these grave, and sublimer Subjects, and to come nearer their <hi>Province;</hi> for I am sensible that <hi>Theology,</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> require too much of <hi>Thought,</hi> and too much strength of <hi>Iudgment,</hi> to be Entertainment agreeable to their <hi>airy</hi> Genius, which relishes nothing but a <hi>trifling Iest,</hi> a <hi>Quibble,</hi> or at most a <hi>pleasant Banter,</hi> as they call it. These Gentlemen are so wholy possessed with the Spirit of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that they may have no cause to think I have quite forgot them, if they will be so complaisant to meet me half way, and give for once a step or two from their eternal <hi>Banter,</hi> to true <hi>Wat,</hi> I will now descend to gratifie these <hi>partial,</hi> and <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> Judges of <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and shew them, that the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unbend from their severer Studies, to make a grateful mixture of the <hi>pleasant</hi> with <hi>profitable,</hi> that they might not give the least cause to any to think their Endeavours any way imperfect: But they make not a Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Delight, or think, that the Life of a

man of <hi>Sence,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> should be taken up with no higher Contemplation, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual view of the lighter Performances of <hi>Wit.</hi> This I must inform these Gentlemen, that they'l seldom find any of these <hi>easier</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says of this <hi>Society</hi> without a just mixture of <hi>Learning,</hi> for that is so much a <hi>Part</hi> of them, that it gives a lasting Beauty to their very Diversions. I shall instance in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, which some (I am pretty sure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration) have been pleased to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their <hi>unintelligible.</hi> Talent of <hi>Banter</hi> upon, I mean the Answer to this <hi>Quaery; Whether <hi>Fleas</hi> have stings, or whether they suck or bite when they draw Blood from the Body?</hi> This <hi>Quaery,</hi> we may see by the Author, was sent by one of the fair Sex, and the Resolution is compos'd not only of true Wit, all the <hi>Similes</hi> being <hi>ex re nata,</hi> not dragg'd from all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Universe, to be cramm'd in by Head, and Shoulders, as those of some men are, who have not gain'd a little Reputation by them, but also of a curious enquiry into the form, and parts of that little, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic Animal, which tho' so common, yet of so wonderful a composure. This I find the first <hi>Quaery</hi> of the 17th Number of the first Volume; which if any true Judge of Wit will consult, I question not but he will with a great deal of readiness subscribe to what I have said of it, and only blame me for the Modesty of my Expression. In the very next Mercury you will meet with a no less entertaining Discourse on this <hi>Quaery; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Beauty</hi> be <hi>real,</hi> or <hi>imaginary?</hi>
                  </hi> The Quaery is nice, but the Answer is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fine. Farther, let the Reader peruse the third, the thirteenth, the fifteenth, and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Numbers of the second Volume: The Subject of the two last I cannot pass over in silence. (1.) <hi>Whether it be lawful for a young Lady to pray for a Husband?</hi> (2.) <hi>A Lady de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to know when she shall have a Husband.</hi> (3.) <hi>Is it better to live single, or marry?</hi> are the three <hi>Quaeries</hi> propos'd in the fifteenth Number, which are answered with that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and Reason, (an Ingredient seldom found in the <hi>Gallymoferies</hi> our Scriblers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dress out for public view) that it cannot but bring the extreamest satisfaction to any one that pretends with any Justice to value himself as a man of Wit, and Sence. The first <hi>Question</hi> of the sixteenth Number I shall say no more of, but that the Reader may see, that as it is of the same nature with the first in the former Number, so it appears to <hi>confess</hi> the same Authors. See farther in this kind Num. 4. and the 13th of the third Vol. and Num. 3. &amp; 13th of the fourth Volume; and several places I have omitted in each Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
               <p>In the fifth, and sixth Volumes I find the <hi>Society</hi> endeavouring a farther <hi>diversion</hi> of the <hi>Witty,</hi> by several Essays in <hi>Poetry,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Quaeries</hi> sent them in Rhime; this being indeed the necessary result of their first. Promises, of answering all manner of <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> In this, as well as in all their other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, the <hi>Society</hi> propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Service of <hi>Religion,</hi> and I hope the <hi>Wits</hi> will not wholy condemn them for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to <hi>Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> at once, since tho' <hi>Quarles</hi> has <hi>scandaliz'd Devotion</hi> with <hi>wretched Verse,</hi> yet <hi>Beaumont</hi>'s <hi>Psyce, &amp;c.</hi> that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poem <hi>Spencer</hi>'s <hi>Fary Queen,</hi> designed an Encomium on all the noble train of Virtues; the <hi>Steps to the Temple,</hi> and other Verses of <hi>Crashaw,</hi> who was commended by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Cowly;</hi> nay, the <hi>Plagues of Egypt,</hi> the Paraphrase on <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and other Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics of <hi>Cowly</hi> himself shew, that <hi>Poetry</hi> is never so elevated, and fine, as when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on Subjects of that nature: Nay, <hi>Virtue</hi> is so far from <hi>not</hi> being the proper Subject of <hi>Poetry,</hi> that nothing else, indeed, is: For, if we believe the best of <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> and examin the <hi>Rules</hi> laid down by them for both <hi>Dramatic,</hi> and <hi>Epic Poesie,</hi> we shall find, that the <hi>aim,</hi> and <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>first,</hi> is to reward <hi>Virtue,</hi> and punish <hi>Vice;</hi> and the <hi>business</hi> of the latter is, not only to draw its <hi>Characters</hi> truly virtuous, but to make them successful, as the Piety of <hi>Aeneas</hi> (and most, if not all of his <hi>Trojan</hi> Companions) in <hi>Virgil,</hi> of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign, Tancred,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">For the Character of <hi>Rinaldo</hi> is Virtuous, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Amour with <hi>Armida,</hi> which was the effect of her Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more than his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this failing, his Prayer on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> before his attaquing the Enchanted Forest, and the rest of his Actions, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie my placing him in this Number.</note> 
                  <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldo, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Tasso,</hi> of <hi>David, Ionathan, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Cowly,</hi> may satisfie: So that I have reason to conclude, that the <hi>Poet,</hi> who pretends to write without this Aim, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant in his Art, or guilty of perverting its <hi>sacred Laws.</hi> All this being thus evident, the more <hi>equal</hi> Readers will, I question not, be very well pleas'd, when they see this <hi>Society</hi> in their Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Mercuries,</hi> in lofty Numbers presenting a <hi>formal Challenge to Uice;</hi> and as two Opposites are best distinguish'd when set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, so here a <hi>Uice</hi> in one Column, and its contrary <hi>Uirtue</hi> in another, must render the first as odious, as it really is, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce, if not the <hi>Beauty,</hi> yet the <hi>Esteem</hi> of the latter. To perform this with the more force, and majesty, the SOCIETY have, with a great deal of Reason, made choice of <hi>Spencer</hi>'s <hi>Stanza:</hi> This new Project for the promotion of Religion is confin'd only to one <hi>Virtue,</hi> and one <hi>Vice</hi> at a time, that the other half of the Paper may be free to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer such Quaeries that are sent them in Verse, as shall any way merit to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
               <p>Before I dismiss this point, I think my self obliged to make some Remarks on the <hi>Poetry</hi> this <hi>Society</hi> have already gratified the World withal, because some, that with no little Ardour aspire to the name <hi>of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> have been pleased to pass none <hi>of</hi> the most favourable Judgments upon it: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess indeed these Sparks are not so kind, as to give us any Reason for their Procedure in this Affair, or to discover those Defects they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103661:15"/>
have found out, supposing that their <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Sentence is sufficient to prove a Guilt; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that may be of great value with those who blindly depend upon their Judgment, but we that are so arogant to believe an <hi>ipse dixit</hi> no proof, must take the liberty to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion their <hi>Decission</hi> as very partial.</p>
               <p>I wish these mighty Critics had given us some Standard for the Excellence of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Verses, or had rang'd them under some of the known Heads, nay tho' they had ran as far as the Division of<note n="*" place="margin">In his Third Book <hi>De optimo statu Civitatis.</hi>

                  <hi>Plato;</hi> for then I cou'd with the more ease have made an examination of them, and have obviated those Objections, they had made, but when Men speak at random, without giving any reason for what they say, it is sufficient to be as positive in our denial as they were in their affirmation, <hi>'tis not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as convincing, as <hi>it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to shew the World that I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to bring the <hi>Poetry</hi> of the Society to the <hi>Test,</hi> I shall, according to what <hi>Standard</hi> I shall think <hi>Iust</hi> (since they have given me none) examine it, with that impartiality which becomes not only an Historian, but a <hi>Critic.</hi> Every one that has ever essay'd any thing in Verse cannot but be sensible of the difficulty of bringing every part to that <hi>decorum</hi> which is necessary for the beauty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that way of writing, without which as<note n="*" place="margin">Ut in vita, sic in ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione nihil est difficili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, quam quid deceat videre: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Horace</hi> in his Art of Poetry, to avoid <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, Trifling, Bombast, meaness</hi> both of thought, and expression, and <hi>affected copiousness,</hi> which is a spining out a Thought into various, and synonimous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and this last <hi>Claudian</hi> is very much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to, notwithstanding the Character <hi>Scaliger,</hi> gives him.</p>
               <p>If we can't find the <hi>Society</hi> guilty of any of these faults I think (by so good an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>Horace</hi>) we may conclude their Poetry ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill'd at without any just reason.

               <p>What can be more <hi>fine,</hi> and sweet than these Verses? What more <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cal?</hi> What more correct? and if at any other time their <hi>Poetical answers</hi> come not up to these, there are several reasons for it. First, because several Queries are sent in <hi>Verse,</hi> which wou'd be more to the purpose in <hi>Prose,</hi> for there are subjects not so proper for Verse. <hi>2dly,</hi> Because they design'd 'em otherwise, as for example <hi>Burlesque,</hi> as the first Query of the <hi>11th.</hi> Number of the <hi>5th.</hi> Volume, which in its kind is very witty, and pleasant; and the <hi>6th.</hi> of the same <hi>Mercury.</hi> But then there are the Answer to the <hi>4th.</hi> Query, and the <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> very fine; and Lastly, when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103661:16"/>
the subject is not so Noble; as that of this, which merited no less, than the <hi>Society</hi> has said of it. I cannot omit an Epigram I find in the <hi>5th.</hi> Number of the <hi>7th.</hi> Volume, which is this,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whatever <hi>Borrow'd Lines</hi> our <hi>Works</hi> have shown,</l>
                  <l>This We dare sware, that <hi>thine</hi> are <hi>all</hi> thy own.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>I find scarce one in <hi>Martial</hi> comparable to this, except, <hi>Pauper Cinna vult videri, &amp; est pauper. Martial</hi> too often playing upon words, which tho' more tolerable in Latin, than English, yet I cannot bring my Palate to relish. The Vertues of an Epigram, are, a <hi>dilucid Shortness,</hi> and an <hi>Acumen,</hi> which is the Soul, Life and Spirit of an Epigram, without which 'tis flat, and insipid, nor can I endure a long Introduction to that, which lies within the narrow compass of a word, or two, the Wit of these being not sufficient to recompence the tediousness of the other, nor cou'd I 'till I saw this ever with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence admit of any thing of that kind in <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole I think that Character which <hi>Iulius Caesar Scaliger</hi> gives of <hi>Claudian,</hi> is justly the due of the Poetical Member of this <hi>Society, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>That he is a great Poet, only has <hi>sometimes</hi> the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being oppress'd with an <hi>unpoetical</hi> Subject, but even then supplies with his <hi>Wit</hi> the defect of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he is Master of a <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py daring,</hi> and a good Iudgment, his Ornaments agreeable, his Language clear, and expressive, his Numbers smooth but not affected, his Thoughts fall naturally in, without force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All I have to add in this point (because I have not room for a long Critical discourse on Poetry) is that they have not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd all the <hi>Beauties of Verse,</hi> but have also had in their eye the very end, and aim of Poetry, which <note n="*" place="margin">1. Aut prodesse volunt, 2. Aut de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectare Poetae. 3. Aut <hi>Simul</hi> &amp; Idoneae, &amp; jucunda dicere vitae.</note> 
                  <hi>Horace</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides into three parts, Pleasure, Profit, and both together: But he concludes the last to be the <note n="*" place="margin">Omne tulit pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, qui miscuit utile dulci.</note> best, which comprizes both the pleasant, and the profitable. Some one of these ends if not <hi>all,</hi> are observable in every Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mercury I have yet seen. In fine, I think; the opinion of one that was so much a Poet as to be Author of those Latin Verses in the <hi>13th.</hi> Numb. of the <hi>6th.</hi> Vol. is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient defence of their Abilities in Poetry, since he, that cou'd write so well must be a competent judge.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude this second Part of this <hi>History,</hi> with a defence of their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance for the <hi>Fair Sex</hi> in Answering their <hi>Queries,</hi> which has been extreamly resented by the <hi>Wits;</hi> and other Emulators of the <hi>Society,</hi> who have themselves in the <hi>13th.</hi> Number of the <hi>3d.</hi> Volume, obviated the main Objections of these Sparks, that hate the <hi>Fair Sex,</hi> because they are their slaves I believe, and 'tis pitty they are not so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to set their Names to their <hi>Queries,</hi> that the Ladies might know their haters. In the Mercury I mention'd there is this Query sent them.—<q>Whether it does not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Credit of the <hi>Athenian Mercury,</hi> that the Authors of it descend to such a pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employment, as to take notice of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine Impertinences?</hi>
                  </q> To which the <hi>Society</hi> answer,—<hi>That they are troubl'd with ten, perhaps an hundred <hi>Masculine Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> for one <hi>Feminine.</hi>
                  </hi> (They might have added this Query to the Number) <hi>Whereas on the other side they have Letters from the Ladies, without the <hi>boasted advantages of Learning,</hi> which are of so great concern, and carry so much weight, that they dare not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considerable <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Thought,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their Answer.</hi> The Society proceeds farther in the same Mercury in this manner,—<hi>For meddling with Questions of <hi>Love, Courtship,</hi> and <hi>Marriage,</hi> we might say, we design'd thereby to mingle the <hi>Dulce,</hi> and the <hi>Utile.</hi>
                  </hi> and a little farther,—<hi>But we scorn to excuse what needs it not, but rather ought to be Gloried in, since tho' some things of this nature, may be <hi>pure Matters of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,</hi> yet there are very many Questions, which not only have an influence, on the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of particular Men, and the peace of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> but ev'n the good, and welfare of larger <hi>Societies,</hi> and the whole <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> which consists of Families, and single Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' this is sufficient to justifie their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the Ladies Queries, to any mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and considering opposer, yet lest the rest shou'd imagine that I beg the Question, and that I take that for granted, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I shall wave the <hi>Word</hi> of this <hi>Society,</hi> that <hi>they have received several weighty Queries,</hi> &amp;c. from them, and prove by undeniable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples both of the present, and the past Ages, that the Women have as Nice a sense of things, and as good Judgments too, as most Men. 'Tis true, that here in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Women</hi> are kept from <hi>all</hi> Learning, as the prophane Vulgar were of old, from the Misteries of the Ancient Religions; and therefore, are not generally so agreeable, in Conversation, to Men of Parts, and Sence, because, a new Dress, Dance, Play, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all they can discourse of, tho' this is far from holding ev'n here in <hi>England</hi> through all, for there are a great many, who in spite of the Tyranny of Custom, will steal some Minutes from the Needle, to improve their Minds, and this <hi>Society,</hi> without doubt, will with their performances envite a great many more, to the same, when they shall see the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103661:16"/>
Beauties of Philosophy, in so sweet, and easie a Dress, and then their Conversation would be far more agreeable to the wiser part of the World, than the impertinent Chatt, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (not by their own faults) are now guilty of. This is evident to any man, that has ever been in <hi>France,</hi> and convers'd with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the better quality there, whose Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions are more quick, and discourse upon any Subject, or in any Science, I will not except the most profound parts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, more <hi>à propos,</hi> and ingenious, than the Men; their Wit, and Notions are indeed extreamly surprizing. I am confident, by the acquaintance I have had the honor to have with some of the Refin'd of that Sex here, that our <hi>English Women</hi> would not be inferior to them in any qualification of the Mind, if they were but bless'd with as happy an Education: Nay, I am apt to think, they would as far surpass the French Ladies in <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as in <hi>Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The entertaining Notions of Philosophy, are not the only Subjects of the <hi>Ladies</hi> Studies in <hi>France, Madam de Maintenon</hi> will prove, that the weighty movements of State-affairs are not above the direction of that Sex: And she that writ the Memoirs of the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> shews, that they are capable of making poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Observations on the nicest Occurrences. <hi>Madam Dacier</hi> is an extraordinary Proof, that the most crabbed Studies are not look'd into by them, without the greatest success. Her Endeavours on <hi>Plautus, Terence,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> shew, that Women are capable of being as nice, and critical Judges of Sence, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as Men; nay, those Essays I have mention'd of this <hi>French</hi> Lady, excel all that has been done in that kind, particularly all the Pedantic Labors of those plodding <hi>Iesuites</hi> who have publish'd Notes upon the <hi>Classic Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> for the use of the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that some will urge, that she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to her Husband, for those upon <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race;</hi> yet these Gentlemen cannot deny, that <hi>Plautus,</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> were publish'd when she was yet <hi>Madam la Fevre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but mention the Lady <hi>Donna Oliva Sabuco,</hi> reckoned amongst the greatest Scholars, she advancing in her Studies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end <hi>Spain,</hi> and the whole World might receive some Advantage thereby, she began a new and most ingenious method of Physic; she wrote to the most august <hi>Philip</hi> II, to obtain the establishing of her Followers as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Physicians,—and in her Treatise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The New Physic,</hi> she learnedly, Dialogue wise, censures the Physic of the Ancients; and most famous Authors have since laid claim to many things, boasting themselves the first Discoverers of them, whereof she had full knowledg, and long before did publish them in her learned Books.</p>
               <p>For a farther Proof of this point, I shall, in a few words, touch upon some of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Women of Antiquity: I will pass over the <hi>Politic Semiramis,</hi> the valiant, and no less politic <hi>Thamyris</hi> Queen of <hi>Scythia,</hi> who not only engaged <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but overcame him, by outwitting him, destroying him by his own Stratagem. Nor will I instance <hi>Sempronia,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Salust,</hi> in his <hi>Catiline</hi>'s <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as <hi>learned,</hi> and <hi>witty.</hi> Nor will I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize the fifteen eminent Women, that taught in the School of <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> All that will be necessary here, will be a short enumeration of the Names of some of most Ages,—as <hi>Magalostrate,</hi> a Mistriss worthy of <hi>Acman</hi> a <hi>Lyric</hi> Poet, that flourish'd in the 27th <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piade;</hi> the often celebrated <hi>Sappho,</hi> great in <hi>Lyric, Elegy,</hi> and all manner of Poetry in the 42d' <hi>Olympiade,</hi> with her Friend <hi>Erinna,</hi> and contemporary <hi>Demophila; Theano,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> both a Philosophress, and Poetess, in the 56th <hi>Olympiade; Cleobulina,</hi> about the 70th <hi>Olympiade; Corinna, Telestia Praxilla,</hi> betwixt the Battel of <hi>Marathon,</hi> and the Peace of <hi>Antalcidas; Aspasia,</hi> between that Peace, and the taking of <hi>Athens</hi> by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander; Cornificia,</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> Sister to <hi>Cornificius</hi> the Poet, in the second year of the 184th <hi>Olympiade; Athenais,</hi> afterward <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger; and <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> Sister to the same <hi>Theodosius.</hi> Among the modern <hi>Italians, Angela,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Anthony de Nugaroles; Modesta, Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Marinella,</hi> who writ a Poem on the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of Womankind; <hi>Olympia Clara, Magdalena Acciaiolia, Valeria Miainia; Anna Maria Schur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> a Flemming. To these I might add of our own Nation, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>'s Daughter, who translated se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of her Father's Latin Works, Mrs. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Carew,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Ann Asoue,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Weston:</hi> Nor must I forget Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, who was not only a politic but lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Princess; and nearer our own times, Mrs. <hi>Katherina Philips,</hi> commended by the great <hi>Cowly;</hi> and of my own knowledg, Mrs. <hi>Behn,</hi> who was not only an excellent Poetess, but discoursed very refinedly on any Subject that came in her way. I could name another that surpasses all these, if I feared not to offend her Modesty, by publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing her name.</p>
               <p>This is enough to satisfie the World, that the Society have advanced nothing but Truth in that Affirmation before quoted, and therefore, that their deference to the fair Sex merits not that Condemnation some of the moroser part of the Town are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give them. Nor is it at all derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Reputation of a Philosopher, to meddle with <hi>Questions of Love, &amp;c.</hi> since the contemplative, and refin'd <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> (to omit other Philosophers) have writ so many soft things on that Subject, that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Tyrius,</hi> no small Admirer of <hi>Plato,</hi> says, <note n="*" place="margin">Me non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratio tantum habet, sed etiam stupor, cum <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonem,</hi> &amp; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratem</hi> lego, <hi>Homerum,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatibus suis arcere, quod tam <hi>Levia,</hi> &amp; lascivia scriberet, &amp;c.—Et paulo post,—Cum &amp; <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; <hi>Socrates</hi> Leviora longe ipsi scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sere, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>That he is amaz'd, to find</hi> Plato, <hi>and</hi> Socrates <hi>banishing</hi> Homer <hi>out of their Cities, for containing light, and amorous things, when they themselves have writ far more <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>amorously.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:103661:17"/>Yet I find this not objected by any of the Opposers of these Philosophers, as a Crime, or Defect, they being only here condemn'd by <hi>Tyrius,</hi> because they forbid the reading of <hi>Homer,</hi> for what they thought fit to mingle in their own Works.</p>
               <p>This <hi>short View of their Performances</hi> makes it evident, what Advantage the Public will reap from their Endeavours, and how much Knowledg will be in a little time improv'd: For, as they very modestly express it, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing that Knowledg to <hi>many,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready familiar to the Learned, is an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. I will produce their own words, being a very moderate, and much too civil Answer, which they give to a very concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and impertinent Quaerist. The Quaery is this;—<hi>Why you pretend to such strange things, and yet in effect tell the World no more than what we all know already?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Quaery, so worthy of Contempt, and Laughter, deserv'd no other Answer than Silence; but after they had wittily rally'd it, they give a serious Return with a great deal of Ingenuity, and <hi>Modesty</hi> even to a Fault, degrading both their <hi>Industry,</hi> and <hi>Abilities,</hi> in terming what they do as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of other mens Thoughts, and that all the improvement they make, is only the communicating them to those that knew 'em not before. But I wrong them in not transcribing their own words, which are these:—<q>'Tis true in some sence, <hi>Nil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum, quod non dictum prius,</hi> the World is Learned, and we wish it were more so; the finest things that can be said, are little else than <hi>old Sence,</hi> with a new Turn; and if ye deny this, all the Orators in it must stand still, and neither <hi>Divines,</hi> nor <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,</hi> get any more than our <hi>Athenian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury:</hi> Yet still what one man knows, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man does not, and a diffusing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is a sort of improving of it, perhaps the best way.—And a little after, in the same Question,—`Besides, we are pretty confident, there are very many Questions here, some of moment, which were never before publicly decided, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Morality,</hi> which is by far the most useful part of Knowledg: And 'twould be no shame for us, should we own, our chief aim in this design, were to convey under a pleasant Dress <hi>Notions of Virtue, and Honour into the Commonalty, and rather make them <hi>better than wiser;</hi>
                     </hi> tho' indeed in one we do both, and cannot doubt in the mean while, but the <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>ingenious</hi> Spirits will seldom take up our Paper, but they'll find something or other in't, that both may divert, and please them: For the less can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Judges, they have done all they can against it already, but avail nothing; the Paper still lives, and <hi>is still like to do so in spight of all their ill nature,</hi> and finds that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which we will say the Design there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deserves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have thought fit to conclude with this Quotation out of the Works of the <hi>Society,</hi> because it is a Recapitulation of all that I have said, both as to their Design and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, with a short <hi>modest Vindication</hi> of both, if not a prophetical Assurance of its surpassing all the Oppositions it has or may meet with.</p>

But I shall give you a concise account of this Book from Mr. <hi>De la Crose</hi>'s <hi>Works of the Learned,</hi> who having been formerly an Antagonist with the <hi>Society,</hi> on account of <hi>Extracts,</hi> may reasonably be supposed not to flatter any of their Performances, especially in that kind: His words are these in his Book for <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1692.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It consists (says he of the <hi>young Student's Library</hi>) of Abstracts of Books in several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as <hi>Divinity, Critics, History, Geography, Philosophy, Law, Physic, &amp;c.</hi> many of which are collected out of the <hi>Iournals des Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the <hi>Universal Bibliotheque,</hi> and, as I hear, accurately translated; but the most considerable, tho' not the biggest part, are two <hi>original</hi> pieces: The first is written by a Divine, a Member of the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> who has spent several years in the study of the Hebrew Tongue, and shews a great deal of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> in maintaining the Antiquity of the Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Vowels against <hi>Lewis Capel,</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: He pretends they are at least as ancient as <hi>Ezra.</hi>

                  <q>The whole is divided into two parts, the first part considers the Opinions of <hi>Elias Levita, Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> and others, for the novelty of the Points; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the improbability of their Conceits, that the <hi>Masorites of Tiberias</hi> pointed the Text, from the silence of the <hi>Iews</hi> about it, their Testimonies against it, the unfitness of the Time, Place, and Persons of late assign'd for the invention of the <hi>Points,</hi> from the nature of the <hi>Masora,</hi> and of the <hi>Masoretic</hi> Notes upon the <hi>Verses, Words, Letters, Vowels,</hi> and <hi>Accents</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations on all the kinds of the <hi>Keri, -u, Ketib;</hi> the words written full, or defective; the <hi>Ittur Sopherim,</hi> the <hi>Tikkun Sopherim,</hi> and the rest of the parts of the <hi>Masora,</hi> and from other Considerations. The second part proves the Antiquity, Divine Original, and Authority of the present Punctuation, by the Testimony of <hi>Iews,</hi> and Christians, the universal Consent of all Nations that receive the Scriptures, their quiet possession of the Text, as 'tis now pointed by Prescription, from Age to Age. The Vowels (an essential part of Speech) oft exprest by the Punctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only. The Obscurity of the Scripture without Points, which yet was commanded to be written very plainly. The Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament evidencing it self to be the Word of God, in, and by the Punctuation only, the Anomalies thereof manifesting its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The Promise of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>That nothing shall be lost out of the Law, and the Prophets,</hi> whereof the Points are so great a part.

Together with Answers to several Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Elias Levita, Ludovicus Capelius,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Walton,</hi> and others against their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; such are the Testimonies of some <hi>Iews</hi> about the Points. The unpointed Copy of the Law so kept in the Synagogue. The silence of the ancient Caballistical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> and <hi>Talmuds</hi> about them. The LXX, and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase reading otherways than our Punctuation directeth. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Character (supposed to be the ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi>) never pointed. The Novelty of their Names: The superfluity of their Numbers: The possibility of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sound without the Shapes, and of reading the Bible without Points (as well as the <hi>Rabbinical Commentaries,</hi> the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> and other Oriental Languages, are read without them) by the help of the <hi>Matres lectionis,</hi> or letters <hi>Evi, a, h, v, i,</hi> by the scope of the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Silence of <hi>Ierom,</hi> and the Fathers, about them. The Opinion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers modern Divines, both Papists, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, against the Antiquity of the Shapes of the present Punctuation. The <hi>Keri, u, Ketib,</hi> being about the Letters, and never about the Points, and the like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This bare Transcription of the Contents of this <hi>Original Piece</hi> (a sight of some sheets of which my Bookseller, by his Interest, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me) is sufficient to shew of what great use it will be not only to all Divines, but also to every one that is curious in Enquiry into the original Text of Sacred Writ, a Study as much above all others, as the Soul is above the Body. The consequence of this Treatise is, as I have remark'd no less than the Authority, and Certainty of Christian Faith: For, as <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Rodolphus Cevallerius,</hi> speaking of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Points, thus pleads for them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>They who are of the contrary Opinion do not only make doubtful the Authority of the Scriptures, but wholy pluck it up by the roots; for, without the Vowels, and Notes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction it has nothing firm, and certain.</hi> And this is sufficient to shew the necessity, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of this Undertaking, and how seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a Treatise of this nature is, to obviate the Objections of the Atheists of this Age, that we may give a loose to our Fancies in <hi>Belief,</hi> since there is nothing of Certainty in the Bible it self: And if this <hi>Ground</hi> prevailed, it would easily reduce us all to that part of <hi>Hobbism,</hi> of veering with e'ery Wind that blows, and changing our Religion as often as Fortune should our Princes to different Perswasions. As for the Performance of this <hi>Divine,</hi> in this <hi>Piece,</hi> the Contents shew, that he has taken notice of all, that can be raised against the Opinion he defends, and the many years he has given himself to the Study of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Tongues, as well as all the <hi>Rabbinical Learning,</hi> leave no doubt, but that Performance is equal to the nobleness of the Subject: And according to my small Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that way, if I may be allow'd to ghess at the rest by what I have seen, he has done it with a great deal of <hi>Strength of Iudgment, Force,</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> of Argument, and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundness</hi> of Skill. 'Twas the Saying of a great man, that he would easily tell the Progress any one would make in any <hi>Science,</hi> if he knew but the Value he had for it, for earnest Desire stirrs up indefatigable Industry, the Mind being never satisfied till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it has obtain'd that to which it was born, by the high esteem, and value it has conceived of it. And no man could have a greater Esteem for any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, than this Divine had for this, as the chief, and obligatory Study of Men of his Character, who were to give the true, and genuine sence of Scripture to the Souls he directed under the pain of <hi>Woe,</hi> at the last Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, which could never be satisfactorily done by depending entirely upon the Word of other men, without an ability of consulting the <hi>Key</hi> of those sacred Mysteries it self, I mean the <hi>original Text:</hi> And 'tis to be wonder'd as well as complain'd of, that so many of our Divines, through a <hi>Criminal Supinity,</hi> do too much neglect this necessary Study, which our <hi>Divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Indeed their whole design seem'd to be to <hi>laugh,</hi> and <hi>ridicule Solidity,</hi> and <hi>Seriousness</hi> out of the World, that so they might make an opener, and more easie inlet to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and that this was their Aim is more than probable from that blasphemous expression of <hi>Serenading their Maker at the expence of <hi>Sternhold,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Hopkins, and affirming that there were many feign'd Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Iob,</hi> and their turning God's Iudgment on <hi>Sodom</hi> into ridicule, and a Iest</hi>—all which, wou'd I confess almost prevail with a Man to believe that those reports were true, which were <hi>then</hi> given of them, <hi>viz.

                  </hi> But whether these were Calumnies or no, I am sure (if I may judge of their design by what they did publish) they seem'd bent to confound the Minds of the Vulgar, and encline them to <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> rather than to fix them in any thing <hi>solid,</hi> and <hi>vertuous:</hi> In short as the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> said of their design, <hi>That the World was already very Learned, yet they desired to make it more so.</hi> So those Interlopers might have said, of their performances, <hi>That the World was very wicked already, but their desire, and endeavours shou'd contribute to render it entirely so.</hi> What cou'd their dispute about the testimony of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> mean, but to bring the very being of <hi>Christ</hi> into

'tis true he says almost as much of <hi>Christ</hi> as we <hi>Christians</hi> (perhaps more than they do) believe, but what if I should say it is <hi>likely Iosephus</hi> did believe all that he writ? I am sure I have his words on my side (his words I say, for all these <hi>SPARKS</hi> have said cannot convince me of the contrary) but is it so strange a thing in our days, that a Man shou'd for, interest, act contrary to that his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is? there were no Preferments among the <hi>Christians but racks, tortures,</hi> &amp;c. they cou'd set up no <hi>Statue's</hi> to the Honour of his Memory, which the <hi>Romans</hi> did.

               <p>So the <hi>ATHENIAN SOCIETY,</hi> tho' they are no Papists, are such friends to truth, as to deny there was ever such a Person as Pope <hi>Ioan,</hi> and indeed <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is not to be answered on that point.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the <hi>Equity</hi> of such an undertaking, and the Persons concern'd in it as well as their prophane and <hi>trifling</hi> performances, for they not only left Divinity to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> (as they first profess'd) but <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and indeed ev'ry thing that was solid, or ingenious; now let us see what encouragement they met with. Just as much as the above quoted Letter prophesied, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pay for Paper, much less for Print; and Copy: This I am positive in, because I made an enquiry of the <hi>MERCURY WOMEN</hi> about it; nor cou'd it be other ways expected, since the <hi>Athenians</hi> took the ready way to suppress it by giving their Readers all the <hi>little Mettal,</hi> that was to be gain'd out of their Oar, <hi>purg'd of its more bulky dross,</hi> with remarks on their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and their own improvements on their Thoughts: For a farther satisfaction to the Reader, I shall insert their Promise (which they all along perform'd to a tittle) made to all their Querists; in the <hi>14th.</hi> Number of the <hi>6th.</hi> Volume, (tho' they often repeated it before, and after in other <hi>Mercuries.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Finding that publishing our <hi>Mercuries</hi> four times a Week, wou'd quite clog our Undertaking, and render it useless, we shall for the future only publish them on <hi>Tuesdays,</hi> and <hi>Saturdays</hi> as formerly, and that we may render our undertaking perfect, <hi>we promise our Querists,</hi> that in case any Person shou'd interfere: with us in our design of answering Questions, they shall constantly find in our <hi>Saturdays Mercury,</hi> Answers to all his Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatever, that so our Querists may not be put to double Charges (<hi>by buying the same Questions twice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd</hi>) nor the Coffee-houses burthen'd with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papers. In another Advertisement they tell the World that it shall find in their Papers all the <hi>Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist's</hi> best Thoughts remarks on his Errors, and their own Improvements upon all he advances.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Performing</hi> these things with all the Justice, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in the World; and <hi>constantly</hi> without omitting any thing worth taking notice of, 'tis no wonder that so few were found void so much of Sense as to buy their trifles, (the more pardonable indeed for being so very short) when they might have a view of all that was valuable in them in the <hi>Athenian Mercury</hi> and that too with great Additions. <hi>So may they thrive, who interfere with an others design!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must not here among the other Oppositions they have met with, forget the Endeavours of their Enemies to cast an Imputation of <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> on the Members of this <hi>SOCIETY.</hi> But it is so evident from what they have writ that they are of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that blind Malice it self cannot deny it.

The Query is this—<hi>What Community in your opinion comes nearest to the Doctrine of our Blessed Saviour, the Apostles, and Primitive Fathers?</hi>—The Answer is <q>—Undoubtedly it is our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Communion we our selves are of, and hope to live, and die in, namely that of the <hi>Church of England</hi> is the best in the World, and nearest to the Doctrine, of our Saviour, his Apostles, and Primitive Fathers, and unless we thought so we shou'd be very ill Men to continue in it—</q> I desire the Reader wou'd consult this place I have quoted, where he will find evident beyond evasion, the distinctive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium betwixt <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>other Protestant opinions,</hi> particularly as to the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and Episcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at large set down, which were too long for me to transcribe here. Number 25. of the same Volume, Quest. 4. is a farther Confirmation of this. The Query is, <hi>I desire your Opinion, what Book you wou'd advise me to for my private Devotions, as being a single Person.</hi>—Pray, Reader mind well the Answer.—<hi>Answ.</hi> 
                  <q>What so many great, and good Men have been concern'd in the Composing of, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>LITURGY</hi> of the <hi>Church of ENGLAND</hi>—if the Labours of one Man, then Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Composures, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This I am sure is enough to convince any reasonable Man of what Church the Members of this <hi>Society</hi> are. 'Twas no impollitic part (how dishonest soever it were) of their opposers to cast an <hi>Odium</hi> upon them in the Affairs of Religion, since too many are carry'd away with a <hi>VIOLENT PREIUDICE</hi> against any thing, that shall be offer'd, by one of an other perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thinking to supply all their other defects, by a <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>unreasonable Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the Oppositions this Noble design met with were many, as appears from what I have said, so were the Encouragements too, from all parts of <hi>England, Some parts beyond Sea,</hi> and from great, and learned Men, as is evident from the Gentleman I lately mention'd, who has join'd himself to them on the account of the <hi>Natural Rarities,</hi> and that worthy <hi>Divine</hi> mention'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this last part, so skilful in <hi>Rabinical Learning</hi> nor is that less which the Approbation of the ingenious Gentlemen of Received Wit and Reputation, have given them in the Verses prefixt to this <hi>History;</hi> nor must I omit the Judgment of a very ingenious Gentleman, which he sent in a Letter to the <hi>ATHENIAN SOCIETY,</hi> (which being now in the Press, I got a sight of) It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus—</p>

               <p>Having thus run through all the points I propos'd to my self upon my resolution of Writing of this <hi>History,</hi> with a much greater brevity, I confess, than what the well handling a Subject of this extent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I shall here
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103661:21"/>
conclude, with a short View of what I have done.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>first part,</hi> I have represented the NOVELTY, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and manner of its Invention; the Advantages it afforded the World, as the making that familiar to many which was before confin'd within too narrow a compass, and recommending the <hi>beauty</hi> of Knowledge to them, who were frightned from it by the <hi>Mercenary</hi> Schools; whereas its <hi>easie Charms in the Athenian Dress,</hi> will excite many to the study of Wisdom; they, at least, whose necessary Business will not permit a more <hi>tedious</hi> Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, may gather good notions of things by a meer cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory reading of the <hi>weekly Mercuries,</hi> which will be no small <hi>improvement of Civility, and Conversation.</hi> Farther, I shew'd, that it was unreasonable, that they to whom Nature had given a <hi>noble Genius</hi> should be denied, when grown up, the improvement of it (without the tedious Discipline of the School) because their Parents had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or their Circumstances hinder'd it when young; that they who naturally slight Learning, will do so still, since this Design is to improve, not <hi>alter</hi> Nature; that it were an Injustice, that they who value it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, because confin'd to Languages: Nor is it reasonable that a <hi>Pedant</hi> should esteem himself above others, for one without the other. I shall only add here to these Considerations, that whereas this was begun in War (<hi>tho' Peace is generally the Mother of new Arts, and Sciences</hi>) so it has several Advantages proper to the Temper, and Exigencies of such a <hi>hurrying, and martial</hi> time, when <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>Stratagems</hi> take up too much of our hours, to permit us to spend many in the Enquiries into <hi>Truth,</hi> and all sorts of Learning, by the perusal of voluminous Tracts.</p>
               <p>Nor did I forget the Difficulties which presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Members of the <hi>Society,</hi> to hinder their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in this Affair; first, as to answering all Quaeries well, and to the satisfaction of those that pretend to follow Reason for their Rule, all Sciences being so very d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; as also from the <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> of others; and lastly, from the different <hi>Humors of the Quaerists.</hi> Nor could I pass over the due Praise of the <hi>First</hi> that set it on foot.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>second part</hi> I endeavour'd, according to the best of my Knowledge, to represent the <hi>Progress, Methods,</hi> and <hi>Performances</hi> of the SOCIETY when establish'd, which if I should have run into the <hi>Vastness</hi> that the Subject requir'd, I must have swell'd my Book into a Volume as big as all they had writ; but designing this as the <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist's Companion,</hi> or <hi>Pocket-book,</hi> I was forc'd not only to omit the abundance of difficult <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> they have explained, and other matters of <hi>Divinity,</hi> but a no less uumber of <hi>Philosophical</hi> Questions, and only inserted References to those that are <hi>Medicinal, Chirurgical,</hi> and <hi>Mathematical, &amp;c.</hi> thinking that sufficient to direct any one in all his Quaeries to the <hi>Society.</hi> Nor was it possible in so voluminous a Miscellany to give e'ery Member his due Performance, especially since I confess my <hi>Ignorance</hi> as to that particular; however, the Talents of each were so universal, that if Sickness or absence of a Member hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, it was easily supply'd by the Abilities of the rest. I shall only add, that they <hi>jointly assist one another in all things that require Consultation;</hi> and, that they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced several things that are <hi>wholy NEW,</hi> and explained those Difficulties in a little time, which one would judge the <hi>business of Ages.</hi> In this same part I have a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon an imperfect Defence of their <hi>Poetry,</hi> though any one that believes, that a Member of this <hi>Society</hi> was concerned in the <hi>search after Wit,</hi> will think my Labour ill spent in perswading the World of what it must grant, that they have not a little; but I directed my Discourse to those who were so <hi>abounding in themselves,</hi> that they deny'd it. I have also (as I think every man of Honor ought) undertaken their Defence for answering the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Quaeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>third part,</hi> I have in few words given a Prospect of what the World is suddenly to expect from the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Pens of our <hi>Athenians,</hi> and likewise what it has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope hereafter. Nor did I forget the Oppositions this Undertaking has met with, with a too-favourable account (when I could have done much more) of both the <hi>Principles</hi> of its Opposers, and the <hi>Injustice</hi> of their Endeavours: In all which, if I can merit Pardon from that <hi>Ingenious Society,</hi> and the more judicious part of the World, I shall think I have attained to no small piece of Happiness, and Success.</p>
