            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</p>

            <p>IN this Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to propoſe to himſelf theſe <hi>Two</hi> things. <hi>First,</hi> The confirming their Faith, by laying open the whole Myſtery of their Salvation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the Miſery of their former Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-ſtate, in the three firſt Chapters; And then
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62409:3"/>
the perſwading 'em to expreſs their Gratitude to Almighty God for ſo great a Deliverance, by the Exerciſe of all thoſe Chriſtian Vertues, which that moſt Holy Diſpenſation was deſign'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce.</p>
            <p>This latter part of his Deſign he enters on in this Chapter, and opens it with an earneſt Perſwaſion to <hi>Meekneſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing it all along with great ſtrength of Reaſon, from their being <hi>Members of one Body,</hi> from their being governed by <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> having <hi>one Hope</hi> of Eternal Life, <hi>one Lord Christ, one Faith</hi> in him, <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> in his Name, <hi>one God, one Father of all</hi>; from the ſeveral Gifts of Chriſt to his Church, all tending to preſerve and advance this Unity among 'em: and at laſt, to ſtrike at the very Cauſe of thoſe Diſorders, which hinder'd its Increaſe, He concludes, <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice</hi>: and ſtrengthening that Exhortation with the Example of our merciful God, that unexhauſted Fountain of infinite Goodneſs, he adds, <hi>And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The drift of the ſeveral Expreſſions in the Text, is to perſwade us to Acts of Concord and Charity, and to diſſwade us from all the Obſtacles to it,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62409:3"/>
which that <hi>unruly Paſſion of Anger</hi> lays in our way.</p>
            <p>The general Head of Charity is of too large, and too nice a Nature, to be ſtated at length, in its ſeveral Particulars, within the compaſs of a Diſcourſe; and therefore, after opening further in a word or two the difficulty of that Task, I ſhall chuſe to fix our Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more particularly on that <hi>Vice,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> which chiefly oppoſes it. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you the <hi>folly and unreaſonableneſs of it in its Riſe, its Nature and Effects</hi>; with regard to <hi>private Men,</hi> and <hi>publick Communities</hi>; and afterwards back theſe Reaſonings with the ſeveral <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> to this Purpoſe, that are to be met with in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> I ſhall, in the Cloſe, point the force of what has been ſaid immediately upon Our Selves; and ſhew, of what preſent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> the Argument is to us.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo hard to perſwade Men that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a Duty, as it is to fix the Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of it; not many, I think, who own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, will diſpute their Obligation to mutual Forbearance and Condeſcenſion, though few, if any, can agree in its Meaſures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Beſides thoſe Prejudices, which an obſtinate Bigotry and falſe Zeal, or Fear and worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt may raiſe in our Minds, and ſo pervert our Judgments, in applying this Duty to particular
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62409:4"/>
Caſes; there is difficulty enough in the nature of the thing. The very different Judgments, even cool and thinking Men frame, of the ſame Action ſufficiently ſpeak it. What by ſome may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a neceſſary ſteadineſs, by others is interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an obſtinate ſtubborneſs, a peremptory ſtifneſs, and a ſtreightneſs of bowels: and what appears to one <hi>as</hi> neceſſary a tenderneſs and forbearance, is eſteem'd by others a baſe and treacherous compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The Apoſtles themſelves found it no eaſie task to adjuſt this Matter. The ſtiff adherence of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Converts to the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies, which they thought unchangeable, and their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire of <hi>keeping up the partition-wall between them and the Gentiles,</hi> which they would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be broken down, raiſed no ſmall Trouble and Diſſention in the Church at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>: and when the Apoſtles and Elders came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to decide the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gentile Proſelytes ſhou'd be oblig'd to Circumciſion, 'twas not till <hi>after there had been much diſputing,</hi> (as we learn from St. <hi>Luke</hi>) that they came to the Reſolution of <hi>not laying any new burthen upon them, nor putting a yoke upon the necks of the diſciples, which neither their own fathers, nor they themſelves were able to bear.</hi> And even after this Deciſion, (which, one would have thought, had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Point) <hi>St. Peter coming to Antioch did eat
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62409:4"/>
with the Gentiles; but when certain came from James,</hi> tender of giving ſcandal to Them, <hi>he withdrew and ſeparated himſelf, fearing them which were of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> This, St. <hi>Paul, withſtanding him boldly to the face, called diſſembling, and walking not upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the truth of the Gospel</hi>; whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> 'tis plain by his practice judg'd as much too ſtiff and inflexible to thoſe of the Circumciſion. So different have been the Judgments even of the beſt aſſiſted and moſt enlighten'd Perſons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaſures of this Duty, when it came once to be applied to a particular Caſe.</p>
            <p>But yet how difficult ſoever it may be to ſtate this nicely in its full extent, thus much, which is more to our preſent purpoſe, both from the Writings of the Apoſtles, and from their Practice, ſeems to lie plain before us: That the Unity of the Church, and the Charity we owe to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, obliges us not to do or ſay any thing how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever innocent in it ſelf (unleſs ingag'd to it by Duty, or ſomething like Neceſſity) which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his unhappy Temper, or Prejudices, may put him out of the way to Heaven, or hinder his Advancement in it; much leſs, how different ſoever our Opinions may be, or on either hand, how well ſoever grounded, are we to give way to <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, anger, wrath, clamour, evil-ſpeaking,</hi> or <hi>malice</hi>;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62409:5"/>
ſo as either to employ 'em our ſelves, or be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by 'em to revenge, when they are us'd againſt us: but rather ought we to be <hi>kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the violence of Anger were not of it ſelf in perfect Oppoſition to the Law of Chriſt, and that Meekneſs it injoins, yet its miſchievous Effects, both on our ſelves and others, are enough to make it juſtly be deteſted; and convince us it can never be well employed but on it ſelf: that It alone calls for all that Bitterneſs and ill Language it uſually breaks out in; and truly merits that moſt implacable Revenge it generally animates; which is never ſatisfy'd but in reducing its Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the power of doing us an Injury. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order it cauſes in our Minds, our Blood, and our Spirits, deſerves indeed all the Reſentment it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but the Paſſion is too irregular to be ſo well directed, and we are too much heated to judge ſo truly of its Application: we blindly miſ-place it on our innocent Neighbour, and lay the weight of that on our Brother, which is only due to our own Pride or ill Nature.</p>
            <p>For 'tis an <hi>Anger,</hi> which is <hi>Wrath,</hi> that is here forbidden, an Anger of <hi>Revenge</hi> or of <hi>Reproach</hi>; which owes its Riſe either to an <hi>over-fond opinion of our ſelves,</hi> or <hi>too mean a one of other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62409:5"/>Man is but too apt to be full of himſelf, to love Dominion and Independance; That Boſom-flatterer, Self-love, enlarges the Proſpect of all his good Qualities, and leſſens the View propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably of his Weakneſſes or Faults: but turns the Glaſs to look on thoſe of other Men, and augments or diminiſhes the Repreſentation, as ſuits beſt with the Intereſts of that Preheminence he would eſtabliſh for himſelf. Hence he natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grows captious and quarrelſome. If others (as well they may) reſiſt this Uſurpation: if they not only refuſe to ſubmit to it, but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Pretence to it as unreaſonable and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; and return it with Contempt, or Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the like Attempts in their own Favour; the ſenſe of this diminution goes deep into his heart; he trembles, and looks pale at the danger of thoſe Deſigns his Revenge ſuggeſts to him: or, if the execution of that Revenge ſeems out of his power, he breaks out into loud and paſſionate cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, into haſty threats, and bitter revilings; confeſſing his impotence, by the very means he would appear formidable, and defeating the utmoſt efforts of his malice, by diſcovering its aims.</p>
            <p>Now what temper can there be, which is leſs able to juſtifie it ſelf, either to Reaſon, or to the Principles of the Goſpel? The Foundation it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62409:6"/>
built upon is as weak, as the Paſſion is violent; and the one does not diſorder and confound our Reaſon, more than the other ſhocks and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it.</p>
            <p>There is an Equality in Men as ſuch, whereon all the natural Duties are founded, that make us eaſie or uſeful to one another; an Infringement of this, is an Uſurpation on Mankind; and whoever draws too large a ſhare to himſelf of a common Right, will be juſtly look'd upon by others as a general Invader. 'Tis this unjuſt preference of our ſelves makes us touchy and captious: we think more due to our ſelves than others in reaſon can allow us; and that makes us fret at the Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: if we inſiſt on our Demand, Others have as good a Right to make it upon Us; and if Both continue obſtinate, this can end in nothing but continual War and Confuſion: before we can poſſibly <hi>treat,</hi> we muſt reduce our ſelves to this <hi>Equality</hi>; for when a <hi>Superiour dictates,</hi> 'tis rather an <hi>Impoſition</hi> than an <hi>Agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to ſuppoſe a Caſe which rarely happens) ſhould we think <hi>ſoberly of our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>juſtly of our Neighbours</hi>; ſhould our Anger not have thoſe <hi>unequal</hi> Grounds of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi>; were We wholly blameleſs, and They the faulty Aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; yet neither in This Caſe can Anger ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it ſelf to Reaſon. For whatever fine things
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62409:6"/>
ſome Philoſophers may have ſaid of it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how it is a neceſſary Weapon to defend us from Injuries, and a uſeful Spur to many Vertues: 'tis a ſtrange ſort of Weapon which governs the Man who weilds it, and a very dangerous Spur which drives him down a Precipice. Whoever pretends to govern it by Reaſon, muſt either change its Nature, or loſe his Aim; it muſt be ſubdued and broken, before it can be quiet. 'Tis the proper Character of Anger, not to liſten to Reaſon; impetuous it is and turbulent in all its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, raſh and violent in all its Reſolutions, bitter and revengeful in all its Deſigns: let our Anger be abated to ever ſo low a degree, ſo long as it is Anger, 'twill be a Deſire of Revenge, and a Paſſion that delights it ſelf in the Proſpect of the Ruine of the Offender: a Pleaſure, that is as much below the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of a <hi>Vertuous Man,</hi> as 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to give his Enemies the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Pleaſure, of thinking, they can offend him.</p>
            <p>They give us a very wrong notion of Juſtice, who make Anger its Aſſiſtant; and as ill a one of Courage, who derive the force of it from thence. No reaſonable Man would deſire to have his Cauſe come before a Judge that is in wrath; it may blind him indeed, and leave him the chance of doing Right, but can never make him diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62409:7"/>
and impartial. There's a coolneſs of Temper abſolutely neceſſary to Juſtice, that may allow it the leiſure of looking into both ſides; and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage too requires a ſight of the Danger: 'Tis a mad Fury that tranſports a Man, when he ruſhes on, without Sight or Knowledge of the Danger he caſts himſelf into; his Mind is hurried away in the Storm from all thoughts of his Defence, and he falls on his Enemy without Senſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; like a weighty Ruine, only to break him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on him, to pieces. 'Tis a noble Generoſity and Conſtancy of Mind, which affords the moſt ſubſtantial defence againſt Injuries, and gives the manlieſt Vigour to our Courage. Whoever is above the reſentment of an Injury, has plac'd himſelf out of the reach of its force; and he that is unmov'd at the ſight of his Danger, will never ſhrink in the Conflict with it. He that takes no notice of an Enemy, gives him the libetry of forgetting he is ſo. <hi>Oppoſition</hi> only and a <hi>dread</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> keep up in him the memory of the Difference, and make it ſo very difficult for Him to Forgive an Injury, who has been ſo hardy as to Do one.</p>
            <p>In a word, the very firſt motions of <hi>Anger</hi> in their own Nature directly tend to the ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Reaſon: Give it ever ſo little head, it ſoon becomes irreſiſtible; and, when once intire and abſolute Maſter, can end in nothing but <hi>Rage</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62409:7"/>
and <hi>Madneſs.</hi> When aggreſſor, partial, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; when defendant, blind, and inſufficient; if noyſie and clamourous, mean and falſe to its own ends; if ſullen and malicious, full of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and inwardly tormenting; if bitter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, adding weight to Injuries already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and provoking yet more, to fill up the meaſure of its <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> There are ſome ſorts of <hi>Anger</hi> indeed not ſo mean, or ſo extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>tranſporting,</hi> and leſs <hi>miſchievous</hi> than others; but there is none which raiſes not a great Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the <hi>Mind,</hi> which does not drive out of it all <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>humanity,</hi> and rob a Man of the beſt part of himſelf: it may have ſome <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>tranſient riſings</hi> indeed in the Breaſt of a <hi>wiſe Man,</hi> but it <hi>reſts only in the Boſom of Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill theſe are the Miſchiefs of this <hi>violent temper</hi> only between Man and Man: They are much more extenſive, if we conſider him as a <hi>Member</hi> of <hi>Society.</hi> In That ſtate, they never fall on a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, but at the ſame time they threaten and offend the whole Community. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, all Laws how much ſoever they connive at and overlook the Exceſſes of ſome other <hi>Paſſions,</hi> have taken ſpecial Care to bridle this, as peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tending to the deſtruction of <hi>Government</hi> it ſelf: they have reſerv'd the avenging of <hi>Injuries</hi> to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> alone, and not abandoned the Security

of Men's <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of <hi>Life,</hi> for the ſake of which they enter'd into <hi>Society,</hi> to the Cruelty and Violence of furious Men, by leaving the <hi>Sword of Juſtice</hi> in their hands. The <hi>Revenge</hi> therefore which <hi>Anger</hi> ſuggeſts to a private Man, is an <hi>Outrage</hi> to the <hi>Laws,</hi> and a <hi>breach</hi> of all thoſe <hi>ſacred Bonds</hi> which unite Men in the ſeveral <hi>forms of Government</hi>; and where thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> are vigorouſly executed, 'twould be as great a Madneſs and Folly to attempt it, as to think to fight it out with a <hi>whole Nation:</hi> For the will of the <hi>whole</hi> centers in that of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> His Judgment is the <hi>Judgment of the Community,</hi> and the <hi>Execution</hi> of it is attended with their <hi>

When we indiſcreetly or furiouſly exaſperate their Minds, we ſhut 'em againſt the Truth, and their Hearts againſt, our ſelves, and ſo deſtroy all Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is the Life of Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor are our Civil Diſſentions leſs ſcandalous and prejudicial to Government, than our Religious Bickerings to Piety and Vertue; or the means of carrying 'em on, leſs bitter and malicious. Some are not content to accept of Deliverance, but even quarrel and fall out with their Preſervation; and even of thoſe who would be thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with Acknowledgment enough, there are but too many who ſeem deſirous to leſſen the Number. Every Party among us would pretend to engroſs all the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to it ſelf, excluſive of all others; and the Diſputes on this <hi>Head</hi> are not more common, than they are eager

and provoking. 'Twere well the Pretence were as <hi>honeſt</hi> as it would ſeem, though ſurely 'tis not much, the wiſer for being ſo confining. But 'tis rather to be fear'd, that particular Intereſt, and a mutual Oppreſſion are the only real Aims at the bottom of ſuch Diſtinctions; while the very Name of Party is induſtriouſly and very revengefully kept up among us, to the apparent Hazard of reducing us back again to all that Diſorder and Confuſion, from which we have been ſo wonderfully reſcu'd. In the mean time, the Common Enemies of both our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Civil Rights, are intent more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to widen our Differences, and watchful to find their Account in our Diviſions. When the Enemy is at the Gate, 'tis time, one wou'd think, to be united; but we have never had the ſenſe to do ſo, till he was enter'd the City.</p>

               <p>God grant that we may all know, and do in this our day, the things that belong to our Peace; to the Quiet and Security both of our Religion and Government: That we may be ſlow to anger, ready to forgive, overcoming evil with good, ſpeaking evil of no man, and, by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour and Eternal Life, thro' the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. To whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcrib'd, as is moſt due, all Glory, Honour, Power, Might, Majesty, and Dominion, now and for ever.</p>
