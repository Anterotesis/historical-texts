            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Humble Addresse of John Musgrave,
To the Supreme Authority, The Parliament
of the Common Wealth of England.</head>
            <head type="sub">To the Right Honourable William Lenthall, Speaker to
the Honourable House of Parliament; and to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Member thereof.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore this Parliament begun, I suffered not
a little, lost the favour and friendship of
my great kindred, for asserting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Liberty against the arbitrary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the corrupt Judges in the case of
Ship-money.</p>
            <p>Upon the Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as a witnesse, attended upon my own charge;
and then it was said, I did the Parliament an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
service, as my Lord Commissioner <hi>Whitlock</hi> well
remembers. Upon my return into the Country after
the said Earl's Tryal, I was committed to <hi>Carlisle</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle
by Sheriff <hi>Dikes;</hi> because I gave evidence again
the Earl upon his Tryal.</p>
            <p>Upon the late King's leaving the Parliament, and
going to <hi>York,</hi> I was accused and committed for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109173:2"/>
for my affection to the Parliament. Afterwards
for refusing the Oath of allegiance, and for adhering
to the Parliament, I was condemned <hi>in premunire,</hi> to
forfeit lands and goods, and to be imprisoned during
life, and a hundred pound, after I got my liberty, was
bidden by Sir <hi>Philip Musgrave,</hi> to bring me in alive or
dead, and the little estate I had, then seized on, and
my self declared Traytor. I was forced to flye into
<hi>Scotland</hi> for my life, (the Parliament having no Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
near us) where I lived in exile two years, untill
our Country was reduced to obedience of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I discovered the treachery of Sir <hi>Wilfride Lawson,</hi>
and others intrusted for the Parliament, who (while
I attended here) betrayed the Country twice into
the enemies hand.</p>
            <p>While I was prisoner to the Parliament in the <hi>Fleet,</hi>
I did give intelligence to the Armies Agitators, and
otherwise was useful to the Army, as Col. <hi>Saxby,</hi> and
Lieut. Col. <hi>Joyce,</hi> can give accompt of, which the
L. General took special notice of, upon his coming
up to the Parliament against the City: And the L.
General upon his march for <hi>Scotland,</hi> recommended
my petition to Mr. <hi>Weaver,</hi> to present to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi> going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> could not
do it.</p>
            <p>Upon special order from the Councel of State, I
brought in my exceptions to the now Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmes against the Parliament. The other day, they
suffered 26 men, to carry away Colonel <hi>Henningham
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109173:2"/>
Steward</hi> from <hi>Rose</hi> Castle, within two miles of <hi>Carlisle,</hi>
without resistance, though they had timely notice
of it, and none of the enemies forces within 30 miles
of <hi>Carlisle;</hi> which as they are treacherous, discover'd
them also to be base and cowardly.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners for the Militia in <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
are also Commissioners for sequestrations, and for
Ministers, who protect Delinquents from sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and keeps in their places malignant and disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Ministers.</p>
            <p>That by an order of Parliament (made the 18. of
<hi>February,</hi> 1650.) for concealed delinquents in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
the Parliament and Common Wealth will be
cheated of five thousand by year, if the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for sequestrations in Cumberland (as that order
directs) have the disposing of the concealments; the
Commissioners for sequestrations there being Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
and sequestrable.</p>
            <p>That most of the Delinquents in the North, who
have compounded at <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Hall, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
at far under-valewes; and more concealed
not compounded for: But all such as sollicite for
the Common Wealth, receive such discouragements
from the Commissioners at <hi>Haberdashers</hi> Hall, as few
men will make any further discoveries: If desired, I
shall particularize wherein.</p>
            <p>That some in the <hi>North</hi> have compounded with
Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerigg,</hi> and paid their Fines, yet their
estates are kept under sequestration, and the Comm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>missioners
for compounding, will not give order <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
delayes, to the great oppression of such.</p>
            <p>That I have brought in to the Common Wealth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109173:3"/>
by discoveries, (upon my own charge) four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds by year, whereof the Common wealth
is now actually possessed; And my discoveries not
perfected, I will undertake if finished, will amount
unto above ten thousand pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> But
untill I have my petition read, in Alderman <hi>Allan</hi>'s
hand, I am wholly disabled, as discouraged, further
to proceed therein.</p>
            <p>If you refuse to receive our petitions, remove De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
out of the Militia, bring to examination
our complaints, as those under you in Authority
have in the Northern parts, from time to time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
and given us up to the enemy; and by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
enriched themselves: Pardon my boldnesse, we
cannot but impute the fault hereof to you, and you
will make your selves guilty of the losse, harm, and
bloud, the enemies shall do and shed in this Nation;
our Country being a door or inlet for any enemy.</p>
            <p>If you will revoke your Order of the 18. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,
1650. I will undertake without any charge
to you, out of the moyeties of my discoveries, to raise
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>000 l. for a manufacture in <hi>Cumberland;</hi> and 1000 l.
for the distressed well-affected there; and will raise
and maintain 200 horse with their Riders, under
faithful Commanders, whom the Generall shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of; the other moyety of the discoveries to
come into the publick treasury, the fifths for my
travel and charges onely deducted.</p>
            <p>If you approve not of this, then pardon all our
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orthern Delinquents; for better so, then the
whole profits of them, to be swallowed up by a few
malignant men, who enrich themselves thereby, and
cheat the Common Wealth of thousands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:109173:3"/>
Whereas it may be objected, multiplicity of State-businesse
hinders private to be heard by you.</p>
            <p>1. I answer, our noble General and the Officers
of the Army, upon complaint from Country men of
disorder in any Souldier, might give the like answer;
but we see not the least offence upon that accompt
passed by, but examined, and severely punished;
and thereby it is the best ordered disciplin'd Army
that ever <hi>Europe</hi> had.</p>
            <p>2. I observe not withstanding the objection, the
great and eminent Lawyers of the House, for a ten
shillings fee, will wave all State businesse in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and attend at the Bar of any Court in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Hall, and so whole Termes, and take their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulations
for money with the Judges in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Circuits.</p>
            <p>3. I see and observe, Cavaleers and Delinquents
frequently and daily have their petitions read, and
ready dispatches, without any long attendance: so
publick businesse is but pretences and meer excuses,
no reality or weight in it.</p>
            <p>We have none sitting in Parliament for <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
but Sir <hi>John Ipsley,</hi> who never to this day preferred a
petition for any well-affected in <hi>Cumberland;</hi> but
ready ever to serve Cavaliers and Delinquents here,
I will forbear to say more, in hope he may grow
better, as older) and Alderman <hi>Allan,</hi> who hath such
great imployments and State-businesse, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mind us.</p>
            <p>I never sought nor affected a place or office, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever will. I never had sallery or profit for any
service I ever did you. Many grow rich by your
offices, I desire to recover my own by your Justice,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109173:4"/>
whereby I may be the better enabled to serve my
Country: And if my petition in Alderman <hi>Allan</hi>'s
hand may be read, as I doubt not your Justice, so
the Commons will be benefited thereby, many
thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>Being friendlesse and meanlesse, otherwise then
by this addresse to come unto you. If any man
of honour, upon reading the same, consider
mine and my Countries condition procure us
right and justice, I shall be thankful, and blesse God
for it; till when, I will live in hope, and ever be as
I write,</p>

            <p>UPon your return from <hi>London</hi> the last Michaelmas Term
we were much gladded the Councel of State was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to hear you upon your exceptions to the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Militia, and for their Declaration to redress
our grievances complained of by you in your Remonstrance
(but when we understood that Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the same men whom you excepted against, not only to
be Commissioners for the Militia, but for the Ministery) we
were cast down, conceiving the Enemy to be potent and
prevailing more on you, because of your negligence, though
formerly you have been very active and suffering for your
Countrey, yet in this we cannot but blame you, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that if the Councel of State had known what manner
of men they were, how disaffected to the present Parliament,
either Cavaliers, or of the Scottish faction, not one of them
would have been approved by the Councel of State, unless
the Governour of <hi>Carlile,</hi> who in regard he is a stranger is
wholly guided by the other; As for the Militia, they pursue
not the Act, but take a disposing power of mens estates, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some the half horse, where his estate is not equal, to
such they impose but a third part: And for the Ministry,
they approve of few or none, but such as be either of the
Scottish faction, and raylers against Independents, or if worse
may be, such as are Malignants and Royalists; but for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men they cannot abide, such they remove and put out
of the Ministry under the name of Sectaries and Independents;
as Mr. <hi>Lampit,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baggerley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wharton;</hi> if any be for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109173:5"/>
the Presbytery, though he deny the Ingagement, approved
of, and allowed, our Justices of the Peace do impose book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing
upon some of the States friends, and for denying
of the same do fine them in ten pounds, threatning them,
and scoffing and calling as they think good. Mr. <hi>Musgrave</hi>
be not weary of well doing, though you have no money nor
wages from us, slight us not, it concerns you neerly; If the
enemy be thus holden up, you can expect little ease, and less
security; therefore as you tender your owne welfare, and
your friends peace, be not sluggish, or longer silent, but stand
for the cause of God and his people; Be bold, it will be
your honour, whatsoever the success be, trust God: Sir,
however bad our condition is, we will not cease to trouble
you, hoping you will take in good part what we have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
you will not forsake your suffering friends, or in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
leave us under our enemies hands; Let the God of
power inable you to finish what ye have begun for the good
of his Church and people in these parts, to whose protection
and care we recommend you and our cause, this 31. of the
Ninth moneth, 1650.</p>
