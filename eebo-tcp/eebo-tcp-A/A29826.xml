            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>A Great part of theſe Papers were Printed eight years ſince, and ſome of them have ſeen the light no leſs than twelve: But ſince that the Copies have been diſpoſed of, and the Impreſſions ſold, the <hi>Bookſeller</hi> hath thought fit to Reprint them together. In order to which, whilſt he gave me the Opportunity to read them over, I could not omit the making of divers Additions, and adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Journey through the delightful Country of <hi>Lombardy:</hi> Calling to mind the Magnificence of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, and the Remarkable Actions of great Men in thoſe Quarters. Whereby I might give a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtrange Fate and various Revolutions of divers of their ancient Cities. As to the natural Curioſities and Obſervations in the firſt parts, it would be unneceſſary to make any Introduction, they having now run through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands. I can only ſay, that what you had in ſcattered parts before, are here compacted together in one intire Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and hope for the ſame kind Acceptance. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Cuts are increaſed, and the Figures of divers Habits, Medals and Antiquities, added: The Particular Deſcription of which, in this <hi>Preface</hi> would prevent the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of conſidering them in their proper places; to which I ſhall refer you, wiſhing you the ſame pleaſure in viewing them there, that I have had formerly in beholding them in their due Situations, and in the Contemplation and Deſcription of them afterwards.</p>

THE General Deſcription OF HUNGARY.</head>
               <p>HOW far <hi>H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NGARIA</hi> exceeds other Countries of <hi>Europe</hi> in Mines, Baths and Mineral-waters; becauſe I have elſewhere given a particular account of ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I ſhall at preſent omit their repetitions, and at this time add ſome other Conſiderables; and in the firſt place ſay, That it aboundeth not only in thoſe, but is alſo the beſt Rivered Country in <hi>Europe:</hi> nor doth any Region thereof afford ſo many noble and uſeful Streams.</p>
               <p>On the Eaſt ſide it is waſhed with that Noble and Navigable River <hi>Tibiſcus,</hi> or the <hi>Teiſſe,</hi> ariſing in the Country of <hi>Maromorus,</hi> at the foot of the high <hi>Carpathian</hi> Hills: which, having received the <hi>Mariſcus</hi> or <hi>Mariſa,</hi> and many Rivers into it, runneth into the <hi>Danube,</hi> between <hi>Varadine,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Belgrade.</hi> By this River comes down the great quantity of natural Stone-ſalt, brought from many Salt-mines in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> whereof a great part is brought up the <hi>Danube</hi> to all Places, as far as <hi>Presburg;</hi> (it being prohibited to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried any higher) leaſt it ſhould hinder the ſale of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Salt, upon which the Emperor hath an Impoſt, and no ſmall quantity alſo down the <hi>Danube,</hi> and afterwards up the River <hi>Morava</hi> into <hi>Servia</hi> and neighbouring Countries.</p>
               <p>On the Weſt ſide runs the River <hi>Arabo</hi> or <hi>Rab,</hi> riſing in <hi>Styria,</hi> and running into the <hi>Danube</hi> by <hi>Javrinum</hi> or <hi>Rab.</hi> A conſiderable River receiving the <hi>Lauffnitz, Pinca, Guncz,</hi> and other Rivers into it. And now lately more famous for the defeat of the <hi>Turks,</hi> under <hi>Achmet</hi> the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> by the Imperial Forces, at St. <hi>Gothard,</hi> nigh this River. The diſcourſe hereof was freſh, when I was at the City of <hi>Rab:</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I found, who ſaw the Corps of Men and Horſes floating in that Stream.</p>
               <p>Upon the Southern Parts are conſiderable, the River <hi>Dravus</hi> or <hi>Drau,</hi> which ariſing in the Territory of <hi>Saltzburgland,</hi> a part of old <hi>Noricum,</hi> runs a long courſe through <hi>Carinthia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and falls into the <hi>Danube</hi> near <hi>Erdoed,</hi> or old <hi>Teutoburgium;</hi> after it hath paſſed from its head about three hundred Miles. About its entrance into <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> it receiveth into it the long River <hi>Mur;</hi> and, far above this, nearer its original I found it a conſiderable Stream: having paſſed the ſame by a good Bridg as high as <hi>Villach</hi> or <hi>Villaco,</hi> and between <hi>Clagenfort</hi> and Mount <hi>Leubell</hi> in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> I paſſed the ſame alſo by two long Wooden Bridges, and an Iſland in the middle between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:66078:4"/>
On the ſame ſide is alſo the noble River <hi>Savus,</hi> or the <hi>Sau;</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> entreth the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Belgrade;</hi> continuing a long courſe of about three hundred Miles, and ſwelling by the acceſſion of many good Rivers. Being at <hi>Carnodunum</hi> or <hi>Crainburg,</hi> an handſom Town, not far diſtant from the Head, it appeared a conſiderable Stream; which is afterwards ſo enlarged, as to have remarkable Iſlands in it, as that of <hi>Metubaris,</hi> to the Weſt of old <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and that of <hi>Segestica</hi> or <hi>Siſſeck,</hi> by <hi>Zagrabia,</hi> containing of old a ſtrong and famous Town; unto which the old <hi>R mans</hi> brought their Commodities from <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and ſo by Land to <hi>Labach</hi> or <hi>Nauportus;</hi> from thence unto <hi>Segestica,</hi> and forwards, for the ſupply of thoſe Provinces and their Garriſons and Forces in them. Between theſe two noble Currents of the <hi>Dravus</hi> and the <hi>Savus,</hi> lyeth a fair and long <hi>Inter-amnian</hi> Country, wherein <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent choſe a ſafe retreat, until he came to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade:</hi> when, with about four hundred thouſand Men, which he brought to take <hi>Vienna,</hi> he dared not to meet the Forces of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, then encamped before that City.</p>
               <p>Upon the North part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> are the Rivers ariſing from the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains, which divide <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary;</hi> more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the River <hi>Gran,</hi> which runs into the <hi>Danube,</hi> over againſt <hi>Strigonium</hi> or <hi>Gran;</hi> and alſo the River <hi>Waag</hi> or <hi>Vagus,</hi> which comes in above <hi>Comara:</hi> which <hi>Stuckius,</hi> an ocular Witneſs, conceiveth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual the <hi>Po</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> I am ſure, at <hi>Freiſtat,</hi> above fifty Miles, before it diſchargeth into the <hi>Danube,</hi> it is a very large Stream, and hath a long Bridge over it; part whereof was broken down by the Ice, the ſame year when I was there. And far above it, nearer the head, there is alſo a conſiderable Bridge at <hi>Trenſchin,</hi> a fair Town, which gives the name unto that Country, and much reſorted unto for its hot Baths and Mineral Waters; having no leſs than thirty two plentiful Springs.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Danubius</hi> or <hi>Thonau</hi> continues its Stream quite through <hi>Hungary;</hi> and no one Province hath a larger ſhare of it; for account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the City of <hi>Vlme</hi> in <hi>Swabenland</hi> or <hi>Suevia,</hi> where it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be Navigable, it continues a long courſe, paſſing by <hi>Ingolſtad, Ratisbone, Straubing, Paſſau, Lintz</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> unto <hi>Presburg;</hi> from whence through <hi>Hungary</hi> it makes a courſe of above three hundred Miles, before it paſſes by <hi>Belgrade:</hi> To omit the long Stream thereof in its farther progreſs, when having waſhed the Shoars of <hi>Servia, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, Wallachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> with many mouths it entreth the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine</hi> or <hi>Bla k-Sea:</hi> having in this long paſſage drank in above ſixty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rivers; and in ſober account performed a courſe of above fifteen hundred Miles. Whereby it may tolerably admit the double name of <hi>Danubius</hi> and <hi>Ister,</hi> properly applyed unto diſtinct Parts thereof.</p>
               <p>So that, altho I have ſeen the <hi>Danubius,</hi> for about ſeven hundred Miles; yet cannot tell, whether I may certainly ſay, that I have ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of <hi>Ister.</hi> For <hi>Strabo</hi> aſcribes that name unto it, below its <hi>Cataract,</hi> or great fall, which happenes about <hi>Axiopolis,</hi> in <hi>Moeſia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, or <hi>Bulgaria.</hi> But <hi>Appianus,</hi> and later Account, define it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at its concurrence with the <hi>Savus</hi> at <hi>Belgrade:</hi> and if ſo, yet we had but a ſhort ſight of the <hi>Iſter;</hi> which travelling more up into <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> we were fain to leave at <hi>Hiſſargich.</hi> And of this <hi>Iſter</hi> or lower part of the River, many things are ſpoken and related by the Ancients, which are not ſo plainly verifiable of <hi>Danubius.</hi>

               <p>As this Country excels in Rivers, ſo has it alſo many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and long Bridges. There is a long Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Danube,</hi> between <hi>Strigonium</hi> and <hi>Barchan,</hi> which is the firſt Bridge on this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which we meet with from the great Wooden Bridge at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which takes above two thouſand Trees to plancher it. Upon the ſhoar of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s <hi>Iſland</hi> by <hi>Virouichitz,</hi> I took notice of a ruine of Stones, where the <hi>Turks</hi> told us, there had been formerly a Stone Bridge: but the <hi>Turks</hi> in theſe Parts, think it beſt to make Bridges of Boats; which they ſo handſomly contrive, as to open a paſſage for Boats and Veſſels of burthen to paſs; ſo that he that beholds thoſe in theſe Parts, will not wonder at the Bridges of Boats at <hi>Rouen,</hi> and <hi>Grenoble</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Between <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Pest,</hi> there is a Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Danube,</hi> where it runs all in one Stream, of above half a Mile long, the beſt I have ſeen of this kind; and if <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had lived to effect his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, of making a notable Stone Bridge in this Place, there had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly been no Bridge in <hi>Europe</hi> to compare with it. There is alſo a Bridge at <hi>Calocza,</hi> formerly an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi>'s Sea, and a handſome and well-contrived Bridge, by <hi>Walcovar</hi> over the River <hi>Walpo.</hi> But that of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> or <hi>Murſa</hi> of old, is ſcarce to be parallel'd with any other; built partly over the <hi>Dravus,</hi> and partly over the <hi>Fenns,</hi> which are often overflowed. The Bridge is five Miles at leaſt in length, having Towers built upon it at the diſtance of every quarter of a Mile: It is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly railed on each ſide, and ſupported by great Trees, erected under it; nine or ten in a rank, unto each Arch. That part of the Bridge, which was built over the <hi>Dravus,</hi> was burnt down by Count <hi>Nicholas Serin,</hi> in the late <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Wars between <hi>Leopoldus</hi> the Firſt, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the Fourth: and is now ſupplyed by a Bridge of Boats, ſomewhat below the former; which I paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>September,</hi> 1669. The <hi>Turks</hi> did not rebuild it in the ſame place, becauſe the Supporters below the Water, when the fire ceaſed, were ſo ſtrongly faſtned and hard, that it would have coſt them too great a labour to get them up. By this Bridge the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces paſs into <hi>Hungary:</hi> and at this place the unfortunate King <hi>Ludovicus</hi> thought to have ſtopped the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army which marched under <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman.</hi> And lately Count <hi>Serini</hi> undertook a long March to burn the ſame, to prevent Supplies from coming to the <hi>Viſier,</hi> who was with his Army in other parts of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as there are ſtill many Bridges over the upper <hi>Danube,</hi> ſo have there alſo been in Old time upon the lower, or <hi>Iſtrian</hi> part thereof. <hi>Darius</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> made a Bridge of Boats over that Mouth of the <hi>Iſter</hi> called <hi>Oſtium Sacrum. Nicephorus</hi> relates, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> built a Stone Bridge over it. But the moſt remarkable and admirable Bridge, was that, built by the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> and deſcribed by <hi>Dion</hi> the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian: whereof there are ſtill ſome Ruines, not far from <hi>Severin,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

twenty <hi>Hungarian</hi> Miles from <hi>Belgrade.</hi> This Bridge conſiſted of twenty Piles of ſquare Stone of an hundred foot high, beſides the Foundation: of ſixty foot in breadth, and the diſtance between each of them one hundred and ſeventy foot; and conjoyned by Arches, upon the which was this Inſcription,</p>

               <p>No River affordes ſo large and peopled Iſlands. Between <hi>Vicegrad</hi> and <hi>Vacia,</hi> there is a fair and large Iſland, called St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Iſland. Another a little below <hi>Buda,</hi> againſt the Weſt ſide of which ſtands <hi>Adom,</hi> extending forty Miles; and exceeds that of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> containing many Villages in it; upon part whereof the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces encamped, when they came to raiſe the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Siege at <hi>Buda,</hi> and was the great omiſſion and error of the Chriſtians, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified not in that Iſland.

               <p>At the Siege of <hi>Belgrade, Mahomet</hi> the great brought two hundred Ships and Gallies, well appointed, up the Stream.

By the help of ſuch Naval Veſſels <hi>Wolfgandus Hodder</hi> did a good piece of Service, when <hi>Solyman</hi> beſieged <hi>Vienna;</hi> for he came out of <hi>Presburg</hi> with armed Veſſels, and ſunk the Veſſels ſent from <hi>Buda</hi> with the great Ordnance, to batter the Walls of <hi>Vienna.</hi>

               <p>And as this Country aboundeth in Rivers, ſo is it not without ſome notable Lakes, as the Lake <hi>Balaton</hi> or <hi>Platſee,</hi> or <hi>Volcaea</hi> of old, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great length between <hi>Veſprinium</hi> and the <hi>Dravus,</hi> with ſome ſtrong Forts upon it. This Lake put a ſtop unto the cruelty of <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Souldiers, who deſtroyed all from <hi>Buda</hi> unto the Lake <hi>Balaton.</hi> And ſince it lyeth on the Eaſt of the River <hi>Leyta,</hi> we may alſo reckon in the <hi>Newſidler</hi> Sea, a pleaſant Lake, ſeven <hi>German</hi> Miles long, and three broad: ſo called from <hi>Newſidel,</hi> a ſmall Town, of one ſtreet and ſome backward Houſes, with a ſmall ſquare Caſtle upon an Hill by it, from whence I had a good proſpect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Lake. In the Commotions of <hi>Botſcay,</hi> fourteen Villages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Lake were burnt by <hi>Turks, Tartars</hi> and rebellious <hi>Heyducks.</hi> The <hi>Hungarians</hi> call it <hi>Terteu</hi> and <hi>Pliny, Peiſo.</hi> It is in the middle way between <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Sabaria,</hi> the birth-place of Saint <hi>Martin.</hi> The long extended plain of <hi>Pampus,</hi> in <hi>Paraguay</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> exceeds all others, as being two thouſand Miles in length. And I have heard that famous Navigator, Captain <hi>Narborough,</hi> ſay, who not long ſince, was Commander of the <hi>Sweepſtakes,</hi> and made a Voyage in her into the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> that there is all low Land from the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> unto the middle of the Straights of <hi>Magellan. Moſcovia</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> have long Plains, but many of them Woody, and obſcured by Trees; but none more open and clear Plains than this Country. The greateſt Plains. I have obſerved in <hi>England,</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Salisbury, Lincoln</hi> and <hi>New-Market.</hi> But theſe are but long Walks, compared with thoſe of <hi>Hungary;</hi> and are exceeded by the Plains of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from <hi>Vienna</hi> unto Mount <hi>Simmeren,</hi> unto the Borders of <hi>Styria.</hi> And though the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Hungary</hi> be hilly and plentiful in Wood; yet are there large Plains below. I travelled from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> about four hundred Miles, upon continued and not interrupted Plains; which often appeared like the Sea, without any viſible Eminencies, only a ſhort and plain Wood, by <hi>Bacna,</hi> and <hi>Shilberg,</hi> beyond <hi>Dotis;</hi> and if we reckon the full of this Plain, it will prove much longer, extending from Mount <hi>Kalenberg</hi> or <hi>Cetius,</hi> two <hi>German</hi> Miles Weſt-ward of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſo beyond <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> ſtill along the North ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> unto the Borders of <hi>Walachia;</hi> which will make a larger extent, than the famous long Walk from <hi>Agra</hi> to <hi>Lahor</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> This plainneſs of the Country, affords an handſome way of Travelling in open Chariots, carrying one or two Men with a Charioter, drawn by two or three, ſometimes four Horſes a Breaſt; and room enough to lye down. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I travelled from <hi>Buda</hi> to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> over fair large Plains; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miles upon Green-Swarthe and unworn Wayes; eſpecially in the County of <hi>Sirmium</hi> or <hi>Schremnia,</hi> as they now call it.</p>

And as this Country excels in <hi>Rivers,</hi> ſo is it very abundant in <hi>Fiſhes.</hi> The <hi>Tibiſcus</hi> or <hi>Teiſſe,</hi> is eſteemed the moſt Fiſhy River in <hi>Europe,</hi> if not in the World; inſomuch, that they have a common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That it conſiſts of two parts of Water, and one of Fiſh.</hi> And the River <hi>Bodrack</hi> which runs into the <hi>Tibiſcus,</hi> not far from <hi>Tokay,</hi> is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with <hi>Fiſh,</hi> that in the Summer when the River is low, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay the Water ſmells of Fiſh. And this is no ſmall River, but as I had the account from a Commander who purpoſely made it for <figure/> me when he paſſed it, was thirty Fathoms broad, and eight and an half deep, but being of this Figure it could not be well Fiſhed with Nets. Which exceeding fertility, if any will aſcribe unto Saline Tinctures, both of its own Stream, and others acceſſionary into it, which lick the many natural Salt-Mines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, and ſo may carry with them, or at leaſt promote ſome Principles of foecundity, may admit of conſideration.

               <p>As the Rivers are full of Fiſh, ſo are they covered with <hi>Fowl,</hi> in the Winter; <hi>Swans</hi> I obſerved none in the <hi>Danube,</hi> but many other Fowls; and ſome <hi>Pelicans,</hi> not far from <hi>Belgrade.</hi>

And before we come to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the <hi>Schlavonian</hi> enters again; which is alſo ſpoken in <hi>Servia, Bulgaria, Romania,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and in ſo many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, that with this Language a Man may make a ſhift to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from the <hi>Adriatick-Shore</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> unto the <hi>Tartarian Ocean.</hi> For we read in <hi>Purchas,</hi> that when the <hi>Hollanders</hi> returned from <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> the Inhabitants not very far off could ſay, <hi>Dobre,</hi> and <hi>Nich Dobre;</hi> that is, <hi>Good,</hi> and not <hi>Good;</hi> which are expreſſions of <hi>approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>diſapproving,</hi> in the <hi>Schlavonian</hi> Language.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power ſo much prevailing or threatning in theſe Parts; it is in vain, to expect any great <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> beyond <hi>Vienna.</hi> Nor do I find that there hath been any very conſiderable ones in this Countrey; and though they have had many <hi>Biſhops</hi> and learned Men; yet they have had their Education many of them out of <hi>Hungary.</hi> As had alſo of old St. <hi>Jerom</hi> St. <hi>Martin.</hi> And the preſent <hi>Hungarians,</hi> which addict themſelves unto Learning, eſpecially thoſe of Quality, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Study at <hi>Vienna, Prague</hi> or <hi>Breſlaw;</hi> a ſmall University, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Study there is at preſent at <hi>Schemnitz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Hungarians</hi> may juſtly boaſt of early helps unto learning, and a very noble <hi>Library</hi> erected at <hi>Buda,</hi> by their King <hi>Matthias Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus,</hi> Son of the famous <hi>Hunniades,</hi> about two hundred years ago; conſiſting of ſome thouſands of Books, eſpecially <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts not to be met with or Purchaſed elſewhere; part whereof was diſperſed into the <hi>Turkiſh Dominions,</hi> when <hi>Solyman</hi> ſurprized that City; and a choice part thereof procured afterwards, for the <hi>Imperial Library</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> when <hi>Cuſpinianus</hi> was Keeper thereof, divers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are marked with the Armes of <hi>Corvinus, a Crow bearing a Gold Ring in his Beak;</hi> which with many ſucceeding additions, made by <hi>Busbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius, Wolfgangus, Lazius, Fugger,</hi> and others; together with the choiceſt <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> brought from the <hi>Ambraſian Library</hi> near <hi>Inſpruch,</hi> by the Learned <hi>Petrus Lambecius,</hi> the preſent Library Keeper, make up the fourſcore thouſand Volumes, now contained in the <hi>Emperors Library</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> by the eſpecial Favour of which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſon, I had the honour, not only to ſee many of the choiceſt and moſt ſpecious thereof, together with many Noble Rarities in that Place; but to have any uſeful Book unto my private Lodgings. And at my coming away, he gave me a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of ſome hundreds of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymical Manuſcripts,</hi> which are in that Library, which I preſented to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> from him; with leave to have any of them brought into <hi>England,</hi> or to be Tranſcribed at <hi>Vienna,</hi> if they pleaſed. And if the three moſt admirable <hi>Braſs Statua</hi>'s of <hi>Hercules, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> which were placed at the entrance of <hi>Corvinus</hi> his Palace in <hi>Buda,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66078:8"/>
had not been carried away by <hi>Solyman,</hi> and caſt into <hi>Ordnance</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> it is not improbable, they had been by this time at <hi>Vienna.</hi> About four hundred Books, the Reliques and refuſe of the Library at <hi>Buda,</hi> were lately remaining there; where it was no eaſie matter to have a ſight of them; yet ſo careleſly kept by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that Worms, Mice and Rats were like to have the Spoil thereof. But the <hi>Fire</hi> at <hi>Buda</hi> 1669, hath now conſumed them all.</p>
               <p>And as their Language is peculiar, ſo is the Opinion of their Crown; of which they have the greateſt eſteem of any other Nation. This they commonly believe to have been brought by an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> their King: and have ſo high an eſtimation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they think, the Right and Fate of the Kingdom goeth with the poſſeſſion thereof. Which makes them very wary in the Cuſtody of it, and in all Adverſities to ſecure it. And the <hi>Turk</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways induſtrious to obtain it. It was formerly kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Vicegrad;</hi> but at preſent in that of <hi>Presburg.</hi>

                     <hi>Pineda</hi> cut of <hi>Cromerus.</hi>
                  </note> And this opinion is probably founded upon the Tradition or Story, how they came unto it; which is thus delivered. King <hi>Stephen</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſettle the Chriſtian Government in his Kingdom, appointed two <hi>Arch-Biſhops Sees; Strigonium,</hi> which was the place of his Nativity, and <hi>Colocza;</hi> and ſent <hi>Aſtricus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Colocza,</hi> to the Pope, to confirm the ſame, together with his Kingdom, and to ſend him a Crown, and other Royal Ornaments. At the ſame time it fell out, that <hi>Miſca,</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> ſent about the ſame Errant: and a Crown was providing for him. But Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> the Eight, in the mean time was warned by an Angelical <hi>Apparition,</hi> to ſend the Crown unto King <hi>Stephen;</hi> which accordingly he did, which probably begot that great Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and high Opinion, they have ever ſince had of it.</p>
               <p>The Crown it ſelf is alſo ſingular in its Faſhion and Figure; for it is a low Crown, with a Croſs upon it, with four Leaves or Turnings up about it; one whereof is as large as the other three, at leaſt as two thereof. It is no eaſic Favour to obtain a view of this Crown at <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> but I ſaw a Model of it in the Treaſure of the preſent Emperor <hi>Leopoldus;</hi> which was a Crown of Gold, adorned with many precious Stones, exactly made after the faſhion of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Crown, and perhaps richer than the exemplar.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Hungarians</hi> want not Ingenuity, Induſtry, and ſufficient parts for Learning, and liberal Arts; yet have they been more addicted unto <hi>Martial affairs,</hi> than unto deep Learning: Even the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy-men</hi> proving ſtout Soldiers; and no leſs than ſix <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſlain, with their King <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> in that fatal Battel of <hi>Mohatch.</hi>

               <p>The mighty Acts of <hi>Attila,</hi> King of this Country, together with the numerous Forces he brought out of theſe and the neighbouring parts, are very remarkable; whereby he over-ran a conſiderable part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy:</hi> Sacked and Burnt <hi>Aquileia;</hi> and fought that memorable Battel with <hi>Aetius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General, in <hi>Campis Catalonicis,</hi> near <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> wherein 'tis ſaid were ten <hi>Kings</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and about two hundred thouſand ſlain: and, which is alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, the Generals on both ſides were of theſe Parts; for <hi>Attila</hi>

               <p>This Country has given the longeſt ſtop unto the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Conqueſts, and farther intruſion into the Weſtern Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> For moſt, which they have already obtained, has been upon the advantage of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Diviſions, and their own ſubtilty and falſe practiſes; and <hi>Solyman,</hi> by ſuch falſe and low dealings, ſurprized the Capital City of <hi>Buda.</hi> And although the <hi>Turk</hi> has now obtained the beſt part of the Country; yet almoſt a third part remains out of his Power, and in obedience to the Emperor, as King of <hi>Hungaria:</hi> as almoſt all <hi>

               <p>Many <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> have honoured theſe Quarters with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Birth, Death, or great Actions.

The <hi>Roman</hi> Armies being much in this Country, no wonder it is, that ſo many <hi>Coins</hi> of <hi>Copper, Gold,</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> are to be found in it: Whereof I obtained no ſmall number at <hi>Petronell,</hi> or Old <hi>Carnuntum,</hi> which was a Part of <hi>Pannonia.</hi> And at <hi>Sene,</hi> or <hi>Senia,</hi> ſituated near the <hi>Danube,</hi> I met with very many.

               <p>Near the Town of <hi>Deva</hi> or <hi>Devas,</hi> was found great ſtore of <hi>Treaſure,</hi> by the Peaſants of the Country, under an Ancient Caſtle or Palace, all ruined and decayed.

The Storm and rage of water being paſt, and the Sun ſhining on theſe, made a marvellous glittering; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Peaſants, they remained raviſhed with joy; and taking them up, they alſo found a <hi>Golden Serpent:</hi> which afterwards Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Caſtalde</hi> ſent unto <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with a part of theſe Ancient <hi>Medals.</hi> This being an ancient Cuſtom with thoſe who buried their Treaſure, to place <hi>Serpents</hi> there, in token of a Faithful keeper. After the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants had taken, no man knew what, others took from thence more than Twenty thouſand <hi>Ducats.</hi> And the report was, that they might have taken an hundred Thouſand. For that had ſometimes been the abode of King <hi>Lyſimachus.</hi> Whereof <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had a Thouſand, and <hi>Caſtalde</hi> three Hundred. Which Coin remained in this place from <hi>Lyſimachus</hi>'s time.

The ſecond is the Water <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi> lying towards the <hi>Danube.</hi> The third is the Baſtion of the <hi>holy Hill,</hi> under which when the <hi>Turks</hi> ſprang a Mine, a Horſeman was blown off from the top of it into the <hi>Danube,</hi> without any hurt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his Horſe. The fourth is the middle Baſtion, towards the Land Eaſtward. The fifth is the new Baſtion. The ſixth is the Imperial, or Empreſs Baſtion. And the ſeventh is the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Baſtion, lying next the River <hi>Rab,</hi> where the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Governor was killed when the Town was ſurpriſed in the Night by the Chriſtians. The Country is all plain about, and there is nothing which ſeems to command it, but a ſmall Hill at ſome diſtance, which is undermined, and may be blown up upon any occaſion; beyond which there is alſo a Tower or Spy in the open Fields, to diſcover the approach of the Enemy. It was Beſieged by <hi>Sinan Baſſa,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Amurah</hi> the Third; where he loſt many Men, and at one aſſault Twelve thouſand; but at laſt was Surrendred, by the Treachery of Count <hi>Hardeck,</hi> the Governor; which coſt him his Head at <hi>Vienna;</hi> where, upon a Seaffold covered with black Velvet, kneeling by the ſide of a Table covered with a black Velvet Carpet, he laid his Hand upon the Table, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners at the ſame inſtant ſtruck off both his Head and his Hand. In a few years after, it was recovered, by a notable ſurpriſe, acted by Count <hi>Swartzenburg,</hi> and Count <hi>Palfi,</hi> with a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Turks.</hi> I ſaw a part of the Gate, which was then broken by a <hi>Petard,</hi> the ſame being ſtill kept for a Memorial, in a part of the Cathedral Church. While this place was in the <hi>Turks</hi> Poſſeſſion, they made a Dungeon for Chriſtian Priſoners, wherein there is no light, but what enters by a Grate upon the ground in the Market-place. But this is now ſeldom empty of <hi>Turks,</hi> begging the Charity of Paſſers-by, and ſelling neat Whips which they make in this their ſad reſtraint.</p>

Over againſt <hi>Strigonium</hi> lieth <hi>Barchan;</hi> between theſe two places there is a Bridge of Boats.</p>

Charles</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſworn King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> was wounded on the head by <hi>Forchatz;</hi> and being carried into the Caſtle, under pretence of laying a Plaſter on his head, was ſtrangled.

This place was ſeized upon, ſacked and burnt by the <hi>Turks,</hi> 1541. but taken by the Emperors Forces, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> in the Year 1684. after he had overthrown the <hi>Turks</hi> in Battel near the Town, but was quitted again at the latter end of the <hi>Autumn,</hi> there being a ridge of Hills near it which over-look the Town, and render it not eaſie to be defended.</p>
               <p>Here we changed our Convoy again, and paſſed unto <hi>Buda,</hi> the Capital City, and Royal Seat of the Kings of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a <hi>Turkiſh Viſier,</hi> who hath divers <hi>Baſſa's</hi> under him.

               <p>The firſt is a large open Bath at the foot of a high rocky Hill, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Purgatory, whereof the People have ſome odd and ſcrupulous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is covered with a <hi>Cupola,</hi> and ſtands nigh the ſame Hill, but more into the Town, and near a place where they uſe Tanning.</p>
               <p>The third is called the <hi>Bath</hi> of the green Pillars, though at preſent they be of a red colour, it ſtands over againſt a <hi>Caravanſara.</hi> The Water is hot but tolerable without the Addition of cold water, it is impregnated with a petrefiing Juyce, which diſcovers it ſelf on the ſides of the <hi>Bath,</hi> upon the Spouts, and other places, and makes a grey Stone: The Exhalation from the <hi>Bath</hi> reverberated by the <hi>Cupola,</hi> by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars forms long Stones like <hi>Iſicles,</hi> which hang to all theſe places.</p>
               <p>The Water is let out at night, when the Women have done bathing, who often ſtay late. The <hi>Bath</hi> is round, ſet about with large Pillars ſupporting a <hi>Cupola,</hi> which hath openings to let out the Steam, and yet the whole Room continues to be a hot Stove.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baths</hi> of the <hi>Weſt</hi> end of the Town are firſt, <hi>Tactelli,</hi> or the <hi>Bath</hi> of the Table, a ſmall <hi>Bath</hi> covered: the Water white, and of a Sulphureous ſmell; they drink of this as well as bathe in it; what they drink they receive from a Spout, bringing the Water into this place. I delivered a five-Sols piece to a <hi>Turk,</hi> who was bathing in it, to gild for me, which he did in half a Minute, by rubbing it between his fingers, while the hot Water fell from the Spout upon it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Barat Degrimene,</hi> or the Bath of the Powder-Mill, it riſes in an open Pond near the High-way, and mixes with the freſh Springs, which makes the Pond of a whitiſh colour in one part, and clear in the other; as alſo cold and hot in ſeveral parts. This convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed croſs the High-way into a Powder Mill, becomes uſeful in making of Gun-powder.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>cuzzoculege,</hi> the little Bath, or the Bath of the <hi>Saint,</hi> for which name the <hi>Turks</hi> give a ſuperſtitious reaſon: It is kept by <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monks. The Bath where the Springs ariſe, is ſo hot as ſcarce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66078:15"/>
to be endured; but being let out into another bathing place at ſome diſtance, it becomes tolerable and fit for uſe. This Water hath neither colour, ſmell, nor taſte different from common Water, and depoſeth no ſediment, only the ſides of the Bath are green, and have a fungous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all over.</p>
               <p>The fourth is <hi>Caplia,</hi> a very noble Bath, but part of the Buildings was conſumed this year, 1669. by a great Fire that happened in <hi>Buda,</hi> but is ſince repaired by the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Water is very hot, not without a petrefying Juyce in it. The Building about is eight ſquare, with a noble Bath in the middle, with a Circle of a Trench of Water about it for the better Ornament, to bathe the feet in; on every ſide it hath a <hi>Niche,</hi> wherein is a Fountain; in the middle of the Anti-Chamber, where they leave their Cloths, there is alſo a fair Stone Baſon and a Fountain.</p>
               <p>The fifth is the Bath of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>elibey,</hi> which hath a ſtrong ſulphureous ſmell; and a petrefying Juyce in it, and is ſo hot, that to make it tolerable it requires the addition of cold Water; this is the nobleſt of all. The Anti-Chamber is ve y large, the Bath-Room capacious, and high-Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adorned with five <hi>Cupola</hi>'s; one a very fair one over the great round Bath in the middle; and one leſſer over each of the four corners, where are either Baths, or Bath-ſtoves for private uſe: in theſe the <hi>Turks</hi> take off the hair of their Bodies by a <hi>Pſilothrum</hi> mixt with <hi>Soap:</hi> it being not their Cuſtom to have any hair, except their Beards. Twelve Pillars ſupport the great <hi>Cupola,</hi> between eight whereof are Fountains of hot Water, and between the others are places to ſit down, where the Barbers and Bath-men attend; and each of theſe places has two Ciſterns of <hi>Free-stone,</hi> into which are let in hot Bath-water, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cold Water, to be mixed and tempered as every one pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Men bathe in the Morning, and Women in the Afternoon. When any man intends to bathe, having entred the firſt Rooms, he finds there divers Servants attending, who furniſh him with a Cloth and Apron. Then he puts off his Cloths and having put on the Apron, he enters the ſecond Room, wherein is the great Bath, and ſits on the ſide of the Bath, or between the Pillars near a Fountain, where the Barber ſtrongly rubs him with his hand opened, ſtretching out his Armes, and lifting them up; after which the Party bathes. Then if he be a Subject of the grand <hi>Seignior</hi>'s, or it be the Cuſtom of his Country, he hath his head ſhaved, and if a young man, his beard, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the upper Lip; next the Barber rubs his Breaſt, Back, Armes, and Legs, with an hair Cloth, while he either ſitteth, or lieth with his face downward, then waſhes his head with <hi>Soap,</hi> and after throws cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon him, all over his Body, and then he walks in the ſteam of the Bath for a time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> call this City <hi>Offen,</hi> and ſome will have it founded by <hi>Buda,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Attila,</hi> the Famous King of the <hi>Hunnes.</hi> And to ſpeak the truth among all the numerous Countries, and Places Conquered by that Warlike Nation, they could not chooſe out indeed a nobler Seat to build a City in, where, beſides the advantage of their natural Baths and Stoves, this being placed upon the Banks of the greateſt River in <hi>Europe,</hi> where it runs in one entire Stream, and the City riſing up by degrees to the top of Hills, affording from moſt Streets of the Town, a Proſpect of twenty Miles or more, on the other ſide of

               <p>Over againſt <hi>Buda,</hi> upon the <hi>Eastern-ſhoar</hi> of <hi>Danubius,</hi> ſtands the City <hi>Peſt,</hi> being Quadrangular and ſeated upon a Plain: and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The habit of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Women ſeemed new and ſtrange to me: Breeches almoſt to their feet, a kind of Smock over them, and then a long Gown with their Head-dreſs, which ſetches about, covering their face, except their eyes, and makes them look like Penitents: but it was not unpleaſant unto me, as taking away the occaſion of Pride and Folly: though otherwiſe it can have no good grace in a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's fancy.</p>
               <p>During our Stay at <hi>Buda,</hi> we went into a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Convent, where the Prior or Superior called <hi>Julpapa,</hi> or Father of the <hi>Roſe,</hi> with ſome of his Brethren brought us into a large Room like a Chappel, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us with Melons and Fruit: at parting, we gratified them with ſome pieces of Silver, which were kindly accepted. The <hi>Julpapa</hi> had his Girdle or Ceinture emboſſed before with a whitiſh Stone, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the palm of my hand, which was <hi>Galactites</hi> or <hi>Milk-ſtone;</hi> whereof they have a great opinion, becauſe in their belief, <hi>Mahomet</hi> turned a whole River in <hi>Arabia</hi> into this kind of <hi>Stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We lodged at an old <hi>Raſcians</hi> houſe, where we were well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; having from it a fair Proſpect over the <hi>Danube,</hi> the long <hi>Bridge</hi> and <hi>Pest,</hi> and a good part of the Country. Divers <hi>Turks</hi> and ſome <hi>Chiauſes</hi> reſorted unto us, where they were treated to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Maſter of the Houſe was thought to hold ſecret corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friar of <hi>Peſt,</hi> and to give intelligence of Occurrences unto the Miniſters of State at <hi>Gomora, Rab,</hi> and <hi>Vienna;</hi> he prevailed with me to pen a Letter in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian;</hi> wherein I was not unwilling to gratiſie him, becauſe it contained nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an account of ſome Priſoners, and the encroachment of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> Merchants upon the Trade.</p>
               <p>As we were riding in the City, divers of the common <hi>Turks</hi> murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we ſhould ride, where they went on foot. But I was pleaſed to ſee many <hi>Turks</hi> to ſalute Seiginor <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the Emperors Courrier, in our Company, and to take his hand, and put it to their foreheads,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66078:16"/>
but was much more delighted with the courteous entertainment of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan Ephendi,</hi> a perſon of note, and who had been an Envoy extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at <hi>Vienna.</hi> He received us in an handſom large Room, and treated us with great kindneſs; ſaying, that he deſired our company, not to any Feaſt, but to a Treat of Affection and Reſpect; ſuch as might declare, that we had converſed like friends, and eat and drunk together; he called for a ſtool, that I might ſit down, it being then uneaſie to me to ſit croſs-legged, and asked me, whether I would learn the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, or whether I would go to the Port, and how I liked <hi>Buda,</hi> and among other queſtions, asked, what was the King of <hi>Poland</hi>'s name? and when I told him, <hi>Michael Wiſnowitski;</hi> his reply was ſ mewhat ſtrange unto me; ſaying, <hi>Michael,</hi> that's a good name, that's the name of the greateſt Saint in Heaven, except <hi>Mary;</hi> and ſo having entertained us, he diſmiſſed us with good wiſhes. At our return to this place, after two days ſtay, the Governor ſent us with four and twenty Horſe Souldiers into Chriſtendom again, theſe guarded us with great care, a day and a night, till they ſaw us ſafe at <hi>Dotis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now leaving <hi>Buda,</hi> we travelled by Land Eaſtward; and paſſing by the ruines of the King of <hi>Hungary</hi>'s Mint-houſe, by <hi>Ham Zabbi Palanka,</hi> and by <hi>Erzin,</hi> we came to <hi>Adom,</hi> in <hi>Turkiſh, Tzan Kurteran,</hi> or <hi>anima liberata,</hi> ſo named by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent; becauſe, in his haſty retreat from <hi>Vienna,</hi> he firſt made a quiet ſtop at this place, and there could think himſelf ſecure from any purſuit of the imperial Forces. This place was afterwards taken by <hi>Graff Palſi,</hi> from thence we came to <hi>Pentole</hi> or <hi>Pentolen Palanka.</hi> This or <hi>Adom</hi> is conceived to be the old <hi>Potentiana,</hi> where the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> invading thoſe parts, fought a bloody Battel with the <hi>Romans,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Macrinus</hi> and <hi>Tetricus,</hi> but were overthrown.</p>
               <p>From hence to <hi>Fodwar,</hi> in ſight of <hi>Colocza,</hi> ſeated on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> in the road to <hi>Temeſwar,</hi> formerly an Arch-Biſhops See; whereof <hi>Tomoreus</hi> was Biſhop, whoſe raſhneſs conferred much unto the loſs of <hi>Hungary,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Mohatz.</hi> Then by <hi>Pax</hi> or <hi>Paxi</hi> unto <hi>Tolna,</hi> formerly <hi>Altinum</hi> or <hi>Altinium,</hi> where the <hi>Hunnes</hi> being recruited, fought a ſecond Battel, obtained the Victory, and expulſed the <hi>Romans,</hi> though not without the loſs of forty thouſand of their own men. This hath been a very great place, but burnt by the Chriſtians. The <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Raſcians,</hi> who inhabit here, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in no good agreement.</p>

From thence by <hi>Setzwar</hi> to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſeck,</hi> where we travelled by night, and had a Horſe-guard of <hi>Spahies,</hi> till we came to <hi>Setz,</hi> a large Town; where I obſerved the ruines of an old Caſtle, and a round Paleſado upon the Hill.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo a new <hi>Chan</hi> or <hi>Caravanſara;</hi> then to <hi>Mohatz.</hi> Before we came to this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we paſſed by a ſmall Bridge over the Brook <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe;</hi> which, upon great rains, over-flows the Neighbour parts; near which <hi>Ludovicus</hi> the unfortunate King of <hi>Hungary</hi> periſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtifled in a muddy place, where his Horſe plunged, after the Battel fought with the Forces of <hi>Solyman,</hi> on the other ſide of the Town.

We went to ſee the place, where ſo noble a Prince loſt his life, and an inconſiderate Battel loſt the Crown of <hi>Hungary.</hi> This Battel was fought the 29th day of <hi>October,</hi> in the Year 1526. <hi>Cotriſcus,</hi> who was near the King's Perſon when he was drowned, related the manner of it to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and ſhewed them the place where he fell in, from whence the King's Body was afterwards taken up entire, and carried to <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> where with great Solemnity it was buried among the Sepulchres of the other Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>

               <p>From hence by <hi>Barinowar Darda</hi> or <hi>Draza</hi> unto <hi>Eſſeck</hi> or <hi>Oſſeck,</hi> conceived to be old <hi>Murſa,</hi> or not far from it.

But that which is moſt remarkable here, is the well contrived Bridge of Wood, made partly over the River <hi>Dravus,</hi> and partly over the Fenns adjoyning, being five Miles long: being rayled, and having Towers at every quarter of a Mile: that part over the River <hi>Dravus,</hi> was burnt down by Count <hi>Nicolas Serini,</hi> in the laſt Wars, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther built ſince. He that beholds this Bridge, the Towers of Wood upon it, the ſtrong rayles and floar, and the numerous ſupporters of it, cannot but wonder, how they ſhould be ſupplied with Wood to build it, or maintain it. But hereof I ſpeak elſewhere, this is the greateſt Paſſage in <hi>Hungary,</hi> from <hi>Servia,</hi> and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. Had this been well defended, when <hi>Solyman</hi> invaded <hi>Hungary,</hi> he had not probably obtained ſo eaſie a March unto <hi>Buda.</hi> And to hinder the Supply of the Grand <hi>Viſiers</hi> Army from other parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> Count <hi>S rini</hi> burned down that part, which was built over the <hi>Dravus;</hi> and in his return burnt <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae</hi> or the City of five Churches, which lieth Weſtward from <hi>Eſſeck.</hi>

Arriving at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> I paſſed by the Water Caſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards by the upper Caſtle, both large, and having many Towers; The Streets, where the greateſt Trade is driven, are covered over with Wood, as in divers other Trading Places; ſo that they are not offended with the Sun, or Rain. They conſiſt commonly of Shops which are but ſmall; and no other, than a Taylors Shop-board, placed low; upon which, after the ſame manner, the Shop-keeper ſits, and ſelleth his wares to his Chapman without, few or none entring in. I ſaw alſo two large places built of ſtone, like unto the Exchange with two rows of Pillars over one another; but they were ſo full of Merchants Goods, that they loſt much of their beauty. There are alſo two large <hi>Bezeſtens,</hi> or places, where the richeſt Commodities are ſold. They are built in the form of a Cathedral Church, and within are like to the old Exchange, above ſtairs. The Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> hath built a noble <hi>Caravanſara</hi> in this City, with a Fountain in the Court, and near unto it a <hi>Moſchea,</hi> with a Fountain before it: which was the firſt <hi>Moſchea,</hi> which I had the opportunity to ſee within-ſide. He hath alſo built a <hi>Metreſeck</hi> or College for Students, I ſaw a Stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Although near to moſt Towns there be Sepulchres to be ſeen, yet I obſerved them to be moſt numerous at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> as being very populous, and the Plague having been lately in it.</p>
               <p>We lodged at an <hi>Armenian</hi> Merchant's houſe, where we were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly accommodated. And we viſited divers others, who had built them fair houſes; one, in which there was a Fountain and handſom Bath, and Stoves, where we wanted not <hi>Coffee, Sherbet,</hi> and excellent Wines; ſuch as the Neighbour Country affords. Theſe <hi>Armenians</hi> are diſperſed into all Trading Places, and have a Church here at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and ſeem to be more plain dealing, and reaſonable men to buy any thing of than either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Countries about have a great Trade unto this place: the <hi>Raguſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Trade here, and the Eaſtern Merchants of <hi>Vienna</hi> have a Factory in this City. And ſurely <hi>Belgrade</hi> is as well ſeated for Trade, as any in-land place in <hi>Europe,</hi> for being ſituated upon the Confluence of the <hi>Danubius,</hi> and the <hi>Savus,</hi> having the great River <hi>Tibiſcus</hi> running into the <hi>Danule</hi> near it; the <hi>Dravus</hi> not very far from it, and the River <hi>Morava</hi> not far below it; the <hi>Danube</hi> alſo flowing forward unto the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, it may hold no uneaſie Commerce with many remote parts. And <hi>Servia</hi> being a fruitful and pleaſant Country conſiſting of Plains, Woods, and Hills, which might afford good Metals, not without ſtout Men, good Horſes, Wines and Rivers, if it were in the Chriſtians hands of the temper of thoſe in the Weſtern part of <hi>Europe,</hi> it might make a very flouriſhing Country.</p>
               <p>This place hath formerly been the Bulwark of <hi>Hungary,</hi> in vain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond, and again by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, who was repulſed by the valour of <hi>Hunniades,</hi> and the Auxiliaries, raiſed by Friar <hi>Capiftranus:</hi> when <hi>Hunniades</hi> iſſuing forth, and encamping out of the City, beat away the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces with great ſlaughter: where <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf was wounded in the breaſt, loſt his Ordnance, and two hundred Ships were overthrown, by a Fleet, which came from <hi>Buda;</hi> but, being unprovided, it was ſince taken by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, in the ſecond Year of his Reign, in the Year of our Lord 1521. and in no likelihood to be recovered.</p>

Leaving <hi>Belgrade,</hi> we proceeded in <hi>Servia,</hi> and pa ſſed by a very high Hill, called <hi>Havilleck,</hi> on the South or right hand, where are ſtill the ruines of an old Monaſtery, and came unto <hi>Hiſſargick,</hi> nigh the <hi>Danube;</hi> which, in Maps, is commonly placed too far from it.

me in mind of the ſwiſt River <hi>Varus,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which I paſſed on Horſe-back, with two men going by me, on the lower ſide ſhoving up my Horſe leſt the current ſhould bear him down.

Not far from this River, was that great ſlaughter of the <hi>Turks</hi> by <hi>Hunniades;</hi> who, with ten thouſand Horſe, ſet upon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp by Moon-light, ſlew thirty thouſand, and took four thouſand Priſoners, victoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning unto his Camp.

The Prieſt, being of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſpake <hi>Latine,</hi> which is a Language not ordinary in theſe parts; and enquiring of me after La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Books, I preſented him with one, called <hi>Manuductio ad coelum,</hi> which he kindly accepted, and gave me a wrought-coloured Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſome little things of thoſe parts. They had alſo a Phyſician, who had ſome knowledge of Simples and ordinary Compoſitions. His manner was to go into the Market-place every morning, and invite all perſons, who ſtood in need of his aſſiſtance, to reſort unto him.</p>
               <p>From hence we came to <hi>Leſcoa,</hi> or <hi>Leſcovia,</hi> where I could obſerve little, beſides a large Tower, which ſeemed to be ancient, but without Inſcription. We paſſed much of our time at a great Fair, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be at that time kept in a large encloſed place, with great reſort of People; where I thought it ſeaſonable, to preſent the <hi>Chiaus</hi> with a Feather; he having loſt his the day before, and we found ſome want thereof, for hereby we travelled with more Authority through all places.

               </p>
               <p>The next day we travelled over the Mountain <hi>Cliſſura,</hi> one of the Spurs or Excurſions of Mount <hi>Haemus.</hi> We were much ſurpriſed at the gallant appearance thereof, for the Rocks and Stones of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhine like Silver, and by the light of Sun and Moon, (for I paſſed it once by day and another time by night) afforded a pleaſant glittering ſhow, as conſiſting of <hi>Muſcovia</hi> glaſs, whereof I brought ſome home with me.

The Hills between <hi>Servia</hi> and <hi>Macedonia,</hi> are a part of Mount <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> which, under ſeveral names, is thought to extend from the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> to the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea; admitting of ſeveral paſſages, which <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> took a ſpecial care to ſhut up againſt the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations. Which when he had done, he thought himſelf ſecure: and that from thence no Enemies could come at him, except they drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the Clouds. Some have thought, that from the middle Peaks of <hi>Haemus</hi> a man might ſee both the <hi>Euxine</hi> and <hi>Adriatick</hi> Seas; and King <hi>Philip</hi> made tryal of it: but we find not, that he ſatisfied his curioſity therein; nor do I think any hath done it.

               <p>Then through a Plain Country we came to <hi>Monaſter</hi> or <hi>Toli,</hi> a great Place, well peopled, and pleaſantly Seated.

We proceeded over dangerous Rocks, in narrow hanging ways ſtill on Horſe-back; although we had little pleaſure to look down the Precipices on one hand, and ſee the Carkaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Horſes in ſome places, which had fallen down and broke their necks.

From hence paſſing over a River, we entered into a round Plain, of about five Miles over; with divers Towns pleaſantly ſeated in it. Then over an Hill again, which is a Spur of Mount <hi>Olympus;</hi> upon the top whereof an old Man ſtood beating of a Drum, to give notice unto Paſſengers on both ſides, that thoſe parts were free from Thieves. From this Hill as we deſcended, we had a good Proſpect of the Plains<note place="margin">Pharibus.</note> of <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> and at the foot of it we turned to the left, and paſſed over a River, which runs from under a rocky Mountain, not in ſmall Springs, but the whole body of the River together; and then through Vineyards, and Cotten Fields, to <hi>Tornovo,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where the <hi>Ottoman Court</hi> reſided: of which places we ſhall ſpeak more hereafter.</p>
               <p>In our return, we left the road, about <hi>Kaplanlih,</hi> and turned unto <hi>Skopia,</hi> a City of great Trade, and the largeſt in theſe parts. <hi>Scopia</hi> or <hi>Scupi</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> named <hi>

In the Court-yard of the <hi>Emir</hi>'s Houſe, ſtands a remarkable and peculiarly contrived Fountain, in manner of a Caſtle, ſet round with many Towers, out of the tops whereof the Water ſprings forth. Their beſt Houſes are furniſhed with rich Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to tread upon: and the Roofs divided into Triangles, Quadrangles, and other Figures fairly gilded, and painted with ſeveral Colours, but without any Imagery or Repreſentation, either of Animal or Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>We proceeded forward to <hi>Preſtina,</hi> a good Town, and where we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good accommodation; but having entered into a fair Room, we found a man lying down in it ſick of the Plague.

               <p>
                  <hi>LARISSA</hi> is the chief City of <hi>Theſsaly,</hi> ſeated by the River <hi>Peneus,</hi> the chief River of that Country. Upon the North it hath the Famous Mountain <hi>Olympus,</hi> and on the South a Plain Country. It is now inhabited by <hi>Chriſtians, Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> hath fair <hi>Bezeſtens,</hi> divers <hi>Turkiſh Moſchea's,</hi> and Chriſtian Churches in it. It is pleaſantly ſeated, and upon a riſing ground: on the upper part whereof ſtands the Palace of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> which he hath made uſe of during his reſidence in this place: it is contrived with jetting large Windows, on four ſides, near which he took his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, and paſs-time, according as the Wind ſerved, or afforded the beſt ventilation.</p>
               <p>It is alſo an Arch-Biſhop's See, having divers Suffragan Biſhops under it. The Reverend Father <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was then Arch-biſhop. The Church of St. <hi>Achilleus</hi> is the Cathedral, where I heard Divine Service, the Arch-biſhop being preſent, and ſtanding in his Throne in his Epiſcopal habit, and his Croſier in his hand; when three or four of us Strangers came into the Church, he ſent one to fume us with Incenſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> kept his Court in this place for ſome years, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> and for the great convenience of Hunting and Hawking, wherein he exceedingly delights.

               <p>In the hot and dry Summer 1669. the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> paſſed above two months of that Seaſon upon the Neighbouring Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> partly that he might have a large Proſpect over the Plains, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The <hi>Sultan,</hi> who is a deſperate rider, killed one of his beſt Horſes; by forcing him up a noted Peak of the Mountain, called <hi>Pythagon</hi> or <hi>Kiſsagon,</hi> where few or none could ſollow him; he was alſo ſo daring, that he would have leaped on Horſeback over a Fiſſure or Cleft in the Rocks in a bravery; and was ſcarce with-held from that bold attempt, by the prayers and importunity of his chi f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> (who are forward to magnifie the Concerns of their Country,) ſpeak highly of Mount <hi>Olympus:</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> would have it to be the habitation of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the Gods, and to be without Clouds; but unto me ſome part of the <hi>Alpes</hi> ſeem much higher; and I have ſeen Clouds above it; and in <hi>September</hi> there appeared no Snow upon it, which the high Peaks in the <hi>Alpes, Pyrenaean</hi> and <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountains, beſides many others in <hi>Europe,</hi> are never without. And <hi>Olympus</hi> alſo was plentifully ſupplied with it upon the firſt Rain that fell in that Country; it not being unknown to you, I ſuppoſe, that when it rains upon the Valleys, at the ſame time it ſnows upon high Mountains; and this Hill I muſt confeſs to be viſible at a great diſtance; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it from <hi>Ecciſſo Verbeni</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſeventy miles from it; and it conſiſts not of one riſing Peak, as it is ſometimes deſcribed, but is alſo extended a great way in length, and makes good the Epithere of <hi>Homer, Longum tremere fecit Olympum.</hi> If the word be there taken, nor<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

               <p>This Hill chiefly extending from Eaſt to Weſt makes the Inhabitants, at the foot of the North and South ſides, to have a different temper of Air, as if they lived in Climes much diſtant; which makes the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Lucan</hi> very Emphatical:

               <p>Before the Battle of <hi>Pharſabia,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> delivers, <hi>Scipio</hi> lay with a Legion in this City; and this was the firſt place, unto which <hi>Pompey</hi> retired, after his Overthrow; according to that of <hi>Lucan.</hi>

               <p>And not ſtaying there, he went along the River; and taking Boar, went out to Sea, and was taken in by great Ship, then ready to weigh Anchor.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Peneus,</hi> which runs by <hi>Lariſsa,</hi> is the chiefeſt in <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly,</hi> and into which moſt of the other Rivers run; ariſing from Mount <hi>Pindus;</hi> and running into the <hi>Sinus Thermaicus,</hi> or Gulf of <hi>Salonichi,</hi> paſſing by the famous Valley of <hi>Tempe,</hi> and running between Mount <hi>Olympus</hi> and <hi>Oſſa,</hi> into the Sea.</p>
               <p>In that famous Expedition against the <hi>Graecians, Xerxes</hi> would have made his entrance by this way: for <hi>Herodotus</hi> delivers, that he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Thermae,</hi> now <hi>Salonichi,</hi> unto the mouth of the River <hi>Peneus;</hi> to obſerve, if there were any paſſage, or any could be made, to enter into <hi>Theſſaly;</hi> and finding, upon enquiry, that the River had no other paſſage, and that it could not be turned: he ſaid, That the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> had done wiſely to yield, and make their peace with him; for, by ſtopping of the River <hi>Peneus, Theſſaly</hi> might have been drowned.</p>

               <p>There is an handſome Stone Bridge over this River, conſiſting of Nine Arches; and peculiarly contrived with holes and paſſage in the ſolid parts between the Arches, to afford ſome paſſage unto the water, when it is high; and hinder the bearing down of the Bridge, in high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and great floods.</p>
               <p>The City being full, many <hi>Turks</hi> had their Tents in the Fields, by the River ſide, and lower Grounds, which being of various colours, and not far from a large <hi>Moſchea,</hi> and the City, afforded a pleaſant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. The Sails of their Tents were ſo ordered, that they came not within a yard of the ground: ſo that the Air might freely enter into

               <p>The neareſt conſiderable Port unto <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> is that of <hi>Vollo,</hi> or old <hi>Pagaſa,</hi> in the <hi>Sinus Pagaficus,</hi> or <hi>Demetriacus,</hi> or Gulf of <hi>Armiro:</hi> not far from whence ſtood old <hi>Argos Pelaſgicum;</hi> from which place the <hi>Argonauts</hi> firſt ſet ſail, in that famous Voyage for <hi>Colchos,</hi> by which way the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> received intelligence from <hi>Candia,</hi> and his <hi>Aſian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Dominions.

               <p>It was no hard matter to have a ſight of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> at this place; for he rode out often, for his recreation of hunting and hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with great number of Attendants, and Huntſmen, and Falconers, in their proper habits: and alſo went frequently to the great <hi>Moſched.</hi> I had a full view of him, as he came out of his Palace, to go unto his devotion.

Many brave Horſes were led after him, and divers perſons followed, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Cuſhions and Pillows to the <hi>Mofchea.</hi> Before he came our of his Palace, I obſerved many gallant Perſons in the Porch, which the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> who walked with me, told me, were perſons of the greateſt quality in <hi>Turky.</hi>

               <p>The Place was alſo extraordinary populous: there being at that time ſuch a mixed multitude in it. Yet was the City in very good order,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66078:25"/>
and quietneſs. An Officer with a Club in his Hand, accompanied with about twenty Perſons, walking about the Streets, and puniſhing all Perſons drunk, quarelling, clamorous, or acting any thing againſt good Manners.</p>
               <p>When I was there in <hi>September</hi> 1669. it was very hot Weather, and many were ſick of Fevers and Agues; as they were at that time in moſt Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and at my return into <hi>England</hi> I found many languiſhing under Quartan Agues, who had been taken therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time. They were then alſo in their Vintage, and we had the opportunity of taſting their Muſt and New Wine; and the ſtricter <hi>Turks,</hi> who would not be tempted with Wine, would be much deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to take a little in the Muſt.</p>
               <p>During the hot ſweating Seaſon, we went often to the Barber, who would handſomely perform his Work, and much to our refreſhment; trimming every Man according to the Faſhion of his Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> have a place, of the bredth of a Dollar, leſt bare upon the top of their Crowns; and then let the Hair grow round it the bredth of two Fingers, more or leſs; after which they ſhave all the reſt of their Head, and wear it bare.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Croatian,</hi> hath one ſide of his Head ſhorn, and the other ſide is neither ſhorn nor cut, but the Hair is let to grow as long as it will. The <hi>Hungarian</hi> ſhaves his whole Head, except his Fore-top. The <hi>Polander,</hi> wears his Hair ſhort cut, ſo as it comes down to the middle of his Fore-head, and the middle of his Ear. The <hi>Turk</hi> ſhaves his whole Head, except a Lock upon his Crown. The <hi>Francks</hi> ſhave not their Heads, but wear their Hair long, as with us, only for the more amicable converſe, and that nothing about them might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to thoſe, whom they live amongſt, they often tuck it up under their Caps. The <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſts, alſo neither ſhave nor cut their Hair, but wear it as long as it will grow; and many of them have thick heads of Hair; but thoſe, that have leaſt, receive moſt refreſhment here. The Party to be ſhaved, ſits low; and the Barber has the better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to ſhave much at one ſtroke, he lays on very much Soap, and holds his Raſor as a Knife, and in a few ſtrokes finiſhes his Work. There is a Veſſel of Water with a Cock hanging over their Heads, which the Barber opens as he pleaſes, and lets fall the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In one of theſe Barbers ſhops in the City of <hi>Lariſſa</hi> I ſaw an ancient large Tomb of ſtone of a <hi>Jaſpis</hi> green colour, a noble Monument, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken little notice of there, and the Barber had cauſed a hole to be digged through the top ſtone, and put Water into it, and made it to ſerve him for a Ciſtern.</p>
               <p>I was in ſome doubt, how we ſhould be accommodated for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of our Ducats, Dollars, and other money we brought with us; but we found ready accommodation therein from Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, who ſit in the Market-place for ſuch purpoſes, to change them into Medines, Aſpers, and five ſols Pieces, whereof there was plenty in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>The great trading Streets were covered, as in other great <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Towns; the Shops are ſmall, but well furniſhed; wherein hang all Commodities, which may be had in a larger manner, if deſired.

               <p>Though I have been much pleaſed at the ſight of the fine Stables of Horſes of many Princes in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as at that of the <hi>Louvre</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Vice-Roy's of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s noble Stable at <hi>Dreſden,</hi> and Count <hi>Walleſteyne</hi>'s at <hi>Prague</hi> in the laſt of which each Horſe hath a Marble Pillar by him, eats his Provender out of a Manger of poliſhed Marble upon a Pedeſtal of the ſame, placed in a <hi>Nicchio,</hi> in which hangs alſo his rack of hammered Steel, and over his head on one ſide his Picture as big as the life. Yet thoſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Horſes, I beheld at <hi>Lariſſa</hi> were ſurprizing unto me, choſen from all parts of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; which were ſo richly equipped with Bridles and Saddles ſet with precious Stones, and withal ſo tender mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tractable, that it was a great delight to behold them. I ſaw ſome <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſes, which are of ſingular eſteem, for hardineſs, laſting, and ſwiftneſs, but unſightly, and promiſe little, and when <hi>Cha Gagi Aga,</hi> Ambaſſador from the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> preſented ſome of them to the Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> at firſt ſight I thought them but a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful preſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Merchants ſome of them learn the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, in order to their Commerce: which makes that Language of good uſe unto a Traveller in theſe parts, where <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> are in a manner uſeleſs.

               <p>I was in <hi>Theſſaly</hi> at a very dry ſeaſon, and ſome conſiderable Rivers were low, and ſmall ones dry, yet one I obſerved about ſeven Miles on this ſide <hi>Tornovo,</hi> to flow plentifully from under a rocky Mountain; not in ſmall ſprings or ſtreams; but the whole body of the River came from under the Hill. The Country however in general was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot and dry, and I could not but think, what a different face it now had, from that, in the time of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> King of <hi>Theſsaly;</hi> when that memorable deluge happened in this Country, which ſome affirm, to have laſted a whole Winter; occaſioned by ſome ſtopping of the River <hi>Peneus,</hi> and its current into the Sea; into which River moſt of the others run, and ſo an inundation muſt follow in ſuch a Country as <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> which is plain, and encompaſſed with Hills. And ſome alſo conceive, that in the firſt times all this Country was under water, till an Earthquake divided the Mountains of <hi>Oſſa</hi> and <hi>Olympus,</hi> and made a free paſſage for <hi>Peneus,</hi> to paſs by <hi>Tempe</hi> into the Sea. In <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> between <hi>Comonava</hi> and <hi>Filurina,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ecciſſo Verbeni,</hi> where I ſaw plentiful Springs of Mineral waters, I had alſo a Proſpect of two great Lakes; one whereof the People have a Tradition, that it firſt happened by taking great ſtones out of the ſide of a Mountain; whereupon there iſſued out ſuch a flood of water, as to drown the Country about, and to cauſe a Lake.</p>
               <p>As I travelled in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the <hi>Chiaus</hi> told me, that within two days he would ſhow me <hi>French</hi> men, whereby he meant the Country People of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> from ſome likeneſs of their Caps with ſmall brims, to the little Hats lately in faſhion.</p>

The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> have been a warlike Nation, and are ſtill a ſtout Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>The Country of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> ſeemed the more conſiderable to me, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it hath formerly been the Seat of great Actions, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many worthy Perſons; and particularly, becauſe the famous <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> the Father of Phyſicians lived and practiſed here, as may be collected from the Oration of his Son <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> and the Narration of his Life by <hi>Soranus,</hi> annexed to his Works; wherein it is delivered That he lived in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and was warned by a Dream to abide in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               <p>The <hi>Theſſalians</hi> are an handſom race of People, having black Hair, black Eyes, and their Faces of a freſh and florid ſanguine, much like our freſh Complexions in <hi>England:</hi> ſo that Strangers much admired the Women, and ſpoke often of the <hi>bel ſangue de' Greci,</hi> or fair blood of the <hi>Graecians.</hi> The <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who live in hilly Countries, are of a coarſer Complexion: and the <hi>Moreans</hi> or <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> who live more South-ward, incline unto a ſwarthineſs.</p>
               <p>They have always had the name of good Horſe-men, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſtill abounds in good Horſes.

               <p>The Country produces very large, fair, and delicious Figs, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melons, the largeſt and moſt pleaſant I have taſted; which were very refreſhing unto us; as alſo fair and delicate Pomegranates, Orainges, Limons and Citrons, Vines, which are low, like thoſe about <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> and not ſupported; but the Branches and Cluſters great, and the Grapes as big as good Damaſens, and of a delicious taſte.

               <p>They plant Tabaco, and eſteem it better, than what is brought from other Parts, as being more ſtrong and pungent. The Fields are ſpread with <hi>Seſamum</hi> and <hi>Cotton Trees;</hi> but the Trees grow low, yet make a fair ſhow.

the Font or Baſon is generally made of plain Stone, and placed low upon the Floor of the Church; and this is more convenient for them, in their baptizing of Infants.

               <head>SOME OCCURRENCIES AND OBSERVATIONS IN THIS JOURNEY.</head>
               <p>IT is no unpleaſant ſight to behold a new Scene of the World, and unknown face of things, in Habits, Diet, Manners, Cuſtoms and Language. A Man ſeems to take leave of our World, when he hath paſſed a Days journey from <hi>Rab</hi> or <hi>Comorra:</hi> and, before he comes to <hi>Buda,</hi> ſeems to enter upon a new Stage of the World, quite different from that of theſe Weſtern Countries: for he then bids adieu to Hair on the Head, Bands, Cuffs, Hats, Gloves, Beds, Beer: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon Habits, Manners and courſe of life; which with no great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, but under ſome conformity, extend unto <hi>China,</hi> and the utmoſt Parts of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though we were pretty well ſecured by Authority for ſafe Travel, yet we were not without fear of the <hi>Huſsars,</hi> till we came to <hi>Eſſeck</hi> Bridge, over the River <hi>Dravus:</hi> for they are active Perſons; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Language, will boldly range about for Booty, as far as that noted Paſs; and, knowing all By-ways, will rob and ſpoil whom they meet, eſpecially the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
               <p>Nor were we without fear alſo of <hi>Gypſies,</hi> who are ſtout and bold, and ſome of them have been noted Robbers. There are many of them in <hi>Hungaria, Servia, Bulgaria, Macedonia;</hi> and ſome I ſaw at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>TheBaly.</hi> They are in moſt Towns, and live by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and handy-craft Trades; many of them colour their Hands and Feet of a reddiſh colour, with <hi>Cnà,</hi> and think thoſe Parts ſuffer leſs from the Cold thereby. Some <hi>Gypſy</hi> Women colour the ends of their Hair alſo. Though they be remotely diſperſed, yet they are thought to have had their beginning about <hi>Wallachia,</hi> and the adjoining Parts, many of them are conceived to be Spies unto the <hi>Turk.</hi> A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I came to <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> by <hi>Freiſtadt,</hi> a great drove of them appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe Parts; which the People ſuſpected to be Spies of the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> to take notice of the State of thoſe Parts, and how that Fort proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:66078:30"/>
Travelling from <hi>Belgrade</hi> into <hi>Servia,</hi> we were in ſome danger of being robbed: for we perceived three Horſe-men to ride very faſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us; and, when they had over-taken us, they rode about us, wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Lances, and diſcharged their Piſtols; but the <hi>Chiaus</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be <hi>Spahies,</hi> ſhowed his Feather, and ſaid to me, diſcharge one of your Piſtols at random, and let them know, we are not unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at which they went off, and we ſaw them no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caravanſara's, Chan's,</hi> or Places of publick Lodging, built by Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, we liked not ſo well as private Houſes; and therefore, being but few in Company, ſeldom lodged in them, for they are wide Rooms, and we muſt provide for our ſelves therein; and ſometimes they are dangerouſly ſeated, ſo that it was not fit to adventure our ſelves therein, for fear of being robbed; for though Robberies be ſeverely puniſhed, yet are they frequently committed; and <hi>Gypſies</hi> are well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that Trade; and therefore, in order to the ſafety of Travellers, Drummers are appointed in dangerous Paſſages; and in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> in a narrow Paſs, I ſaw an old Man beating a Drum upon the ridge of a Hill; whereby we had notice, that the Paſſage was clear and free from Thieves.</p>
               <p>We had the advantage of good Accommodation for Travel, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Comora,</hi> our Boat was towed by a <hi>Saick</hi> of twenty four Oars; <hi>Hungarians</hi> rowing upon one ſide, and <hi>Germans</hi> on the other; till we came to <hi>Motch,</hi> the Frontier Town, where we had a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Convoy; who faſtning our Boat to their <hi>Saick</hi> with eighteen Oars, rowed down the <hi>Danube,</hi> we carrying the Eagle on our Flag, and the <hi>Turks</hi> the double Sword and Half-moon, and paſſed by divers remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Places to <hi>Buda,</hi> from whence we had good Accommodation for Travel to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> by open Chariots, with two, three or four Horſes on breaſt; which with great ſpeed conveyed us through that pleaſant plain Country, and from thence through <hi>Servia,</hi> and other Provinces, we were furniſhed with very good Horſes, which would travel at a good rate twenty Miles in a Stage, and were very ſure of foot; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I had good experience, when in ſome Parts we travelled over great Hills, unequal and craggy Places, and over the bare Rocks. They are very free, and therefore the Owners of the Horſes took acceptions at our Spurs, which are ſeldom uſed by them, and the <hi>Turks</hi> had none, but what we brought, and gave them. They are very tractable and tender mouthed; and when we mounted or alighted, would hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly apply themſelves to ſuch Places; and when we walked, ſome of them would follow us without leading. They have a lighter and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Shooe than our Horſes; and when they have ſhod one foot, they take up the foot againſt it, and ſetting the other upon a Block of three inches high, they pare it.</p>
               <p>They have very good Horſes in moſt of theſe Countrys, and very fleet, but they never dock them, but their Tails grow out at length, and ſometimes they handſomly make them up: and in their Journeys they often alight from them, and ſtrongly pull at their Fore-top or forehead-lock, and think that doth much refreſh them, which the Strangers who travel here call <hi>Croatian</hi> Provender.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſsa</hi> of <hi>Temeſwar</hi> preſented <hi>Ragotzi</hi> with a Horſe, which <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotzi</hi> ſlighting cut off the Horſe's Ears, Main and Tail, and ſent him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66078:31"/>
back again. This perhaps would have been thought an Ornament to an Horſe in <hi>England:</hi> but the <hi>Baſsa</hi> took it as ſuch an affront to his, that he never ceaſed from ſtirring up the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and other Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and never forgave the Injury, but by the help of the <hi>Turk, Tartar, Emperor, Poles</hi> and <hi>Ragotzi</hi>'s own Country-men alſo, he wrought at laſt his Ruine.</p>
               <p>For their feeding, they make no high Mangers or Racks, to pull down thir Food; but, obſerving the Rule of Nature, lay their Hay low before them, and almoſt even with the Ground; which in long neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Animals, may be the moſt commodious way, they are lodged hard, and often with little covering. At <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where the Town was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with Horſes and Camels: the Yards of the Houſes were full of them, and Places made at the bottom of the Wall for their Food.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Caravanſara's</hi> the Horſes are tyed to a ringle, faſtned unto the ſide of a long Place, a little elevated, upon which the Travellers take their reſt; and the Hay was laid a little below our feet, whereon the Horſes feed.</p>
               <p>They plow more with Oxen than Horſes, and eſpecially with <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felo's;</hi> and have great variety of Ploughs and Carts; ſome whereof I could not but take notice of in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> made with Wheels, not conſiſting of Spoaks, but of ſolid Wood, in the whole piece; whether ſo contrived for ſtrength, in thoſe rocky Countries, where they muſt ſtrike and force upon ſuch inequalities, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>We were furniſhed with ſmall things to oblige the People where we paſſed: and in Houſes where we entred, many would welcome the Emperor's Courier, and ask him what he had brought for them. We pleaſed them with Sciſſors, Knives; and they would be content, if we gave a Glove to one, and the fellow to another. To the Women we gave ſmall pieces of <hi>European</hi> Coines; and I was much thanked by a <hi>Bulgarian</hi> Woman, for a bright <hi>cinq ſols</hi> piece, which ſhe added to the dreſs of her Head, over her Fore-head, with other Coins ſhe had there before; ſome of them wearing Duckets of Gold, and Pearl, and Stones of value upon that Part, which make no unhandſom ſhow.</p>
               <p>Being only careful to keep our ſelves from Thieves, we expected no ſuch trouble, as we found from Wolves and Dogs, in our Journey about the Mountains in <hi>Servia;</hi> and eſpecially in large Woods, we were continually alarmed by Wolves, eſpecially in the Night; when they ſeldom ceaſed to howl in great numbers, and not far from us; ſo that we were forced to be ſolicitous in our Guard, and to keep cloſe together. And as the Wolves were troubleſome, ſo alſo the great number of Dogs in thoſe Parts were very offenſive to us. As ſoon as we came near any Town, or left it, they came out, running at us, barking and biting the Horſes legs, and in Houſes would be barking and ſnarling, ſo that without a Cudgel it was not ſafe going into the Yard. And it ſeems impoſſible, that theſe Towns ſhould be ſurprized by the moſt ſilent Enemy, without having good notice thereof by Dogs: and ſure, they are kept to this intent. For as ſoon as the Sun ſets they begin to bark and ceaſe not till the Morning. The Town of St. <hi>Malo's</hi> in <hi>France</hi> is alſo guarded ſomewhat after this manner, where they turn the Dogs out of the Town at Night, and are as ſecure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66078:31"/>
as if they had an army of Watchmen to guard them. Some ſuch trouble from Dogs I remembred, that I had met with at the ſtrong Town of <hi>Komara,</hi> when I came into the Town about Midnight, which was ſo full of Dogs fiercely barking and running upon us, that to ſave our ſelves, we were fain to take ſhelter in the <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> till a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was provided for us.</p>
               <p>I could not but pity the poor Chriſtians, ſeeing under what fear they lived in thoſe Parts; when I obſerved them to make a way, as ſoon as they perceived us coming towards them. In <hi>Macedonia</hi> the Men and Women would betake themſelves into the Woods to avoid us; and we took the pains ſometimes to ride after them, to undeceive them of their folly and needleſs Frights.</p>
               <p>But that which moved me moſt, was the pitiful Spectacle of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Slaves, which are often met with in thoſe Countries; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the variety of their hard Fates and Accounts, how they fell into that Condition; ſome by Treachery, ſome by Chance of War; others by Plagiary and Man-ſtealing <hi>Tartars,</hi> who plentifully furniſh the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominion; ſome fixed to one Maſter, others having been ſold unto many, and at diſtant Places. But their Condition is moſt deſperate who are Slaves to the Court, and belong to the <hi>Grand Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignior:</hi> for they are never to be redeemed. Of which kind I met with one at <hi>Egribugia</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> attending at the poſt-houſe; who though he had no hard Office, yet was extremely dejected upon this misfortune of Non-redemption.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Theſſaly</hi> alſo I met with one <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> who had been a Slave to ſeveral Perſons, and in ſeveral Countries. He was an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> born at <hi>Gran,</hi> and taken at the Battle of <hi>Barachan,</hi> under Count <hi>Forchatz,</hi> in the laſt Wars; firſt ſerved a <hi>Turk,</hi> then ſold to a <hi>Jew,</hi> who proved a hard Maſter, then to an <hi>Armenian;</hi> under whom he ſo well acquitted himſelf, that his Maſter gave him his freedom, and he made a ſhift to come to <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where the Emperor's Reſident entertained him. I was very much pleaſed with his Converſation, being a worthy, honeſt and good natured Man; and had maintained his Chriſtianity in his ſeveral Fortunes. He ſpoke <hi>Hungarian, Sclavonian, Turkiſh, Armenian</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:</hi> ſhew'd me the Draughts of many Monaſteries, Abbies, <hi>Moſchea's,</hi> and conſiderable Buildings in <hi>Armenia, Perſia</hi> and <hi>Turkey:</hi> and I hope by this time he is in his own Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> who are well acquainted with the Captives of ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, make obſervations of them: ſo they ſay, a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> is beſt for the Oar, a <hi>Georgian</hi> makes a good Courtier, and an <hi>Albanian,</hi> a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor. A <hi>Turk</hi> in our company, obſerving a <hi>Georgian</hi> Captive much dejected at his Condition, encouraged him, and bid him be of good cheer; telling him he might come to be a great Man, and one of the beſt in <hi>Turky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt time I went to have a ſight of the <hi>Grand Seignior, Oſmund Chiaus</hi> made no great haſte forward, and when I asked him the reaſon, he replied, I take no great pleaſure to be too near him: and afterwards when he talked of ſome <hi>Baſſa's,</hi> who had been ſtrangled, and I added, that in this reſpect he lived more happily than any <hi>Baſsa:</hi> he ſaid, ſuch things muſt be patiently put up, all our Lives are in the <hi>Sultan's</hi> hands: in your petty Kingdoms and States, Men are Tryed and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66078:32"/>
but our great Empire cannot be ſo maintained, and if the <hi>Sultan</hi> ſhould now ſend for my Head I muſt be content to lay it down pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, not asking wherefore: and I remember his Words were that in this Country we muſt have, <hi>patienza fin a perder la teſta, e poi pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> patience even to the loſs of our Heads, and patience after that.</p>
               <p>We had frequent Memento's of Mortality, by Graves and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, as we paſſed; eſpecially near <hi>Belgrade.</hi> For the <hi>Turks</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly buried by the High-ways: yet their Tombs are not ordinarily ſplendid, conſiſting only of a Stone erected at the Head and at the Feet: yet ſome ſet up Stones of two, three or four yards high. Some have a Turbant carved upon the Stone, at the Head; and others ſet up two Pillars of Stone; ſome proceed farther, and raiſe the Sepulchres, as with us, and afterwards place two Pillars upon them, one at the Head, and another at the Feet. At <hi>Scopia</hi> I ſaw fair ones, after this manner, and two Sepulchres in one of them: but the beſt way I obſerved in theſe Parts, is by building a Pavillion ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by four Pillars. As we travelled to the South from <hi>Jagodna</hi> in <hi>Servia,</hi> I ſaw upon the ſide of a Hill, a large <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tomb, about four yards long, and a ſquare place covered by it, which the <hi>Chiaus</hi> told me was the Tomb of one of their Saints, and accordingly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Devotions at it, and at other Places: on Thurſday Nights and Friday's, I obſerved the Women to viſit the Sepulchres, and pay their Devotions at the Tombs of their dead Friends.</p>
               <p>This Gigantick Saint that lay buried here, was certainly a fit Man in his time to wield the holy Club, with which the <hi>Turk</hi> does propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his Religion and Dominion, and if he were as long as his Tomb, he was as formidable a Perſon as any of the <hi>Patagonian</hi> Gyants painted upon the Southern Part of divers Maps of <hi>America</hi> with long Arrows in their Throats. I muſt confeſs it ſeems ſtrange to me that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man ſhould be extended to that height. Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, who hath made very fair and accurate Maps of the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan,</hi> the Iſlands therein, and the Coaſt from the River of <hi>Plate</hi> to <hi>Baldivia,</hi> in the South-ſea, told me that he had ſeen divers Graves in the Southern Parts of <hi>America</hi> near four yards long, which ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him the more, becauſe he had never ſeen any <hi>American</hi> that was two yards high, and therefore he opened one of theſe long Sepulchres from one end to the other, and found in it a Man and a Woman, ſo placed, that the Womans head lay at the Mans feet, and ſo might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably require a Tomb of near that length.</p>
               <p>But to return into the rode for our diverſion, we ſometimes met with <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fairs, which are ordinarily kept in ſome large ground, encloſed and divided into Streets and Paſſes, according to the variety of Commodities to be ſold, where a Man may recreate himſelf with multiplicity of Fripperies, and things different from thoſe of our Parts, and cannot want variety of Muſick; which, though but mean, proved ſome diverſion unto us. The firſt Fair we met with, was at <hi>Leſcoa</hi> or <hi>Leſcovia,</hi> upon the River <hi>Liperizza</hi> in <hi>Servia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was no ſmall comfort to us, to find the Country ſo free from the Plague, which we only met with at <hi>Preſtina,</hi> a large Town, on part of the Plains of <hi>Coſſova,</hi> when we came into that Place, we were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a very good Houſe, and brought into a large Room, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66078:32"/>
with Carpets and other Ornaments; where we found a <hi>Turk</hi> lying ſick of the Plague. The <hi>Chiaus,</hi> after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Humor, made nothing of it; but ſome others were not ſo contented; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we removed and travelled in the Night, till we came to a <hi>Gyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie's</hi> Houſe amongſt the Hills, where we were well accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> were much pleaſed to ſee me write; when I came into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Houſe, I pulled out my Paper-book to ſet down what I obſerved; which when they perceived, they would come about me, taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Paper, and binding of the Book, wondring to ſee me write ſo faſt, and with ſuch a Pen, which was made of a Gooſe Quill, they uſually writing with a hard Reed, cut like our Pens. Many carry about them an handſome braſs Ink-horn, which they hang by their ſides; their Ink is good, Paper ſmooth and poliſhed; whereon they will write very fairly, as I have to ſhow in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Paſs, which I brought home with me.</p>
               <p>When I found occaſion, I uſed to look upon ſome Maps, which I carried with me: whereat <hi>Oſman Chiaus</hi> ſmiled, ſaying, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Maps; they ſet down only great Towns, and often falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Chiauſes</hi> are able to make the beſt Maps, who paſs their Days in travelling Countries; and take notice of all Places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and know their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Names; and in many particulars I found ſome truth in his Words; for the Maps of <hi>Hungary</hi> are not exact; thoſe of <hi>Servia, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia, Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly</hi> very imperfect. In upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> many Towns are omitted, many ill-placed; in the lower alſo not a few. The <hi>Danube</hi> ſeems to fetch about too much to the South-weſt, before the <hi>Tibiſcus</hi> enters into it. In <hi>Servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Hiſſargick</hi> is placed too far from the <hi>Danube,</hi> which runnes by it. I find no mention of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupia</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchoop,</hi> of <hi>Leſcoa</hi> or <hi>Leſcovia,</hi> conſiderable Towns; the laſt upon the winding River <hi>Liperizza:</hi> nor of <hi>Kaplanly</hi> or <hi>Tigres</hi> Town, in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> nor of <hi>Kupruly</hi> or <hi>Bridge-Town;</hi> nor of <hi>

And he that travels in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> will never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reconcile the Poſitions of Rivers and Towns to their uſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in Maps, although not long ago there have been large ones publiſhed of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66078:33"/>
ſit down with them, then offer me <hi>Coffee,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Tabaco,</hi> and at Meals invite me to eat heartily; only in ſome places, the Boys, and meaner ſort of People would call me <hi>Saſhtlu gaur,</hi> or haired Infidel. And a <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> whom I had employed to buy ſome little things for me; and I ſaying, they were too dear, gave me ſome ill Language, which ſo diſpleaſed ſome that were by, that if the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> had not been in perſon in the Town, they would have taught him other manners.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> took much Tabaco in the Countries which I paſſed, and many carried little bags thereof by their ſides, which they take in pipes of an ell long, made of an hard reed, and an earthen head at the end, laying one end on the ground, and holding the other in their mouthes. I did ſeldom take any; but to comply with their kindneſs, I would not refuſe it; and by reaſon of the length of the pipe, it was cool, and leſs diſturbing; they take it alſo often in ſnuff. <hi>Seignior Gabriel,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Courier would tell them many ſtories; and while he was ſpeaking, they would come about him, and liſten very attentively: and he would pull out his ſnuff-box, and put ſnuff-powder into their noſes, which they would take very kindly. They would be always gazing upon the Emperor's Armes cut in a Stone, which he wore upon his breaſt; whereupon he would take occaſion to magnifie the Emperor, deſcribe the multitude of Provinces ſubject unto him; and any thing that might confer unto his honour, whereof they would take great notice.</p>
               <p>I liked well the neatneſs and cleanlineſs of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with, and their waſhing of their feet, hands, and faces, though they had ſome purifying conceit thereof; while we travelled, the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> at the fight of a Spring, or clear water, would often alight, and waſh himſelf; and every morning was very curious in winding up his Turbant, and combing of his beard; and would ask me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were well done. When they go to the houſe of office, they carry a pitcher of water with them; they affect privacy when they make water; which they perform, reſting upon one knee, and ſtretching out the other leg. Walking in <hi>Lariſſa</hi> with the <hi>Chiaus,</hi> the Streets being narrow, and full of people, and remembring the ſad fate of <hi>Vincent le Blanc,</hi> who loſt his liberty, beſides other misfortunes, for piſſing over a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Saints head, who lay interred in a place, he little ſuſpected; I asked him, where I might make water without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who anſwered me grumblingly at firſt, but afterwards directed me to a place, and ſtood at a little diſtance, to ſecure me from any affront. And at another time while I travelled in an open <hi>Caleſche</hi> or Chariot by Moon-light, I made water over one ſide thereof, to avoid being troubleſome to the reſt in ingaging them to ſtay for me till I alighted and went aſide or retard their journey in the night; but one who layed down by my feet took notice of it to me with a great deal of regret, and and though out of the reſpect he profeſſed to bear me, he was reſolved not to divulge it. Yet he wondered I would venture the loſs of my credit in ſuch a matter.</p>
               <p>Some experience we had in our return of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Juſtice, at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gribugia,</hi> in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> for travelling from <hi>Sariggiole</hi> over high Rocks, we met with a <hi>Turkiſh Aga</hi> before our arrival; who, having a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train, had taken up all the Horſes at <hi>Egribugia;</hi> ſo that we could not be readily ſupplied; and therefore intended to ride our Horſes

another Stage, the way laying now in the Plain, and our Horſes ſtrong and able, we ſet forward on the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Horſes; but before we were got out of the Town, we were ſtopped, and carried before the <hi>Cadih,</hi> by the Poſt-maſter; who alledged againſt us, that we were injurious unto him, in that we paſſed by, without taking Horſes at his Houſe; he being allowed by the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> whoſe Servant he is, ſo much for every Horſe he provides; and that none was to provide Horſes in that place, but himſelf; ſo that he was damnified and had no profit coming unto him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cadih</hi> therefore conſidering of the buſineſs, and ſitting croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legged upon his Carpet, and leaning his elbow upon four or five Folio Books, which he had by him; commanded his Servants to fill every one a diſh of <hi>Coffee.</hi> The <hi>Chiaus,</hi> in our defence, urged, that we had buſineſs of concern; that we had the <hi>Chaymacham</hi>'s Letters; and were employed from the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to the Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> that he himſelf was a <hi>Chiaus</hi> to the <hi>Viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the <hi>European Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, which I paſſed, I could not but take notice of the great number of Chriſtians; for, excepting great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or where the <hi>Souldiery</hi> reſide, they are generally all Chriſtians; whereof the great body is of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, who live patiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> toleration. If there ſhould happen any conſiderable commotion among the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> powers; it is highly probable, they would ſit ſtill, and be little active; and if any Forces of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church ſhould attempt the Conqueſts of theſe parts, in all probability they would find very little aſſiſtance from them, and I fear they would rather adhere unto their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Maſters.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Auguſtus</hi> thought it a point of wiſdom, to put ſome limit unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, yet I do not find the <hi>Turks</hi> are of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſtill endeavour to enlarge their Dominions, and when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that people, their hardy education, ſober courſe of life, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Superiors; that no <hi>Baſſa</hi> can eaſily intend a revolt, but ſome others will diſcover him, in hope to obtain his place, or ſome great preferment; and that they ſo punctually obſerve the duty of their Charges; I am apt to think, or fear, if he, who puts bounds to the Sea, and ſaith hither thou ſhalt come and no further, doth not, out of his great mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tartars</hi> broke over, burned and ruined the whole Country about in the late war, in ſuch manner, that it remains ſtill deſolate; at half a miles diſtance from this place is a hole in the Earth which burns like <hi>Solfaterra</hi> by <hi>Naples.</hi> From hence we went to <hi>Schinta</hi> a large Fort and built long ſince to command the River and the Country about. There is a Tower in the middle, four Baſtions and many good pieces of Cannon. At the entrance there hanges a great Rib, a Thigh-bone and a Tooth, which I judged to be of an Elephant, having ſeen the <hi>Skeleton</hi> of one: and alſo ſuch bones as theſe hang up before the Emperor's Houſe at <hi>Laxambourg;</hi> thoſe bearing the name of the bones of a great Heathen Virgin; and theſe of a Gyant. We came afterwards to <hi>Leopolſtadt;</hi> a noble regular For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification with ſix Baſtions, where the Young Count <hi>de Souches</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to whom I delivered Letters, and received many favours from him. Afterwards I paſſed the River and came to <hi>Freiſtat,</hi> a large ſair Town but lately burned by the <hi>Turk.</hi> Count <hi>Forchatz</hi> hath a handſome Caſtle here, and a large Houſe in the Town, whereof I took the draught.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> had alſo a School or College here, but ruined with the reſt of the Buildings. They are Tributaries to the <hi>Turk,</hi> paying yearly eight <hi>Hungariſche,</hi> almoſt four pence of our money, for every head, whether of Man, Woman, Children, Sheep, Oxen, or Horſes. The Children are educated to hardſhip, and the Women ſeldom marry twice. They bathe much, and uſe ſweating naked in Stoves, holding their feet in warm water. They uſe Cupping-glaſſes alſo very much and ſcarifications. In the Convent of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> were onely twelve Friars left; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians in theſe parts have few other Prieſts but Monks.</p>
               <p>Two <hi>Hungarian</hi> miles from <hi>Frieſtat</hi> lies <hi>Banca,</hi> where in a low ground near the River are fifteen Baths; into three of which the River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water is now entred, the River <hi>Waag</hi> continually wearing out its banks by reaſon of its rapid courſe. Twenty years ſince there were alſo hot Baths on the other ſide of the River, but are now covered with the cold ſtream. Theſe Baths leave a white ſediment in all places, and tinge Copper and Silver immediately as black as Ink: Hard by theſe Baths is a Quarry of Stone, and ſome Veins of Chalk, which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſing to behold, the Chalk being of all colours except green, and the colours ſo finely mixed, as a painting or marble Paper doth not equal it.</p>
               <p>We being here upon the 18 of <hi>March,</hi> and the weather very cold, had no thoughts of bathing in ſo open a place; though in ſome of them we ſaw Women and Children; and the <hi>Huſſar</hi> who drove our Chariot hither, after we had ſupped, went out, and in a very hard froſt pulled off his clothes in the open Meadow at midnight, and bathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in one of thoſe Baths.</p>

We paſſed the River <hi>Gran</hi> early in the Morning, and came among the Hills to <hi>Hodrytz,</hi> by which Town runs a ſwift ſtream very ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to them, which helps to move their Engines employed in the pounding, waſhing and melting of the Silver-ore. We travelled over a Mountain called <hi>Hell,</hi> and came to <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> the greateſt of the Mine-towns in <hi>Hungary:</hi> and where great quantity of Silver-ore is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day digged. The Town is well built, hath three fair Churches in it, the greateſt part of the Inhabitants are Lutherans. There are alſo three Caſtles here; the old Caſtle in the Town, where there is Wind-Muſick at ſix every morning, and at twelve, and at ſix at night. 2. The New-Caſtle, built by a Lady, who removed the Gibbet from this Hill, and left a fair building in lieu of it. The third is on a high peak, where there is a continual watch kept to diſcover the approach of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who immediately give notice of it by the ſhooting off a Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. The Streets lie up and down Hill, the Country hereabouts being all very uneven.</p>
               <p>There are very many Mines here, and many adventurers are induced to try their fortunes by the good ſucceſs ſo many have had: for if they find a Vein of Ore in any reaſonable time, before they have quite ſpent their Stocks in digging, they may probably expect great profit.</p>
               <p>Theſe Mines amongſt others are very remarkable; the <hi>Windſchacht-Mine,</hi> the <hi>Trinity,</hi> that of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> St. <hi>John, Matthias,</hi> and one called the three <hi>Kings;</hi> but the chiefeſt and moſt wrought are thoſe of <hi>Windſchacht</hi> and <hi>Trinity. Trinity-Mine</hi>
is ſeventy fathoms deep, built and kept open with under-work at a great expence, much of this Mine being in an earthy ſoil. The Ore of it is much eſteemed, and is commonly of a black colour covered with a white Earth or Clay; ſo that the ſtreams where they work it, become milky and whitiſh, and is that ſubſtance I ſuppoſe which is called <hi>Lac Lunae,</hi> or the Milk of the Moon or Silver. Divers Veins in this Mine lie North, and other rich Veins run to the North-Eaſt. When two Veins croſs one another they eſteem it fortunate; ſo that all Veins of Ore keep not the ſame point even in the ſame Mine, which would be an help to diſcover them; but they have no certain way to know either which way they run, or where they are, till by induſtrious perſevering in the labour of the Mines they are at laſt found out. They uſe not the <hi>Virgula divina,</hi> or forked Hazel-ſtick to direct them, having no opinion of it (as I obſerved they had at the Silver Mine at <hi>Friburg</hi> in <hi>Miſnia,</hi> where I alſo learned the uſe thereof) but dig alwayes as the Adventurers deſire. They ſhew'd me one place, which they had digged ſtreight on ſix years, when the Ore was but two fathoms diſtant from the place where they firſt began:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66078:38"/>
and in another place they digged twelve years outright, and a t laſt found a Vein which in a ſhort time paid their charges. I was in many parts of this Mine, and went ſo far, that at length I paſſed quite under a Hill, and came out on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Windſchacht-Mine</hi> wherein I alſo deſcended as far as the water would then permit me, deſcending thrice almoſt perpendicularly about three hundred large ſteps or ſtairs of a Ladder. I obſerved a large Wheel deep in the Earth, of twelve yards Diameter; turned about by the fall of ſubterraneous Waters. This Wheel moves Engines which pump out the water from the bottom of the Mine, up to the cavity wherein this Wheel is placed. The water which moves this Wheel falls no lower into the Mine, but paſſes away through a <hi>Cumculus</hi> made on purpoſe, through which both this and the other water pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the deepeſt parts of the Mine, do run out together at the foot of an Hill. Beſides this Wheel there is another above ground which lies Horizontally, drawn about continually by twelve Horſes, which ſerves alſo to pump out much of the water of this Mine; about all the Works whereof, I was informed that there were no leſs than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men employed.</p>
               <p>In ſome places of the Mine it is very cold, and in others ſo hot, that to refreſh my ſelf I was conſtrained to go with my breaſt naked; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I had only linen Cloths on. Where they work it is always hot, ſo that they labour naked for eight hours if they are able, and then reſt eight hours more.</p>
               <p>In this Mine they ſhewed me a place where five men and a Perſon of quality were deſtroyed by a Damp, for which reaſon they have now placed a Tube there, the like they place over all doors, and over all ways where they dig right on for a great ſpace, and have no paſſage through; whereby the air is let in, let out, or carried round, and the Miners under-ground ventilated with it.</p>
               <p>The blackiſh Ore is eſteemed the beſt; much of it hath a mixture of a ſhining yellow ſubſtance or <hi>Marchaſite,</hi> which if it be not in too great a quantity is not unwelcome, by reaſon that it diſpoſes the Ore to fluidity, or renders it more eaſie to be melted; but if it be in too great a proportion, they are of opinion, that it preys upon the Silver in the Mine; and in the Furnace carries it away while it melts, by over-volatilizing it; and therefore they term it a Robber, as a ſubſtance which ſpoyls and takes away the richneſs of the Ore.</p>
               <p>There is often found a red ſubſtance which grows to the Ore called <hi>Cinnabar</hi> of Silver, which being grinded with Oyl makes a Vermilion equal to, if not ſurpaſſing the <hi>Cinnabar</hi> made by ſublimation.</p>
               <p>There are alſo found in theſe Mines, <hi>Cryſtals, Amethyſts,</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyſtine</hi> mixtures in the cleſts of the Rocks, and ſometimes nigh or joyned to the Ore; as alſo Vitriol naturally cryſtalliz'd in the Earth in divers of theſe Mines; and particularly in a Mine in <hi>Paradiſe Hill;</hi> which then belonged to Mr. <hi>Jacobus Schwiboda,</hi> an Apothecary, at whoſe Houſe I lodged, and who preſented me with many curious Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>And as there is great variety in the Silver-Ore, as to its mixtures with <hi>Earth, Stones, Marchaſite, Cinnabar, Vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. So alſo in its richneſs; ſome holding a great proportion of Silver in reſpect of others. An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound weight of Ore ſometimes yields but half an ounce or an
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66078:38"/>
of Silver; ſometimes two ounces, three, four, five, and unto twenty ounces; what is richer is very rare, yet ſome hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een found to hold half Silver, and I have ſeen of it ſo rich, as to be cut with a knife.</p>
               <p>A Specimen of each ſort of Ore which they dig out of the Mines is carried upon its firſt being diſcovered to an Officer called the <hi>Probie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> who is to prove and judge of its richneſs; which he doth in this manner. Of all ſorts of Ores he takes the ſame quantity, the Ores being firſt dryed, burned, and pounded, he gives an equal proportion of lead to all, melts and purifies them, and then by exact Scales takes notice of the proportion between the Ore and Metal contained in it, and reports it to thoſe employed in the great melting Furnaces; who accordingly add or diminiſh the quantities of thoſe ſubſtances which are to be mixed with the Ores to melt them in the melting Furnace; as for example, to an hundred centen or ten thouſand pound weight of Silver-Ore, which holds above two ounces and an half of Silver in an hundred pounds weight, they add forty centen of <hi>Leich,</hi> which is Ore pounded and waſhed; two hundred centen of Iron-Stone, which is not Iron-Ore, but a Stone found in thoſe Hills, of which the liver colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the beſt. A q antity of <hi>Kis,</hi> or a ſort of <hi>Pyrites,</hi> according as the Ore is mixed with <hi>Marchaſite,</hi> and of <hi>Slacken</hi> as much as they pleaſe. This laſt is the ſcum or cake taken off from the top of the Pan into which the Metals run, and is a ſubſtance made out of the former men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, by fuſion.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever is melted in the melting Furnace, is let out through an hole at the bottom thereof into the pan, which is placed in the Earth before it; and thus expoſed, it immediately acquires an hard ſcum, droſs, loaf or cake, which being continually taken away, the Metal remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes purer; to which is added lead which carrieth all the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver down to the bottom with it, and after ſome time the melted Metal is taken out; then being again melted in the driving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urnace, the lead or what elſe remains mixt with the Silver is driven off by the blowing of two great bellows; and runs over from the melted Silver in form of <hi>Litharge.</hi> That which firſt comes over, is the white and that which comes laſt, being longer in the fire, is the red, not that it is Litharge of Gold, both being driven off from the ſame Metal.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Schemnitz</hi> Silver-Ore holds ſome Gold which they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by melting the Silver, then granulating it, and afterwards by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving it in <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> made out of a peculiar Vitriol prepared at <hi>Chremnitz,</hi> whereby the Gold is left at the bottom and is afterwards melted; the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> is diſtilled from the Silver, and ſerves again for uſe. But it would be too tedious to deſcribe all the works of theſe Mines which do well deſerve as accurate Deſcriptions as thoſe of <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and other parts, of which <hi>Agricola</hi> hath written largely, and very well in his Books <hi>De re Metallica &amp; de foſſilibus. Lenys</hi> alſo of Mineral works is eſteemed, and <hi>Lazarus Erker</hi> hath handſomely deſcribed the principal Ores and Mineral bodies. But certainly there are few places in the World to be compared with this, where Art and Nature ſtrive to ſhow their utmoſt force and riches.</p>
               <p>They work in this Country much after the manner they did in the Emperour <hi>Rudolphus</hi> his time; who was a great undertaker and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of Mine-works; but, many of their Inſtruments and Engines are much improved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:66078:39"/>
Notwithſtanding the great quantity of Silver made every week at <hi>Schemnitz</hi> and carried away in Carts, I found ſome difficulty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the leaſt piece there, and ſcarce any one in the Town could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me with any that was pure, for the Money of the Country is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with above half Copper; and being deſirous to ſee what alteration divers of thoſe Mineral-waters in that Country, would make upon Metals, for want of other Silver, I was forced to make uſe of ſilver Croſſes, Crucifixes and Medals, which I borrowed.</p>
               <p>Near unto <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> where old <hi>Schemnitz</hi> ſtood, is an high Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Rock, part of which from the bottom to the top is naturally tinctured with ſhining fair blue, ſome green, and ſpots of yellow in it. At firſt ſight I was much ſurprized with the beauty of it, and could fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy nothing like it, but a whole Rock of poliſhed <hi>Lapis Lazuli:</hi> and I have heard from a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who lived long in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that there is alſo a Rock like this nigh to the Silver Mines in <hi>Peru.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Glaſs-Hitten,</hi> an <hi>Hungarian</hi> mile, or about ſeven <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> there was formerly a rich Gold Mine, but it is loſt, no man knowing where the entrance was ſince the time that <hi>Beihlem Gabor</hi> Prnice of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> over-ran that Country, and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants fled away. The Owner notwithſtanding left ſome marks and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections whereby they might diſcover it, with the Figures of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments upon the Barks of Trees; which Inſtruments they have already found by digging in the Earth, and thus much is intimated to them, that where they find a Stone, on which a Face is carved, they are at it, and are onely to remove part of a Rock with which the Owner ſtopped up the Mine.</p>
               <p>This place is much frequented by reaſon of its natural hot Baths, of which there are five very convenient, with handſome deſcents into them, and covered over with large high Roots. The Springs are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, the Sediment is red and green, the wood and ſeats of the Baths under water are incruſtated with a ſtony ſubſtance, and Silver is gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by being left in them: But the moſt remarkable of theſe Baths, is that which is called the ſweating Bath, whoſe hot Springs drain through an Hill, and fall into a Bath built to receive them; at one end of which by aſcending I went into a Cave which is made a noble Stove by the heat of theſe <hi>Thermae,</hi> and ſo ordered with Seats, that every one who ſits in it, either by chooſing an higher or a lower ſeat, may regulate his ſweating, or enjoy what degree of heat he deſires. This Cave, as alſo the ſides of the Bath are covered by the continual dropping of thoſe hot Springs, with a red, white, and green ſubſtance, very fair and pleaſing to the eye.</p>
               <p>Bathing my ſelf in the largeſt of theſe Baths when there were a great many Men and Women in it; an active man to divert the Company, had privately conveyed himſelf to the top of the Houſe which covered the Bath, and on a ſuddain caſt himſelf down into the water, and by taking hold upon the bottom of the Seats kept himſelf under water for ſome time; afterwards a Serpent coming into the Bath through a channel which conveyed the water into it, many of the women were afrighted at it. He ſtill to continue his ſervice and good will to the Company, was the firſt that would encounter it, and deliver the Damſels; which he did in a ſhort time, ſo ſucceſsfully, that he caught the Serpent in both his hands, and holding it out of the water,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66078:39"/>
put it into his mouth, and bit the head off. Being taken with his good humour, I afterwards ſent for him into the Stove; and finding that he had been employed in the Mines, I asked him among other things, whether he had ſeen any natural Vitriol, and where, in the Mines, cryſtallized in lumps, pure and ready for uſe, which he ſaid he had in many places, but in the greateſt quantity, in a Mine now given over; by reaſon that in ſome places the Earth was fallen in, which was near to <hi>Schemnitz:</hi> And accordingly two or three days after he came to ſee me at <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> brought me Lamps and Mine-mens habits for my ſelf, and two Friends more; and we went with him under ground, till I came where he ſhew'd me great quantities of it, much to my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: the Vitriol there ſhooting upon the Stones and Earth, upon the floor and ſides of the paſſages, as it doth by art in the Pans, and about the ſticks, not hanging from the top, as in many other places I have ſeen it, like to Ice-icles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glaſs-Hitten</hi> belonges to the Count of <hi>Lippey,</hi> of whoſe Family was the Learned <hi>Polycarpus Procopius Bocanus,</hi> who was ſent ſome time paſt by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Presburg</hi> to give an account of the rarities of theſe Countries; but his death hindred the publiſhing of his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eiſenbach</hi> about four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Glaſs-Hitten,</hi> and five or ſix from <hi>Schemnitz,</hi> hath alſo hot Baths; the Sediment of which is red, and turnes into ſtone; ſo that I brought away with me pieces of it of five or ſix inches diameter: I took alſo a large piece of this water petre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as it fell from a ſpout in which the waves of it are to be ſeen; but the ſpout it ſelf, although made of Wood, was not at all changed, as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it. However, thoſe Trees with which they built the ſides of the Bath were ſo petrefied, that thoſe which lay next above the water, were intirely turned into Stone. And it was not unpleaſant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how nature did here aſſiſt art, and out of the body of a Firr-Tree frame a Column of Stone. Nor is it much to be wondred at, that the wood under the water ſhould remain unaltered whilſt that above ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great a change. Theſe waters are hot, and part of whatſoever is contained in them is ſufficiently Volatilized to be carried up with the ſteam of the Bath, and I remember in the Bath of the Green Pillars at <hi>Buda,</hi> I took notice, that the exhalation from the Bath reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the high <hi>Cupola</hi> built over it, and by the Irons extended from one Column to another, and by the Capitals of the Pillars was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into long Stones like <hi>Ice-icles,</hi> which hang to all the ſaid places, ſuch as may be obſerved in many ſubterraneous <hi>Grotto</hi>'s, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Okey-hole</hi> in <hi>Somerſet-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Pooles-hole</hi> in <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by-ſhire. Sulphur</hi> alſo which is in great quantity in many hot Springs flyeth away continually, and is not to be found in them, if you boyl or evaporate the Bath water: and therefore to diſcover it, I thought it more rational to look out of the water than into it; neither was I more deceived in my conjecture, than he who looked towards the Weſt, rather than towards the Eaſt to ſee the riſing of the Sun. For upon many places which were over the Baths, and received the ſteams of the hot water, I have ſeen <hi>Sulphur</hi> to ſtick; and to ſatisfie my curioſity further herein, I cauſed once a Pipe to be opened at <hi>Baden</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> through which the hot water continually ran, and took with my hand from the upper part of the Pipe, divers Boxes full of a ſubſtance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66078:40"/>
ſcarce to be diſtinguiſhed from Flower of Brimſtone. Walking about alſo one day in the <hi>Sower Bath</hi> at <hi>Baden,</hi> and leaning over the Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres to talk with ſome Friends, who were then bathing themſelves, I perceived that my Buttons and what elſe I wore of ſilver, were all turned yellow of a fair Gold colour, although I were at ſome diſtance from the water. Which made me try this experiment alſo, which was to hang money over the Bath at a foot diſtance, or at a greater, to ſee what alteration it would make, and how ſoon; which it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured in a minutes time, and that which was nearer in half a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Eiſenbach,</hi> there are two convenient Baths much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, and a third which is made by the water let out of the former, called the <hi>Snakes-bath,</hi> from the number of Snakes coming into, and delighting in it when it is filled with theſe warm waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> the thirtieth, I travelled from <hi>Schemnitz</hi> by <hi>Glaſs-Hitten,</hi> and <hi>Apfelsdorff,</hi> where there is a Houſe of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> and afterwards paſſed the River <hi>Gran</hi> and came in between the Hills; where in one place they have thrown up the Earth, and made a work from one ridge of the Hills to the other, to defend the Country; and hinder the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Excurſions towards <hi>Chremnitz:</hi> Afterwards we proceeded by that Golden River and yellow Stream which waſhes all the Ore above till we came to the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chremnitz</hi> is a ſmall Town, but hath large Suburbs, and lies high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Johns</hi> Church at ſome diſtance from it, is thought to ſtand upon the higheſt ground in <hi>Hungary.</hi> This is the oldeſt Mine-Town, and the richeſt in Gold of all the ſeven in theſe parts, which are theſe, <hi>Schemnitz, Chremnitz, Newſol, Koningsberg, Bochantz, Libeten</hi> and <hi>Tiln.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have worked in the Gold-Mine at <hi>Chremnitz</hi> nine hundred and fifty years; the Mine is about nine or ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in length, and there is one <hi>Cuniculus</hi> or Horizontal paſſage which is eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fathoms long, called the <hi>Erbstall.</hi> The depth of it is above one hundred and ſeventy fathoms; they do not uſe Ladders to deſcend into this Mine, but are let down at the end of a Cable, unto which is faſtned a ſling, or ſeat of Leather; the Leather being broad, and divided ordinarily into two or three parts, ſo that it is to be ſhifted or changed as you find convenience, and affords no uneaſie ſeat, even to ſuch as are not uſed to it. And in this manner, whoſeever enters the Mine is let down. Through one of the <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chts</hi> or perpendicular Pits, of which there are ſix. 1. That of <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</hi> 2. Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> 3. <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> 4. <hi>Matthias.</hi> 5. <hi>Windſchacht,</hi> and 6. <hi>Leopold.</hi> I went down by the Pit of the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> gently deſcending by the turning about of a large wheel to which the Cable is faſtned, one hundred and eight fathoms deep into the Earth; and after many hours being in the Mine, was drawn out again by <hi>Leopoldi Schacht,</hi> or <hi>Leopolds</hi> Pit, or Shaft, ſtreight up above one hundred and fifty fathoms; a heigh ſurpaſſing that of the Pyramids by a third part. At the bottom of which <hi>Schacht</hi> I was not diſcouraged to find my ſelf ſo deep in the earth, for conſidering that I was yet above three thouſand miles from the Center, I thought my ſelf but in a Well. It is built on all ſides with Firr-Trees, one laying upon another on four ſides from the bottom to the top, and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:66078:40"/>
all theſe Mines are kept open where they have not a Rock on all ſides.</p>
               <p>Many Veins of the Ore run to the North, and to the Eaſt; They work alſo towards one, two, or three of the clock, as they ſpeak; for the Miners direct themſelves under-ground by a Compaſs not of thirty two points (ſuch as is uſed at Sea) but by one of twenty four, which they divide as we do the hours of the day into twice twelve. Of the Gold-Ore ſome is white, ſome black, ſome of it red, and ſome yellow. That with black ſpots in white is eſteemed the beſt, as alſo the Ore which lieth next to the black Veins. This Ore is not rich enough to ſuffer any proof in ſmall parcels, like that of other Mines, whereby to know what proportion of Metal is contain'd in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they pound a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great quantity thereof, and waſh it in a little River which runs near the Town: The whole River being divided and admitted into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cuts, runs over the Ore continually, and ſo waſhes away the earthy parts from the <hi>Metallin,</hi> and from a clear River above the Town, by its running through ſo many works, and over ſo much pounded Ore, it becomes below the Town a dark yellow Stream, of the colour of the Earth of thoſe Hills. Unleſs it be upon ſix days of the year; two at <hi>Christmas,</hi> two at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and two at <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> when the River it ſelf as well as the Mine-men ceaſeth from working, and is permitted to flow clear within its own Banks.</p>
               <p>There have been pieces of pure or virgin Gold found in this Mine, ſome of which I have ſeen in the Emperour's Treaſury, and in the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Repoſitory, one piece as broad as the palm of my hand, and others leſs; and upon a white Stone many pieces of pure Gold; but theſe are very rare.</p>
               <p>The common yellow Earth of the Country near <hi>Chremnitz,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Hills towards the Weſt, although it be not eſteemed Ore, affords ſome Gold. And in one place I ſaw a great part of an Hill digg'd away, which hath been caſt into the works, waſhed and wrought in the ſame manner, as pounded Ore with conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthias Dollinger</hi> the chief Officer at <hi>Chremnitz</hi> for the Mine-work, hath alſo lately invented a Mill to pound the Ore finer than it was before; and by this invention hath obtained a conſiderable quantity of Gold out of that Ore which otherwiſe would have yielded none; in his Houſe I ſaw many ſorts of Minerals, and was very kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by him; and when I was at the bottom of the Gold-Mine he ſent me down a preſent of excellent Wine to drink the Emperour's health.</p>
               <p>Some paſſages in this Mine cut through the Rock and long diſuſed, have grown up again; and I obſerved the ſides of ſome which had been formerly wide enough to carry their Ore through, to approach each other; ſo as we paſſed with difficulty; this happens moſt in moiſt places, the paſſages unite not from the top to the bottom, but from one ſide to another.</p>
               <p>They carry their Ore under ground from one place to another; or to the bottom of the Pit whence it is drawn out, in a Box or Cheſt which they call a Hundt or Dog; this runs upon four whels, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er behind than before, and hath a tongue of Iron at the bottom, which being fitted into a channel of wood framed in the middle of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66078:41"/>
the bottom of each paſſage, it can no ways deviate, but keeps alwayes in the middle; and by this means a little Boy will run full ſpeed with three or four hundred pound weight of Ore or Earth before him, wherever you command him, without any light, through thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal dark paſſages of the Mine: and it was very new to me to hear the rattling they make in the Mine, and the alteration of the ſound as they are nearer or further from us; and to ſee them come with that ſwiftneſs out of the Rocks, overturn their little Charriot, where they are to leave their Ore, then turn again and enter thoſe dark Caves with ſuch a force and ſwiftneſs.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike this is another inſtrument they have to bring the Ore from the mouth of the Mine, or from the Hills down to the <hi>Buchworke,</hi> where they pound it and waſh it; but inſtead of a tongue it hath eight wheels or four rowlers and four wheels, and the way is made with Firr in ſuch manner and at ſuch a diſtance that the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers rowl upon the wood of the Firr-trees. And theſe rowlers and wheels are ſo contrived, that theſe Cheſts can never overturn nor go out of the way, and a child draws them, and ſometimes a dog ſerves the turn. To one <hi>Buchworke</hi> alone, they carry every week three or four hundred of theſe Cheſts full, and each Cheſt holds four hundred pound weight.</p>
               <p>There were two very bad ſtrong damps in this Mine when I was there, and divers others that had not the like force to ſuffocate in ſo ſmall a time. One of theſe Damps was in a <hi>Schacht Puteus</hi> or Pit, and the other in a Stall, or right-on paſſage; no Lamps would burn in either of them, yet the Miners would venture into them for ſome ſhort ſpace of time: and we let one man down into that Damp which was in the Pit five or ſix times; but pulled him up again as ſoon as ever we ſaw his Lamp go out; this place is moſt poyſonous when the water is high, the vapour then ariſing more ſtrongly, the other Damp in the <hi>Cuniculus</hi> they hope to remedy, by perflation, and making or digging another paſſage into it.</p>
               <p>I was informed that there had been twenty eight men killed at one time, by Damps in four <hi>Cuniculi,</hi> ſeven in each; and in the ſinking of <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Pit, they were much troubled with Damps, which they remedied in this manner.</p>
               <p>They fixed to the ſide of the <hi>Schacht</hi> or Pit a Tube from the top to the bottom; and that not proving ſufficient they forced down a broad flat board which covered or ſtopped the Pit, or couched very near the ſides of it on all ſides, but where the Tube was: and ſo forced out all the Air in the Pit through the Tube; which work they were forced often to repeat. And now they having divers other paſſages into it, the Air is good and ſufficient, and I was drawn up through it without the leaſt trouble in breathing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Altermans</hi> Fore-ſtall, a <hi>Cuniculus</hi> five hundred fathoms long, was burned in the year 1642. by the careleſneſs of a boy wiping the ſnuff of a Lamp upon the wood; and fifty men ſmothered in it; they were all taken out except one, who was afterwards found to be diſſolved by the ſharp waters of the Mine, nothing eſcaping either of fleſh or bones, but only ſome of his cloths.</p>
               <p>There is Vitriol in this Mine, white, red, blue and green; and alſo Vitriolat waters. There is a ſubſtance found, which ſticks to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66078:41"/>
Gold-Ore of ſmall pointed parts like needles, of a purple colour, and ſhining, the mother of which is yellow like brimſtone, it is called by them Antimony of Gold. There are Cryſtals found here, and ſome tinctured yellow.</p>
               <p>There is a Vitriol-Mine in theſe Hills nigh the Gold-Mine, about eighty fathoms deep. The Earth or Ore whereof is reddiſh, and ſometimes greeniſh. This Earth is infuſed in water, and after three days the water is poured off, and boyled ſeven days in a leaden Veſſel, till it comes to a thick granulated whitiſh ſubſtance, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reduced to a Calx-in an Oven, and ſerves in the making of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or the ſeparating water uſed at <hi>Schemnitz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where they pound the Gold-Ore, they lay a foundation three yards deep of wood, upon which they place the Ore, over which there are four and twenty Beams armed at the bottom with Iron, which break and grind the Ore, it being covered all the while with water. Theſe Beams are moved by four Wheels, one Wheel to ſix Beams, the water which comes out from the pounded Ore, is let into little Pits or Cheſts commonly ſeven or eight one after another; and afterwards into a large Pit of almoſt half an Aker of ground, and then after ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling let out.</p>
               <p>The Gold-Ore in powder or pounded is called <hi>Slich,</hi> of which that is the richeſt which is neareſt to the Beams where it is firſt pounded. They work thus day and night continually. The Candles which they make uſe of are of Firr or ſome Reſinous wood.</p>
               <p>They take the <hi>Slich</hi> waſhed ſo long as perhaps in an hundred pound weight, there may be half an ounce or an ounce of Gold and Silver, the greateſt part ordinarily Gold, two thirds generally, (for the <hi>Chrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz</hi> Gold-Ore is ſeldom without ſome mixture of Silver, and the beſt of the <hi>Schemnitz</hi> Silver-Ore yields an eighth part of Gold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Silver;) to this <hi>Slich</hi> they add Limeſtone and Slacken, and melt them together in the melting Furnace.</p>
               <p>This firſt melting produces a ſubſtance called <hi>Lech;</hi> this <hi>Lech</hi> they burn with Charcoal to make it lighter, to open its body and render it porous, and then it is called <hi>Roſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Roſt</hi> they add Sand as they ſee occaſion, and melt it again in the melting Furnace; then let it out into the Pan, and proceed as in the melting of Silver.</p>
               <p>They have divers other ways to get the Gold out of the pounded Ore, and I cannot omit to ſet down this one, in which they proceed without Lead.</p>
               <p>They waſh the pounded Ore often, and lay it in powder upon Cloths, and by the gentle oblique deſcending of the water over it, and their continual ſtirring it, the earthy, clayiſh, and lighter parts are waſht away, while the heavier and metalline remain in the Cloth: not much unlike to this proceeding is that with Sheep-skins and Wooll, which they place either in the water which comes from the works, or in rivulets which have their Heads hid in Hills and Mountains rich in Gold; ſo that while the water and fluid parts paſs through or over them, the more ſolid, heavy and metalline are inſnared; and by this way ſome have obtained the Golden Fleece. But to continue the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working with cloths, they waſh the cloths in which the Ore doth ſtick in ſeveral Tubs, and the water after ſome ſetling is pour'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66078:42"/>
off from its Sediment; which Sediment is again waſht and ſtirr'd up in ſeveral Veſſels and Troughs, till at length they ſprinkle Quick ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon it, and knead it well together for an hour or two; and then waſhing it again in a wooden Veſſel, after the ſeparating of much of it, which the Quick-ſilver touches not, by ſtriking this Veſſel againſt their leg, they bring the Gold and Quick-ſilver together in an <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama,</hi> to one corner of it. From this <hi>Amalgama</hi> they ſtrain as much of the Quick-ſilver as they can through courſe cloths firſt, and then through fine. They put the Maſs remaining upon a perforated Plate, which they ſet over a deep Pan placed in the Earth; in the bottom of which Pan they alſo put Quick-ſilver: This Pan they cover, and lute the cover well, and then make a Charcoal fire, upon it, and drive down the Quick-ſilver yet remaining in the Gold to the reſt in the bottom of the Pan; and then taking out the Gold, they caſt it into the fire that it may ſtill become purer.</p>
               <p>After ſome few days having ſeen the moſt remarkable curioſities of <hi>Chremnitz,</hi> I went to <hi>Newſol;</hi> paſſing thoſe Hills which lie on the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Chremnitz,</hi> upon the top of one of which lies a vaſt Stone or Rock alone by it ſelf, near the way-ſide; theſe Hills afford wood for the Service of the Gold-Mine. Paſſing on further we were not far from <hi>Lila,</hi> a Village, where they find Quick-ſilver; and after we had travelled over the Quick-ſilver Hills, we came again to the River <hi>Gran,</hi> upon which <hi>Newſol</hi> ſtands; there is a Bridge of wood to paſs the River at this Town, and an handſom building of Piles ſhoring croſs the River to ſtop the wood thrown into this River, ten miles higher, where the Country is very full of wood: and by this Artifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour or charge, it is conveyed to <hi>Newſol,</hi> to be uſed in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Copper-Ore, and in the burning, melting, caſting, hammering of the Copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newſol</hi> is an handſome Town, and hath a large <hi>Piazza,</hi> at the upper end whereof ſtands a fair Tower. The Caſtle alſo is worth the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which is the Church covered over with Copper; within the Church there are many Figures of carved Wood, and ſome Reliques: but being in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> they are not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, though carefully preſerved. As I alſo obſerved in ſome <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> as at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> and <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where ſome Reliques had been left; which they have not parted with, but ſtill keep as rarities.</p>
               <p>At this Town, and near unto it, are the greateſt Copper-works in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the body of the Copper being very ſtrongly united to its Stone, Bed, or Ore, the ſeparation of it is effected with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and difficulty; for the Copper-Ore taken out of the Mine is burned and melted fourteen times before that it becomes fit for uſe; and firſt it is melted with a Stone which they call <hi>Fluſs-ſtein,</hi> and its own droſs, and with <hi>Kis</hi> or a ſort of <hi>Pyrites.</hi> It is afterwards carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Roſt-hearth,</hi> where it is laid upon great ſtacks or heaps of Billets, and thoſe ſet on fire under it; by which means it is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a ſubſtance called <hi>Roſt,</hi> and this is repeated ſeven or eight times; afterwards it is melted again in the melting Furnace, and at two Furnaces more at <hi>Miſmills,</hi> and twice at the Hammer.</p>
               <p>Here they alſo melt <hi>Kis</hi> which is brought hither from <hi>Jeſina,</hi> which ſubſtance melted is ſerviceable in the melting of Silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:66078:42"/>
At <hi>Miſmills</hi> not far from hence they get Silver out of Copper, which they ſeperate thus: They add Lead to the Copper when it is melted, and take out the Metals melted together in Spoons or Iron Diſhes. When it is cold they give it a ſtrong fire again as it lies upon croſs Bars, untill the Silver and Lead melts and falls through. When the Copper hath paſſed its laſt melting and is fit for uſe, they cut it in pieces, with great Hammers which are ſharp, to move every one of which there is a Mill on purpoſe, which with great force lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the Hammer: and to ſhape and form it into Veſſels or Plates, they have other Hammers, which are flat or round according as they intend to frame the Copper.</p>
               <p>The Governor of theſe Works at <hi>Newſol</hi> was highly obliging, and beſides the giving us opportunity of ſeeing every thing we deſired, he ſent me a handſom preſent of Wine and Fowls, and wrote a Letter to the Praefect of the Copper-Mine at <hi>Herrn-grundt</hi> to ſhew me every thing that was curious and obſervable in that Mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herrn-Grundt</hi> is a little Town ſeated very high between two Hills, upon a part of Land of the ſame name, an <hi>Hungarian</hi> mile diſtant from <hi>Newſol.</hi> The Country about was then all covered with Snow after we came to ſuch a heighth, but in the Valleys, and in our journey from <hi>Newſol</hi> hither we met with none; ſo that we found the Air very piercing as we paſſed towards the entrance of the Mine in Miners ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; which habit conſiſts of a Linen Coat and Drawers, a ſtiff round Cap, like the crown of a Hat, a leather Apron turned behind, and two pieces of Leather tyed to the Knees, to defend thoſe parts againſt any ſudden ſtriking againſt the Rocks, or the fall of Earth upon them. In the Mine we were warm enough.</p>
               <p>I went into this Mine through a <hi>Cuniculus</hi> called <hi>Tachſtoln,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued divers hours in the Mine, and viſited many of the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable places in it. The ſleep deſcents in this Mine are made by Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Trees ſet upright, with deep notches or ſtayers cut in them to ſtay the foot upon: They are not troubled with water, the Mine lying high in the Hill, ſo that the water may drain away; but they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with duſt, which is choaking and fretting, and alſo with pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous damps.</p>
               <p>In one place of the Mine they ſhewed me the manner how they had lately cured a very bad Damp by a great pair of Bellows, which were blown continually for many days; and in divers other places the Damps were ſo ſtrong as to hinder the Work-men very much in their labour, and theſe Damps are not only met with in places where the Earth is full of Clay or the like ſubſtances, but alſo where it is rocky, and one place they ſhewed me where there had been a pernicious Damp, and yet the Rock ſo hard, that it could not be broken by their Inſtruments; but the deſcent was all made by the means of Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ramm'd into long holes in the Rock, and ſo blown up.</p>
               <p>Much of this Mine lies in the Rocks where they have no need of Wood-work to keep it open, and ſome paſſages lie between the Rock and the Earth, ſo that they are kept open upon one ſide by Firr-Trees, and on the other ſide with Stone, the paſſages alſo are not ſo regular as at <hi>Chremnitz,</hi> for many here are neither horizontal, nor near to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, but moderately inclining up and down, and there are many large Cavities within. In one place where we deſcended obliquely to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66078:43"/>
go to a remarkable part of the Mine, we found that the Earth had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in and ſtopped up the paſſage, but one of our Guides unwilling to go about, and the Earth being yet looſe, he made a Burrough into it and digged his way through, although the Earth continually fell upon him and covered him; and got at length through and tumbled down amongſt the Work-men below, with a great quantity of Earth after him; with which they ſo ſpeedily laded their Barrows and Hundts, of which I ſpake before, and the Boys ran away with them with ſuch ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that in a ſhort time he made the paſſage clear again up to the place where he had left us.</p>
               <p>The Veins of this Mine are very large, many of them, ſuch as are termed <hi>cumulatoe,</hi> and the Ore is very rich, in an hundred pounds of Ore they ordinarily find twenty pounds of Copper, ſometimes thirty, forty, half Copper, and even to ſixty in the hundred. Much of the Ore is joyned ſo faſt to the Rock, that 'tis ſeparated with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and in many places the Ore and the Rock are one continued Body or Stone, onely with this difference that one part of the Rock will yield Copper, the other none; which is known and diſtinguiſhed by the colour, and eaſily at firſt ſight, the Copper-Ore being for the moſt part, eſpecially the beſt of it, either yellow or black: The yellow is pure Copper-Ore, the black contains alſo a proportion of Silver.</p>
               <p>There are divers ſorts of Vitriol found in this Mine, white, green, blue, and a red clear tranſparent. There is alſo a green Earth or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a green Water, called <hi>Berg-Grun,</hi> uſed by the Painters; there are likewiſe Stones found of a beautiful green and blue colour, and one ſort upon which <hi>Turcoiſes</hi> have been found, and therefore called the Mother of the <hi>Turcois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are alſo two Springs of a Vitriolat Water which turn Iron in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Copper, called the old and the new <hi>Ziment;</hi> theſe Springs lie very deep in the Mine, and the Iron is ordinarily left in the water fourteen days. Theſe Waters are very profitable, ſeeing that the worſt ſort of Iron, and uſeleſs old Iron is hereby turned into the pureſt ſort of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which hath this commendation above other Copper to be more ductile, malleable, and eaſily melted; and I have melted it without the addition of any other ſubſtance, without difficulty. Whilſt the Ore of Copper muſt run through many Fires and Furnaces to be brought to any thing. Of this ſort of Copper I took a good quantity out of the old <hi>Ziment,</hi> and I took alſo a piece of Copper of the Figure of a Heart which had been layed in it eleven or twelve days before; having the ſame Figure, but as perfectly Iron then, as it is at this day Copper. Some will not have this to be a Tranſmutation of one Metal into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that this Water of the <hi>Ziment</hi> being ſaturated with a <hi>Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Veneris,</hi> and meeting with ſuch a body ſo ready to receive it as <hi>Mars,</hi> it depoſes <hi>Venus,</hi> who immediately inſinuates her ſelf ſo far into <hi>Mars,</hi> that ſhe doth <hi>dividere &amp; imperare,</hi> and at laſt ſhe ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes her own body, and precipitates that of <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the changing of Iron into Copper in theſe Springs, many parts are indeed often ſeparated, and lie at the bottom in powder, but theſe parts are not Iron but Copper; and I have taken of this powder out of the Spring, and melted it into excellent Copper; ſo that if the Iron be not changed, I know not what becomes of it. This Operation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66078:43"/>
which nature ſo curiouſly performs in the Mine, I have ſince ſeen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be imitated by Art; and in my judgment ſucceſsfully.</p>
               <p>After that I had ſeen many of the moſt remarkable places in the Mine, I returned to the <hi>Verwalter</hi> of <hi>Herrn-Grundt</hi> his Houſe, and put my clothes on again in the Stove: where we were afterwards very kindly entertained. He ſhewed me a Map of that Mine wherein we had ſpent moſt part of that day; and the delineations of all thoſe places we had been at, with a Scale to meaſure the lengths and diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all Paſſages and Places in the Mine; and it was very delightful to ſee ſo large a Draught or Picture of ſo fair a Subterraneous City: nor can I term it leſs, in which there is more building than in many. The extent ſurpaſſes moſt, and the number of the Inhabitants are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, their Order admirable, their Watches exact, their Reſt undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, grateful after Labour and refreſhing, they repoſing themſelves eight hours in the hollow of a Rock after the ſame time ſpent in labour; beſides this Map, he ſhew'd me many curious Minerals taken out of that Mine, and by heating the Copper-Ore, and caſting it into water, made the water like ſome natural Baths which ariſe near theſe Hills. And upon my commending the <hi>Ziment</hi> water and its ſtrange Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Iron, he preſented me with divers fair pieces, and a chain of Copper tranſmuted in thoſe Springs. They make alſo very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Cups and Veſſels out of this ſort of Copper, and we drank out of one of them which was gilded over, and had a rich piece of Silver-Ore faſtned in the middle of it; and this Inſcription graved on the outſide:
<q>
                     <l>Eiſen ware ich, Kupſer bin ich</l>
                     <l>Silber trag ich, Goldt bedeckt mich. <hi>i. c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>Copper I am, but Iron was of old,</l>
                     <l>Silver I carry, cover'd am with Gold,</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The profit which the Emperor makes by his Mines, is reckoned to amount to an hundred and twenty Thouſand pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> yearly. But when they come to deal with deeper and richer veins of Ore, and that there ſhall be by degrees more of theſe Vitriolate Copper ſprings diſcovered, this revenue will then be encreaſed. And it is more than probable that time will bring more of them to light; for at <hi>Zolnock,</hi> and other places near the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Hills there are divers of the ſame ſprings already made uſe of. But if furthermore, conſidering the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of theſe ſprings, containing in them the true mature Salt of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſome Perſons hereafter ſhall be ſo fortunate, as moreover to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and experimentally improve the uſe of Springs and Fountains ſaturated with a <hi>Vitriolum Lunoe,</hi> and learn perfectly how to adapt Metalline Bodies to the adaequate energy, and activity of ſuch waters; The improvement by tranſmutation as it is at preſent more than ten to one, ſo it will in thoſe dayes amount to above a hundred to one, and the uſe of theſe Mines and Metalline labours may hereby effectually prove in times to come one of the Richeſt Jewels in the Imperial Crown.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Herrn-Grundt</hi> we came to <hi>Stubn,</hi> a Town three <hi>Hungarian</hi> miles diſtant from <hi>Newſol,</hi> and two from <hi>Chremnitz;</hi> where near unto
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66078:44"/>
a Rivolet there are divers hot Baths of great eſteem, and much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented; the water whereof is very clear and ſinells of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment green; it colours the wood over it green and black, but doth not change the colour of Metals ſo ſoon as moſt others; I left money in it a whole night, which was yet but faintly coloured. The Springs ariſe underneath, and paſs through the holes in the plancher of the Baths.</p>
               <p>The heat of theſe is anſwerable to that of the Kings-Bath in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> there are ſeven in number: The firſt is the Noblemans Bath, the ſecond the Gentlemans, the third the Country-mans, the fourth the Country-womans, the fifth the Beggars Bath, the ſixth for ſuch as are infected with the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> the ſeventh the Bath of the <hi>Gypſies.</hi> Theſe Baths are in a Plain encompaſſed on all ſides with Hills, the nigheſt unto them are towards the Eaſt; and it is the ſame ridge of Hills which on the other ſide are ſo rich in Metals. I bath'd in one of theſe and met good company that I was detained too long, and received ſome inconvenience from the heat of the Bath, nor could I commend their cuſtom of eating, drinking, and ſleeping much while they bathed.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Stub'n Bad</hi> we went to <hi>Boinitz,</hi> croſſing the River <hi>Nitra</hi> and leaving <hi>Privitz</hi> a large Town on the left hand. At <hi>Boinitz</hi> there are alſo five natural Baths of a moderate gentle heat delightful to bath in, being much beautified by Count <hi>Palfi</hi> Palatine of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and all of them covered under one large roof. The firſt is the Noblemans Bath built of Stone, deſcended into on all ſides by Stone ſtairs; the other four are of wood, very handſomely and well built, where it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to us to ſee the Boys and Girls dive ſo finely for any thing that we caſt in. About this part of the Country there grows very much Saffron.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Boinitz</hi> we went to <hi>Weſtonitz,</hi> two <hi>Hungarian</hi> miles, and from <hi>Weſtonitz</hi> the next day, we arrived at <hi>Trenſchin,</hi> which they count four <hi>Hungarian</hi> miles; but ſuch long ones they are, that we were travelling from before Sun-riſing till eight of the Clock at night, before we could come to our journeys end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trenſchin</hi> is a handſome Town ſeated upon the River <hi>Waag,</hi> over which there is a Bridge of wood; the <hi>Piazza</hi> is fair, the Jeſuites Church handſome, the Caſtle ſeated very high, eaſily diſcernable at twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles diſtance, and belonged to the <hi>Graff Jellhaſey.</hi> There are two warm Baths a mile from the Town, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Springs of Mineral waters in the Country about. Here we met with Count <hi>Rothall</hi> going from the Emperor to treat with <hi>Abaffi</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> his Commiſſioners at <hi>Eperies,</hi> where I engaged ſome of his Attendants to make enquiry into the Salt-Mines of that place, or any other, according to the inſtructions I left with them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I received an Account to this effect.</p>
               <p>Half an hours going from the City of <hi>Eperies</hi> in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> there is a Salt-Mine of great note from the firſt place of deſcent unto the bottom, it is about one hundred and fourſcore fathoms deep. Into this the Miners deſcend firſt by Ropes, and at laſt by Ladders unto the lower parts. The Mine is for the moſt part in an Earthy, and not a Rocky ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66078:44"/>
The Veins of Salt are large, and there are pieces to be found of ten thouſand pound weight: they commonly hew out the Salt into long ſquare pieces of two foot in length, and one in thickneſs, and for uſe it is broken and grinded between two Grind ſtones.</p>
               <p>The Mine is cold and moiſt, but the Salt being a Stone ſalt, is not eaſily diſſolved, or at leaſt in any great quantity by dampneſs or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; yet much of the water of the Mine is impregnated with ſalt, in ſuch ſort that being drawn out in large buckets, and afterwards boyl'd up, it affords a blackiſh Salt, which they give to their Cattle in that Country.</p>
               <p>The colour of the ordinary Stone-ſalt of this Mine is not very white, but ſomewhat grey: yet being broken and grinded to powder, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as white as if it were refined, and this Salt conſiſts of pointed parts or foſſets. Another ſort of Salt there is alſo, which conſiſts of Squares and Tables; and a third to be found of ſomewhat ſtirious or long ſhoots.</p>
               <p>Nor is all the Salt of this Mine of one colour, but of divers; that which is found groſly mixt with the Earth receives ſome colour from it; and even that which is moſt pure and reſembles Cryſtal, doth often receive tinctures of ſeveral colours; in the middle of a Cryſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalt with long ſhoots, I have ſeen a delicate blue; and at Count <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall</hi> his Houſe at <hi>Vienna,</hi> I ſaw a large piece of a fair tranſparent yellow. There are alſo ſome pieces ſo clear and hard, that they carve them into divers Figures, as if they were Cryſtal it ſelf. Of all theſe ſorts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned I alſo obtained ſome pieces, and brought them with me into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is time to conclude this long diſcourſe of Mines and Minerals, which may ſeem of little concern unto many; yet for the ſatisfaction of the more curious in ſo conſiderable a piece of Naturals, in places lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known unto us; and withal, undeſcribed by any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pen that I know; I would not omit this particular account thereof.</p>
               <p>I continued my journey near to the River <hi>Waag,</hi> and came to <hi>Nove Mneſto,</hi> and from thence the next day to <hi>Tirnaw,</hi> a City ſeated upon a Plain, and to be ſeen at a great diſtance; it hath almoſt recovered it ſelf out of the Aſhes that it was reduced into ſix years before: the day following we got to the <hi>Danube</hi> again, and lodged that night at <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> whereof I have ſpoken elſewhere; and then paſſing the <hi>Danube</hi> in two Ferry-boats, we travelled by <hi>Homburg</hi> Tower, by <hi>Haimberg</hi> Hill, by the Town of <hi>Haimberg,</hi> by <hi>Regelsbrun, Viſchet</hi> and <hi>Swechet,</hi> and came to <hi>Vienna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great part of theſe Countries of upper <hi>Hungaria,</hi> through which I travelled, had a different face from that of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and from what they had formerly been. For ſome places had been burnt or plundred by the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> in the late war, and divers pay contribution to them, ſo that many live warily and meanly to become leſs noted: And in divers places their Houſes are bare and unfurniſhed; and it is well if they have any other Bed than one for the man of the Houſe and his Wife. Even in parts of the Country better provided, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperor, a great part of the people being of the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or the reformed Religion, are under ſuch hard meaſure and fears that they live in little content, and being of a ſtout and perſevering temper, they may in time become ſo deſperate, that if the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould break power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66078:45"/>

               <head type="sub">Unto the ſtrange Lake of <hi>Zirchnitz,</hi> to the Quick-ſilver Mines at <hi>Idria,</hi> and to other remarkable places in the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHILE I remained at <hi>Vienna,</hi> I took the pains to ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places not far diſtant from it, as <hi>Néugebáu, Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Cloſter, Newberg, Itzing, Baden, Laxamburg, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidler-See,</hi> with others; and afterwards made a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney unto <hi>Venice,</hi> not by the Stage-Coaches which keep one conſtant road, but choſe rather to perform it by Horſe whereby I might ſtay in any place, or go out of the road at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The firſt conſiderable place we ſaw was <hi>Baden,</hi> about four <hi>German</hi> miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> a pretty walled Town ſeated near a part of Mount <hi>Cetius,</hi> which divided <hi>Noricum</hi> from <hi>Pannonia;</hi> a Rivolet named <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet</hi> paſſes by it, which afterwards enlarges and runs into the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> about a <hi>German</hi> mile from <hi>Vienna,</hi> there are three Churches, that of the <hi>Auguſtiners,</hi> of our Lady, and S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> but this place is moſt remarkable for its Baths which are much frequented from <hi>Vienna</hi> and theſe parts. The Springs being numerous and affording nine conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Baths, two within the Town, five without the Wall, and two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Rivolet called <hi>Swechet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dukes-Bath is the largeſt, about twenty foot ſquare, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Houſe of the ſame Figure, built over it. The vapour paſſes through a tunnel of Wood, at the top: and the Water is conveyed into the bottom of the Bath, at one corner through wooden pipes and Trees, under the Town-wall, from the Spring head, which riſes at a little diſtance Weſtward. The Springs of the reſt of the Baths riſe under them, and let in through holes of the Plancher, for all the Baths are Wainſcoted, the Seats, Sides, and Bottom being made of Firr. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the moſt part is clear and tranſparent, yet ſomewhat blewiſh, and makes the Skin appear pale in it, in the ſame manner as the Smoak of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66078:46"/>
Brimſtone, it coloureth Metals (except Gold, the colour of which it alſo heightens) turning them black in a few minutes. The Coyn of this Country, which is mixed of Copper and Silver, (having 7/15 of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and 8/15 of Copper) is in a minutes time turned from a white into a dark yellow, and ſoon after becomes black. It gives a fine green colour to the Moſs and Plants which it waſhes, and leaves often a ſcum upon them of a purple, mixed with white As it runs from the Spring-head, it ſomewhat reſembles the Sulphur River in the way from <hi>Tivoli</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but is not ſo ſtrange or ſtinking nor doth it incruſtate its banks.</p>
               <p>The Spring head is alſo conſiderable, in regard that it riſes under a rocky Hill, at ſome diſtance from the entrance, and I paſſed to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the length of forty yards, through an Arched paſſage cut in the Rock, which is alſo a natural ſtove, (as that of <hi>Tritola</hi> and <hi>Baiae<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> made by the hot Bath water running under it, moſt part of the top of this Cave is incruſtated with a white ſubſtance which towards the mouth becomes harder and ſtony. I cauſed ſome of the Pipes through which the Bath water runs to be opened, and from the upper part of the Pipe. I took ſome quantity of the Sulphur in powder, it being very like flowers of Brimſtone, this being as it were ſublimed from the water and not depoſed, it being found in the upper part of the Pipe, <hi>oleum Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris per campanum</hi> dropped into this water, is received into it quietly, <hi>Oleum Tartari per deliquium</hi> cauſes an ebullition as in the making of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Bath within the Wall is our Lady's Bath, about twelve foot broad and twenty four foot long. One end of this is under a Church of the ſame name. This is fuller of Sulphur than the reſt, and more blew, and leaves a yellow flower upon the boards, as the others do a white.</p>
               <p>The Third is the New Bath, without the Town near the Gate, when I ſaw it, it was full of People who were making merry and ſinging.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is the Jews Bath, this hath a partition in the middle, to ſeparate the Men from the Women.</p>
               <p>The Fifth is St. <hi>John's</hi> Bath of a triangular Figure.</p>
               <p>The Sixth is the Beggars Bath, alwayes ſhallow ſo as they lie down in it.</p>
               <p>The Seventh is the Bath of the holy Croſs, about two ſathoms ſquare, chiefly for the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The Eighth is St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Bath, this is greener than the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Ninth is the Sower-Bath, this is ſet about with ſtone Balaſtres, and covered with a handſome Cupola and a Lanthorn, the Water is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, in the ſtream of this Bath I have often coloured Money black without touching the Water; yet the Water it ſelf being once cold changes not the colour of Metals, although they be boyled in it.</p>
               <p>The hotteſt of theſe Baths have not the heat of the Queens Bath at <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> They uſe no Guides as with us, but direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſhort turned Staff.</p>
               <p>Here we met with very good Company, and all kind of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation at no dear rate. A Captain of the Emperour's whom I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied to theſe Baths as a token of his love gave me a <hi>Gempskugel</hi> which is ſaid to be an excreſcence upon the Liver of a wild Goat of <hi>Tyrol,</hi> and highly cryed up in <hi>Germany</hi> for a ſignal remedy againſt the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66078:46"/>
diſeaſes of the Liver, malignant Fevers and the Plague, and many are ſo obſtinately credulous as to think that whoſoever takes it becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable for twenty four hours after.</p>
               <p>Having bathed in the Baths, and taken a draught of the Town, I left <hi>Baden,</hi> and the next conſiderable place was <hi>Newſtad,</hi> one of the chiefeſt Cities in <hi>Auſtria;</hi> it is of a ſquare Figure with a <hi>Piazza</hi> in the middle of it, two ſides whereof are arched and ſupported with Pillars: there are four Gates, three whereof are to be ſeen from the <hi>Piazza;</hi> St. <hi>Jacobs</hi> is the chiefeſt Church, which hath two Steeples in the Front. The Emperor hath a Palace here of a ſquare Building with four Towers, which are to be ſeen a great way off, as is alſo moſt part of the Town, as lying in a Mariſh Ground, and in a plain Country; it is encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Ditch and two Walls, the one very low, the other ſeems not ſtrong; yet as they told me, at one time the <hi>Turk</hi> could not take it, but left it upon condition that they might take ſomething out of the Town; which being granted, they took the <hi>Pronger</hi> or <hi>Whipping-Post,</hi> and carried it unto <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and at another time in the Year 1529. <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent ſtormed it ſeven times in one day, and was every time repulſed. At this place Count <hi>Peter Serini</hi> and <hi>Frangipani</hi> were beheaded, as being chief Contrivers in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Revolt.</p>
               <p>From hence through the Plains we came to Mount <hi>Simeren</hi> paſſing by <hi>Newkirckel,</hi> where there is a Chappel with a little red Pinnacle which they ſay was built by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King; I ſuppoſe by King <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, who was kept Priſoner in <hi>Auſtria</hi> in his return from the Holy Land, whoſe Ranſom built the old Walls of <hi>Vienna.</hi> Mount <hi>Simeren</hi> is a part of Mount <hi>Cetius</hi> upon the top whereof lies an heap of Stones which make the boundary between <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Styria;</hi> the aſcent of the Hill is ſteep and ſtony; ſo that ſometimes it takes twenty four Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Oxen to draw up a Cart or Coach.</p>
               <p>We lodged at <hi>Schotwien</hi> or <hi>Schadtwien,</hi> a ſtrange Town ſeated between Rocks upon the paſſage of the Hills, the Houſes upon the ſides of the Rocks are inacceſſible but from the Top of the Hills, and looking over the Plains, ſerve for Watch-Towers; this is a cloſe ſtrong place, and called by ſome <hi>Clauſtra Austriae;</hi> having the Mountains on each hand, and ſhut up with a Gate at each end; a ſmall current coming down from the Hills, is admitted into the Town under the Wall, which put me in mind of the Picture of the Wall to the Kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> wherein is expreſſed the manner of the Rivers running into <hi>China,</hi> the Wall being ſtill continued over them. From hence I came to <hi>Mehrzuſchlag,</hi> the place where they beat out the Iron into Bars; ſo to <hi>Keimburg</hi> paſſing by a ſwiſt ſmall River named <hi>Murtz,</hi> then travelled by a Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Family of <hi>Stubnberg,</hi> which is eſteemed one of the Ancienteſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> and came to <hi>Prug,</hi> ſeated upon the River <hi>Mur</hi> or <hi>Muer,</hi> a ſwift large River, but not navigable, although after it hath paſſed by <hi>Gratz</hi> and <hi>Rakenburg</hi> it enlarges. <hi>Prug</hi> or <hi>Muripons</hi> is not ill built conſidering the Country, and hath a fair <hi>Piazza.</hi> Another Town of this name I had ſeen before ſeated upon the River <hi>Leyta,</hi> and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction called <hi>Prug</hi> upon the <hi>Leyta,</hi> ſo forward by <hi>Luheim</hi> where the Staple of Iron is. I came to <hi>Knitelfeldt</hi> and <hi>Judenburg</hi> ſtill nigh to the River <hi>Mur,</hi> the next day to <hi>Hundtsmark</hi> and <hi>Newmark,</hi> then to <hi>Frei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach,</hi> which ſome think to have been <hi>Virunum,</hi> others <hi>Vacorium,</hi> in ſight
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66078:47"/>
of <hi>Altenhofn,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Itrowitz,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Tottenbrun,</hi> which belongs to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Saltzburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to St. <hi>Veit</hi> or St. <hi>Faith,</hi> formerly the chief City of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> ſeated upon the Confluence of the River <hi>Glan</hi> and <hi>Wunich,</hi> it is walled about, hath ſix Churches in it, a <hi>Piazza</hi> alſo, and in the ſame a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Fountain with a Laver or Baſon of white Marble made out of one Stone, which was five of my fathoms in circumference: this noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity was brought from <hi>Saal</hi> or <hi>Zolfeldt,</hi> a place not far off, and abounding with <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itopolis</hi> or St. <hi>Veit,</hi> there are four remarkable Hills, as the Hill of St. <hi>Veit,</hi> St. <hi>

               <p>We ſtayed at St. <hi>Veit,</hi> and had the divertiſement of a <hi>Latine</hi> Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Convent, it was in <hi>May</hi> when the higher Hills were covered with ſnow, but the lower were all green, full of Firr
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:66078:47"/>
and Larch-trees, it thundred and lightned very much, and as ſoon as it began they rung their Bells. Many here have great throats, ſome as big as their heads, many are blind, divers dumb and fools withal; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town there is an Hoſpital for ſuch as have loſt their voice, their wits, or are otherwiſe oppreſſed by their great throats, many of them cover their throats, which otherwiſe are very ill complexioned in cold weather. Men and Women have them, the better ſort of People, which live well, drink wine and good beer, are leſs ſubject to them. I ſaw big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger throats in theſe parts, than any I had obſerved in the <hi>Alpine</hi> parts of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Veit,</hi> whoſe name this place bears, was a zealous Chriſtian who laboured much in the Converſion of theſe parts, and was perſecuted under <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> Many Churches and Towns do carry his name in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the People have an opinion of St. <hi>Veit</hi> in the curing of that dacing diſeaſe called <hi>Chorea Sancti Viti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we travelled to <hi>Saal,</hi> or <hi>Solua,</hi> anciently a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and ſet down in the Map of <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius</hi> by the name of <hi>Colonia Soluenſis;</hi> a Field near unto it, is called <hi>Ager Soluenſis</hi> or <hi>Zolfeldt,</hi> a place very fruitful in Antiquities, many whereof have been carried into other parts: in this Field I ſaw that much ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Antiquity of the Kings Chair; it is made of Stone ſet together in the form of two Elbow-Chairs turned back to back. Upon three of the Stones there are Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſurely more ancient than the Chair. At the inſtalling of the Duke of <hi>Carinthia,</hi> whether he be King, Prince, or Emperor; either he himſelf or his Subſtitute ſits in one part of the Chair towards the Eaſt, and a Baur or Country-man in the other part of the Chair toward the Weſt; and among other Ceremonies, the Country-man riſes up and preſents the Duke with a fat and lean Ox; the Duke is obliged to take the lean and return the fat one, and afterwards to receive a gentle box on the ear from the Country-man, and ſo after this manner is inſtalled.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Saal</hi> is very ancient, and hath eſcaped the fury of the Barbarous Nations; herein I ſaw the Tomb of <hi>Modestus</hi> a Companion of S. <hi>Veit,</hi> it is a plain Monument, and they have a Tradition here, that the Tomb hath removed it ſelf about a yard nearer unto the Altar than where it was firſt placed. On the Church Walls are many old <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities of good <hi>Baſſo relievo,</hi> which were firſt taken out of <hi>Zolfeldt;</hi> thoſe which I chieflly obſerved were theſe. <hi>A Chariot with two Horſes. A Chariot and a man in it. A Wolf licking of fruit fallen from a Tree. Hector fastned unto the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of</hi> Achilles <hi>as he was drawn about</hi> Troy. <hi>Four fair Heads unto the middle. Two Wolves, each holding a Horn and a Cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, out of which ſhoots a Vine with Leaves and Grapes,</hi> this is over the Porch. Within the Porch is a <hi>Cupid</hi> holding of a bunch of Grapes. <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> ſucking of a Wolf. Two figures over the Cruciſix by S <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> with ſome others, all which <hi>Zolfeldt</hi> afforded; where I alſo ſaw many Inſcriptions, one upon a ſtone on the South-ſide of the Church was this,

alſo divers <hi>Roman</hi> Coins of Copper and Silver found in theſe parts, and I brought away a Medal of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s in Gold.</p>
               <p>From thence we came to <hi>Clagenfurt</hi> or <hi>Claudia</hi> of old, which is at preſent the chief Town in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> a fair four ſquare Town encloſed with an handſom Wall; the Rampart is very broad; at each corner there is a Baſtion, and one in the middle of each Curtain; the Streets are ſtrait and uniform as well as the Works; there is alſo a very fair <hi>Piazza</hi> in the middle. For the beauty of this place they are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Induſtrious <hi>Lutherans</hi> while they held this Country: The <hi>Piazza</hi> is adorned with a Column of Marble, and a Statue of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin upon it, alſo with a Statue of the Emperor, but above all with a noble Fountain in the middle, over which is a large prodigious Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon made out of one Stone, <hi>Hercules</hi> with a Club ſtanding before it, which the people think to be the Statue of a Baur which killed this Dragon in theſe parts. This was alſo brought from the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Field of <hi>Saal.</hi> There are three noble Maſſy Fountains obſervable in theſe hilly parts, theſe two of St. <hi>Veit</hi> and <hi>Clagenfurt,</hi> and another of white Marble at <hi>Saltzburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the odd Cuſtoms of <hi>Carinthia</hi> there is an old one delivered<note place="margin">
                     <hi>By</hi> Aenaeas Sylvius.</note> of this place, that if a man were vehemently ſuſpected of theft, they hanged him, and three days after judged of the Fact; if he were found guilty they let his body hang till it was corrupted, if otherwiſe, they took down the body, buried it upon the publick account, and ſaid prayers for his ſoul. <hi>Clagenfurt</hi> was then full of Souldiers, where I had the honour to ſee Count <hi>Leſley</hi> the chief Commander, Baron <hi>la Hay,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Peaſly</hi> who had a Company in the Town, whoſe ſingular civilities and favours I cannot ſufficiently acknowledge, they obliged me to be at their Table while I ſtayed, and one day my Lord <hi>Leſley</hi> carried me in his Barge through a handſom ſtreight cut into the Werd-Sea or Lake of <hi>Clagenfurt</hi> to a houſe of pleaſure called <hi>Loretto,</hi> finely ſeated, and which hath a Chappel in it, built after the ſame manner with that of <hi>Loretto</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which having formerly ſeen, I was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to confirm the exact imitation of it. Count <hi>Leſley</hi> is related to <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> and ſo was pleaſed to give me Letters to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and to other parts: The honour I had to know the right honourable the Earl of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Earl Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> did much encreaſe my kind reception among them, whoſe worthy name I found not only known in the Dominions of the Empire, but afterwards alſo in <hi>Turky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Clagenfurt,</hi> I continued my Journey Southward, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>German</hi> mile and half croſſed the River <hi>Dravus</hi> where I found it already a large ſwift River, paſſing over two long Bridges of Wood, and an Iſland in the middle; and after an hour or two I began to enter between the Hills at a place called the <hi>Hammer,</hi> where the Iron is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out, and proceeded in order to my paſſage over Mount <hi>Luibel.</hi>

               <p>In aſcending this Hill we had bad weather, rain and fierce hail, and and the ſnow laid ſtill by the way-ſide; and being ſo high at the time of a ſtrom, I had an opportunity to ſee the Clouds deſcend, and after it was paſt to aſcend again ſo high, as to got over part of the Mountain, and a ſtream of them paſſed through the hole out of <hi>Carniola</hi> into <hi>Carin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> oppoſitely unto us who paſſed out of <hi>Carinthia</hi> into <hi>Carniola,</hi> or out of <hi>Karnten</hi> into <hi>Craen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This noble paſſage being already ſo well contrived, and in the Country of a laborious and induſtrious people, is like to be continued, who remove the ſnow with great pains in the Winter, and keep the way paſſable, and as we continually aſcended till we came to this <hi>Grotto,</hi> ſo when we were once got through it we always deſcended, &amp; came firſt to S. <hi>Anna,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles downward, then to <hi>Newſtuttel</hi> a <hi>German</hi> mile and half further ſtill deſcending, and proceeded forward till we came to <hi>Crainburg,</hi> which is thought to have been formerly <hi>Carnodunum,</hi> a good Town ſeated upon the River <hi>Savus,</hi> from whence through a fair Plain four <hi>German</hi> miles long, we came to <hi>Labach</hi> or <hi>Lubiana</hi> the chief City of <hi>Carniola;</hi> the River <hi>Labach</hi> runs through it, which falls after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the <hi>Savus.</hi> It is an handſome City with a Caſtle ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Hill which over-looks two large Valleys to the North and South, and hath a fair Proſpect of many Hills and Caſtles, but being commanded but another Hill not far from it, it is neglected, although we find that it hath endured a ſtrong Siege, for while the Emperor <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> was receiving the Crown at <hi>Aken,</hi> his Brother <hi>Albertus</hi> and Count <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrick</hi> took the advantage to beſiege it, but it made ſo good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that the Emperor had time to raiſe the Siege and deſtroy the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66078:50"/>
Army. At <hi>Labach</hi> I happily met with Mr. <hi>Toſh</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Apothecary in that Town, who was very civil unto me, informing me of the places about, and ſhewing me many Curioſities, and the ſeveral Minerals of thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>This place is conceived to be old <hi>Nauportus</hi> famous for the landing of the <hi>Argonautes,</hi> who ſetting forth from <hi>Argos Pelaſgicum</hi> in <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſailed unto <hi>Colchos</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of the <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> but being purſued by the King of <hi>Colchos</hi> his Veſſels diſpatched after them, they declined returning by the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> but bearing Northward entred the mouth of <hi>Iſter</hi> or <hi>Danubius,</hi> and paſſed up the River till they came to the concurrence of the <hi>Danubius</hi> and the <hi>Savus,</hi> and taking up the <hi>Savus</hi> they came to the River <hi>Labach,</hi> and went up that River landing about this place anciently called <hi>Nauportus,</hi> and then travelled to the <hi>Adriatick Sea</hi> and returned unto <hi>Greece.</hi> So that in my travels I had been near their ſetting out in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and at the place of their landing in <hi>Carniola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence we travelled towards the <hi>Zirchnitzer-See,</hi> or famous ſtrange Lake of <hi>Zirchnitz</hi> having the Marſhes on our right, hand, and the Hills on our left till we came to <hi>Brounitza,</hi> and then paſſing over them we came to <hi>Zirchnitz,</hi> a Town of about three hundred Houſes, which gives the name unto the Lake, here I applyed my ſelf unto <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Wifer</hi> the <hi>Richter</hi> or Judge of the Town who afforded me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and accommodations for the viewing of the Lake; and went down to <hi>Seedorff,</hi> a Village half a mile nearer the Lake, and then to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdorff,</hi> where I took Boat and ſpent ſome time upon the Lake.</p>
               <p>This Lake is about two <hi>German</hi> miles long, and one broad, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with Hills at ſome diſtance, and upon the South-ſide lies a Foreſt part of <hi>Birnbaumer</hi> Foreſt, which extends a great way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are many Dear, wild Boars, Foxes, Wolves and Bears.</p>
               <p>Every year in ſome part of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> the water of this Lake deſcends under ground through many great holes at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; and in the Month of <hi>September</hi> returns again by the ſame holes; and with a ſpeedy aſcent, ſpringing and mounting up to the heighth of a Pike, and ſoon covering that tract of ground again. When the water is under-ground, the Earth makes a ſpeedy production of of Graſs yielding food for Cattel in the Winter, and at the ſame time, Hares, Deer and Boars reſort to this place out of the Country, and the fore-mentioned Foreſt, and are often taken by the people.</p>
               <p>The Lake affords plenty of Fiſh, but they fiſh but by permiſſion, for the Prince of <hi>Eckenberg</hi> is Lord thereof, and a good part of the Country about, but upon the going away of the water, all have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take Fiſh, which they do by ſtanding in the water by the holes, and ſo intercepting their paſſage take great plenty of them, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would follow the water under-ground, and not returns again until <hi>September.</hi> I could not hear that any unknown Fiſhes were brought up by the water, but thoſe which come up are of the ſame kind with thoſe which went down, which are a kind of Carp, Tench, Eels, and ſuch as are common in other Lakes; and they are rather gainers than Looſers hereby, when they come up, for the Fiſh having ſpawned before, the fry that goes down hath had about three months growth under ground when they are brought up again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:66078:50"/>
The Ground under the Lake is very unequal, and the water not near of the ſame depth, but in ſome places four foot, and then ſuddenly again twenty yards deep: and becauſe the Fiſh frequent the Valleys or deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er places, more than the Hills or eminent parts, the Fiſhermen who know the place wet and dry, have given unto ſeven of theſe Valleys peculiar names, which in the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> the Language of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are theſe,</p>

               <p>I paſſed over the five firſt mentioned Valleys, and went to a noted Stone called the Fiſhers Stone, by the appearance whereof they can conjecture how ſoon the water will deſcend, and by an Hill, which when the water is high becomes a pleaſant Iſland, and then return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>They can give no account that this Lake hath failed any year to deſcend and ariſe again, or have any tradition how long this property of the Lake hath been obſerved. Some Lakes have been made by Earth-quakes, but it is more probable that this hath been from all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and according to the beſt conjectures, this is the <hi>Lugea Palus</hi> of <hi>Strabo,</hi> and therefore more ſtrange that the Ancients are ſilent in this remarkable account.</p>
               <p>The neareſt Sea unto this Lake is the <hi>Sinus Tergeſtinus,</hi> and <hi>Sinus Flanaticus,</hi> the Gulf of <hi>Trieſte,</hi> and the Gulf of <hi>Quevero.</hi> And not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles from hence are the Heads of divers conſiderable Rivers, as that of <hi>Labach,</hi> the <hi>Corcoras</hi> or <hi>Gurk,</hi> the <hi>Colapis</hi> or <hi>Culp,</hi> which run into the <hi>Savus.</hi> The <hi>Vipao</hi> or <hi>amnis frigdus</hi> which runs into <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonſo</hi> by <hi>Goritia,</hi> and divers more, but whither theſe Rivers ariſe where the Lake falls, I could not learn.</p>
               <p>The Ground not far from this Lake is very hollow and full of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and I obſerved many Caverns and deep holes in other parts of <hi>Carniola</hi> ſomewhat like unto <hi>Elden</hi> hole in <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> and I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the moſt conſiderable perſons at <hi>Zirchnitz</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Eckenberg</hi> had the curioſity to go into one of them, and came out again upon the ſide of an Hill.</p>
               <p>I was upon conſideration whether I ſhould go from hence unto <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtum</hi> now <hi>Trieſte,</hi> a Port-Town of the Emperor's in the <hi>Adriatick-Sea,</hi> and then by Ship to <hi>Venice,</hi> but having been in many Mines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a deſire alſo to ſee the famous Quick ſilver Mine at <hi>Idria</hi> in the County of <hi>Goritia;</hi> and parting from <hi>Zirchnitz</hi> I paſſed by <hi>Lovecq,</hi> and travelled over Mountainous parts till I came to <hi>Idria,</hi> which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with Hills on all ſides, and a River of the ſame name runs by it, which although <hi>Leandro Alberti</hi> terms <hi>ſuperbiſſimo fiume d'Idria,</hi> yet I found it ſmall and ſhallow at the time when I was there, upon plentiful rains howſoever it proves ſufficient to convey down the Firr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, and other wood required in the building of the Mines, and alſo
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66078:51"/>
for fuel neceſſary in the ſervice of them; and to this end there is an handſome work of Piles made ſlopeing a-thwart the River, (after the ſame manner as I obſerved at <hi>Newſol</hi> in upper <hi>Hungary</hi> croſs the River <hi>Gran)</hi> to ſtop the Trees which are cut down and caſt into the River above this place.</p>
               <p>What is chiefly conſiderable in this Town are the Quick-ſilver Mines, very well known to the neighbouring parts, and exceeding uſeful to many at greater diſtance.</p>
               <p>The entrance into theſe Mines is not high or upon an Hill, but in the Town it ſelf, whereby they are ſomewhat the more troubled with water, againſt which they are provided with many excellent Engines and Devices, as at other deep Mines; the deepeſt part of the Mine from the entrance is between one hundred and twenty, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty fathoms.</p>
               <p>Of the Quick-ſilver of this Mine they have two ſorts, the one call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jungfraw,</hi> that is virgin Quick-ſilver, the other plain Quick-ſilver, virgin Mercury they call that which diſcovers it ſelf without the help of fire, and is either plainly to be ſeen in the Earth or Ore, or falls down in little drops in the Mine, and ſometimes ſtreams out in good quantity; as about ſeven years ago it ran out of the Earth at firſt in a ſtream as ſmall as a thred, and afterwards as big as a Pack-thred, but ceas'd in three or four days.</p>
               <p>That alſo is accounted virgin Quick-ſilver, which having no need to paſs the fire, is ſeparated by water firſt in a Sieve, and afterwards in a long Trough, having very ſmall holes at one end, ſo that there is in a manner two ſorts of Virgin Mercury; the one running out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it ſelf without labour, the other requiring ſome way of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſeparation, though not ſo high an one as by fire.</p>
               <p>Plain Quick-ſilver they name that which is not at firſt perceived by the eye, or falls from the Ore, but is forced out by fire, and this they obtain out of the Ore, or out of the natural Cinnabar of Mercury which they dig out of this Mine. The Ore is of a dark colour mixed with red, but the beſt is a hard Stone which they commit not preſently to the fire, but powder it groſly and work it by the ſieve, that ſo if any Virgin Quick-ſilver be found in it, it may be ſeparated in this manner, and what doth not paſs the ſieve, may be ſeparated by fire in Iron Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, fifty of them in a fire.</p>
               <p>The Quick-ſilver-Ore of this Mine is the richeſt of all Ores I have yet ſeen, for ordinarily it contains in it half Quick-ſilver, and in two parts of Ore one part of Quick-ſilver, and ſometimes in three parts of Ore, two parts of Quick-ſilver.</p>
               <p>I went into the Mine by the Pit of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> and came up again by that of St. <hi>Barbara,</hi> deſcending and aſcending by Ladders; I aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at one of ſix hundred and thirty nine ſtaves, or eighty nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms. <hi>Siſerus</hi> in <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In a Laboratory, where the Quick-ſilver is ſeparated by fire, I ſaw an heap of ſixteen thouſand retorts of Iron, every one of which coſts a Crown at the beſt hand from the Iron Furnaces in <hi>Carinthia:</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are alſo at one time eight hundred retorts, and as many recipients
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66078:51"/>
employed together in drawing over the Quick-ſilver in ſixteen Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fifty in each Furnace, twenty five of a ſide, twelve above, and thirteen below of each ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 12. 1669. When I was there they carried out forty ſaumes of Quick-ſilver into Foreign parts, each ſaume containing three hundred and fifteen pound weight to the value of four thouſand Ducats of Gold, though the conveyance be not eaſie, for it is carried upon Horſes backs, two ſmall Barrels upon each Horſe, yet ſome is ſent as far as <hi>Chremnitz</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> for the uſe of the Gold Mine, and ſome into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and other remote parts.</p>
               <p>In the Caſtle I ſaw three thouſand ſaumes of Quick-ſilver together in Barrels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Quick-ſilver being firſt made up in double Leather; and in another Houſe as much rich Ore as can be deſtilled in two years, except they have great plenty of rain to bring down the wood, but the Hills being high about them, it ſnows at the tops of them oftner than it rains.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Strangers who come into the Caſtle of <hi>Idria,</hi> have their names ſet down in a Regiſter-Book, with the Country of which they are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the Catalogue is large, but of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men there are few; of late years onely Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pope,</hi> with their Company, of whoſe obſervations there is an handſome account in the Philoſophical Tranſactions ſome time ſince. This place is the more grateful to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in reſpect that it being a Frontier Town, and bordering upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations, many Languages are underſtood here, and I obſerved that there were five ſpoken freely by the Officers and better ſort of People, beſides <hi>French</hi> which was not excluded from this place, though not ſo eſteemed or deſired. <hi>viz. Friulian, Sclavonian, German, Latin</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Idria</hi> I paſſed over <hi>Swartzenberg</hi> or the black Mountain, and deſcended about ten miles through a ſtony Country far worſe than the <hi>Crau</hi> or ſtony Plain in <hi>Provence,</hi> and came to <hi>Adoſhini,</hi> and then to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Goritia.</note> or <hi>Noreja</hi> of old, the chiefeſt place of the Country of <hi>Goritia,</hi> well ſeated and over-looking a fair Plain to the South-Weſt. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Governour of this Country lives in the Caſtle, and hath had of late a Guard granted unto him, having been ſet upon by a Gentleman of the Country, who for that fact was baniſhed, and his Houſe raſed.</p>
               <p>Travelling in the night, we had ſometimes about us a great number of large Glow-worms, which put into papers gave a dim light; and in ſome places in the Plains the Air was full of flaming flies affording ſome delight to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carniolians</hi> ſpeak a Dialect of the <hi>Sclavonian,</hi> but in theſe parts they have a Language called <hi>Lingua Fullana,</hi> or <hi>Friulana;</hi> he that ſpeaketh <hi>Italian</hi> may underſtand much thereof. The Lords Prayer in that Language begins thus, <hi>Pari Neſtri ch' ees in Cijl ſee Santificaat tuto nom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Leaving <hi>Goritia</hi> I paſſed the River <hi>Sontius</hi> or <hi>Liſonzo</hi> which ariſing in the Hills above runs into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea. Near this River, <hi>Odoacer</hi>

Afterwards travelling on through Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, I came unto the ſtrong and well fortified City of <hi>Palma Nova,</hi> built ſince to hinder the like incurſions.</p>
               <p>All this long Circuit until we came within a mile of <hi>Palma Nova</hi> we were in the Emperors Dominions, which are much larger than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly apprehended, and having ſooner or later ſeen the greateſt part thereof, I cannot but be of that opinion, for he poſſeſſes all <hi>Auſtria, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,</hi> part of <hi>Croatia, Iſtria,</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> part of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> the large County of <hi>Tirolis,</hi> the large Country of <hi>Bohemia, Moravia, Sileſia,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Luſatia,</hi> and a conſiderable part of <hi>Hungaria;</hi> from <hi>Presbourg</hi> to <hi>Tockay</hi> and <hi>Zathmar,</hi> above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty miles, and the Inhabitants of theſe Countries being an hardy ſtout and valiant People, I cannot but think him a great and powerful Prince, and an happy Bulwark of Chriſtendom againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>

                  <hi>Palma Nova</hi> in <hi>Friuli</hi> is the largeſt regular Fortification I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it hath nine Baſtions, bearing the names of ſome noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> which have little to be excepted againſt but their round ears, on each Curtain there are two Cavalliers, the Rampart is much higher than the Wall, upon which there are planted a hundred good Guns, and many more ready upon all occaſions, the Ditch is thirty paces broad, and twelve deep; it is kept dry to render the Town more healthful, but may be filled with water upon occaſion, as that of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> much whereof is kept dry leaſt it ſhould injure their deep Cellars; there are three Gates, <hi>Porta Maritima, Porta di Cividal,</hi> and <hi>Porta di <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine.</hi> Between the <hi>Porta Maritima,</hi> and the <hi>Porta di <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine</hi> lie theſe three Baſtions <hi>Foſcarini, Savorgnan</hi> and <hi>Grimani.</hi> Between the <hi>Porta di <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine</hi> and <hi>Porta di Cividal</hi> are three others named <hi>Barbaro, Dona</hi> and <hi>Monte.</hi> And between the <hi>Porta di Cividal</hi> and the <hi>Porta Mariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> are theſe three. <hi>Garzoni, Contarini</hi> and <hi>Villa Chiara.</hi> They were then making one fair Half-Moon before each Gate: In the Center of the City is fixed a Standard over a Triple Well, in the middle of a Sexangular <hi>Piazza,</hi> from whence a man may ſee the three Gates and ſix Streets quite through the Town. The <hi>Piazza</hi> is beautified with the Front of the <hi>Domo</hi> Church, divers Statues, and an Obelisk much gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Bridge there is a Draw-bridge made with ſuch Artifice, that the sentinel diſcovering any force approaching, may by onely touching a certain Iron with his foot draw up the Bridge; many handſom contrivances for Draw-bridges I had ſeen in other parts, ſometimes many upon one Bridge, and not onely one after or behind another, but alſo ſometimes two or three on a breſt, the outermoſt ones ſerving for the retreat of the foot, that in the middle for the Horſe and Carriages. Some Draw-bridges are not to lift up, but to be drawn on one ſide, and ſo by onely turning of it like to the opening of a Gate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers are conveyed over the Moat and landed; but thoſe which

               <p>This is at preſent eſteemed one of the nobleſt Fortifications in <hi>Europe,</hi> begun by the <hi>Venetians</hi> 1594. and is a notable Bulwark of their State and <hi>Italy,</hi> for this way the <hi>Huns</hi> and barbarous Nations paſſed into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and this way the <hi>Turks</hi> have formerly made in-roads almoſt as far as <hi>Treviſo.</hi>

               <p>Having ſeen many of the chief Fortifications in <hi>Europe,</hi> I had the greater deſire to take a view of this, becauſe it carries ſo great a fame, and is ſaid to have been contrived by Military advice from all parts, and as alſo becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> would have it believed to be the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Fortification, not onely in <hi>Europe,</hi> but in the World; I heartily wiſh they may never know a complete <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army before it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ever they are in no good condition to relieve it. If the Emperor, through whoſe Countries the <hi>Turks</hi> muſt paſs to come to this place, and the Republick hold firm, it will be hard for the <hi>Turk</hi> to come unto it, and if the <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould be at ſuch a peace with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> as may bind up their Fleet from aſſiſting the other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſhall not need to attempt it or make his way into <hi>Italy</hi> by that place, for whether the Naval Forces of <hi>Italy</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> be able to reſiſt a complete <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, ſo as to hinder landing and falling upon that Country ſome other way, is much to be doubted.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Palma nova</hi> I went to <hi>Maran</hi> St. <hi>Vito,</hi> a Port Town of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> in <hi>Friuli,</hi> ſo named from St. <hi>Vito,</hi> who is ſaid to have been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this place.</p>
               <p>At this Town we took a <hi>Felluca,</hi> and ſayling by the ſhoar of <hi>Friuli</hi> or <hi>Patria,</hi> we paſſed by <hi>Porto di Taiamento,</hi> and came to <hi>Cahorle.</hi> In this Iſland there is a Church dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea-ſhoar nigh the Waves, yet ſaid never to be overflowed by the Sea, being as it were the <hi>Halcyon</hi> Neſt of its Patroneſs, and a place of remarkable devotion. On this ſhoar we refreſhed our ſelves and were divertiſed at Sea in ſeeing them take Shell-fiſh, and then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Livenza,</hi> where the Sea came formerly up as high as <hi>Opitergium,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Porto di Piave,</hi> I arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> entring by the <hi>Porto de Caſtelli</hi> paſſing by the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> Convent, and landed at the <hi>Piazza</hi> of St. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I found the whole City highly concerned for the <hi>Hazardous</hi> State of <hi>Candia,</hi> which was loſt ſoon after, <hi>Dominico Cantarini</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Duke was ſedulous in that affair.

               <p>There was alſo a ſupply of Auxiliaries in good readineſs; it was at that time a more than ordinary hot Seaſon, and ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sea Captains and Maſters told me, that they had ſeldom met with ſuch hot weather even between the <hi>Tropicks.</hi>

Having formerly had a view of <hi>Rome, Naples, Florence,</hi> and the great Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and paſſed ſome time at <hi>Padoa</hi> a few years before, I made but a ſhort ſtay about Venice, and having reviewed what was moſt conſiderable, and renewed my acquaintance with ſome worthy courteous Friends at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Padoa,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> the Conful, Mr. <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cadined,</hi> and others.

               <p>In order thereto I took Boat at <hi>Venice</hi> and landed at <hi>Meſtre</hi> a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Town, and the beſt place for accommodation for ſuch as travel into <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Tirol,</hi> or into <hi>Auſtria</hi> by <hi>Friuli;</hi> from hence I travelled ten miles through a pleaſant plain Country till I came to <hi>Treviſo</hi> or <hi>Tarviſium,</hi> which gives the name unto the Country about, <hi>La Marca Trevigiana,</hi> a handſome City adorned with good Houſes, Churches, Towers and Fountains.

               <p>From thence I came to <hi>Lovadina,</hi> and croſſed the great River <hi>Piave, Plavis,</hi> or <hi>Anaſſus,</hi> which ariſing in the Mountains, paſſes by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Belluna</hi> and <hi>Feltre,</hi> then to <hi>Concian</hi> or <hi>Coniglian,</hi> and next to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cille</hi> or <hi>Sacillum,</hi> formerly a Biſhops See under the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> a pleaſant and well-built place eſteemed the Garden of the Republick, and ſeated by the River <hi>Livenza</hi> or <hi>Liquentia,</hi> which paſſing by <hi>Motta</hi> runs into the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I took a guide to conduct me through the Plains and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and came to <hi>Spilimbergo,</hi> where I again took a Guide to croſs the ſwift River <hi>Taiamento</hi> or <hi>Tiliaventum;</hi> this is eſteemed the greateſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Friuli,</hi> ariſing above in the <hi>Julian Alpes,</hi> and running down into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, and often over-flowing a great part of the plain Country. This ſwift River put a ſtop to the incurſion of the <hi>Turks</hi> when <hi>Scander Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Illyria</hi> broke into <hi>Friuli</hi> with twelve thouſand Horſe and deſtroyed all before him, in the Reign of <hi>Sultan Bajazet</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Spilimbergo,</hi> I paſſed a neat River or notable Cut call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>La Brentella,</hi> ſixteen miles long, made by the <hi>Venetians</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bringing down of wood from the Mountains to be uſed in the making of Glaſſes at <hi>Muran;</hi> it is all paved with a good Stone, bottom and ſides, the bottom is round, ſo that it is ſomewhat like a Tube opened or ſplit in two.</p>

               <p>In theſe Mountainous places I was entertained with ſtrange ſtories of the Snow which covers theſe Hills in the Winter, as how many pikes length the Snow was deep in ſome places, how round the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would look when all the craggy Rocks were covered, how a Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball thrown down from a Mountain would ſo gather and augment in the fall, as to do great miſchief in the Valley, and that if the ſmalleſt Bird ſhould but ſcrape with her foot at the edge of an high Hill, that little beginning might ſo encreaſe in the deſcent, upon a thaugh, as to over-whelm an Houſe at the bottom.</p>
               <p>From hence by <hi>Tervis,</hi> and <hi>Tirl,</hi> unto <hi>Villach,</hi> or <hi>Villach,</hi> an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Town, and one of the chiefeſt in <hi>Carinthia;</hi> but before I came to <hi>Villach</hi> I went to ſee the Natural Baths which were not much out of the way at the foot of an Hill about an <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from the Town and in good eſteem. There are two clear Sulphureous Baths, but very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warm, and have an acid and no unpleaſant taſte; the bottom is not planchered nor paved, but hath its own natural Spring and Settlement with it; yet into one there is a hot Spring let in which ariſes by it; they are large and have ſtairs to deſcend into them, with little Rooms of wood about them for accommodation, they are covered over, and they bathe in them cloathed with ſhirt and drawers as in <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

               <p>Not far from hence is a Lake called the <hi>Oſſiacker See,</hi> from <hi>Oſſiack</hi> a Town upon the ſide thereof, and is one of the moſt conſiderable Lakes in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> there being beſides it, theſe which are remarkable, the <hi>White Lake,</hi> the <hi>Millſtatter,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Forchten;</hi> this Lake doth not onely abound in Fiſh, but affords great plenty of <hi>Oſſiacker</hi> Nuts, which the people eat, and ſome make Bread of; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding upon examination I found to be no other than very large Seeds of <hi>Tribulus Aquaticus,</hi> or water <hi>Gallthorps.</hi>

               <p>From <hi>Villach</hi> I ſoon came to the <hi>Werd See,</hi> and keeping it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on my right hand, I travelled by the ſide of it till I came to <hi>Clagenfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> and then paſſed again to St. <hi>Veits,</hi> where I met Mr. <hi>Donellan,</hi> from whom, upon my former deſires to him, I received an account of the great Lead Mines in upper <hi>Carinthia</hi> at <hi>Bleyberg,</hi> where they have worked eleven hundred years, and the Pits are deep; <hi>Federnus Stollen</hi> or <hi>Cuniculus</hi> is an hundred and ten fathoms deep in the Earth, and the Hills ſo high about it, that upon the melting of the Snow in the Spring, there is often much hurt done, the Snow rowling and falling in ſuch vaſt heaps that nothing is able to reſiſt it, ſo that in the year 1654. it fell ſo vehemently that it deſtroyed and carried away ſixteen Houſes.

               <p>The old Mens houſe, or an Hoſpital for ſixty aged perſons, is large and handſome; having a good Quadrangle and a Garden in it. The Hoſpital alſo for the ſick is very cleanly kept.</p>
               <p>Here I firſt ſaw the manner of puniſhing Malefactors by whipping them with rods, which is more ſevere than I imagined; they lead them to a Poſt upon a Scaffold, their hands tyed and by a Pully drawn up as high as can be extended, and then an Iron faſtned about their waſt to keep them ſteady; in which ſtretched-out poſture they receive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fifty or ſixty ſtripes or more, according to the merit of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Not far from this place there is a great Water, or noted Lake called <hi>Haerlem Meere</hi> about twenty Miles in length, which is frozen over in hard Winters, and men ſwiftly travel over it by ſliding or in ſleds. When <hi>Haerlem</hi> was beſieged there was a Naval fight upon it; The <hi>Dutch</hi> having about an hundred and fifty Veſſels, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not many fewer.

               <p>From <hi>Haerlem</hi> I went to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a City at preſent for Riches, Trade, Shipping, fair Streets, and pleaſant habitations, ſcarce yielding to any other of the World. It is ſeated upon the River <hi>Ye,</hi> and hath its name, as 'tis reported, from a Caſtle appertaining long ſince to the Lords of <hi>Amstel,</hi> to whom this place alſo belonged: At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the ſeat of a few Fiſhermen; but afterwards increaſing, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many Priviledges from the Counts of <hi>Holland,</hi> and was made a Town or City by the favour of their Grants and Charters. In the year 1470. it was walled about with a Brick-wall, to defend it againſt the Citizens of <hi>

In few Months after alſo, the whole Town was almoſt reduced to Aſhes by fire, but by the increaſe of their Traffick they eaſily overcame their loſſes, waded through all difficulties, and rendred good Services to their Counts, and received the honour afterwards from <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor to have the Imperial Crown over their Armes, which ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Party, and communicated his deſign, he reſolved to ſurprize the Town by night, at the time of the ſounding of the Bell; to which intent they were already entred the Market place, had ſet upon the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: and cut in pieces thoſe who reſiſted them. When by great providence the rope to the great Bell was taken away; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates had notice of it, and cauſed all the Streets and Avenues leading to the Market-place to be ſtopped up with Wool-ſacks and Hop-ſacks, whereby they were hindred in their deſign of taking the Town by night, and the next morning their number being diſcovered to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, they were ſet upon, driven into the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</p>
               <p>Of late years this City is mightily encreaſed and encompaſſed with a new Wall, and fortified after the modern way. The new Streets are large and uniform: and the whole Town being in a low Marſhy ground, the water is let in through all the conſiderable Streets. The River <hi>Amſtel</hi> paſſes through the City, being let in under a handſome well contrived Bridge of Eleven Arches, which is ſo built as to make part of the Wall and Rampart, and is 26 paces broad. The whole Town is built upon Piles, or high Firr-trees, driven down perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into the Earth ſo thick together, that nothing more can be forced in between them: And by this means they build Houſes in the Sea, and lay Foundations ſtrong enough to ſupport the geateſt Buildings whatſoever, in places where no ſolid bottom is to be found. But they muſt needs be at a great expence and labour before they can lay the firſt Stone: And the number of Trees required to each Foundation is conſiderable; ſince for the Foundation of one Tower or Steeple alone, over againſt the Church of St. <hi>Katherine,</hi> Mr. <hi>J. de Parivall,</hi> who wrote <hi>Les Delices de la Hollande,</hi> reckons that there was rammed into the ground a <hi>Foreſt,</hi> as he calls it, of Six thouſand three hundred and thirty four great Trees. About this manner of work, for the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Foundations, I ſaw them employed in divers places, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly at the <hi>Eaſt-India-houſe</hi> and at a place where a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church was then deſigned to be built, So that it was not improbably ſaid, <hi>That if a man could ſee all under this City, he could hardly behold a greater Foreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Stadthuis</hi> or <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> is the nobleſt Building in all theſe Countries. A Pile of Freeſtone of an hundred and ten paces in Front, being larger than the Magnified Front of the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> and eighty one paces deep, or on the ſides. The Chambers in it, the Pictures and Statues, are worthy to be ſeen and admired. The firſt Room on the right hand, or <hi>Judgment-hall,</hi> where the Malefactors receive their Sentence, is adorned with large Statues, hanging down their heads in mournful poſtures, as if concerned or grieving at what was then pronounced. The Floors are of Marble; the Roofs are rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gilt and painted. Upon the top of all ſtands <hi>Atlas</hi> or <hi>Columbus,</hi> holding a Globe upon his Shoulder made of Copper, of about ten foot Diameter, which is as large perhaps as any Ball or Globe whatſoever employed to this ornamental uſe. That upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> as having been in it, I judge to be leſs; as likewiſe that at <hi>Florence.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ornament to the Tower of their <hi>Moſques,</hi> is three Balls one above another, and an half Moon over them, but they are leſs by far, at leaſt ſuch as I have ſeen: and by relation from Eye-witneſſes, the

largeſt of the three noble gilded Balls at <hi>Morocco</hi> are inferiour to this. But I will ſay nothing more of this great building, the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> ſince there is a peculiar deſcription of it in Folio, with Cuts and Figures of the moſt remarkable Curioſities in it. The <hi>Exchange</hi> is fair and large, and above it are Shops: it is very well frequented, and he that comes after twelve payeth ſix ſtivers.</p>

The <hi>Tuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuis</hi> or <hi>Raſpelhuis,</hi> or Houſe of Correction for debauched young men, ſuch as are incorrigible and diſobedient to Parents or Laws, hath at the entrance of the Gate two Lions bridled, a proper Emblem, with this Inſcription, <hi>Virtutis eſt domare quae cuncti pavent.</hi> This was formerly a Monaſtery belonging to the Nuns of the Order of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to this uſe 1595. They who are put in, are forced to work and gain their Bread with hard labour. I ſaw thoſe who raſped <hi>Brazil,</hi> having a certain task ſet them every day, work ſo hard, that being naked and in a ſweat, and the duſt of the <hi>Brazil</hi> wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d flying upon them, they were all over painted of a beautiful red colour. Which odd ſight made me call to mind the Fancy of my Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> of a Nation wherein the People were of Orange-tawny co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the King of Purple.</p>
               <p>They told us that ſome that were committed to their charge, and not to be brought to work by blows, they placed in a large Ciſtern, and let the water in upon them, placing only a Pump by them for their relief, whereby they are forced to labour for their lives, and to free themſelves from drowning. One we ſaw put into a narrow Dungeon, and kept from meat. Some are put into this Houſe for a longer time, ſome for a ſhorter. It hath been a puniſhment for ſuch as have drawn their Daggers, or offered to ſtab any one. And ſome Citizens, though
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66078:59"/>
able and rich enough, contrive it ſo, that when their Sons are extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and maſterleſs, the Officers ſeize upon them, and carry them into this Houſe, where they are not forced to any hard labour, but kept in till they ſee ſufficient ſigns of amending their life.</p>
               <p>This way of Correction may ſeem ſevere to many, yet is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that which is ſaid to have been formerly uſed in <hi>Germany.</hi> Particularly at <hi>Colen,</hi> in the <hi>White Tower,</hi> at the North end of the Town, near the <hi>Rhine;</hi> where it is reported, that ſuch Youths, who were not otherwiſe to be reclaimed, were in a barbarous manner ſhut up in the <hi>White Tower.</hi> The height and thickneſs of the Walls ſecured them from eſcaping, or from their complaints being heard. Near the top was placed out of their reach a loaf of bread, the laſt remedy againſt ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which while their bold neceſſity forced them to reach at, they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their laſt ſentence upon themſelves, and miſerably brake their own necks.</p>
               <p>Somewhat like the <hi>Raſpelhuis</hi> is the <hi>Spinbuis,</hi> or Houſe of Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the young women, who live looſely, are taken in the night, or can give no account of their living. They are put in for a certain time, according as their fault merits, and are bound to make lace, ſew, or employ their time perpetually in ſome honeſt labour.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the better ſort are permitted to have Chambers apart. In one large Room I ſaw about an hundred of them, and ſome very well dreſſed and fine, which was an unexpected ſight to me, and would ſure be more ſtrange to behold in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Weeſhuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for Children, where there are Six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Orphans carefully looked after, and well educated.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dolhuis,</hi> or a Houſe for ſuch as are Delirious, Maniacal, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholical of both Sexes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gaſthuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for the Sick, being large, and hath a great Revenue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mannenhuis,</hi> or Hoſpital for old Men, and ſuch as are no longer able to labour towards their own ſupport.</p>
               <p>Beſides all which, there are great Sums of money collected for the poor, ſo that there is not a Beggar to be ſeen in the Streets, and upon all aſſignations or appointments of meeting at the Tavern, or elſewhere, and upon many other occaſions, whoſoever fails to come at the exact time, forfeits more or leſs to the uſe of the Poor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India-houſes</hi> are remarkable, and the great Stores of their Commodities, <hi>Cinnamon, Green-ginger, Camphire, Pepper, Calecuts, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> &amp;c. The Ships are of a great burden: their Houſe was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging, although it was great before; and a perfect Town for all Trades within it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Admiralteyt,</hi> or Admiralty where their Stores for War and Shipping are laid up, is encompaſſed with water; near to it there lay then 72 Men of War. In the Houſe we ſaw their Cables, Grapling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons, Pullies, Oars, Charges for Powder, Lanthorns for Ships, &amp;c. At the entrance of the Gate hangs up a <hi>Canoe</hi> which ſeems to have a man in it, dryed up, ſo as to be preſerved from corruption, and a Paddle in his hand: encloſed up to the waſt in the <hi>Canoe,</hi> in ſuch ſort, as the Fiſh-skins, which were the cover to it, being ſo ſewed together that no water could get in, he might keep the Sea in the greateſt Storms without danger. The top of this Houſe, as of divers others alſo in this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66078:59"/>
City, is a Reſervatory for Rain-water, which they have the more need of, becauſe they have little good water hereabouts.</p>
               <p>The faireſt Streets in the Town are <hi>Harlem-ſtreet,</hi> the <hi>Cingel, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Graft, Kaiſers Graft,</hi> and the New Buildings in the Iſland towards <hi>Gottenburg.</hi> And if they continue to build with Freeſtone, they will ſtill ſurpaſs theſe, which, I'll aſſure you, are in no ſmall meaſure beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
               <p>I ſaw a Globe to be ſold, made by <hi>Vingbomes,</hi> between ſix and ſeven foot Diameter, valued at Sixteen thouſand Guldens: The Meridian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, being of braſs, coſt a thouſand Guldens. The Globe is made of Copper-plates excellently well painted, with all the new Diſcoveries in it, as that of <hi>Anthony Van Dimons</hi> Land, found out 1642. in 42 degrees of Southern Latitude, and 170 of Longitude, thoſe towards the North-weſt of <hi>Japan,</hi> and thoſe places both about <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea beyond the Streights of <hi>Voygats, New-Holland, Weſt-Frieſland, Cape d' Hyver,</hi> &amp;c. but I have ſince met with a Book, which doth ſomewhat contradict this; entituled <hi>A Voyage into the Northern Countries by Monſieur</hi> Martiniere, who went in one of the three Ships belonging to the Northern Company of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> in the year 1653. and by that means had occaſion to converſe with the <hi>Norwegians, Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Laplanders, Kilops, Borandians, Siberians, Zemblians,</hi> and <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jedes,</hi> who are Neighbours to the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Tingorſes,</hi> in his 46 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he expreſſes himſelf after this manner. There having fallen into my hands ſeveral Geographical Charts of ſundry eminent and much celebrated Authors, I am much amazed to ſee how they are miſtaken in the poſition of <hi>Zembla,</hi> which they place much nearer the North Pole than really it is; they divide it likewiſe by the Sea from <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and place it far diſtant from it, when as indeed thoſe two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are Contiguous, the Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> butting upon the Coaſts of <hi>Zembla,</hi> ſo as did not the great quantity of Snow, and the violence of the cold render thoſe Borders uninhabitable, the paſſage would be very eaſie by Land from <hi>Greenland</hi> to <hi>Zembla</hi> and from <hi>Zembla</hi> paſſing the <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> Mountains to enter into <hi>Samojedia,</hi> from thence into <hi>Tartary</hi> or <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as one pleaſed: I was amazed likewiſe to ſee they had deſcribed the Streight called <hi>Voygat,</hi> not above ten French Leagues in length, whereas it contains above five and thirty Dutch Leagues, which is ſix times as much. Again, they would perſwade us that through that Streight our ſhips might paſs into the great <hi>Tartarian</hi> Ocean, which is a miſtake. And although they indeed do affirm that in the time of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> a Dutch Veſſel paſſed that way into that Ocean, yet it is a manifeſt error, that Streight being bounded, as I ſaid before, by the <hi>Pater-noſter</hi> Mountains, which are half a League high, and the tops of them covered with perpetual Snow, which never diſſolves. And of this I can give a poſitive teſtimony, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been my ſelf in that Streight under thoſe Mountains in the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, which is the hotteſt time of the year.</p>
               <p>From the Steeple of the old Church of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had a good Proſpect of the Town, and the great number of Ships lying upon one ſide of it, like a Wood; and all the Towns about it. The Roofs of the Houſes being ſharp, it is a moſt uneven Town to be looked upon down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as it is a handſome one to be looked on upward; and is not ſo diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing or pleaſing to the ſight, as ſome Towns in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:66078:60"/>
have flatter Roofs, or elſe are covered with a fine black Slat or Ardoiſe. Upon this, and all other Towers of the Town, a Trumpet is ſounded at Midnight, and in other parts of the City at ſix a Clock night and morning. At eleven a Clock, the time of going on to the <hi>Exchange,</hi> there is good Muſick at the <hi>Stadthuis,</hi> given by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> They make good Harmony alſo every hour in playing upon their Chimes and Bells in moſt Steeples. And there is a Muſick-houſe or Entertaining-houſe, where any one is admitted for a Stiver, hears moſt ſorts of Muſick, ſees many good Water-works, and divers motions by Clock-work, Pictures, and other Divertiſements.</p>
               <p>During my ſtay at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had the opportunity of ſeeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Learned Men, and Perſons of Note. Dr. <hi>Ruiſh</hi> ſhewed us many Curioſities in Anatomy, as the <hi>Skeletons</hi> of young Children, and <hi>Faetus's</hi> of all Ages, neatly ſet together, and very white; the <hi>Lymphatick veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> ſo preſerved, as to ſee the <hi>valves</hi> in them. A Liver excarnated, ſhowing the Minute veſſels, all ſhining and clear. The Muſcles of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren diſſected and kept from corruption: entire Bodies preſerved; the face of one was very remarkable, without the leaſt ſpot or change of colour or alteration of the lineaments, from what might be expected immediately after death: he had then kept it two years, and hoped it would ſo continue. Dr. <hi>Swammerdam</hi> ſhewed us divers of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments which he hath ſet down in his Treatiſe <hi>De Reſpiratione;</hi> and a very ſair Collection of Inſects brought from ſeveral Countries; a <hi>Stagg-fly</hi> of a very great bigneſs; an <hi>Indian Scolopendria,</hi> or <hi>Forty-foot;</hi> a fly called <hi>Ephemeron,</hi> and many other Curioſities. Old <hi>Glawber</hi> the Chymiſt ſhewed us his Laboratory: And we received much civility from <hi>Blaſius</hi> the Phyſick Profeſſour who hath wrote a Comment upon <hi>Veſlingius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews live more handſomly and ſplendidly here, than in any other place: Their chief Synagogue is large, adorned with Lamps of Braſs and Silver. We happened to be there at the Feaſt of their <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>year;</hi> ſo that there blowing of Horns, ſhouting and ſinging was not omitted: Some of them underſtand divers Languages. I ſaw one <hi>Moſes di Pas,</hi> a Learned young Man, and <hi>Orobio,</hi> a Phyſician of Note. And I was ſorry to ſee divers here to profeſs themſelves publickly Jews, who had lived at leaſt reputed Chriſtians, for a long time in other places: One who had been a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friar thirty years; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who had been Profeſſour ſome years at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and before that Phyſician to the King of <hi>Spain. Juda Leo,</hi> a Jew, hath taken great pains in making a Model of the Temple of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Houſe, the Fort of the Temple, the Tabernacle, the Iſraelites encamping, and other Curioſities. I was preſent at the Circumciſion of a Child; which is performed by thruſting a Probe in between the <hi>Glans</hi> and <hi>Praeputi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and ſeparating it, or dilating the <hi>Praeputium,</hi> ſo as the inward Skin may be drawn forward as well as the outward; then by applying an Inſtrument joynted like a Carpenters Rule, or a Sector, the Skin is held faſt beyond the <hi>Glans,</hi> and with a broad Inciſion-knife, or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion-knife, the Foreskin is cut off cloſe to the Inſtrument; and what remains of Skin is immediately put back, the blood ſtopped with Powders, and a Plaiſter applyed; the Relations and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſinging all the while, whereby the cries of the Infant are leſs heard.</p>

Leaving <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I paſſed by a peculiar Burial-place of the Jews, who are not permitted to interr their dead within the Walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>Overs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerk, Bamburg,</hi> and in ſix or ſeven hours arrived at <hi>

It is now an Univerſity, founded by the States in the Year 1639. I ſhall not trouble you with the Names of the Profeſſors; the Learned Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> whom I had the honour to meet in divers places abroad, having already cauſed to be printed the <hi>Series Lectionum</hi> of this and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Univerſities in the <hi>Low-Countries, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations Topographical, Moral, Phyſiological,</hi> ſet forth 1673. The great Church hath a very high Tower, or three Steeples one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: From the higheſt of which I had not only a good ſight of the Town it ſelf, which lay under mine Eye like a Platform, but of many others alſo; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tretcht</hi> being in a plain ſlat Country, and ſo well ſeated, and encompaſſed with ſo populous a Country, that in a days Journey a man may go from hence to any one of fifty walled Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church here is an ancient Building; the Pillar in the middle of it, whoſe Foundation could not be laid but upon Bulls<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hides, is much taken notice of: It was built 1099. and hath the Picture of a Bull upon it with this Inſcription;
<q>

               </p>
               <p>There is an old Library belonging to this Church, which contains divers old Books and Manuſcripts. A large Bille in ſix Volumes, painted and gilded after a very ancient manner: Two Idols, taken (in time of War) long ſince in <hi>Germany,</hi> and given to this place by the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, are worth the ſeeing, not ſo much for their neatneſs, as their Antiquity and odd ſhape: As alſo a Horn made out of a Tooth, ſaid to be given at the ſame time. There are alſo three <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns</hi> Horns, little differing in length; the longeſt being five foot and an half: I drank out of one of them, the end being tipp'd with Silver, and made hollow to ſerve for a Cup. Theſe were of the <hi>Sea-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn,</hi> or the Horn or long wreathed Tooth of ſome Sea-Animal much like it, taken in the Northern Sea; of which I have ſeen many, both in Publick Repoſitories, and in Private Hands. Two ſuch as theſe, the one Ten foot long, were preſented not many years ſince to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> being taken near to <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> and I have ſeen ſome full fifteen foot long; ſome wreathed very thick, ſome not ſo much, and others almoſt plain: Some largeſt and thickeſt at the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:66078:61"/>
End near the head; others are largeſt at ſome diſtance from the Head: Some very ſharp at the end or point, and others blunt. My honoured Father Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> had a very fair piece of one which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly among the Duke of <hi>Curland</hi>'s Rarities, but after that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner by <hi>Douglas</hi> in the Wars between <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> it came into the hands of my Unckle Colonel <hi>Hatcher,</hi> of whom my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had it, he had alſo a piece of this ſort of <hi>

I have ſeen a walking Staff, a Scepter, a Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard for a Sword, Boxes, and other Curioſities made out of this Horn, but was never ſo fortunate as from experience to confirm its Medical Efficacy againſt I oiſons, contagious Diſeaſes, or any other evident ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, although I have known it given ſeveral times, and in great quantity, Mr. <hi>Charlton</hi> hath a good <hi>

               <p>The Town-houſe is fair, the Houſe built for the Eaſt-country Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants is very ſtately and large, but runs now to ruine, in this I ſaw, among other curioſities, divers ſtrange Muſical inſtruments, which at preſent are not underſtood, or at leaſt not made uſe of: The <hi>Heſſen</hi> houſe hath been alſo formerly conſiderable. The water which they make uſe of in Brewing, is brought by an Aqueduct from <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> about thirty miles diſtant from hence; and is conveyed into the Town by a large Channel, peculiarly walled in by it ſelf where it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Ditch; in this City are many good collections of Pictures both Ancient and Modern, and excellent Miniature or Liming by <hi>Gonſol;</hi> one fine piece, which I ſaw was peculiarly remarkable, it being the work of 35 ſeveral Maſters.</p>

in Braſs, Count <hi>Marſin</hi>'s houſe formerly belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> hath a fair Court, and overlooks a good part of the City, but a quarter of it is ruined by Lightning. The Thunderbolt or Stone which they affirm to have effected it, is bigger than two Mens heads, and hangs up upon the door at the entrance. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Church is handſom, and in it the fair white Tower is beautifully gilded at the top. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> Church hath a noble Altar, and near unto the Church is the <hi>Statua</hi> of a piſſing boy, which is a continual Conduit. The Armory was well furniſhed as we were informed, before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the low Countries ſold the Arms; and <hi>Caſſel Roderigo,</hi> the Governor, left it very bare. There remains the Armour of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, of Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Parma, Ernestus,</hi> and of the Duke <hi>d'Alva,</hi> and of the Duke <hi>Alberts</hi> horſe, who being ſhot ſaved his Maſter, and died the ſame day twelve month; Spears for the hunting the wild Boar, one with two Piſtols; The Armour of Cardinal <hi>Infante,</hi> and of an <hi>Indian</hi> King; A <hi>Poliſh</hi> musket which carries ſix hundred paces; <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Sword for the making the Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Sword ſent to declare war; Good Bucklers for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſome well wrought; eſpecially one with the Battel of <hi>Phrrhus</hi> and his Elephants; and banners taken with <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Pavia.</hi>

               <p>Somewhat like <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillons</hi> ſhooting the three Pigeons near the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> is the ſhot which <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> made, when with an Arrow ſhe killed a Bird, in memory whereof, a Bird pierced with an Arrow is ſet upon the top of a Tower in the Court, which is large; and if the New Buildings and Deſign were continued, it would be very handſome Before the Court ſtands five braſs Statues. The Park is pleaſant, with Trees ſet in order, and adorned with Grotto's, Fountains, and Water-works, which come very near the <hi>Italian;</hi> one piece ſomewhat imitating <hi>Fraſcati,</hi> in which all Muſical Inſtruments are imitated, and a perpetual motion attempted: and on the Front of the Buildings ſtand the <hi>Caeſars</hi> heads. But the Echo is moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which may perfectly be diſtinguiſhed to ten or twelve Replies. The greateſt Church is that of St. <hi>Gudula;</hi> in which is her Statua, the Devil ſtriving to blow out the Light of her Lanthorn. The two Chappels therein are remarkable; the one built by <hi>Leopoldus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> very fair on the out-ſide: the other towards the North, hath been viſited by five Kings; in which is the Hoſt which bled being ſtabbed by the Jews. In the <hi>Dominican</hi> Church is the Monument of the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> and his Dutcheſs, in <hi>Corinthian</hi> braſs. But for a New Church that of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennes,</hi> or Pious Maids, is very conſiderable; there being Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them in this City, who have a particular place allotted to them, where they have built this milk-white Church. The Plague was much in this place at that time, three hundred Houſes being ſhut, up and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands placed on the doors, in the middle of which was written IH<hi rend="sup">†</hi>S.

Towards the South-eaſt lies a Hill, which ariſes gently, and overlooks part of the Town. Under this Hill is one of the nobleſt Quarries of Stone in the World. To ſecure the Town from the diſadvantage it might receive from this Hill, there was formerly a Fort built upon it, but it hath been long ſince ſlighted; and they have made out an Horn-work within Musket-ſhot of it, and the Baſtion anſwering to it is made very high, to cover the Town. On the other ſide of the River ſtands <hi>Wicke,</hi> very well fortified alſo, and rather ſtronger than <hi>Maeſtreicht,</hi> into which they might retire if the Town ſhould be taken by Storm, it being united to <hi>Maeſtreicht</hi> by a handſom Bridge over the <hi>Maes,</hi> conſiſting of Nine Arches.

               <p>The private Houſes of <hi>Maestreicht</hi> are generally covered with a black Slat, or Ardoiſe, otherwiſe not very beautiful.

Many of the Streets are broad, and paved with broad ſtones.</p>
               <p>It received the Chriſtian Faith very early, and <hi>Maternus</hi> was their Biſhop above 1350 years ſince, who ſubſcribed, amongſt others, to the Council of <hi>Arles.</hi> They have a great number of Churches, and well endowed, which take up a great part of the Town; the Prebends and Canons Houſes having in many places Vincyards, and large Gardens adjoyning.

In a Church dedicated to all the Apoſtles, they ſhew us a Tomb, which being opened by Thieves, intending to plunder it, the Woman buried in it aroſe up and went home, and lived with her Husband divers years after. In one of the Streets is a Tower, or rather one Tower upon another, which ſeems to be ancient, now made a Priſon.

It was not long ſince very well fortified by the order of the preſent Archbiſhop, and the direction of Colonel <hi>Biſer,</hi> a blind man, having <hi>Cataracts</hi> in both his eyes. The Archbiſhops Palace is very Noble, and there is a Chamber ſeated a good way into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to which they paſs thorow a Gallery.

It is a place of good Trade, and well ſeated for it, as having the advantage of the River <hi>Main,</hi> which paſſes by <hi>Bamberg, Schweinfurt, Wurtzburg, Guemund,</hi> or <hi>Gaudia mundi;</hi> and alſo the <hi>Tauber,</hi> and other Rivers running into it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords conveniency for Commerce with the remoter parts of <hi>Franconia;</hi> and the <hi>Main</hi> running into the <hi>Rhine,</hi> makes a large communication both up and down that Stream.</p>

Here are alſo a great number of good Horſes bought and ſold: and on the North-ſide of the City there is a ſpacious place for a Horſe-Fair. The City is ſtrong and well fortified; and moſt part of the Town are <hi>Lutherans.</hi> In the <hi>German</hi> Wars, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having taken <hi>Hanaw,</hi> ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Franckfort</hi> to know whether the City would peaceably and ſpeedily ſet open their Gates unto him, and accept fairly of a Garriſon, or ſtand to the hazard of a Siege: And although they were unwilling to yield, yet for fear of the worſt, they conſented, That the King ſhould have free paſſage for his Army through the City; and that for the better aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it, ſix hundred of his men ſhould be received for a Garriſon into <hi>Saxonhauſen;</hi> and alſo that the Magiſtrates and People ſhould take

               <p>Upon the Town-houſe is a Clock with divers Motions, and when the Clock ſtrikes, the figure of an Old man pulls off his hat, a Cock crows, and ſhakes his wings, Souldiers fight with one another, and the like. The Prince's Stables for above a hundred Horſes are ſeated upon the River very conveniently, but were fairer formerly, above half thereof having been ruined by the Imperaliſts; as alſo divers of the Statues on the out-ſide of the Caſtle, which is ſeated high above the Town.</p>
               <p>The preſent Elector is <hi>Carolus Ludovicus,</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Frederick</hi> the Fifth; he was born in the year 1617. and paſſed his Youth an Exile from his Fathers Kingdom and Electorate: and at the pacification, at <hi>Prague</hi> 1635. he was excluded from any reſtitution to be made to him. But at length in the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> 1648. he was reſtored to the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and 1657 returned to the poſſeſſion of his Fortunes: a highly accompliſhed Prince, much honoured and beloved by his Subjects. In the year 1650. he married <hi>Charlotta,</hi> Daughter to <hi>William</hi> the Fifth <hi>Landgrave,</hi> and to the famous <hi>Amelia Elizabeth, Landgraveſs</hi> of <hi>Haſſia;</hi> by whom he had the <hi>Char</hi> Prince, or Electoral Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and a Daughter, the Princeſs <hi>Charlotta Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabetha;</hi> but upon ſome diſcontent the Princeſs Electreſs ſince returned to her own Friends and Country. This Elector is alſo Knight of the moſt Noble Order of the Garter, Great Treaſurer of the Empire, and together with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Vicar of the Empire.</p>
               <p>In his Palace or Caſtle at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> are divers things remarkable; a very great Tower to be equalled by very few; within which is a Theatre for Comedies. This was formerly called <hi>Trutzkaiſar,</hi> or the Tower that bad Defiance, or threatned the Emperor; but ſince the Reſtauration of the Elector, there are ſome Works drawn about it in the figure of a Star, and the olddiſobliging Name is by Proclamation forbidden to be continued, and it is at preſent called <hi>Sternſchanz,</hi> or the <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> By it is a handſom Garden; in the Ditch whereof there was then kept a great Bear, and a very large Wolf. The Grotto's and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter works are very handſom: they were alſo making divers others, having the advantage of the ſide of the Hill to bring down the Water, and to make Grots and Caves in the Rock. Amongſt other Fountains, that of the Lions head with a Frog in his Ear, is taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. The Cellars are very large and cool, filled with Veſſels of no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66078:71"/>
ordinary ſize; yet inconſiderable, if compared to the great Tun kept in a great Building joyning to the Cellars; it was built by this preſent Elector's Orders, 1664. and goes far beyond any made before: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 204 Faiders and odd meaſure, or about two hundred Tuns: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Hoops it is built with large knee Timber, like the ribs of a Ship, which are painted and carved, and have divers Inſcriptions upon them, and ſupported by carved Pedeſtals. Upon one ſide of it is a handſom Stair caſe to aſcend to the top of the Veſſel; upon the top of which is a Gallery ſet round with Balliſters, three and forty ſteps high from the ground.</p>
               <p>About an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile from <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> between the Hills, is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place, where three large Streams or Springs guſh out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and preſently fill five Ponds, have three handſom Caſcates or Falls, and after run into the Plain, and are ſtrong enough in a ſmall ſpace to turn four Mills; this is called <hi>Wolfsbrun,</hi> or the <hi>Wolfs Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> from a Princeſs who formerly retired into a Cave in this deſert place, and was here devoured by a <hi>Wolf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I was at <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> men came kindly to me, Mr. <hi>Villers,</hi> and <hi>Timothy Middleton,</hi> belonging to <hi>Lobensfeldt Cloiſter,</hi> a Convent formerly of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> but ſince let out to about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who left their Country 1661. came up the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by the permiſſion of the Elector, ſettled themſelves a few Miles from hence, living all together, Men, Women, and Children, in one houſe; and having a Community of many things: They are of a peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, calling themſelves Chriſtian Jews; and one Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living at <hi>Norwich,</hi> is their Head. They cut not their Beards, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many other Ceremonies and Duties, which they either think themſelves obliged to from ſome Expreſſions in the old Teſtament, or from ſome New Expoſition of their Leaders.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Heidelburg</hi> I made an excurſion, and had a ſight of <hi>Spire,</hi> ſeated in a Plain, on the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> a place of Antiquity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Nemetum</hi> of old; a large place and populous. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> Wars demoliſhed the Works about it, not willing to ſpare ſo great a number of his Souldiers as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Garriſon it, and make it good. It is an Epiſcopal See under the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mentz:</hi> there are many fair Houſes in it, divers Churches, and a fair Cathedral, with four large Towers. The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> preach in it at ſeveral hours. It is the more populous, and filled with people of good quality, by reaſon of the concourſe of perſons from other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> for the deciſion of Law Suits: For here the Imperial Chamber is held, and many differences which ariſe in the Empire are determined, and the Electors and other Princes, in ſome Tryals at Law, may be called hither. It is a ſettled Court, which <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt, for the better eaſe of all perſons, placed firſt at <hi>Worms,</hi> and not long after it was fixed at <hi>Spire,</hi> from whence it cannot be now remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but by the conſent of all the Eſtates. Things Cognoſcible in this Court are determined by an Imperial Judge, and ſealed with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Arms, ſo that there lies no appeal unto the Emperor.</p>
               <p>Another day I went to <hi>Manheim,</hi> formerly a Village, ſeated at the Confluence of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Neccar;</hi> but walled about by the Elector <hi>Frederick</hi> the Fourth, and ſince is much encreaſed; all the Streets
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66078:71"/>
being large and uniform, and a Noble Cittadel built; within which, over againſt the Gate, the Elector deſigns a Palace, the Model of which I ſaw: and at preſent, on the right hand, there are three Pavilions of Lodgings: in one of which lodges the Elector <hi>Palatine;</hi> in another the Prince his Son; and in the third the Princeſs his Daughter: behind theſe there is a handſome Garden and Lodgings for <hi>Degen Felderen,</hi> the <hi>Churfurſts</hi> Miſtreſs. Here are ſome good Pictures, as a Head of <hi>Hans Holben,</hi> and a Landskip with the Story of the Union of the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> The Bridge over the Moat of the Cittadel into the Town, is alſo remarkable, as having ſix Draw-bridges upon it, three great ones, and three ſmall ones on the ſide. There are Paliſado's all along the bottom, in the middle of the Ditch, and without upon the <hi>Eſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Heidelberg</hi> I travelled to <hi>Nurnberg</hi> in the Company of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Wagenſeyl,</hi> who had been in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wars, and was employed a little before in blowing up the Caſtle of <hi>Launſteyn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> to prevent its ſurpriſal by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> He was then employed to raiſe a Company at <hi>Nurnberg,</hi> for the Service of the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi> I had a good advantage in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by his Company; for he travelled with Authority, and was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, knowing, and courteous perſon.</p>
               <p>The firſt day we travelled near to the <hi>Neccar,</hi> in ſtony and rocky way; and it being dark before we came to <hi>Moſpach,</hi> the Peaſants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us from Village to Village with bundles of lighted Straw.</p>
               <p>The next day we came to <hi>Poxberg,</hi> where there is an old Caſtle, and in the afternoon reached <hi>Morkenthal,</hi> or <hi>Mergetheim,</hi> the Seat of the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Herrhn Deutchern,</hi> or the <hi>Teutonick Order.</hi> The Town is well built, hath a fair <hi>Piazza,</hi> with a large Fountain in it, and a Statue of one of the Grand Maſters, with a long <hi>Corridore</hi> from his Palace. This Order hath been of great Fame, and hath had large Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, as may be ſeen in the exact Account of the <hi>Teutonick Knights</hi> of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> made out from the beſt Authors, by my worthy honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Aſhmole,</hi> in his Noble Deſcription of the Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as <hi>Lewis du May,</hi> Counſellor unto the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> hath ſet it down. <hi>For the Knights Templers and of St.</hi> John, <hi>having fought proſperouſly againſt the Infidels, raiſed an Emulation in ſome</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Gentlemen, who waited upon the Emperor</hi> Frederick <hi>the Firſt, in his Expedition to the</hi> Holy Land, <hi>to take the</hi> Croiſado. <hi>And becauſe they were inſtalled in the Church and Hoſpital of St.</hi> Mary <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>they were called,</hi> Marianites. <hi>Their Order differed nothing from thoſe above-mentioned, but in the form and colour of their Croſs, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Pope</hi> Celeſtin <hi>the Third. Afterwards when</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was taken by</hi> Saladin, <hi>thoſe Knights betook themſelves to</hi> Ptolemais, <hi>from whence the Emperor</hi> Frederick <hi>the Second, ſent them back into</hi> Germany, <hi>and employed them againſt the</hi> Pruſſians <hi>and</hi> Livonians, <hi>who at that time were ſtill Pagans. But by the Valour and Piety of thoſe Knights, their Souls were brought into ſubjection to Chriſt, and their Bodies to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which began that War in the year</hi> 1220. <hi>a little while after theſe Knights found themſelves Maſters of a Country of very large Extent, which obeyed the Order, till the year</hi> 1525. <hi>at which time</hi> Sigiſmond, <hi>King of</hi> Poland, <hi>gave the inveſtiture of</hi> Pruſſia <hi>unto</hi> Albert <hi>Marqueſs of</hi> Brandenburg. <hi>In the year</hi> 1563. <hi>the Great Maſter became Secular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:66078:72"/>
                  <hi>and took a part of the Lands ſubject to the Order, with the name of Duke of</hi> Curland. <hi>And</hi> Livonia <hi>having been the Subject and Theatre of many Wars between the</hi> Polanders, Muſcovites, <hi>and</hi> Swedes; <hi>theſe laſt did at length become Maſters of it, and have it in poſſeſſion ſtill. So that there is no more remaining of the</hi> Teutonick Order, <hi>but ſome Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries ſcattered here and there in</hi> Germany. <hi>And the Great Maſter hath his Seat and Reſidence at</hi> Mergenthal.</p>
               <p>They wear on a white Matle a plain black Croſs. The Dignity of Grand Maſter is generally held by ſome Great and Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and in the Great Aſſembly he takes place of al Biſhops. The preſent is the Baron of <hi>Amring;</hi> and the Grand Maſter before him was <hi>Leopold William,</hi> only Brother to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>From hence we travelled to <hi>Lauterbach,</hi> near which we paſſed through a Wood, and found a Noble Church upon the top of a high Hill, which being much frequented by Pilgrims, they have made hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtone Stairs from the bottom to the top: then to <hi>Rotenburg,</hi> and lodged at <hi>Burgperner,</hi> and the next day by <hi>Schantzbach</hi> we came to <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg. Rotenburg</hi> is an Imperial City, which ſome have likened unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for its Situation upon hilly places and many Turrets in it. It is Situated near the head of the River <hi>Tauber,</hi> which may be accounted the ſecond River of <hi>Franconia,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Rottingen, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nurenberg.</note> and <hi>Werthaim,</hi> where it runs into the <hi>Main.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nurenberg</hi> is the faireſt City that I ſaw in <hi>Germany;</hi> the Houſes moſt of them of Free-ſtone, very high; and divers of them painted on the outſide, and adorned with gilded Balls on the top; many are of ſix or ſeven Stories high. <hi>Der Herr Peller</hi> hath one of the faireſt. The City is very populous and full of Trade, although it ſtands in a barren Country, and wants a Navigable River. The three beſt Churches are the <hi>Hoſpital Church,</hi> lately built very fair; St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> which is very large, with two high Steeples in the Front; and St. <hi>Sebald</hi> the beſt of the three. The Body of St. <hi>Sebald</hi> being laid upon a Cart drawn with Oxen, in that place where the Oxen ſtood ſtill, they buried the Body, and erected this Church in his Memory. In this Church is a Cruciſix of Wood, very well carved, and eſteemed at a high rate. The Cruciſix without the Church is very great, and of a black colour: and ſome fancy that the <hi>Raht Herrn,</hi> or Magiſtrates of the Town, have repoſited a Treaſure within it. The Pulpit is well carved and gilded, and the whole Church ſo ſtately, that it may paſs in the firſt rank of <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches; that Religion being here practiſed in its ſplendour. The Prieſt every morning reads the Scripture to the people for half an hour, or preaches a Sermon. The Town-houſe is well worth the ſeeing: In it the Hall is ſpacious, as alſo the Chambers, and furniſhed with good Pictures, and Stoves well gilded and painted with white and gold, green and gold, dark coloured and gold, and the like. There is one Picture of moſt of the Great Perſons in <hi>Germany</hi> entertained in the Great Hall; another of the three Brothers of <hi>Saxony;</hi> one of an Elephant as big as the life; a piece of St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and another of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both by <hi>Albert Durer:</hi> but the moſt rare piece is that of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> by the ſame Maſter, with this Inſcription.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>

Another excellent one is that of St. <hi>Luke</hi> drawing the Picture of our Saviour and the bleſſed Virgin: Over the Gate at the entrance of the Shambles is a large Oxe carved in Wood, and painted over, with this Inſcription:
<q>
                     <l>Omnia habent ortus ſuaque incrementa, ſed ecce</l>

                  </q>
The Caſtle ſtand upon a high Hill, from whence the Town makes a handſome ſhow: In it are obſervable a very deep well, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Chappel, his Picture, and the Pictures of the Electors; good Night pieces; and one of a man behind a white Curtain tranſparent, very well expreſſed. The Armour of <hi>Hebbele van Gailinghen</hi> the great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer is here ſhown; and in the Wall of the Caſtle the marks of his Horſes feet, when he leaped from thence over the <hi>Town ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The new Fountain was not then finiſhed; but the Statua's in Braſs made for it were excellent; the Sea Horſes large, the Sea-Nymphs much bigger than the life; and <hi>N ptune,</hi> who was to ſtand on the top, is above three yards and a halfhigh. When I came firſt into this place, I was not a little ſurprized to behold the fairneſs of the Houſes, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Streets, different Habits, induſtrious People, and neatneſs in all things, more than I had obſerved in <hi>German</hi> Cities before; and no place hath greater number of curious Artificers in Steel, Braſs, Ivory, Wood, wherein they work at an extraordinary cheap rate; and there are Officers to inſpect and enquire into the works of Artificers, that they be true, perfect and without fraud: they make ſtrong and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Clock-work. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> preſented the Grand Seignior with a very noble Clock, who took ſo much delight in it, that when it required ſome mending (the <hi>Turks</hi> being ignorant in Clock-work) he ſent it from <hi>Adrianople</hi> as far as <hi>Nurenburg</hi> to be ſet in order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was more magnificently received and entertained in this City, than in any other of <hi>Germany;</hi> which ſo incenſed <hi>Wallenſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It was much augmented and adorned by the Emperour <hi>Arnulphus,</hi> who had a great affection for this place, ſo pleaſantly ſeated, and in a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Here the River <hi>Regen</hi> runs into the <hi>Danube;</hi> from whence it was called <hi>Regenſburg.</hi> There are two Bridges, one of wood below the Town, and another Bridge of ſtone of about fifteen Arches; which is the faireſt ſtone Bridge over the <hi>Danube.</hi> It is an Imperial City, but not without ſome acknowledgement to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſtrongly fortified, yet it was taken by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> wars. There are many fair buildings in it, both private and publick; and though I am not able to confirm what ſome report, that there as aremany Churches and Chappels in this City, as there are days in the year; yet are there many fair Churches and Convents: As the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on the South-ſide of which is the Picture of St. <hi>Peter</hi>

               <p>But that which chiefly promotes its luſtre, is the General Diet or Parliament, which is often held in this City, and is not to be called in any part out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and the place is not unfit for the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſuch a noble Convention, as are the Eſtates of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Vice-Marſhal takes care to provide Lodgings reſpectively to their perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſees that all things be brought hither, and at a juſt price; that the Hall or Place of Aſſembly be furniſhed and adorned ſuitably to the dignity of the Perſons convened, and hath an eſpecial eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard towards the Publick ſafety. By this Convention the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of <hi>Germany</hi> are much ſecured, and their peace and quiet Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherein <hi>Germany</hi> ſeems to have a better advantage than <hi>Italy;</hi> For <hi>Italy</hi> being likewiſe divided into many Dominions and Principalities hath no Common Diet or Great Council, whereby to proceed for their Publick ſafety: Which makes them often ſo divided in their common Concerns in times of Danger, and when they moſt need a joynt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination.</p>
               <p>I entred the notable River <hi>Danubius</hi> at this place, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready run a good courſe, and paſſed by many fair Towns or Cities; as the large City of <hi>

               <p>The firſt day we paſſed by <hi>Thonawſteyn,</hi> where there is a Caſtle ſeated upon a high Rock, and came to <hi>Pfeter</hi> or <hi>Vetera Caſtra</hi> of old, now but an ordinary place.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday, November</hi> the fifteenth, we came by <hi>Wilſhoven</hi> to <hi>Paſſaw, Patavia,</hi> or <hi>Boiodurum,</hi> a long and noble City in the lower <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or <hi>Bayern,</hi> made up of three Towns, <hi>Iltzſtadt Paſſaw,</hi> and <hi>Innſtadt,</hi> at the concurrence of the River <hi>Inn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the <hi>jltz.</hi> As Towns are commonly of great Antiquity which are built at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of great Rivers, for the Strength of the Situation and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Commerce; ſo is this accounted ancient, as being a <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the place of the <hi>Caſtra Batava</hi> in old time.</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> is ſtately, beſides other fair Churches. The Biſhop, who is Lord of the City, hath a ſtrong Palace upon a Hill; his Revenues are large, and beſides what he poſſeſſes hereabouts, he hath the tenth part of the notable great Lead-Mine at <hi>Bleyberg</hi> in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia.</hi> This place had lately ſuffered much by fire; but a good part was rebuilt, and very fairly after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner: So that this may well be reckoned as one of the ten conſiderable Cities, which are upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> accounting from <hi>

Near to a Wall over againſt the great Church at <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> which was then repairing, I ſaw a vaſt Head cut in ſtone, the Mouth whereof was two ſpans wide, and the reſt proportionable. The River <hi>Iltz,</hi> which runs in here from the North, is conſiderable for the Pearls which are found in it; and the noble River <hi>Inne</hi> or <hi>Oenus,</hi> from the South, is the greateſt River which hath yet entred the <hi>Danube;</hi> having paſſed by <hi>Inſbrug,</hi> and taken in the River <hi>Saltz,</hi> upon which ſtands <hi>Saltzburg;</hi> and ariſing in the <hi>Alpes</hi> in ſuch a high Country as <hi>Tirolis,</hi> it runs in here with a great force, and adds much unto the ſwiftneſs of the <hi>Danube.</hi>

                  <hi>Austria,</hi> not very great, but as neat and handſome a City as moſt in <hi>Germany.</hi> There is in it a very great Market-place, with never a bad Houſe in it, the whole Town built of a very white Free-ſtone; and the Caſtle upon the Hill is of Mordern Building, and very large. There is alſo a Bridge over the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Imperial Forces rendezvouſed here when <hi>Solyman</hi> came to <hi>Vienna.</hi> This was alſo beſieged by the Peaſants of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second; they having got a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together of Forty thouſand men, and many pieces of Ordnance, but were ſtoutly repulſed after many Aſſaults, and at laſt overcome by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim.</hi> Not far below <hi>Lintz</hi> the River <hi>Draun</hi> enters the <hi>Danube;</hi> this comes from the <hi>Gemundner Sea,</hi> or <hi>Lacus Felicis,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Lampack, Weltz,</hi> and other Towns, and hath a noted Cataract or Fall of Waters.</p>

               <p>The next day we paſſed by <hi>Ens, Aniſia,</hi> upon the River <hi>Aniſius,</hi> or <hi>Onaſus,</hi> which taking its original in the Borders of <hi>Saltzburgland</hi> runs into the <hi>Danube,</hi> and divides the higher from the lower <hi>Auſtria,</hi> having received into it ſelf the River <hi>Saltza,</hi> upon which ſtands <hi>Cell,</hi> or <hi>Maria Cell,</hi> a place of the greateſt Pilgrimage in <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Near this Town are many <hi>Roman</hi> Coyns and Antiquities found, and <hi>Lauriacum</hi> ſtood of old, a <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſon, and afterwards a Biſhip's See: we came to a Village on the North ſhoar of the <hi>Danube,</hi> called <hi>Greim,</hi> where the <hi>Graff von Leichtensteyn</hi> hath a Houſe. A little below this are two dangerous paſſages in the River; the one called the <hi>Strudel,</hi> where the River running amongſt vaſt Rocks, ſome under water, and ſome above, the waves are broken with great force, and the Current is rapid, foaming, and troubleſome; and ſome skill is required to paſs between the Ledges of Rocks which are under water, and when the water is

low the paſſage is very difficult. The other is the <hi>Wurbel,</hi> or a kind of Whirlpool, where the water turns about with great force, being hindred in its direct Courſe by a great Rock. Upon the top of a high craggy Rock ſtands a large Croſs, and at the foot a little Church dedicated to St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who is Patron of this dangerous place, and is believed to take peculiar care of ſuch as paſs this way, and therefore a little Boat comes to you as ſoon as you are out of danger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieves what Acknowledgment you pleaſe, or what perhaps you may have promiſed to give, when you were in ſome fear.

               <p>It is not ſeated upon the main ſtream of the <hi>Danube,</hi> but by a branch thereof; for the River running through a low Country; it is divided into ſeveral Streams, and makes many Iſlands. A ſmall River named <hi>Wien</hi> runs by the Eaſt part of this City, and enters the <hi>Danube,</hi> below it, which upon floods doth often much hurt, yet ſometimes low and very ſhallow, ſo as I have ſtepped over it; ſome will have it to give the Name unto this City: it divides part of the Suburbs from it, and hath divers Bridges over it. For that we may have a diſtinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of <hi>Vienna,</hi> we muſt conſider the City and Suburbs thereof; the Suburbs are very great, and not without fair Houſes, Gardens, Walks, and all Accommodations at large.</p>
               <p>The City it ſelf is that walled and fortified part, deſigned not only for convenience of Habitation, but alſo to ſuſtain a Siege, or any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack from the <hi>Turk,</hi> and is now ſeparated from the Suburbs by a fair <hi>Eſplanade,</hi> or open Ground, above a Musket ſhot over.

Theſe two latter are called the Works of Gonzaga. The Baſtions are large; upon one of them I ſaw Count <hi>Souches</hi> muſter a good part of the Militia of the City. The Ditch is large and very deep, into which although they can let in the River, yet it is commonly kept dry, leſt they might incommode their deep Cellars. There are two walls, the one old and inward, little conſiderable at preſent, built at firſt with the ranſom of our King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, who in his return from the Holy War, was detained Priſoner by the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> upon the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1192.

The other outward of a great breadth, made of Earth, and faced with Brick, edged with Free-ſtone, ſo well built, as to render this City one of the moſt conſiderable fortified places in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Eſplanade</hi> gently deſcends from the Town for three hundred Paces; there are very few Outworks.</p>
               <p>It is very uncertain who was the firſt Builder of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and after it had been long built it ran to decay again for Four hundred years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in the year 1158. did much repair it; and the ranſom afterwards of King <hi>Richard</hi> beautified it.</p>

There is alſo a Bridge within the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> called the <hi>Hochbrug,</hi> or <hi>High-bridge,</hi> which is made by the croſſing of two Streets at equal Angles; the ground of one ſtreet being as high as the tops of the Houſes of the other, ſo th t to continue it, they were forced to build a Bridge or Arch in the <hi>Lower ſtreet,</hi> to let the upper to paſs over it.</p>
               <p>The City is fairly built of ſtone, and well paved; many Houſes are of ſix ſtories high; they are ſomewhat flat roofed after the <hi>Italian</hi> way; the Streets are not narrow, but the compaſs of ground will not admit them to be very broad; and their Buildings are remarkable both above and below ground; their Cellars are very deep. To ſatisfie my curioſity, I went into ſome of them, and found four Cellars one under another; they were arched, and had two pair of Stairs to deſcend into them. Some have an open ſpace in the middle of each roof, to let the Air out of one Cellar into another, and from the loweſt an <hi>adit</hi> or <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be</hi> unto the top, to let the Air in and out from the ſtreet, ſomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the Mines.</p>

                  <hi>Aenaeas Sylvius,</hi> about two hundred years ſince, commending the City of <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> among other expreſſions lets fall this: <hi>Cuperent Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum Reges</hi> tam <hi>egregiè quam mediocres Cives</hi> Norinbergenſes <hi>habitare.</hi> The Kings of the <hi>Scots</hi> would be content to dwell ſo well as the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſorts of Citizens of <hi>Nurnburg.</hi> I muſt confeſs, when I firſt entred <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> I was much ſurprized to ſee ſuch a noble, large, ſpruce, rich, and well built City: but <hi>Vienna</hi> doth alſo deſerve the commendation which he affords it: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Palatia digna Regibus, &amp; Templa quae mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> Italia <hi>poſſit.</hi> Where there are Palaces fit for Kings, and Churches which <hi>Italy</hi> may admire. And this being ſpoken ſo long ago, is now better verified of it.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Palace is very Noble, Subſtantial, and Princely furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſiſting chiefly of two Courts; the one very large, the other leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66078:77"/>
wherein the Emperor lodges. At the Entrance over the Gate, are ſet in Capitals Letters the five Vowels, <hi>A, E, I, O, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>;</hi> whereof the Phancies of men make various interpretations. That which was told me, was this, <hi>Auſtriae est imperare Orli <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſo;</hi> or, <hi>Alles Erdreich Iſt Oſterreich <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nterthan; i. e.</hi> All the World is ſubject to <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could hardly believe this was the firſt intended meaning. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe two Courts is another ſmall one, where ſome of the Pages lodge. I took notice of a large rough <hi>Jaſpis</hi> ſtone lying upon the ground, little regarded or obſerved: it is about nine foot Diameter; it was preſented unto the Emperor by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> whoſe Country aſſords notable Quarries, and ſtones of many ſorts; a little piece of it poliſhed, aſſords fine yellow, red, black, and white Veins. The Palace of the Count <hi>de Draun,</hi> and that which Count <hi>Rothal</hi> hath lately built and nobly furniſhed, are very conſiderable; with many others.</p>
               <p>There are alſo many fair Churches, rich Convents, and Conventual Churches; as that of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> of the <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines,</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas;</hi> In this Church I could not but take notice of the late Sepulchral Monuments of Count <hi>Strozzi</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach.</hi> The <hi>Dominican</hi> Convent is very fair. The <hi>Auguſtines</hi> have a large Church, in the middle whereof they have built a Chappel after the manner of the Holy Houſe at <hi>Loretto;</hi> upon the top of which hang the Colours taken from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> many of which Enſigns are not ſquare like ours, but made Eſcucheon-wiſe, ſome filled with Circles, wherein are expreſſed half Moons. The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Colleges are large, who ſeldom fail of noble Convents, eſpecially in places where they have ſo good footing as in this. The Front of one of their Colleges opens into a fair <hi>Piazza,</hi> in the middle whereof ſtands a large and high compoſite Column of Copper upon a Pedeſtal of white ſtone, with four Angels with Eſcucheons, and on the top the bleſſed Virgin; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions alſo, in which the Emperor dedicates <hi>Austria</hi> unto her Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Tuition.</p>

In another Market-place, where the Town-houſe is, there is a handſome <hi>Statua</hi> of Juſtice in Copper.</p>
               <p>I could not but obſerve the <hi>Scotch</hi> Church and Cloiſter, which gave alſo the name unto the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gate of the City, becauſe I ſomewhat wondred how the <hi>Scots</hi> in old time ſhould be ſo conſiderable in this place; but I found by Information, and the Account of <hi>Lazius</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeus Merian</hi> in <hi>High-dutch,</hi> that this Convent was in former times a great Receptacle for the <hi>Scots</hi> in their long Pilgrimage unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:66078:78"/>
founded and endowed by Duke <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, in memory of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory:</hi> and it may ſeem leſs ſtrange that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent here, and be numerous in theſe parts in former Ages, if we conſider that St. <hi>Colman,</hi> one of the Saints of the greateſt Veneration in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> and ſaid to be of the Royal Blood of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who, in his paſſage to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was murdered by the <hi>Baurs</hi> or Country people at <hi>Stockerau,</hi> four <hi>German</hi> miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and hanged on a Tree, where, as the Story goes, his Body remained uncorrupted for a year and a half, and divers Miracles being affirmed of it, it was taken down, and honourably interred near <hi>Stockerau;</hi> but by <hi>Meginhard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aichstadt</hi> it was tranſlated unto <hi>Melk,</hi> and afterwards ſent into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and his Head kept a long time at <hi>Stullweiſſenburg,</hi> or <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> according to the Account which is here given of this Saint.</p>
               <p>The Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is alſo conſiderable, not for its Splendor but Antiquity, as being accounted the oldeſt in the City, ſtanding in a place where in old time there ſtood an Altar in honour of <hi>Domitian,</hi> called <hi>Ara Flaviana.</hi> In this Church lies the Body of that famous and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon <hi>Wolfgangus Lazius,</hi> with this Epitaph or Inſcription:</p>
               <p>Magniſico Nobili Clariſſimo atque ſummâ eruditione ornatiſſimo viro Domino <hi>Wolfgango Latzio Vien.</hi> Philoſophiae atque Medicinae Doctori &amp; Profeſſori Primario, Celeberrimi Archigymnaſii <hi>Viennenſis</hi> Rectori &amp; Superintendenti <hi>Caeſareo,</hi> &amp; ejuſdem Sacrae <hi>Caeſareae</hi> Majeſt. <hi>Ferdinandi</hi> Sanctiſſimae memoriae Conſiliario &amp; Hiſtorico Peritiſſimo defuncto Anno Domini <hi>M D LXXXVI.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Church of the <hi>Capucines</hi> Convent, are interred the Emperor <hi>Matthias</hi> and his Empreſs, and the Empreſs <hi>Maria,</hi> wife to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, who out of their Devotion and Humility, choſe to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Church of this poor Order. And the <hi>Capucines</hi> not admitting of Magnificent Monuments in their Churches, as in the Churches of other Orders, no Tombs are erected worthy ſo great an Emperor, and ſuch Empreſſes.</p>
               <p>But the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> contains divers Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many Princes and Great Perſons, and is a large ſtately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſomewhat dark by reaſon of the thick painted Glaſs: not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Lead, but with Tiles of wood, which is the only blemiſh thereof, yet makes a good ſhow. The Steeple and Spire are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as being high, large, ſtrong, and handſome. On the top or Weather-cock-place of the Spire ſtands a Croſs under a Star and half Moon, according to the Figure I have elſewhere ſet down, which the People think to be of Gold, or at leaſt very well gilded: and in the time of Thunder and Lightning it looked pale and whitiſh.</p>
               <p>They have this Account how theſe came firſt to be ſet up in this place: That when <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent beſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Forces in the City to be obſtinate, he had an intent to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down the Steeple about their ears: But ſome of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and great Commanders, advertiſing him how unprofitable a buſineſs it would prove, and withal when he took the City, what an honour it would be unto him to have ſuch a Noble Pyramid in his Dominions: He ſent word into the Town, That he was willing to ſpare the Steople,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:66078:78"/>
upon condition that they would ſet up the half Moon and Star (the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms) upon the top thereof. They returned Anſwer that they would, if he would ſend the ſame unto them; which he did, and they placed it where it ſtands.</p>
               <p>This Spire hath the largeſt Crockets I have obſerved in any, they being above a yard long, and adorned with foliage work. The Spire of <hi>Landſhute</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> is accounted the higheſt in <hi>Germany;</hi> that of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> the neateſt and faireſt; and this of <hi>Vienna</hi> the largeſt and ſtrongeſt. And therefore it is no wonder, that when the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Boſna</hi> formerly came unto <hi>Vienna,</hi> they ſo often viewed and admired this Fabrick, and plainly ſaid, That all the mony in their Country was not ſufficient to have built it.</p>
               <p>This Steeple is accounted about four hundred ſixty and five foot high, being about half way up three hundred and thirty eight ſteps. Beſides other Hills, I could ſee <hi>Haimburger</hi> Hill within two miles of <hi>Presburg,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which the long Courſe of the <hi>Danube</hi> rendred very pleaſant and delightful into the eye. In the Chamber or Room from whence I had this proſpect, there is a Clock, whoſe Caſe being of wood, was in part burnt down by Lightning, and therefore there is water always kept in this place to extinguiſh the fire, and a man continually watches in the place where the Bells hang. There is alſo an Inſtrument of wood, or wooden Bells or Hammers, which they make uſe of from <hi>Good-Friday</hi> till <hi>Eaſter-ſunday,</hi> all the time that our Saviour was in the Grave, during which time they permit no Bells to ring.</p>

               <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Vienna</hi> is alſo remarkable, if we conſider the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity thereof, the number of Scholars their courſe of Studies, their accommodations, privileges and advancements. This is ſaid to have been begun by <hi>Albertus</hi> the Third, above three hundred years paſt; and their Rules, Orders, and Statutes to have been borrowed from the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Students were diſtinguiſhed into four Diviſions or Nations; who, beſides the General, have their particular Rules and Officers, and were comprehended under the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians,</hi> Nations of the <hi>Rhine, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Diviſion were contained the <hi>Friulians,</hi> all of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe of <hi>Trent,</hi> all <hi>Italy,</hi> with the other Provinces beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> were comprehended <hi>Suevians, Alſatians, Franconians, Haſſians;</hi> alſo all the Provinces to the South-weſt, as <hi>France, Spain, Navarre, Holland, Brabant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or <hi>Natio Hungarioe,</hi> were contained <hi>Hungarians, Bohemians, Polonians, Moravians, Sclavonians,</hi> all that ſpeak the <hi>Sclavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Tongue, and alſo <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Natio Saxonum,</hi> were reduced <hi>Saxons, Weſtphalians, Friſlanders, Turingians, Miſnians, Brandenburgers, Pruſſians, Livonians, Luſatians, Pomeranians,</hi> with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramarine</hi> Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Diviſions take up all the Nations of <hi>Europe;</hi> and indeed there are Students here of many Nations: and upon Contentions and Differences the ſeveral <hi>Claſſes</hi> will hold unto their own, and take parts, and bandy againſt each other, but will all unite and hold together in differences with Towns-men or Jews, which happen ſometimes unto an high degree.</p>
               <p>They follow here the old beaten way of Knowledge: and I met with few who had any good inſight in new <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but there are many good <hi>Philologers,</hi> and are well verſed in Languages, Hiſtory and Antiquity: and there are many Learned Men either educated here, or come from other parts. Some who had taken notice of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> were very inquiſitive after it; and when I had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied them in all particulars, were very much pleaſed therewith. If they ſhould fall into the way of <hi>Experimental Philoſophy,</hi> being very induſtrious, 'tis very probable they may do much therein, and they were ſure to have the countenance of the Emperor. I found them alſo much affected with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Society in other parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> At the Univerſity of <hi>Altorff</hi> I was much enquired of concerning it: and a Magiſtrate of <hi>Nurnburg,</hi> who had got a <hi>Tileſcope</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to his Houſe, to practice the way of uſing it. <hi>Der Herr von</hi>

He ſhewed alſo great reſpect and obſervance unto the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66078:80"/>
Empreſs Dowager <hi>Elconora,</hi> who was a ſober and prudent Princeſs, well skilled in all kind of curious Works, and delighted ſometimes to ſhoot at Deer from a Stand, or at other Game, out of her Coach. He was alſo very loving unto his Siſters, beautiful and good Princeſſes; whereof one, the eldeſt, was ſince married unto that Noble Prince <hi>Michael Wiſnowitzski,</hi> King of <hi>Poland.</hi> And afterwards to <hi>Charles Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſpeaks four Languages, <hi>German, Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> He is a great Countenancer of Learned Men, and delights to read, and when occaſion permits, will paſs ſome hours at it. The worthy <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Lambecius,</hi> his Library Keeper, and who is in great eſteem with him, will uſually find out ſome Books for him which he conceives may be acceptable. While I was there he recommended a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Religio Medici</hi> unto him, wherewith the Emperor was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pleaſed, and ſpake very much of it unto <hi>Lambecius,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Lambecius</hi> asked me whether I knew the Author, he being of my own name, and whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he were living: And when he underſtood my near Relation to him, he became more kind and courteous than ever, and deſired me to ſend him that Book in the Original <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which he would put into the Emperors Library: and preſented me with a neat little <hi>Latin</hi> Book, called <hi>Princeps in Compendio,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Emperors Father, <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>He is alſo skilful in Muſick, compoſes well, and delighted much in it, both at his Palace and the Church, which makes ſo many Muſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Vienna;</hi> for no place abounds more with them; and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we ſeldom ſailed of Muſick in the Streets, and at our Windows: And the Emperors delight herein makes the Church-men take the greater care to ſet off their Church-Muſick, for he goes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Church, and not to one, but divers, eſpecially the beſt Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Churches: and in his own Chappel ſome of his own Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are often play'd. He hath alſo excellent Muſick in his Palace, both Vocal and Inſtrumental; and his private Chappel is well ſerved, where beſides the excellent Muſick, there are always eight or ten Counts, Pages to the Emperor, who ſerve at the Altar with white wax Torches in their hands; and after the manner of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, divers <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to ſing.</p>
               <p>For his Recreations abroad, he delights much in Hunting, eſpecially of the wild Boar in due ſeaſons; I have known him bring home ſix Boars in a morning. Some ſtout perſons, particularly count <hi>Nicholas Serini,</hi> would encounter a wild Boar alone, but at laſt he unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately periſhed by one, which hath made others more wary ſince; and therefore when the Boar is at a Bay, the Huntſmen ſo ſtand about him, that the Emperor, or other great perſons, may more ſafely make uſe of their Boar-ſpears upon him.</p>
               <p>Surely there are great numbers of them about the Country, for they are no unuſual or extraordinary Diſh in the City, though of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and pleaſing taſte. They feed upon <hi>Acorns, Beech-maſt,</hi> and <hi>Cheſnuts,</hi> upon the ſpring or ſprout of <hi>Broom, Juniper,</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> and upon the roots of <hi>Fern,</hi> and will range into Corn-fields, and come out of Foreſts into Vineyards. The Huntſmen are notably verſed and skilful in that Game; for though they ſee it not, they will diſtinguiſh a wild from a common Swine, and gueſs whether that which they hunt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:66078:81"/>
be Male or Female, old or young, large or ſmall; fat or lean; and this they chiefly conjecture from their tread or foot, and the caſting their hindfeet out of the track of their forefeet.</p>
               <p>The Emperor being ſo good a Huntſman, it is the leſs wonder that he is eſteemed a good Horſeman. Certain it is, that he hath a very noble Stable of Horſes, procured from all parts, <hi>Turk ſh, Tartarian, Polonian, Tranſylvanian, Saxon, Bohemian, Hungarian, Naples,</hi> &amp;c. and they are well managed; and they ride them to the ſatisfaction of the Beholders.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen the <hi>Arſenal</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Stores</hi> at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and the <hi>Naval Proviſions</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I am not like to admire any other, eſpecially ſo far from the Sea, and looked for nothing of that nature in this place Notwithſtanding I found an <hi>Arſenal,</hi> and place for Naval Veſſels to be ſet out upon occaſion, and ſome thereof were employed in the laſt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> war, when they attempted to deſtroy the Bridge of Boats which the <hi>Turks</hi> had made over the <hi>Danube,</hi> a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>Barchan.</hi> They are built ſomewhat like <hi>Galleys,</hi> carry great Guns, and a good number of Souldiers, and will make a fight upon the broad deep ſtream of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and may be handſomly brought into the Town behind one of the Baſtions, when the River is high: and hereof there are ſome at <hi>Rab</hi> and <hi>Komora</hi> as I have declared elſewhere.</p>

               <p>The Count <hi>de Souches</hi> was alſo a <hi>Commander</hi> of great Fame, and in high eſteem with the Emperor.

               </p>
               <p>The number and nobleneſs of the Books doth much exceed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle or place which contains them, as making no fair ſhew at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and ſomewhat wanting light. But as for the number and value of the Books, they are of opinion here that it yields unto none, but rather excels any other Library in <hi>Europe.</hi> There was a place deſigned for the building of a fit receptacle for them; but, I know not how, a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre for Comedies is now built in that place.</p>
               <p>It is divided into eight Chambers or Rooms, which are ſo well filled, that many Books are fain to lie upon the Floor; and the Shelves ſtand ſo cloſe, that there is but juſt room to paſs between them. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, ſtand diſtinct from the printed Books, according to their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, being divided into ſix <hi>Claſſes, Theological, Juridical, Medical, Philoſophical, Hiſtorical, Philological.</hi> There can ſcarce be a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Collection than the Manuſcripts in part of the firſt Chamber, of <hi>Hebrew, Syriack, Arabick, Turkiſh, Armenian, Aethiopick,</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> Books.</p>
               <p>It was begun, at leaſt the Books began to be placed in this recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Firſt, but hath been much encreaſed by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperors, moſt of them, ſince <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Firſt, being much addicted unto Learning, there having been large acceſſions from many noble Libraries, and moſt upon the coſt of the Emperors. The choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Books in the famous Library of <hi>Buda,</hi> of King <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> Son unto <hi>Huniades,</hi> are now in it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Augerius Bushequius,</hi> ſometime Library-Keeper hereof, added much unto it; and in his two <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Embaſſies procured a great number of noble <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which are inſcribed with his own hand, <hi>Aug. de Buſbeck. emit Conſtantinopoli.</hi> A great many were added from the Library of the Learned <hi>Johannes Cuſpinianus,</hi> Library Keeper, and Councellor unto the Emperor.

               <p>I went unto divers noted Places about <hi>Vienna:</hi> I walked unto the Hill of <hi>Vienna,</hi> two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles diſtant from the Town, going up all the way by an eaſie Aſcent; from whence I had a proſpect of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Compagnia about it, together with the high Mountains in

               </p>
               <p>About two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles Eaſtward from <hi>Vienna,</hi> there is a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Garden-place belonging to the Emperor, built by <hi>Rodolphu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which hath been formerly well furniſhed, and provided with Plants, but now ſeems to be neglected, and ſomewhat ruinous. It conſiſts of an inward and an outward ſquare Garden: The inward is two hundred ordinary paces ſquare, about the ſame bigneſs with the Place Royal at <hi>Paris:</hi> It hath a <hi>Portico</hi> or <hi>Cloyster,</hi> ſupported by Forty Pillars of white Stone on each ſide, and is covered with Copper; as are alſo the Pavilions which the common people think to be Gold. Beſides this, there is an handſom row of Buildings well ſeated, called <hi>Néw-gabaú,</hi> in which at preſent are many wild Beaſts kept. Lions and Tigres breed here, and have young ones. Some ſay this was the place of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent's Tent when he beſieged <hi>Vienna.</hi> But it is rather the Figure of his Pavilion which was placed on the other ſide of the City.</p>
               <p>There is alſo, about two or three miles from <hi>Vienna,</hi> a noted place of Devotion, called <hi>Arnols,</hi> much frequented, eſpecially in <hi>Lent,</hi> divers carrying Croſſes very heavy all the way upon their ſhoulders. There is here a little Houſe built exactly after that of the Scpulchre at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> and alſo a handſom Copy of the Picture of our Saviour and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with their exact heights. That of our Saviour is about two yards high; that of the bleſſed Virgin three or four fingers breadth lower: Theſe are taken from the Original in St. <hi>John de Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> Hither the Empreſs deſired to go one morning from her own Palace on Foot, out of Devotion, which ſhe performed, though with a great deal of difficulty, ſhe being not uſed to walk, and the way was duſty. The Emperor accompanied her and all the Court followed on foot, which made a handſome ſhew.</p>
               <p>Nearer unto <hi>Vienna</hi> there is alſo a remarkable place for Devotion, called <hi>Itzing:</hi> and in the way from <hi>Vienna</hi> unto it, the twelve Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Croſs are marked out in imitation of what is obſerved near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the <hi>Via Crucis,</hi> or <hi>Doloroſa,</hi> in our Saviour's proceeding from the City unto Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> the the Figures thereof are print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſeveral paces between every Station ſet down. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror hath a handſom Park near <hi>Vienna,</hi> called the <hi>Brater,</hi> wherein I beheld the effects of the great Lightning and Thunder which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three days before, upon many great Trees which were torn, ſplit, or twiſted. There is a Houſe of Pleaſure in it, where among other things, I could not but take notice of a Muſical Inſtrument which I had not ſeen before, a <hi>Seat</hi> or <hi>Cheſtdrum;</hi> it hath a Cord like that of a <hi>Sea-trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> but ſounds like a <hi>Kettle-drum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I went alſo unto <hi>Laxamburg,</hi> whither the Emperor often retires; he hath a Houſe in this place, but it is old, and not large. There is alſo a Houſe of Pleaſure in the Mote, into which there is no other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage but through a high <hi>Corridore.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There are Stoves alſo in the publick Schools where Lectures are read. And this way of lying between two Feather-beds, with a neat laced ſheet ſpread over, is more convenient in a cold Country, than moſt others they make uſe of. For in the common Inns in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> they generally ſleep upon Straw, and alſo in <hi>Hungary</hi> almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; and more Eaſterly upon the ground, ſpreading a Carpet or Saddle-cloth under them: and more Northerly they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Skins of Beaſts, <hi>Bears, Elks,</hi> or the like; upon which they ſleep in the night. Thoſe that ſleep loweſt are cooleſt in a Stove; thoſe that lie upon Tables, Benches, or higher, are more expoſed to the heat. The Citizens of <hi>Vienna</hi> are well attired, and uſe Furs very much The Women wear a high Velvet Bonnet, lined or faced therewith.

But at <hi>Vienna</hi> a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trick which I ſaw there, pleaſed me much: A man of a middle Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture laid down upon his back, and a heavy Anvil was placed upon his Breaſt, as much as two men could well liſt, then two other men with great Hammers laid on, until they had given almoſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred blows, and cut in ſunder a great Horſhooe of iron, about half an inch thick.</p>

But here are no ſmall number of <hi>Jews,</hi> who have a diſtinct Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſigned them over the Water. They have alſo a Street allowed them in the City for the day time, but they muſt all depart at night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River into the Suburbs.</p>
               <p>They are much diſtaſted by the Citizens and Tradeſmen, and the Scholars agree but ill with them. While I was at <hi>Vienna</hi> there was a quarrel between them to an high degree. For the <hi>Scholars</hi> aſſaulted the <hi>Jews</hi> Town, beat, wounded, and threw divers of them into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Divers <hi>Scholars</hi> were wounded, ſome killed, and alſo ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who were commanded out to compoſe the Fray: and the <hi>Jews</hi> Town was guarded many days by the Souldiers of the City. This begot ſuch ill Blood, and Complaints, that a good number of the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be baniſhed at a certain day. The <hi>Jews,</hi> to ingratiate with the Empreſs, then with Child, preſented her with a noble <hi>Silver Cradle,</hi> but ſhe would not receive it; and there was great danger of the general baniſhment of them when I left that City, which was afterwards effected, they being ſeverely prohibited from living, not only at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> but in any part of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where there were formerly whole Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of them, ſo as they were forced to betake themſelves into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the <hi>Turk,</hi> unto <hi>Venice,</hi> into <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> They being not permitted to dwell in the Neighbour Countries of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſubject to the Emperor, <hi>Styria,</hi> or <hi>Carinthia.</hi> But many of them went to <hi>Buda</hi> and were beſieged there in the year 1684 and becoming obſtinate haters of the <hi>Germans,</hi> they aſſiſted the <hi>Turks</hi> with their Purſes and with what elſe they were able to maintain the Town againſt the Imperial Forces.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs they ſeemed uſeful to <hi>Vienna</hi> for ready accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing, either by ſale or exchange, but the people looked with an ill eye upon them, as taking away much of their Trade and Employment. They alſo looked upon them as uſeleſs to them in war for the defence of the place as Souldiers; and were not without ſome jealouſie that they held Correſpondence with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and gave them Intelligence of their Affairs. Yet the Souldiery dealt much with them, and Captains for the ſuddain habiting, furniſhing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating of their Companies. And dining one day with a Commander at a <hi>Jew</hi>'s Houſe, amongſt other Diſcourſe, I asked the <hi>Jew</hi> concerning the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and where they were? He ſaid <hi>they were far off in</hi> Aſia, <hi>b yond a great Lake which was continually ſtormy, and ſcarce paſſable, but upon their Sabbath-day, upon which days the Jews do not willingly travel.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, when I conſider the old ſtrength of <hi>Vienna,</hi> conſiſting in an old <hi>wall</hi> and a deep <hi>Ditch,</hi> I cannot much wonder that <hi>Matthias Corvinus,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> took this City.

But this place is now in a far better condition ſtrongly fortified, and able to reſiſt the greateſt Forces of <hi>Turky.</hi> The <hi>houſes</hi> are cleared from the <hi>wall;</hi> and yet for better ſecurity, when I was there, Count <hi>Souches</hi> adviſed the Emperor to pull down part of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> upon the other ſide of the neareſt branch of the <hi>Danube,</hi> left the <hi>Turks</hi> might take advantage to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two <hi>Baſtions</hi> on that ſide.</p>
               <p>It would be a ſad loſs for <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> if this place were in the hands of the <hi>Turk;</hi> and no man knows where he would reſt.

A large Town, and much frequented, not far from the River <hi>Albis</hi> or <hi>Elbe,</hi> of eſpecial note for the <hi>Silver Mines</hi> about it: The <hi>Hells</hi> near it are not high, and conſequently the Mines are not ſo deep as thoſe of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and ſome others in <hi>Germany;</hi> yet ſome are above ſeventy or eighty <hi>Fathoms.</hi> They have wrought at theſe <hi>Mines</hi> ſeven hundred years, and there are about thirty of them. I went down into that which was firſt digged, but afterwards leſt for a long time, but they work there now again, it is called the <hi>Cotna,</hi> or <hi>Auf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cotten,</hi> upon the <hi>Cotten,</hi> or <hi>Coat-hill;</hi> and as the Story goes a <hi>Monk</hi> walking over this Hill found a kind of a <hi>Silver Tree</hi> ſticking to his Garment, which was the occaſion that they afterwards digged and built theſe <hi>Mines,</hi> and the place retains the name of <hi>Cottenberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mine</hi> into which I deſcended near the Town, is but nineteen <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep; the chief <hi>Vein</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> runs South, and is about a foot in breadth: the <hi>Ore</hi> holds or contains in it <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> ſo that out of an hundred pound weight of <hi>Ore,</hi> they ordinarily get an Ounce of <hi>Silver,</hi> and eight, nine, or ten ounces or more of <hi>Copper,</hi> even to pounds, but it is not well known, for the <hi>Copper-works</hi> are the Emperors.

About an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile or two from <hi>Freiberg,</hi> there are many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Mines.</hi> I took notice of three of them: One called <hi>Auff den hohen berg,</hi> or <hi>upon the high Hill,</hi> which is the deepeſt in theſe parts, as being ſeventy ſeven of their <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep; each of their <hi>Fathoms</hi> contains twelve of their <hi>Ells,</hi> and three of their <hi>Ells</hi> makes one of our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms.</hi> So that the depth of this <hi>Mine</hi> exceeds any of thoſe wherein I was in <hi>Hungary.</hi> There is another <hi>Mine</hi> called <hi>Himmelfurſt,</hi> or the <hi>Prince of Heaven,</hi> wherein not long ſince there was <hi>Ore</hi> found ſo rich, as in an hundred pounds weight to contain an hundred and thirty Marks of <hi>Silver,</hi> or ſixty five pounds in the hundred, but there was not much of it: And where the <hi>Veins</hi> are richeſt, they are obſerved to be thinneſt, about two fingers broad; but the ordinary <hi>Ore</hi> is but poor, holding an ounce, or an ounce and half, in an hundred pounds weight; and if it holds but half an ounce they work it. Nor is this much to be wondered at, for in the vaſt rich <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chili,</hi> they will work the <hi>Silver Ore</hi> which contains four or five ounces in a<note place="margin">Silver Mines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> hundred pound weight; and ten or twelve ounces is the ordinary rate of the common <hi>Ore</hi> of that rich Mountain of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> out of which Hill alone, if we believe <hi>Albero Alonſo Barba,</hi> Curate of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in that City, there hath been more <hi>Silver</hi> taken than would cover all <hi>Miſnia</hi> over and over: For thus he ſaith, Potoſi <hi>hath already yielded between four and five hundred Millions of pieces of Eight.</hi> A quantity ſufficient to make ſuch another Hill of <hi>Silver:</hi> It is hard to form a conception equal unto ſo exorbitant a heap of Riches; but the better to help our imagination herein, I know, that if the Ground were covered with ſo many pieces of Eight, laid as cloſe to one another as is poſſible, they would take up the ſpace of ſixty Leagues ſquare.</p>
               <p>Here at <hi>Freiberg</hi> they have many ways to open the <hi>Ore</hi> whereby it may be melted; as by <hi>Lead</hi> and a ſort of <hi>Silver Ore</hi> which holds <hi>Lead</hi> in it. They have alſo <hi>Sulphur Ore</hi> found here, which after it is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66078:103"/>
burned, doth help much towards the ſuſion of <hi>Metals:</hi> And beſides theſe, <hi>Slich,</hi> or pounded and waſhed <hi>Ore;</hi> and <hi>Slacken,</hi> which is the Droſs or Cake, or Skum taken out of the <hi>Vortiegel,</hi> or <hi>Pan</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>melted Minerals,</hi> let out at the bottom of the <hi>melting Furnace.</hi> Their <hi>Treibſhearth,</hi> or <hi>driving Furnace,</hi> where the <hi>Litharge</hi> is driven off, agrees better with the Figure of it in <hi>Agricola,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Hungary:</hi> Some of the <hi>Litharge</hi> is green: Their <hi>Buck-work</hi> and their <hi>Engines</hi> which pound the <hi>Ore,</hi> the <hi>Coal,</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> are alſo very neat. Much of their <hi>Ore</hi> is waſhed, eſpecially the pooreſt, and that which is mixed with <hi>ſtones, quarts,</hi> or <hi>ſparrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is peculiar in their working, that they burn the pounded and waſhed <hi>Ore</hi> in the <hi>Roaſthearth,</hi> before they melt it in the <hi>Smeltzoven,</hi> or <hi>melting Furnace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At thoſe <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> where I was, they uſed not the <hi>Virgula divina,</hi> or forked Hazel, to find out <hi>Silver Ore</hi> or hidden Treaſure in the Earth; and I ſhould little depend thereon: but here they have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of it. And I obſerved the uſe thereof, and the manner how they did it. But I ſhall omit the Deſcription of it, becauſe it is ſet down in divers Books, and it cannot be ſo well deſcribed as ſhown to the Eye.</p>
               <p>I ſaw alſo another <hi>Mine,</hi> called <hi>Auff der Halſbrucker,</hi> about eighty of our <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep, and much worked: They have divers ſorts of <hi>Ore;</hi> but they contain either <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Copper, Silver</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> or all three; but they work them only for <hi>Silver.</hi> They have divers <hi>damps</hi> in theſe <hi>Mines,</hi> where it is deep. The <hi>Mines</hi> are cold where the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air comes in; but where not, warm. The greateſt trouble they have is by duſt, which ſpoils their <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Stomachs,</hi> and frets their <hi>Skins.</hi> But they are not ſo much troubled with water; and have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Brimſtone Mines.</note> good <hi>Engines</hi> to draw the water out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Brimſtone Ore</hi> which is found here, is alſo rich; it is hard and ſtony, as other <hi>Ores</hi> are; that which hath <hi>red ſpots</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the beſt. They uſe a peculiar <hi>Furnace</hi> to melt the <hi>Brimſtone</hi> from the <hi>Ore;</hi> ſome whereof yields three pounds of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> out of an hundred weight of <hi>Ore,</hi> which as it melts, runs out of the <hi>Furnace</hi> into water, or the Exhalations from the <hi>Ore</hi> near or in the Fire, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into <hi>Brimſtone</hi> by the Surface of the Water placed to receive it; this is once again melted and purified. Some of the <hi>Brimstone Ore</hi> contains <hi>Silver,</hi> ſome <hi>Copper,</hi> and ſome both in a ſmall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is melted from the <hi>Ore,</hi> the remainder ſerves for two uſes; that is, either for the melting of <hi>Silver,</hi> or for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Vitriol:</hi> To the former only thus; A proportion is caſt into the melting <hi>Furnace</hi> of the <hi>Silver,</hi> to this end, to uſe the <hi>Miners</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to make the <hi>Silver</hi> which is hard, fluid.</p>
               <p>The other uſe, and which is more conſiderable, is for the making of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or <hi>Copperoſe</hi> in this manner: They take the <hi>Ore,</hi> out of which the <hi>Brimſtone</hi> hath been already melted, and burn it once again, or let it ſtill burn in the open Air; then putting it into a large Fatt, they pour water upon it, ſo as to imbibe and drink in the <hi>Vitriol;</hi> this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is afterwards boyled to a ſufficient height, and let out into the Coolers, where ſticks are ſet in it, as in the making of <hi>Sugar Candy:</hi> The pureſt Cryſtallized <hi>Vitriol</hi> ſticks unto the wood, the reſt to the

ſides and bottom. Thus the <hi>Sulphur Ore,</hi> after the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is taken out of it, ſtill works upon the <hi>Silver Ore,</hi> and opens the Body of it in the Fire; but when this <hi>Ore</hi> is alſo deprived of its <hi>Vitriol,</hi> it works no more upon <hi>Metals.</hi>

               <p>Theſe <hi>Mines</hi> afford great benefit unto the City, and alſo unto the Elector; They are ſaid to have been found out in the year 1180.

                  <hi>Leipſick</hi> is ſeated upon the River <hi>Elster,</hi> which ariſing in <hi>Voytland,</hi> or <hi>Terra Advocatorum,</hi> paſſes by it, and afterwards runs into the River <hi>Sala.</hi> It is a rich and great trading City; hath three <hi>Marts</hi> in the year, and great reſort unto it from many parts: It is well built, and divers <hi>Houſes</hi> are ſeven ſtories high.

                  <hi>Leipſick</hi> is famous for two great Battels fought near unto it, in the laſt <hi>Swediſh</hi> wars; one between <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> General of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> 1631. wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> obtained a great Victory. <hi>Tilly</hi> was wounded, fled and lived not long after.

               <p>The <hi>Winter</hi> growing on called me to make haſte to <hi>Hamburg,</hi> from whence I intended to paſs by Sea into <hi>England,</hi> and therefore I took the advantage of the <hi>Stage-Coaches</hi> at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and in four days came to <hi>Hamburg.</hi> I traveled through a Country for the moſt part barren, of little accommodation, or ſcarce any thing very remarkable, through part of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and then through the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi>'s Country, paſſing by the City of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom walled City, beautified with divers fair <hi>Churches,</hi> with high <hi>Spires.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Lambert,</hi> the <hi>Town-houſe,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> are fair.

               <p>In this Road through <hi>lower Saxony,</hi> I could not but take notice of many <hi>Barrows</hi> or <hi>Mounts</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> the burial <hi>Monuments</hi> of great and famous <hi>Men,</hi> to be often obſerved alſo in open Countries in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſometimes rows of great <hi>Stones,</hi> like thoſe in <hi>Wormius</hi> his <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Antiquities:</hi> And in one place I took more particular notice of them, where three maſſy <hi>Stones</hi> in the middle, were encompaſſed in a large ſquare by other large <hi>Stones</hi> ſet up on end.</p>

fortified according to the modern manner, much after the way of <hi>Holland,</hi> with <hi>works</hi> of <hi>earth,</hi> but in no place yet covered or faced with <hi>brick</hi> or <hi>ſtone:</hi> The <hi>Territory</hi> belonging to it is but ſmall; it is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the <hi>new</hi> and the <hi>old Town.</hi> There are five <hi>Gates:</hi> The <hi>Stone gate,</hi> leading towards <hi>Lubeck;</hi> the <hi>Dome-gate;</hi> the <hi>Alten-gate,</hi> or which leads unto <hi>Altenaw,</hi> a place near the <hi>Town,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> where the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> have their <hi>Churches;</hi> the <hi>Bridge-gate;</hi> and the <hi>Dike-gate.</hi> The <hi>Buildings</hi> of this City are handſom, and commonly have a fair entrance into them.

               <p>I found a Ship at <hi>Hamburg</hi> bound for <hi>London,</hi> and while it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for Sail, I made a ſhort <hi>excurſion</hi> into part of the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> Country; and returning to <hi>Hamburg</hi> again, I ordered my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for <hi>England</hi> upon the firſt wind, and hoped the next <hi>Tide</hi> to get over the <hi>Altenaw-ſand,</hi> and to paſs the <hi>Blanckneſs,</hi> but a croſs wind prevented, ſo that I left not <hi>Hamburg</hi> till the tenth of <hi>December,</hi> and then I had the good company of Mr. <hi>Hoyle,</hi> who came from <hi>Narva,</hi> and ſet Sail in a new Ship; but the days being at the ſhorteſt, and the nights dark in the <hi>New-Moon,</hi> the <hi>Tide</hi> falling alſo in the day time,

               <p>They make good proviſion againſt the cold of their Country, by ſleeping between two Feather-beds and Stoves.</p>
               <p>The common <hi>Stoves</hi> in <hi>Inns,</hi> wherein there are for the moſt part ſeveral Companies eating, drinking, and in the night ſleeping, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, conſidering the great cold, or at leaſt tolerable; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rooms cloſe ſhut up, the ſmell of the meat, and eſpecially of <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage,</hi> an uſual Diſh amongſt them, makes them unpleaſant, ſo that ſometimes I preferred the courſe of hot Countries, while I called to mind, that in <hi>Province,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> we drank frozen <hi>Julebs,</hi> which we diſſolved with the heat of our hands; ſlept upon a ſheet, on the outſide of the Bed, with all the Windows of the Chamber open; and as we ſate at dinner, there was a Fann in the middle of the Room, hanging

over our Heads, about two yards broad, which with a ſtring was pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backward and forward to cool us, and divers had Pans filled with Snow, to cool the ſheets when they went into their Beds.</p>

This <hi>Mine</hi> having been wrought Three hundred years, and being one of the moſt remarkable
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66078:112"/>
of that kind, it may not be impertinent to ſet down ſome particulars concerning it. It is about eighteen or nineteen <hi>Fathoms</hi> deep, lying all open like a <hi>Chalk Mine,</hi> of an Oval Figure; they digg at preſent in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and the beſt <hi>Calmey</hi> lies between the <hi>Rocks,</hi> in the deepeſt part of the <hi>Mine:</hi> They have now found an excellent <hi>Vein</hi> ſo placed, of eleven or twelve Foot thick, which they digg out with <hi>Pick-axes,</hi> with ſome difficulty, by reaſon that the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> is very hard. The <hi>colour</hi> of this <hi>Stone</hi> is of a dark <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> and hath <hi>Veins</hi> of <hi>natural Brimſtone</hi> mixed thinly in it. The <hi>Veins</hi> of the <hi>Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris,</hi> being ſo large, they follow them not only in one place, but digg over one anothers heads, and frame their work into the ſhape of large <hi>Stayrs,</hi> and one throws up what another diggs, and ſo upward till they lade the <hi>Carts</hi> with it. Some of the <hi>Cadmia</hi> is blackiſh and dark brown; and there are <hi>Fluores</hi> between the Cavities of the <hi>Stone</hi> handſomly figured, but moſt of a <hi>blackiſh colour.</hi> The <hi>works</hi> about the <hi>Mine</hi> the moſt remarkable, are theſe: 1. An <hi>Overſhot-wheel</hi> in the Earth, which moves the <hi>Pumps</hi> to pump out the <hi>water;</hi> and this not placed in the <hi>Mine</hi> but on one ſide of it, and a <hi>paſſage</hi> cut out of the <hi>Mine</hi> to the bottom of it, by which the <hi>Mine</hi> is drained; and another <hi>paſſage</hi> or <hi>cuniculus,</hi> out of the place where the <hi>wheel</hi> is turned, which lets out the <hi>water</hi> which turns the <hi>wheel,</hi> and alſo the <hi>water</hi> which comes out of the <hi>Mine</hi> into the Neighbouring <hi>Valley.</hi> 2. The <hi>waſhing</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> which they perform, as at other works, by letting the <hi>water</hi> over it, and ſtirring it; and this they do whereſoever they begin to work near the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> for there the <hi>Calmey</hi> is leſs, and more mixed with <hi>Clay</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> but the moſt remarkable <hi>work</hi> is the <hi>calcining</hi> of the <hi>Ore</hi> (for all our <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> of the <hi>Shops</hi> is the <hi>calcined Calmey)</hi> and it is worth the ſeeing; for they place <hi>Faggots</hi> in a handſome order firſt, and cover a large round <hi>Area</hi> with them, of about Forty or Fifty yards <hi>Diameter,</hi> upon which they place <hi>Charcoal</hi> in as good an order, till all be covered and filled up a yard from the ground; then they place ranks of the largeſt <hi>Stones</hi> of <hi>Calmey,</hi> and after them ſmaller, till they have laid all on; and then by ſetting <hi>fire</hi> to the <hi>bottom,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> comes to each <hi>stone,</hi> and all is handſomly <hi>calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> They make <hi>Calmey</hi> alſo about two <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Bleyberg</hi> in <hi>Carinthia,</hi> They make it after this manner, They take the <hi>Ore</hi> out of the <hi>Mine,</hi> ſometimes they waſh it, and ſometimes not, they burn it as they do Roſt. Then they take it, and beat it in pieces with a mallet; They chooſe the beſt of it, and throw away the droſs, the whiteſt is commonly the beſt. From hence we went to <hi>Limburg,</hi> meeting with divers <hi>Souldiers</hi> upon the <hi>Road,</hi> who deſired money of us, but did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing againſt us, we being many of us together in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>

                  <hi>Speutus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> bought the Principality of <hi>Liege</hi> of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> when he went to the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> And in the Treaty of <hi>Cambray,</hi> 1559. the poſſeſſion of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and precedency of Ti le, was granted to the Biſhop of <hi>Liege,</hi> although at this time alſo the Houſes of <hi>La Tour</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> do bear the ſame.</p>
               <p>Of the Pariſh Churches that of St. <hi>John,</hi> and of St. <hi>Servaſius</hi> are fair. Of the Abbeys that of St. <hi>Jacob</hi> within the Town, and of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> built by Biſhop <hi>Raginardus</hi> upon an Hill out of the Town, are noble. There is alſo a College of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuites, well-ſeated upon a Hill, where the Garden is handſom, and the Dyals, made by <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Linus,</hi> are worth the ſeeing: And an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nunnery handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built. In the Church of the <hi>Gulielmites,</hi> out of the Town, lies the Body of our famous Country-man Sir <hi>John Mandeville,</hi> who, after he had travelled through many parts, took an affection unto this place, and here paſſed the remainder of his life, and whoſe Epitaph, and ſome Rareties of his, are ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Biſhop <hi>Notger,</hi> who was conſecrated by St. <hi>Gereon,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Colen,</hi> and died in the year 1007. built the walls of this City, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tutor to <hi>Otho</hi> the third, he found means very much to beautifie it, to repair and build divers Churches, and endow them with rich Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:66078:114"/>
and let the River <hi>Maes</hi> into the Town, which before ran upon one ſide of it.</p>
               <p>As their Churches are fair and numerous, ſoo are their Bells and Chimes remarkable. In the Cathedral of St. <hi>Lambert</hi> there are eight large Bells, and twelve leſſer; and there is one ſo great, as it is ſaid to require Twenty four men to ring it. In the Church of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Bells and Chimes are conſiderable; as alſo at St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> and the <hi>croſſed Friars.</hi> It is alſo an Univerſity, and was ſo famous in former Ages, that they ſtill take notice that at one time there have been Nine Sons of Kings, Twenty four Dukes Sons, Twenty nine of Counts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many of great Barons Students therein.</p>
               <p>Their Speech here, as alſo at <hi>Spaw,</hi> is called <hi>Roman,</hi> and is a kind of old <hi>French,</hi> or Dialect of that Languag, a great part of which is made up of <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> words: and they call the Neighbouring Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Dutch, Tuiſcon.</hi> But many ſpeak very good <hi>French.</hi> They have ſome Vineyards affording a ſmall Wine. The Hills about furniſh them with Quarries of good Stone, and of ſeveral kinds They have alſo divers Mines and Minerals, and great quantity of Pit-coal for Fire, in ſome places fetched deep out of the Earth, in others nearer the Surface: and in one place I ſaw them beginning to dig where they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately found Coal. Their Pumps and Engines to draw out the water, are very conſiderable at theſe Mines; in ſome places moved by Wheels, at above a Furlongs diſtance, to which they are continued by ſtrong Wood-work, which moves backwards and forwards continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cittadel</hi> ſtands upon a Hill, and is of great Strength; It was built to keep the City of <hi>Liege</hi> under Subjection. For 1649. there being ſome diſturbances in the City, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> offering to come into the Town to appeaſe it, was oppoſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, <hi>Jacobus Hennet,</hi> who was ſoon after ſurprized and beheaded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Bartholomaeus Rolandus;</hi> the Conſul having ſworn the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector ſhould never come in whilſt he were alive. And the <hi>Cittadel</hi> ſoon after was ordered to be built. The Bridges are handſom: that over the great Stream of the <hi>Maes</hi> is very broad and fair, and hath large Arches. From hence we could read the Elector's name upon the Cittadel, <hi>Maximilianus,</hi> although it were at a very great diſtance, the Letters were ſo large.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Liege</hi> we had a pleaſant paſſage down the Water to <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreicht,</hi> paſſing by <hi>Argentau,</hi> a Caſtle ſeated upon a high Rock on the right ſide of the River, belonging then to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Vichet</hi> in the half way, and then by <hi>Navagne,</hi> a ſtrong Fort in the <hi>Maes,</hi> which commands the River, and at that time did the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> ſervice; then by pleaſant Rocks on our left hand, wherein many Cuts and paſſages have been digged till we came in ſight of <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Town having been a little before taken from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States</hi> by a ſharp Siege, was full of <hi>French,</hi> and had a Garriſon in it of about ten Thouſand men; and in the <hi>Market-place</hi> ſtood about Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred large Fieldpieces. We ſaw the places where they made their Batteries and their Mines, the Out-works were very numerous, and many of them undermined. Colonel <hi>Storff</hi> ſhew'd us a handſom Draught of all the Works, Approaches and Manner of taking of the Town.</p>

It put me in mind of the <hi>hundred chambers of Nero,</hi> which he cauſed to be made under Ground in the <hi>Rocks</hi> at <hi>Baiae.</hi> And the <hi>Water</hi> which we met with in one place, made me think of <hi>Nero</hi>'s admirable <hi>Fiſh-pond,</hi> built in the like manner within the <hi>Earth.</hi> We came out again near to a <hi>Convent</hi> upon the <hi>Banks</hi> of the <hi>River,</hi> and returned by water to <hi>Maeſtreicht.</hi>

               <head>A JOURNEY FROM VENICE TO GENOA.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Travelled ſome years ſince, between <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> through many Countries of early Civility, ſeated in the middle of the temperate Zone, in a fruitful and happy Climate; affording plentifully all Neceſſaries for Life; and through Countries which have not only been conſiderable for their copious production of Corn, Fruit, Silk, Wine and Oyl, but alſo for having been very fortunate in all Ages, for bringing into the World Perſons of great Fame and Renown, who have rendred this Tract of Earth more than ordinarily remarkable for great Actions in all times. The memory of which is ſtill preſerved not only in their Writings, but alſo in their ſplendid Buildings, and Antiquities; though no parts have taſted more deeply of the dangerous variety of fortune, theſe having ſuffered the frequent Incurſions of many fierce and warlike Nations. Having therefore formerly enjoyed ſuch variety of obſervable Objects, I could not remember this Journey without ſome conſiderable ſatisfaction, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially having at the ſame time had the good luck to travel a great part of it with my worthy friends, Sir <hi>William Trumbull,</hi> Mr. <hi>Soames,</hi> Dr. <hi>Palman,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Daſhwood,</hi> which makes me bold, upon the opportunity of this ſecond Impreſſion, to add further this ſhort Account.</p>
               <p>We paſſed from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Padoa</hi> by water up the ſtream of the pleaſant River <hi>Brent,</hi> having all day long Houſes of Pleaſure, and well built Palaces on each hand of us. We entered this River near <hi>Lizafu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Venice;</hi> where formerly a Wheel, or Engine was placed, to convey the Veſſels into the River. The <hi>Venetians</hi> having long ſince ſtopped up the entrance of the <hi>Brenta,</hi> leſt that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Deſcent of the Water, the Stream, and Channel might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, loſt, or altered; and the paſſages for their Veſſels rendred dangerous, or inconvenient; but this is otherwiſe contrived at preſent, and four large Locks or <hi>Sostegni</hi> are made uſe of, both to keep up the water, and to facilitate the paſſage of the Veſſels. Theſe are placed at
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66078:117"/>
                  <hi>Stra, Dolo, Mira,</hi> and <hi>Moranzan,</hi> and are very remarkable, conſidering that the River in theſe places is locked up, and the Veſſels which are to paſs are brought in between great Gates; and the water let in or out, as they have occaſion to paſs up or down the River.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Padoa.</note> The landing-place at <hi>Padoa</hi> is handſomly ſet off with ſtone ſteps, continued for a long ſpace, along the ſide of the River, after the manner of the landing-place at <hi>Ghent,</hi> and ſome other elegant Cities of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> The outward Wall is ſtrong, being well fortified according to the Modern Rules of Fortification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the time of <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Loredaro,</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice;</hi> and to render it more ſtrong, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Brenta</hi> and <hi>Bacchiglione</hi> are let into the Town Ditch. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wall is now moſt conſiderable for its Antiquity, and for retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of its Founder; it being ſtill called <hi>Antenor</hi>'s Wall: It contains a far leſs ſpace of ground than the former, <hi>Padoa</hi> being built in this reſpect like to the City of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> or <hi>Aken,</hi> having own Town within another.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Patavium,</hi> or <hi>Padoa</hi> is one of the oldeſt Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> built preſently after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, is confeſſed by Ancient Writers; and ſo generally believed of old, that <hi>Livy</hi> lays it down for the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of his Hiſtory; beginning in this manner, <hi>Jam primum omnium ſatis conſtat, Troja capta,</hi> &amp;c. i. e.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place it is ſufficiently manifeſt that <hi>Troy</hi> being taken, the <hi>Grecians</hi> executed the utmoſt of their rage upon the <hi>Trojans, Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Antenor</hi> only excepted, by reaſon of their ancient friendſhip with the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and in reſpect that they had always endeavoured to make Peace, and reſtore <hi>Helena.</hi> After various fortunes, <hi>Antenor</hi> brought a great Number of the <hi>Heneti,</hi> who having loſt their King, <hi>Pylemon</hi> at the Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> and being driven out of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> by a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were now ſeeking new Seats and a Captain to lead them; and came along with them to the bottom of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Gulf, drove out the <hi>Eugenians</hi> who inhabited between the Sea and <hi>Alpes,</hi> and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Trojans</hi> and the <hi>Heneti</hi> in thoſe Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martial</hi> alſo ſaluting <hi>Flaccus,</hi> a <hi>Padoan</hi> Poet, calls him,

               <p>And that you may more firmly give credit to it, you may further alſo have the authority of a Goddeſs for it; for <hi>Venus</hi> is introduced expoſtulating in theſe terms with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Aeneas.</hi>

               </lg>
               <p>In thoſe days when the art of Navigation was but in its infancy, and the Mariners very unwillingly parted with the ſight of land, <hi>Antenor</hi> was forced to keep cloſe, and creep along the Coaſt of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> and then ſail by the <hi>Illyrian,</hi> and <hi>Liburnian</hi> Shoars, which are very uneven and troubleſom to deal with, being full of Creeks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Bays, and Rocks; beſides very many Iſlands of various ſhapes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas if he had croſſed over to the <hi>Italian</hi> coaſt, he had had a nearer voyage, and ſayled with pleaſure all along an even, bold, brave ſhoar.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Padoa,</hi> are well pleaſed with the thoughts of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient founders and Progenitors, and they ſtill preſerve the tomb of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor,</hi> near to which at preſent ſtands the Church of Saint <hi>Lawrence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and in their publick ſhows they will ſtill be repreſenting ſomething of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the old <hi>Trojans,</hi> and in one place I ſaw a horſe of wood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty foot high in imitation of the old <hi>Trojan</hi> horſe; but, I ſuppoſe, nothing near ſo big as the firſt original: Yet when I conſider that above eleven hundred years after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> when Towns and Buildings were very much amplified and improved, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> coming in Triumph, could not enter even the great Triumphal gates of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf in a chariot drawn by Elephants, an Animal that ſeldom or never comes to be ſo high as this Horſe, it may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they could not have received, even this poor model of the firſt great one into the old town of <hi>Troy</hi> without pulling down their walls.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Padoa</hi> was always a friend to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and did them great ſervice in their wars againſt the <hi>Galli, Senones,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrians, Boians, Inſubres, Cimbrians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and ſtuck cloſe to their Intereſt till the time of the declination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; When <hi>Attila</hi> the powerful King of the <hi>Huns</hi> with fire and ſword deſtroyed it; and when after divers years it was rebuilt by the favour of <hi>Narſes,</hi> the Eunuch, General to the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> it was again lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ruined by the <hi>Longobardian</hi> Princes, who by ſhooting arrows, with firebrands fixed to them, ſet the City on fire, and took it. But under the Empire of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and his ſucceſſors, it aroſe out of its aſhes again, and flouriſhed for a long time; being governed firſt by Conſuls, and then by a Podeſta, untill the time of their dreadful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Ezzellin,</hi> who harraſſed, baniſhed, tormented, and maſſacred the Inhabitants, cramming their own Wells within the City, full with their

This noble Family of the <hi>Carrareſi,</hi> very powerful in theſe parts, came from their Caſtle of <hi>Baſſano,</hi> and lived in <hi>Padoa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where they became very conſiderable and ſiding with the Pope againſt the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, they were driven out by <hi>Ezzellin,</hi> but when upon the ſucceſsful attempts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legate, <hi>Anſedin,</hi> a commander under <hi>Ezzellin,</hi> was overthrown, they were again reſtored, dignified, and eſtabliſhed in the government of <hi>Padoa;</hi> which they poſſeſſed, with ſome variety of Fortune, from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their own Family, for about an hundred Years, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which, they were ſeized on by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who thought fit to put <hi>Franciſco Novello,</hi> and his Sons to death in the year 1405.

               <p>The Buildings at <hi>Padoa,</hi> both publick, and private, are very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; for moſt of the City is built upon Arches, making handſom <hi>Portico</hi>'s or cloyſters on each ſide of the ſtreet; after the manner of the houſes in the Piazza of Convent Garden, which at all times afford a good defence againſt the Sun, and Rain, and many of the houſes are painted on the outſide, with very good Hiſtory-Painting in <hi>Freſco;</hi> their Churches are fair, and divers well adorned; The Domo or Cathedral Church is large, ſeated near the middle of the City; endowed, and mightily enriched by the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; whoſe Empreſs <hi>Berta</hi> lies buried here.

               <p>The <hi>Arena,</hi> or old Amphitheater at <hi>Padoa,</hi> is an Antiquity very remarkable; and the remains of ſome of the Arches are to be ſeen ſtill in the Gardens backward; but the <hi>Arena</hi> it ſelf, and the whole <hi>Podium,</hi> are preſerved intire, free, and empty: And at one end thereof, there is built a handſom Palace, the Front of which looks directly into the open Amphitheater, and is a portion of an Oval Figure, and the whole <hi>area,</hi> or <hi>Arena</hi> of the Amphitheater ſerves for the court to it, in ſuch manner, that the entrance being now at the end, directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:66078:120"/>
to the houſe, the handſome proſpect of it, and the clear Avenue to it, is extraordinarily ſurprizing, and extreamly noble, and I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that any Gentleman would ever deſire to have a fairer Court-yard to his houſe, than the ſpacious plain <hi>Arena</hi> of an old Roman Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor a better Wall than a high intire handſom <hi>Podium,</hi> the like to which perhaps is not at this day any where elſe to be ſeen. And I muſt freely confeſs, That of the Remains and Ruines of twelve old Amphitheaters, which I have ſeen my ſelf, I have not met with any one that comes near it; for in the Amphitheater at <hi>Douè</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> which is cut out of a Rock, and being of a ſmaller dimenſion, and part of the bottom being filled up, there is no viſible beauty of the <hi>Podiam,</hi> the like may be ſaid alſo of that at <hi>Nizza,</hi> near the river <hi>Varus,</hi> and that at <hi>Puzzuolo.</hi> That at <hi>Niſmes</hi> is filled up with dwelling houſes, in ſuch manner that the upper ſeats only are diſtinctly viſible. The Amphitheaters of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux, Xainctes, Arles, Garigliano,</hi> that at <hi>Rome</hi> near to the Church of <hi>Santa Croce</hi> in <hi>Gieruſalemme,</hi> and others are at preſent ſo much ruined, that nothing of this nature diſtinguiſhable is to be expected; nay even about the <hi>Arena</hi> at <hi>Verona,</hi> and the great <hi>Coliſſeo,</hi> or <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater at <hi>Rome,</hi> the ground is now riſen ſo high, that the <hi>Podi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> is at preſent either buried, or diſfigured. But as the <hi>Arena</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa</hi> is clear, and evident in this part; ſo is it wanting in all the reſt: and he that deſires at this day to view all the Parts of an Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt not ſee one, but many; and by joyning them together in his thoughts he may collect the figure, proportion, and dimenſions of this ſumptuous ſort of building of the old <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>From the Walls of <hi>Padoa,</hi> there is a pleaſant Proſpect of a plain Country to the North, Eaſt, and South; and of the <hi>Euganean</hi> Hills to the Weſt, which ſupply the Town with variety of Plants, and great Number of Vipers.

Crimſon, and yet was exceeded herein by the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his own picture to be embroidered in theſe coloured Silks, in the poſture of <hi>Apollo</hi> driving the Chariot of the Sun, and round about him, the Stars, and Conſtellations in Gold; and <hi>Lucretius</hi> takes notice of the graceful, beautiful ſhades, which theſe coverings made ſomewhat after this manner.</p>

                  <l>When purple Coverings, Yellow, or deep Red,</l>
                  <l>Over the Amphitheater are ſpread,</l>
                  <l>Which mighty Maſts, and ſturdy Pillars bear;</l>
                  <l>And the looſe Curtains wanton in the Air,</l>

                  <l>Each man's as glorious as a purple King.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But the outſide of the Amphitheater of <hi>Verona,</hi> was as ſplendid as the inſide, though at preſent a Portion of it only remains, as much as between, <hi>O,</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> By this ſmall part however the whole is eaſily known, eſpecially in ſo uniform a building as this. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide therefore being all of marble, about a hundred and twenty foot high, conſiſted of three rows of Pillars and Arches, one over another, which opened into large walks, and ſpacious <hi>Portico</hi>'s with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, quite round the Building; and above theſe three rows of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, there was a handſom wall with Windows over every Arch, and Pilaſters over every Pillar beneath; each row conſiſted of ſeventy two Arches, and ſeventy two Pillars of a great height; the upper row moreover is ſaid to have been adorned with excellent Statues. But the outſide of the Amphitheater at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> being the moſt entire of any now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have alſo inſerted a Cut of it, that nothing might be wanting to the clear underſtanding of the manner of theſe buildings: and as that at <hi>Verona,</hi> hath three rows of Pillars, and a wall above them, this at <hi>Niſmes</hi> hath only two rows of Pillars on the outſide, and the ſeats withinſide reach up to the top of it, and it hath no Galleries above. To ſupply this Amphitheater at <hi>Niſmes</hi> with water ſufficient to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent naval fights therein, the great <hi>Pont du Gard</hi> was built, which ſupports an Aquaeduct paſſing from one Mountain to another, a Cut whereof is alſo inſerted, it being one of the moſt magnificent <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities now ſtanding in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe wonderful Structures were firſt raiſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the more convenient exhibiting of Shows and Fights to the People; and theſe Fights were either between Beaſts and Beaſts, Men and Beaſts, or between Men and Men. The Fights between Beaſts and Beaſts are ſtill continued; for the Gentlemen of <hi>Verona</hi> take that care of this Ancient Venerable Building, that there is not at preſent one Stone wanting of all the Seats within; and when they would ſee any ſtrange hunting, fighting, or baiting o. Beaſts, they preſently enter their own old Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater, where at this time, three or four and twenty thouſand Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may ſit and ſee diſtinctly every Action, and paſs away part of the day in pleaſure and delight.</p>

But theſe Sports were purſued with much more eagerneſs in the time of the old <hi>Romans,</hi> who brought ſtrange Beaſts from all Parts of the known World to fight before them, in theſe publick places; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, upon the ſucceſsful Atchievements of <hi>Sylla</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> the People of <hi>Rome</hi> were not ſo much pleaſed with his making their inveterate Enemy King <hi>Jugurtha</hi> his Priſoner, as they were infinitely delighted with the thoughts of the great familiarity, that <hi>Sylla</hi> had with <hi>Bocchus,</hi> King of <hi>Gaetulia,</hi> whereby they hoped, that he might obtain moſt ſtrange unheard of <hi>African</hi> Monſters of Beaſts, to be ſhewn in their Amphitheaters; and <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great moſt wonderfully gratified the inclinations of his fellow Citizens, when he firſt brought a great <hi>Rhinoceros</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> After him <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> brought another, and following Emperors the like. This Beaſt, as it is reported, performed ſtrange things there; and when irritated, would with his great ſtrong Horn, preſently throw up all other combatant Beaſts to the Skies, and a Bull could not toſs up a Ball Higher than he would toſs up Bulls and Bears together.</p>

               <p>The Fights between Men and Beaſts were more unequal for the moſt part performed by Slaves, Captives, and Condemned Perſons, yet ſome of good quality have alſo polluted themſelves with theſe Brutiſh Sports, and acquired the true title of <hi>Beſtiarij.</hi> That which happened to <hi>Androdus</hi> a <hi>Dacian,</hi> upon this occaſion is well known now, but was ſurprizing at firſt, who ſtanding ready in the <hi>Arena,</hi> and having a Lyon let out upon him, received no hurt; for the Lyon came gently to him, careſſed and fawned upon him, and he likewiſe ſtroaked, and made much of the Lyon; and after the loud ſhouts of the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked how this came to paſs, he let them know, That being with his Maſter in <hi>Africa,</hi> to get rid of his hard ſervice, he had fled into a Cave, whither this Lyon came with a Splinter in his Foot, and held up his wounded Paw to him to cure; which having performed and free'd his Foot from the ſplinter and healed it, the Lyon kept him and provided meat for him three years, and when he came away the Lyon followed him ſo far, that he was alſo taken and brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that by the further cruelty of his old Maſter he was now condemned to the Beaſts, where they found him; whereupon his liberty was granted him, and the Lyon given him for his pains, with which he afterwards got his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, every one being deſirous to ſee the Lyon that was the mans Hoſt, and the man that was the Lyons Surgeon.</p>
               <p>The Fights between Men and Men, were of divers kinds, for they ſometimes fought on Horſe-back, as the <hi>Andabatae,</hi> ſometimes in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, as the <hi>Eſſedarij,</hi> and ſometimes in Ships and Veſſels, and this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Amphitheaters, (the <hi>Arena</hi> being filled with water) or in a Building made on purpoſe, called a <hi>Naumachia;</hi> or in artificial

Ponds, and cuts out of Rivers; and the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> exhibited a Naval Fight upon the <hi>Fucine</hi> Lake, the <hi>Lago di Celano,</hi> or <hi>lacus Fucinus,</hi> a days Journey from <hi>Rome,</hi> where at his firſt appearance both Fleets ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with an <hi>Ave, Caeſar, morituri te ſalutant.</hi>

               <p>Theſe fought, and followed after the <hi>Retiarii,</hi> and other Gladiators, with fierceneſs and courage, and were favoured by divers Emperors, who liked this way of fighting; and when five <hi>Retiarij</hi> had yielded to five <hi>Secutores,</hi> and thrown down their weapons, the Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Secutores</hi> to kill them; which they did to the laſt man, who becoming deſperate took up his fork again, and ſlew all the five conquering <hi>ſecutores,</hi> and this loſs of his dear friends was bemoaned by the Emperor in a publick Edict, with the excluſion of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured to ſee it, from being preſent, for the future at any ſacred rite.

               <p>Another order of Gladiators imitated the <hi>Thracians</hi> in their fights, and bearing a ſmall <hi>Parmula,</hi> or little plain <hi>Thracian</hi> ſhield, but truſting chiefly to their broad ſtrong Swords with their points turning upward, like the preſent <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Cimitars.

               <p>The City of <hi>Parma</hi> is very ancient, inhabited long ſince by the <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> then by the <hi>Boii,</hi> next by the <hi>Romans;</hi> a Colony being ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Rome</hi> about a hundred and eighty two years before the coming of our Saviour; and another in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> But upon the declining of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it ran through divers fortunes, ſerved ſometimes <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Milan,</hi> till it was conquered by Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> the ſecond, and given by <hi>Paul</hi> the third to his Son <hi>Petro Luigi Farneſe,</hi> about a hundred and thirty five years ſince, in whoſe Family it ſtill continues.</p>
               <p>It is a Delightful, Airy, well ſeated City, the Houſes being low, the Streets broad, and the River <hi>Parma</hi> running between the City and the Suburbs, both of which are well fortified with good Baſtions and a broad Ditch. It hath three handſom bridges over the River. The Duke's Palace is ſplendid, his Coaches extremely rich, his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens worth the ſeeing with the <hi>Grotto's,</hi> Fountains, Water-works, and Bows of Orange Trees. The lodgings are furniſhed with excellent pictures, veſſels of Porphyry, A gath, and Jaſpis.</p>
               <p>The Cathedral is fair and ſtately; In the <hi>Capucines</hi> Church is the tomb of <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his time, and of his Dutcheſs <hi>Maria</hi> of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Church of St. <hi>John</hi> is large, and beautiful, and adorned with the paintings of thoſe great Maſters, <hi>Corregio,</hi> and <hi>Parmegiano,</hi> and the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictin</hi> Convent adjoyning is one of the largeſt and faireſt of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This City was formerly beſieged for two years together by the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> who in hopes to make himſelf Maſter of it built another Town near to it called <hi>Victoria,</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> behaved themſelves ſo ſtoutly, that they freed themſelves, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his new Town of <hi>Victory.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Fornova.</note> From <hi>Parma</hi> we went to <hi>Fornovo</hi> ten miles from thence, ſeated upon the ſwift River <hi>Taro,</hi> and rendred remarkable by the battel gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here by <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, King of <hi>France,</hi> againſt the confederate Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in the year 1494 in hisre turn from the conqueſt of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Taro.</note> The River <hi>Taro</hi> is a remarkable River, which runs and plays about the plains, before it falls into the <hi>Po,</hi> and is very ſwift, although it be not ſtreight, but notably winding and turning. At firſt ſight I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:66078:137"/>
that it would prove a troubleſome River, when it was ſhut up between the Hills: and ſo we found it; for as ſoon as we had left the open ſpacious plain Country in which we had travelled with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from <hi>Padoa</hi> hither, and had got in between the ſpurs of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennine,</hi> and entered the <hi>Val di Taro,</hi> the valley in which this River runs, we were forced to travel many times inconveniently upon the ſides of the hills, on the right hand, and on the left; and furthermore to croſs the River it ſelf above forty times, and in one paſſage, one Gentlemans Mule fell down with him in the middle of the River; but after we came paſt <hi>Borgo di Valle</hi> the River was leſs, and we turned more to the right hand, and climbed up the <hi>Apennine</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>

                  <hi>Borgo,</hi> or <hi>Borgo di Valle</hi> is a walled Town at the upper end of this valley, upon the ſide of the hills, where we ſhew our bills of health, and where the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> keeps a Garriſon.

               <p>And indeed many of the Peaks of the <hi>Apennines</hi> are very high, and ſome of them covered with ſnow; and others are rocky, but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral they are earthy, muddy, or full of clay; whereby they ſtain and tincture the <hi>Tiber</hi> and many other Rivers which flow through them, and give an umber, brown, or dirty yellow colour to thoſe ſtreams, which being alſo for the moſt part very ſwift, the <hi>Apennine</hi> Rivers hereby loſe much of their grace and beauty, and become alſo leſs ſerviceable; and to ſpeak the truth, not navigable with any pleaſure: And this tincture which is communicated to them is of ſo deep a Dye in many places, that it is not eaſily altered or diluted, and I have ſeen divers Rivers run down from the <hi>Apennine</hi> with that force into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> that the ſtream or colour of them is perfectly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed a mile or two into the Sea, as if the Gulf of <hi>Venice</hi> were painted in thoſe places with a ſtreight yellow ſtroke for two miles together.</p>
               <p>We were told that the name of the hill which we here paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was called, <hi>The Mountain of the Holy Croſs,</hi> but the Mountain of the Croſs, <hi>La montagne de la croix,</hi> much ſpoken of in the South part of <hi>France</hi> is one of the great Hills in the maritime <hi>Alpes,</hi> in one of the paſſages from <hi>Provence</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi> The higheſt Mountain in the <hi>Apennine</hi> that I paſſed over, between <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Loretto,</hi> was Mount <hi>Soma</hi> in <hi>

But this Mountain of the Holy Croſs is not rocky but all green, and it being the latter end of <hi>April</hi> we deſcended with eaſe and pleaſure, and a good part of the way upon the graſs, till we came to the Sea-ſide in the Evening, to <hi>Seſtri</hi> or <hi>Sestro</hi> called by <hi>Daute</hi> in his Purgatory, <hi>Siſteri,</hi> formerly <hi>Segeſta,</hi> at preſent <hi>Seſtri di Levante,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Seſtri di ponente,</hi> between <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Savona:</hi> for the whole Coaſt of <hi>Genoa</hi> being divided into the Eaſt and the Weſt, that which lyes between <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Legorn</hi> is called <hi>La Riviera di Levante,</hi> and that between <hi>Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Provence, La Riviera di Ponente.</hi>
