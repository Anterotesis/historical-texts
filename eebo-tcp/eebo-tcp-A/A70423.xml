            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>PRag.</speaker>
               <p>Well and what is become of your <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> now I trow, your great <hi>Goliah L'Eſtrange,</hi> and your ſo much Idolized <hi>Diana?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>Very wel; and is this all you can ſay? no leſs than a Gyant and a Goddeſs both in a breath? could not you have ſaid your <hi>Gogmagog</hi> and your <hi>Pentheſilea</hi> Queen of the <hi>Amazons?</hi> it would have done every whit as well, and have made a more noble ſound, but that ſuch hard names might have chanced to have ſtuck in your Throat and choaked you. But pray tell me Mr. <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> what makes you ſo inquiſitive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93124:3"/>
after <hi>L'Eſtrange?</hi> I ſhall ſhrewdly ſuſpect you are the man that ſent out the Hue and Cry after him, unleſs you give me very good reaſons to believe the contrary.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>No really not I: But I hear there is one gone out after him, but cannot overtake him, and I cannot imagine why it ſhould not, unleſs you have ſent him away Poſt upon <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> or ſwept him into a corner with your Broom amongſt your refuſe ſtuffe. Tis great pity a man of parts as he is ſhould ly ſculking about at this rate, and not dare to ſhow his head. I fancy he looks very pleaſantly upon it, and dare ſwear a Cut of him in the preſent poſture he is in would ſell rarely well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>Come leave off your ſilly ſcoffs, and witleſs reproaches, and let us know what is the quarrel you have againſt <hi>L'Eſtrange.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>Quarrel quoth he? Why he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and is not that Quarrel enough in all Conſcience? and you deſerve to be called in queſtion, if you take his part, or maintain that he is not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo,</speaker>
               <p>So, very good ſtill. Then I perceive it is become now as criminal to ſpeak well of <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> as to drink the Dukes Health, and all becauſe one is ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſo. But pray tell me one thing, ſuppoſing, though not granting <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> may not a man for all that ſpeak in his behalf, <hi>quatenus</hi> an honeſt man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93124:3"/>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>That is a good one: An honeſt <hi>Papiſt?</hi> who ere heard of that before? no let me tell you, it is an abſurdity, nay an utter impoſſibility. An honeſt man perhaps may be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but a <hi>Papiſt</hi> can never be an honeſt man: and there is the ſhort and the long of the buſineſs pithily delivered in few words.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>All pith I confeſs, and no ſap. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour is this learned and nice diſtinction your own, or did you borrow it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>No matter for that. I ſay ſtill the <hi>Papiſt L'Eſtrange</hi> is a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and whoſoever ſpeaks a good word of him is a Popeling, an Abettor of the Diabolical party, and an ill Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths man. And if you ſay the Dukes Health may be drank; I affirm that ſuch an aſſertion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Liberty of the Subject, as much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Right of Petitioning, and therefore as a filthy, abominable and ſuperſtitious thing ought to be laid aſide.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>Acutely argued. I perceive by this you are a man of parts and perhaps can give me the reaſon (which I confeſs I never heard yet) why you think <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is a <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>What need of any Reaſon, when all the Town and Country ſay ſo? ſure their words may be taken without any farther Reaſon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore you believe him to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> becauſe he is generally reported one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93124:4"/>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>Yes marry do I: and every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to do the like.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>I always thought that every mans own perſuaſion and practice had made him of this or that Religion, and not anothers ſaying ſo: But it ſeems you think otherwiſe, and <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> muſt needs be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> becauſe the people vote him one: then I ſay, according to your way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> they ought to be puniſhed for being acceſſary to his being ſuch, for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he was none before they talked him into it, What have you to ſay to this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>Ay but it is ſworn againſt him (they ſay) that he is one, and ſure that will ſerve your turn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed this has prevented me from asking you one queſtion, which was, how the Town and Country, which you ſay generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ſhould come to know ſo much, unleſs he had declared it to them himſelf, and given a Certificate under his own hand to put the matter out of diſpute, for his publick Profeſſion has all along ſpoken the quite contrary. But now I underſtand that the ground which you or they have to believe him a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is only becauſe ſuch and ſuch have ſworn againſt him that he is one. Doth their ſwearing then make him a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> whether in his own Opinion he be ſo really or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93124:4"/>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay if they ſwear he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I am bound to believe it: and if they ſhould do as much for you I would endeavor to have you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>I grant you that then in the Eye of the Law he is one, for that proceeds and judges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Teſtimony given upon Oath: but this is not the buſineſs in Diſpute. I would fain know whether any impartial perſon (theſe Oaths that you ſpeak of notwithſtanding) may not, all circumſtances well conſidered, ſtill conclude that <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is all this while an honeſt man, and a true Son of the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all: for I tell you, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it be given upon Oath that he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> I dare pawn my life that he is one, and I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the teſtimony to come from ſuch well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, and true Lovers of the Church, that I dare ſafely ſwear the ſame my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>Very pretty: but what if two or three well meaning malicious fellows ſhould ſwear that you was in the Plot, would you therefore be ſuch a fool to belive it, and ſwear the ſame, and ſo e'ne be fairly truſſed up for your pains.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>Why no, the caſe is altered then: And I would ſay, that they were a company of Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, that ſhould ſwear I was in the Plot, when I know no more of it than the child that is unborn: beſides, what need I care? I am clear enough, ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93124:5"/>
long as my Conſcience plainly tells me that I have no hand in it:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>So, then the Kings Evidence it ſeems may be a company of Raſcals, if they ſhould chance to depoſe any thing againſt you, when in the mean time whatſoever is ſaid or ſworn againſt another man paſſeth with you for an Oracle. This is very fine is it not? but may not another mans Conſcience give theſe bold ſwearers the ly as well as yours can do? and will you not allow poor <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> the liberty to make uſe of the ſame Plea which you would your ſelf? This is very hard meaſure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prag.</speaker>
               <p>How can that be, when his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and uſes to go to Maſs? if he would but have dealt ingenuouſly, he might have gone to the Council, and informed againſt himſelf, without putting any body elſe to the trouble of doing it.</p>

When the Pope ſends Emiſſaries into <hi>England</hi> to promote the <hi>Catholic Cauſe,</hi> perhaps he may allow them to make uſe of ſome Pious Frauds the better to carry on their deſigns, and when ſome of them have the honour to die Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs at <hi>Tyburn</hi> with a lye in their mouths, then goes the common cry, that they have the Popes Diſpenſations and Abſolutions to lick all whole again: and granting this to be ſo, nay and more than that, that <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> had a Diſpenſation too, what great harm would it do, ſo long as it is only to preſerve his Allegiance and approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf true and faithful to his Church, King and Country?</p>

               <p>Ay but theſe confounded Diſpenſations are of a ſtrange nature, for I have heard that by the ſtrength of one of them a man may come to our Church, wear a Peruque and a Sword by his ſide, flatter and fawn upon the King, and cry God bleſs your Majeſty, I wiſh you a long and proſperous Reign, and then Stab or Poiſon him at the firſt opportunity, and yet for all at laſt go to Heaven in a ſtring.

               <p>That does not ſignifie a ruſh: for I tell you that plaguy Diſpenſation, (would it was hanged) has done more miſchief to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than all the <hi>French</hi> Kings Garlick Eaters would do if they ſhould come over: For they ſay Prieſts and Jeſuites cannot marry, but I'le warrant they may upon a good account, and therefore I ſay ſtill, for ought I know <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> may be a Jeſuite, though he is a married man, and no <hi>Papiſt</hi> neither as you ſay: And that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a blind, a mere blind.</p>

               <p>Theſe are bloody things you lay to their charge, and perhaps ſome of them may be true; and for avoiding contention we will grant them all to be ſo for once, whether they be or no; but don't you think the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were the Contrivers, the Plotters, or the Authors (call them which you will) of the laſt great Plague among us too?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That I will. Why look you now, if you could get a Painter to draw a company of ill looked fellows with Bags of Gun-power and Piſtols in one hand, and Daggers and long Knives in the other, that would be the very Picture of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>

               <p>This is the notion then I perceive you have of them: but you forget to deſcribe their Religion: Do you think they are Chriſtians or no?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>All proof would be needleſs to a man of underſtanding: But firſt, I'le take it for granted that ours is but a Reformed Church; and wherever there is a Reformation, there muſt be ſuppoſed ſome Errors and Abuſes which were to be Reformed.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Abuſes were and are ſtill in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which no more hinder it from being a Chriſtian Church (though groſly corrupted) than a company of Boils and Sores ſhould make you ceaſe to be a man (though an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm one) The caſe then is thus; ſhould ſome of theſe Boils and Botches, which I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93124:9"/>
to be in your Body, be cured and done away, that part which had them may be ſaid to be whole again: ſo our Church of <hi>England</hi> being but part of the Catholic Church was once infected with thoſe abominable impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and foul Diſeaſes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now labours under, from which being cleanſed, and purged, it became a pure Church, ſound and healthful, whilſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> remains tainted at this day. And ſo you your ſelf being (as you would make me believe you are) a true Proteſtant, are neither better nor worſe than (be not ſtarted at the word) a Reformed <hi>Papiſt</hi> by derivation from your Anceſtours. This I hope will convince you that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are neither Dogs nor Cats, Wolves, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, nor fiery Serpents, but men like you and I, and Chriſtians too, but not ſo good as they ought to be, nor as it is wiſhed they were.</p>

               <p>And ſo ſome impudent malicious Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals call him Hang-Dog, and Towzer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do you therefore think in your Conſcience, that he is either a Bull-Dog, Spaniel, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel or the like? I have not much time to talk with you about this matter, but will only tell you in few words, that <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is yet a true and ſincere Proteſtant notwithſtanding all the trifling Reaſons that you or any one elſe could ever yet bring againſt him. We are not to make ill concluſions from the preſent misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the manner, frame, unreaſonable and uncharitable conjectures and ſurmiſes, from his abſconding for a time, which may be for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to himſelf, and not ſo fit to be known to his Enemies: but I hope it will not be long ere he will return with a Whip and a Bell to laſh theſe barking Curs, that durſt hardly ſnarl or grin whilſt he ſhowed his Face. Tis ſure there was never a more impudent and brazen-faced Age, than this we live in, when the beſt men ſhall be aſperſed with fouleſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and the beſt Proteſtants, the Biſhops themſelves not paſſing ſcot-free, be branded with the odious names of <hi>Papiſts</hi> for being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for their King and Countries good. It is to be wiſhed that we could once ſee a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93124:10"/>
in our manners inſtead of ſeeking one continually in our Religion. And then we ſhould let Proteſtants be Proteſtants ſtill, and <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> might live quietly without having the imputation of Popery belched out upon him through every poiſonous and malicious throat.
