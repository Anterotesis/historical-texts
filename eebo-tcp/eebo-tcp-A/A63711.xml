            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHen Judges were instead of
Kings, and <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas</hi>
were among the Priests,
every man did what was right
in his own eyes, but few did
what was pleasing in the eyes of the Lord;
and the event was this, God put on his fierce
anger against them, and stirr'd up and arm'd
the Enemies of their Country and Religion,
and they prevail'd very farre, against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
and confidence of them who thought
the goodness of their cause would have born
out the iniquity of their persons, and that the
impiety of their adversaries would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
them even from being made Gods scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and instruments of punishing his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
The sadness of the event proved the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their hopes; for that which was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of their worship, the determination
of their religious addresses, the place where
God did meet his people, from which the
Priests spake to God, and God gave his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
that they dishonourably and miserably
lost: The ark of the Lord was taken, the
impious Priests (who made the Sacrifice of
<pb facs="tcp:115790:5"/>
the Lord to become an abomination to the
people) were slain with the sword of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,
old <hi>Eli</hi> lost his life, and the wife of
<hi>Phinehas</hi> died with sorrow, and the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of childbirth, crying out, That the
Glory was departed from <hi>Israel,</hi> because the
Ark of God was taken.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In these things we also have been but
too like the sons of <hi>Israel;</hi> for when we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as greatly, we also have groaned under
as great and sad a calamity. For we have
not onely felt the evils of an intestine Warre,
but God hath smitten us in our spirit, and
laid the scene of his judgements especially in
Religion; he hath snuffed our lamp so near,
that it is almost extinguished, and the sacred
fire was put into a hole of the earth, even
then when we were forced to light those ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that stood upon our Altars, that by this
sad truth better then by the old ceremony we
might prove our succession to those holy men
who were constrained to sing hymnes to Christ
in dark places and retirements.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But I delight not to observe the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencies
of such sad accidents, which as
they may happen upon divers causes, or may
be forc'd violently by the strength of fancy, or
driven on by jealousy, and the too fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb facs="tcp:115790:5"/>
of troubled hearts and afflicted spirits;
so they doe but help to vex the offending part,
and relieve the afflicted but with a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick
and groundless comfort: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deny leave to my own affections to ease
themselves by complaining of others: I shall
onely crave leave that I may remember <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
and call to minde the pleasures of the
Temple, the order of her services, the beauty
of her buildings, the sweetness of her songs,
the decency of her Ministrations, the assiduity
and Oeconomy of her Priests and Levites, the
daily sacrifice, and that eternal fire of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that went not out by day nor by night;
these were the pleasures of our peace, and
there is a remanent felicity in the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of those spiritual delights which we then
enjoyed as antepasts of heaven, and consigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to an immortality of joyes. And it may
be so again when it shall please God who hath
the hearts of all Princes in his hand, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them as the rivers of waters; and when
men will consider the invaluable loss that is
consequent, and the danger of sin that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
to the destroying such forms of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and devotion in which God was purely
worshipped, and the Church was edified, and
the people instructed to great degrees of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
knowledge, and devotion.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:6"/>4. And such is the Liturgy of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> I shall not need to enumerate
the advantages of Liturgy in general, though
it be certain that some <hi>Liturgy</hi> or other is
most necessary in publick addresses, that so we
may imitate the perpetual practice of all set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Churches since Christianity, or ever since
<hi>Moses</hi> Law or the Jewish Church came to
have a setled foot, and any rest in the land
of <hi>Canaan.</hi> [2.] That we may follow the
example, and obey the precept of our blessed
Saviour, who appointed a set form of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(and certainly they that profess enmity
against all Liturgy can in no sense obey the
precept given by him who gave command,
When ye pray, say, <hi>Our Father.</hi> [3.] That
all that come may know the condition of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Communion, their Religion, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of address to God Almighty. [4.] That
the truth of the proposition, the piety of the
desires, and the honesty of the petitions, the
simplicity of our purposes, and the justice of
our designs may be secured before-hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Whatsoever is not of faith is sin (and it
is impossible that we should pray to God in the
<hi>extempore</hi> prayers of the Priest, by any faith
but unreasonable, unwarranted, insecure and
implicit.) [5.] That there may be union of
hearts, and spirits, and tongues. [6.] That
there may be a publick symbol of Communion
<pb facs="tcp:115790:6"/>
in our prayers, which are the best instruments
of endearing us to God, and to one another;
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Private prayer
not assisted with the concord and unity of a
publick spirit is weaker and less effectual,
saith S. <hi>Basil.</hi> [7.] That the Ministers less
learned may have provisions of devotions
made for them. [8.] That the more learned
may have no occasion of ostentation ministred
to them, lest their best actions, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
be turned into sin. [9.] That extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
levities, and secret impieties be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
[10.] That the offices Ecclesiastical may
the better secure the articles of Religion.
[11.] That they may edify the people by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repositories of holy and necessary truths
ready form'd out of their needs, and descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in their Books of daily use; for that was
one of the advices of the Apostle, <hi>teaching
and admonishing one another in</hi> Psalms,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
               <hi>and</hi> hymns, <hi>and</hi> spiritual songs. [12.] That
men by the intervening of authority may be
engaged to certain devotions. [13.] That
not onely the duty, but the very form of its
ministration may be honoured by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of authority, and not be exposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
by reason of the insufficiency of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
warrant. [14.] That the assignation of
such offices, &amp; appropriating them to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
<pb facs="tcp:115790:7"/>
of certain persons may be a cancel to
secure the inclosures of the Clerical orders
from the usurpings and invasions of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and unhallowed spirits, [15.] That
indetermination of the office may not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
indifferency, nor indifferency lead in a
freer liberty, or liberty degenerate into licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,
or licentiousness into folly, and
vanity; and these come sometime attended
with secular designs, lest these be cursed with
the immission of a peevish spirit upon our
Priests, and that spirit be a teacher of lies, and
these lies become the basis of impious theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes,
which are certainly attended with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
lives; and then either Atheism or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism
may come, according as shall
happen in the conjunction of time and other
circumstances; for this would be a sad climax,
a ladder upon which are no Angels ascending
or descending, because the degrees lead to
darkness and misery.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But that which is of special concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this, that the Liturgy of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> hath advantages so many and
so considerable as not onely to raise it self
above the devotions of other Churches, but
to endear the affections of good people to be in
love with Liturgy in general.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:7"/>6. For to the Churches of the Romane
Communion we can say that ours is reformed,
to the reformed Churches we can say that ours
is orderly and decent; for we were freed from
the impositions and lasting errours of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
spirit, and yet from the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of a popular spirit too: our reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was done without tumult, and yet we saw
it necessary to reform; we were zealous to cast
away the old errours, but our zeal was balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with consideration and the results of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
Not like women or children when
they are affrighted with fire in their clothes;
we shak'd off the cole indeed, but not our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
lest we should have exposed our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to that nakedness which the excellent
men of our sister Churches complained to be
among themselves.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And indeed it is no small advantage to
our Liturgy, that it was the off-spring of all
that authority which was to prescribe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion. The king and the Priest,
which are the <hi>Antistites Religionis,</hi> and the
preservers of both the Tables joyn'd in this
work, and the people as it was represented in
Parliament were advised withal, in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
the form after much deliberation; for
the Rule, <hi>Quod spectat ad omnes ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
tractari debet,</hi> was here observed with
<pb facs="tcp:115790:8"/>
strictness, and then as it had the advantages
of discourse, so also of authorities, its reason
from one and its sanction from the other,
that it might be both reasonable and sacred
and free, not onely from the indiscretions, but
(which is very considerable) from the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of popularity.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And in this I cannot but observe the
great wisdome and mercy of God in directing
the contrivers of the Liturgy with the spirit
of zeal and prudence, to allay the furies and
heats of the first affrightment. For when
men are in danger of burning, so they leap
from the flames, they consider not whither but
whence: and the first reflections of a crooked
tree are not to straightness, but to a contrary
incurvation, yet it pleased the Spirit of God
so to temper and direct their spirits, that in
the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> they did
rather retain something that needed further
consideration, then reject any thing that was
certainly pious and holy; and in the second
Liturgy, that they might also throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
they did rather cast out something that
might with good profit have remained, then
not satisfy the world of their zeal to reform,
of their charity in declining every thing that
was offensive, and the clearness of their light
in discerning every semblance of errour or
<pb facs="tcp:115790:8"/>
suspicion in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The truth is, although they fram'd the
Liturgy with the greatest consideration that
could be, by all the united wisdome of this
Church and State, yet as if Prophetically to
avoid their being charg'd in after ages with
a <hi>crepusculum</hi> of Religion, a dark, twilight,
imperfect Reformation, they joyn'd to their
own starre all the shining tapers of the other
reformed Churches, calling for the advice of
the most eminently learned and zealous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
in other Kingdomes, that the light
of all together might shew them a clear path
to walk in. And this their care produced some
change; for upon the consultation the first
form of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Service-book was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
with the exception of a very few
clauses, which upon that occasion were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd
and expung'd, till it came to that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
form and modest beauty it was in the
Edition of <hi>M D L II,</hi> and which <hi>Gilbertus</hi>
a German approved of as a transcript of the
ancient and primitive forms.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It was necessary for them to stay some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>where.
Christendome was not onely reformed,
but divided too, and every division would to
all ages have called for some alteration, or
else have disliked it publickly; and since all
that cast off the <hi>Romane</hi> yoke, thought they
<pb facs="tcp:115790:9"/>
had title enough to be called Reformed, it
was hard to have pleased all the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
and peevishness of men that called
themselves friends, and therefore that onely
in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
against the word of God, or innovated
against Apostolical tradition, all that was
par'd away. But at last she fix'd, and strove
no further to please the people, who never
could be satisfied.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Painter that exposed his work to
the censure of the common passengers, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to mend it as long as any man could
finde fault, at last had brought the eyes to the
ears and the ears to the neck, and for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
subscrib'd, <hi>Hanc populus fecit.</hi> But his
<hi>[Hanc ego]</hi> that which he made by the rules
of art, and the advice of men skill'd in the
same mystery was the better peece. The
Church of <hi>England</hi> should have par'd away
all the Canon of the Communion, if she had
mended her peece at the prescription of the
<hi>Zuinglians;</hi> and all her office of Baptism, if
she had mended by the rules of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
and kept up Altars still by the example
of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and not have retain'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
by the good will of the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> and
now another new light is sprung up, she should
have no Liturgy at all, but the worship of
<pb facs="tcp:115790:9"/>
God be left to the managing of chance, and
indeliberation, and a petulant fancy.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It began early to discover its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience;
for when certain zealous persons
fled to <hi>Frankford</hi> to avoid the funeral piles
kindled by the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> time, as if they had not enemies
enough abroad they fell foul with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the quarrel was about the Common
Prayer Book, and some of them made their
appeal to the judgement of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom
they prepossessed with strange representments,
and troubled phantasms concerning it, and
yet the worst he said upon the provocation of
those prejudices was that even its vanities
were tolerable. <hi>Tolerabiles ineptias</hi> was the
unhandsome Epithete he gave to some things
which he was forc'd to dislike by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earnest
complying with the Brethren of
<hi>Frankford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Well! upon this the wisdome of this
Church &amp; State saw it necessary to fixe where
with advice she had begun, and with counsel
she had once mended. And to have altered in
things inconsiderable upon a new design or
sullen mislike, had been extreme levity, and
apt to have made the men contemptible, their
authority slighted, and the thing ridiculous,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:10"/>
especially before adversaries, that watch'd all
opportunity and appearances to have disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Reformation. Here therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Law, was established by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
was made solemne by an appendant
penalty, against all that on either hand did
prevaricate a sanction of so long and so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
consideration.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But the Common Prayer-book had the
fate of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for when it had scap'd the
storms of the <hi>Romane</hi> Sea, yet a viper sprung
out of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> fires, which at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
first leap'd upon the hand of the Church,
but since that time it hath gnawn the bowels
of its own Mother, and given it self life by
the death of its Parent and Nurse.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For as for the Adversaries from the
<hi>Romane</hi> party, they were so convinc'd by the
piety and innocence of the Common Prayer-Book,
that they could accuse it of no deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but of imperfection, of a want of some
things which they judged convenient, because
the error had a wrinckle on it and the face of
antiquity. And therefore for ten or eleven
years they came to our Churches, joyn'd in
our devotions, and communicated without
scruple, till a temporal interest of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> rent the Schism wider, and made
<pb facs="tcp:115790:10"/>
it gape like the jaws of the grave.</p>
            <p>And let me say, it addes no small degree
to my confidence and opinion of the <hi>English</hi>
Common Prayer-Book, that amongst the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Armies sent from the <hi>Romane</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,
(who were curious enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
able enough to finde out, and wanted
no anger to have made them charge home any
errour in our Liturgy, if the matter had not
been unblameable, and the composition excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent)
there was never any impiety or heresy
charg'd upon the Liturgy of the Church;
(for I reckon not the calumnies of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
for they were onely in general, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it <hi>[Darkness, &amp;c.]</hi> from which asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it was worthily vindicated by M. <hi>Dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>)
The truth of it is, the Compilers
took that course which was sufficient to have
secur'd it against the malice of a <hi>Spanish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor,
or the scrutiny of a more inquisitive
Presbytery, for they put nothing of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
into their prayers, nothing that was
then matter of question; onely because they
could not prophecy, they put in some things
which since then have been called to question,
by persons whose interest was highly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to finde fault with something. But that
also hath been the fate of the Penmen of holy
Scripture, some of which could prophecy, and
yet could not prevent this. But I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb facs="tcp:115790:11"/>
that any man was ever put to it to
justify the Common Prayer against any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
publick, and professed charge by a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Adversary: Nay, it is transmitted to
us by the testimony of persons greater then all
exceptions, that <hi>Paulus 4<hi rend="sup">t•s</hi>
               </hi> in his private
entercourses and Letters to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
did offer to confirm the <hi>English</hi> Common
Prayer Book,<note place="margin">Tortura Torti P. 142.</note> if she would acknowledge his
Primacy and authority, and the Reformation
derivative from him. And this lenity was
pursued by his Successor <hi>Pius 4<hi rend="sup">tus</hi>,</hi> with an
<hi>[omnia de nobis tibi polliceare]</hi> he assured
her she should have any thing from him,<note place="margin">Cambd. Annal. A. D. 1560.</note> not
onely things pertaining to her soul, but what
might conduce to the establishment and
confirmation of her Royal Dignity;
amongst which, that the Liturgy newly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by her authority should not be rescin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Popes power, was not the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And possibly this hath cast a cloud
upon it in the eyes of such persons who never
will keep charity or so much as civility but
with those with whom they have made a
league offensive and defensive against all the
world. This hath made it to be suspected of
too much complianc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with that Church, and
her Offices of devotion, and that it is a very
<pb facs="tcp:115790:11"/>
               <hi>Cento</hi> composed out of the Mass Book, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,
Breviaries, Manuals, and Portuises
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="17">17. I cannot say but many of our Prayers
are also in the <hi>Romane</hi> Offices. But so they
are also in the Scripture, so also is the Lords
Prayer, and if they were not, yet the allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is very inartificial, and the charge pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
and unreasonable, unless there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
good in the <hi>Romane</hi> Books, or that it
were unlawful to pray a good prayer which
they had once stain'd with red letters. The
Objection hath not sense enough to procure
an answer upon its own stock, but by reflection
from a direct truth, which uses to be like
light manifesting it self and discovering
darkness.</p>
            <p n="18">18. It was first perfected in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the sixths time, but it was by and by
impugned <hi>through the obstinate &amp; dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
malice of many:</hi> They are the words
of M. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of Martyrs. Then it
was reviewed and published with so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
that it was accounted the work of
God; but yet not long after there were some
persons <hi>qui divisionis occasionem arripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebant</hi>
(saith <hi>Alesius) vocabula &amp; penè syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labas
expendendo,</hi> they tried it by points and
<pb facs="tcp:115790:12"/>
syllables, and weighed every word, and sought
occasions to quarrel, which being observed by
Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> he caused it to be
translated into Latine and sent it to <hi>Bucer,</hi>
requiring his judgement of it, who returned
this answer, That although there are in it
some things <hi>quae rapi possunt ab inquietis
ad materiam contentionis,</hi> which by peevish
men may be cavill'd at, yet there was nothing
in it but what was taken out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
or agreeable to it, if rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
that is, if handled and read by wise
and good men. The zeal which Archbishop
<hi>Grindal,</hi> Bishop <hi>Ridly,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Taylor,</hi> and other
the holy Martyrs and Confessors in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> time expressed for this excellent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
before and at the time of their death,
defending it by their disputations, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it by their practice, and sealing it
with their blouds, are arguments which ought
to recommend it to all the sons of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> for ever, infinitely to be valued
beyond all the little whispers and murmurs
of argument pretended against it: and when
it came out of the flame, and was purified in
the Martyrs fires, it became a vessell of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and used in the house of God in all the
days of that long peace which was the effect
of Gods blessing, and the reward (as we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hope) of an holy Religion, and when it
<pb facs="tcp:115790:12"/>
was laid aside in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it
was <hi>[to the great decay of the due honour
of God, and discomfort to the Professors
of the truth of Christs Religion]</hi> they are
the words of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her grave
and wise Parliament.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> in his purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
A. D. <hi>1553.</hi> made an offer if the Queen
would give him leave, to prove All that is
contained in the Common Prayer Book, to be
conformable to that order which our blessed
Saviour Christ did both observe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to be observed. And a little after he
offers to joyn issue upon this point, That the
Order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> set out by
authority of the innocent and godly Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, in his high Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
is the same that was used in the
Church fifteen hundred years past.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And I shall go near to make his words
good. For, very much of our Liturgy is the
very words of Scriptures. The Psalms and
Lessons, and all the Hymnes save one, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but Scripture, and owe nothing to
the Romane Breviaries for their production
or authority. So that the matter of them is
out of question holy and true; As for the
form, none ever misliked it but they that will
<pb facs="tcp:115790:13"/>
admit no form, for all admit this that admit
any. But that these should be parts of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
needs not to be a question, when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the Princes made it a
Law to their Church to sing praises to the
Lord with the words of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.</note> and of <hi>Asaph</hi>
the Seer, and that Christ himself did so and
his Apostles after the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> in
the Feast of Passeover, sung their Hymnes
and portions of the great Allelujah in the
words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> the Seer too,<note place="margin">Apoc. 15. Exod. 15. Psal. 145. Jer. 10. 6,7.</note> and
that there was a song in heaven made up of
the words of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi>
the Seer, and that the Apostles and the
Church of God always chose to doe so, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the commandment of the Apostle, that
we sing Psalms and Hymnes to God. I know
not where we can have better then the Psalms
of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and these were ready
at hand for the use of the Church, insomuch
that in the Christian Synaxes, particularly
in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> observed
that <hi>every man had a Psalm,</hi> it was then the
common devotion, and Liturgy of all the
faithful, and so for ever; and the Fathers of
the fourth Councel of <hi>Toledo</hi> justify the
practice of the Church in recitation of the
Psalms and Hymnes by the example of Christ
and his Apostles, who after Supper sung a
Psalm: and the Church did also make
<pb facs="tcp:115790:13"/>
hymns of her own, in the honour of Christ
&amp; sung them: Such as was the <hi>[Te Deum]</hi>
made by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and
they stood her in great stead, not onely as acts
of direct worship to Christ, but as Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the articles of Christs Divinity, of
which the Fathers made use against the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
<hi>Artemon,</hi> as appears in <hi>Eusebius lib.
5. cap. 28. Eccles. Hist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>That reading the Scripture was part
of the Liturgy of the Apostolical ages, we
finde it in the tenth Canon of the Apostles, in</hi>
Albinus Flaccus, Rabanus Maurus <hi>and in
the Liturgy attributed to S.</hi> James. Deinde
leguntur fusissimè oracula sacra veteris Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamenti
&amp; Prophetarum, &amp; Filii Dei In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatio

ex mortuis, ascensus in Coelum, secundus
item adventus ejus cum gloria. Atque id
fit singulis diebus, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="22">22. So that since thus farre the matter of
our devotions is warranted by Gods Spirit,
and the form by the precedents of Scripture
too, and the ages Apostolical, above half of
the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy is as Divine as Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it self, and the choice of it for practice
is no less then Apostolical.</p>
            <p n="23">
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:14"/>23. Of the same consideration is the Lords
Prayer, commanded by our blessed Saviour in
two Evangelists; the <hi>Introit</hi> is the <hi>Psal. 95.</hi>
and the Responsories of Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Prayer, ejaculations taken from the
words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
recited in the Communion is the ten
words of <hi>Moses,</hi> and without peradventure
was not taken into the Office in imitation of
the <hi>Romane;</hi> for although it was done upon
great reason, and considering the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the people they were to inform, yet I
think it was never in any Church Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but in Manuals and Catechisms onely:
yet they are made Liturgick by the suffrages
at the end of every Commandement, and need
no other warrant from antiquity but the
<hi>20.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi> There are not many
parts beside, and they which are, derive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from an elder house then the <hi>Romane</hi>
Offices; The <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> was composed by
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, the latter Versicle by
S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> though some eminently learned
(and in particular) <hi>Baronius</hi> is of an opinion
that it was much more ancient. It was at
first a confession of faith, and used by a newly
baptized Convert and the standers by, and
then it came to be a Hymne, and very early
annexed to the Antiphones, and afterwards
to the Psalms and Hymnes, all except that of
<pb facs="tcp:115790:14"/>
S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> beginning with <hi>[Te Deum]</hi>
because that of it self is a great Doxology. It
is seven times used in the Greek Office of
Baptism, and in the recitation of it the Priest
and people stood all up and turned to the East,
and this custome ever continued in the
Church, and is still retained in the Church of
<hi>England</hi> in conformity to the ancient and
Primitive custome, save onely that in the
Let any we kneel, which is a more humble po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
but not so ancient, the Letanies having
usually been said walking, not kneeling or
standing. But in this the variety is an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Churches garment. S. <hi>Gregory</hi>
added this Doxology to the Responsory at the
beginning of prayer, after, <hi>O Lord make
hast to help us;</hi> That was the last, and yet
above a thousand years old, and much elder
then the body of Popery. And as for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the Doxology, I am clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that though it might by S. <hi>Hierome</hi> be
brought into the Latine Church, yet it was
in the Greek Church before him, witness that
most ancient Hymne or Doxology, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
However, as to the matter
of the Doxology, it is no other then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the three most blessed persons of the
Trinity which Christ commanded, and which
<pb facs="tcp:115790:15"/>
with greatest solemnity we declare in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
and certainly we can no ways better,
or more solemnly and ritually give glory
to the Holy Trinity, then by being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into the profession and service of it. The
<hi>Trisagion</hi> was taught to the <hi>Greek</hi> Church
by Angels; but certain it is, it sprang not
from a <hi>Romane</hi> fountain; and that the
Canon of our Communion <hi>is the same</hi> with
the old Canon of the Church many hundred
years before Popery had invaded the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Christian Religion, is evident, if we
compare the particulars recited by S.<note n="a" place="bottom">De Spir. sanct. c. 27.</note>

Church, in the Office of Communion, beside
that it is nothing but a plain execution of an

us to pray for all men, but addes by

unchristian, and heathen in all the world.

            <p n="26">26. I shall not need to make any excuses
for the Churches reading those portions of
Scripture which we call Epistles and Gospels
before the Communion. They are Scriptures
of the choicest, and most profitable transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And let me observe this thing, That they
are not onely declarations of all the mysteries
of our redemption, and rules of good life, but
this choice is of the greatest compliance with
the necessities of the Christian Church that
can be imagined. For if we deny to the people
a liberty of reading Scriptures, may they not
complain as <hi>Isaac</hi> did against the inhabitants
of the land, that the Philistines had spoiled
his well, and the fountains of living water;
If a free use to all of them, and of all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were permitted, should not the Church
her self have more cause to complain of the
infinite licentiousness and loosness of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
and of the commencement of ten
thousand errours, which would certainly be
consequent to such permission? Reason and
Religion will chide us in the first, reason and
<pb facs="tcp:115790:17"/>
experience in the latter. And can the wit of
man conceive a better temper and expedient,
then that such Scriptures onely or principally
should be laid before them all in daily Offices,
which contain in them all the mysteries of
our redemption, and all the rules of good life?
which two things are done by the Gospels, and
Epistles respectively: the first being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of the life and death of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
the latter, instructions for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Church, in pious and Christian
conversation; and all this was done with so
much choice, that as obscure places are avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by design, as much as could be, so the
very assignation of them to certain festivals,
the appropriation of them to solemn and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
days does entertain the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the people with notions proper to the
mystery, and distinct from impertinent and
vexatious questions. And were this design
made something more minute, and applicable
to the various necessities of times, and such
choice Scriptures permitted indifferently,
which might be matter of necessity and great
edification, the people of the Church would
have no reason to complain that the fountains
of our Saviour were stopp'd from them, nor
the Rulers of the Church, that the mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Scripture were abused by the petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
of the people to consequents harsh, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:17"/>
and unreasonable in despight of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in exauctoration of the power of
superiours, or for the commencement of
schisms and heresies. The Church with great
wisdome hath first held this torch out, and
though for great reasons intervening and
hindering, it cannot be reduced to practice,
yet the Church hath shewn her desire to avoid
the evil that is on both hands, and she hath
shewn the way also, if it could have been insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in. But however, this choice of the more
remarkable portions of Scripture is so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and proportionable to the nature of the
thing, that because the Gospels and Epistles
bear their several shares of the design, (the
Gospel representing the foundation, and
prime necessities of Christianity, and the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
parts of our Redemption, the summe,
the faith, and the hopes of Christianity)
therefore it is attested by a ceremony of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, it being a part of the confession of
faith: but the Epistles containing super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures
upon that foundation, are read with
religious care, but not made formal or solemn
by any other circumstance. The matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in it sufficient of reason and of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but nothing of necessity, except it be by
accident, and as authority does intervene by
way of sanction.</p>
            <p n="27">
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:18"/>27. But that this reading of Epistles and
Gospels before the Communion was one of the
earliest customes of the Church, I finde it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Rabanus Maurus. Sed enim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itio
mos iste cantandi non erat,<note place="margin">Institut. Cleric. l. 1. c. 32.</note> qui nunc in
Ecclesia ante sacrificium celebratur: Sed
tamen epistolae Pauli recitabantur &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
Euangelium.</hi> The custome of reading
S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and the holy Gospel before
the Sacrament was from the beginning.
Some other portions of Scripture were read
upon emergent occasions instead of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
which still retain the name of Epistle,
but it is so seldome, that it happens upon two
Sundays onely in the year, upon <hi>Trinity</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
and the <hi>25.</hi> Sunday after; upon Saints
days it happens oftner, because the story re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a particular rememoration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is very often taken out of the Acts of the
Apostles, but being in substitution onely of
the ordinary portion of the Epistle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
or other the Apostles, it keeps the name of the
first design, though the change be upon good
reason, and much propriety.</p>
            <p n="28">28. There remains now nothing but the
Let any and Collects to be accounted for: for
the matter of which I shall need to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because the Objections whatsoever
have been against them are extremely low,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:18"/>
and rather like the intemperate talk of an
angry child, then pressures of reason or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
excepting where they are charg'd
with their vertues, for their charity in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for all men, for their humility in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
such a worthlesness in our
selves, as not to dare to ask our petitions
upon our own confidences. These things fall
like water against a rock, or like the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against our blessed Saviour, the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of them splits themselves.</p>

with them. However, although Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
may differ in assigning these several
words to their proper, minute, and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
signification, yet it is most clear, that
they mean not prayers distinct, and made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
by the variety of matter, but several
addresses differing onely in <hi>modo orandi,</hi> and
therefore by these are intended the several
<pb facs="tcp:115790:19"/>
forms of prayer and supplication: and the
Church hath at all times used prayers of all
variety, long and short, ejaculatory, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and solemn. And the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
understood it in this variety, calling the
short jaculatory prayers and responsories by
the names of Letanies, or suffrages, which I
should render in the phrase of S. <hi>Austin</hi> to be
<hi>postulationes,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but the longer Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
he calls <hi>prayers,</hi> which is the true ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (I suppose) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
twice in the Letany, after the short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsories,
the Priest says <hi>[Let us pray]</hi> by
that minding the people of the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
that <hi>prayer</hi> as well as <hi>supplications</hi> be
made. * For the Letanies it is certain, the
form is of great antiquity; <hi>Mamercus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Vienna</hi> made solemn Letanies <hi>400.</hi>
years after Christ, and he and all his Diocess
repeated them together: And therefore I
know not what matter of doubt there can be
reasonable in the form, since besides that we
have the wisdome of so many ages, and holy
and prudent persons to confirm them, the form
is made with design to represent all the needs
of the Catholick Church, and to make the
prayer it self fitted for an active and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
devotion; and that it cooperates rarely
well to these ends, is so true, that of the first
every man is judge, of the second, every man
<pb facs="tcp:115790:20"/>
may be judge that will without prejudice, and
with pious predispositions use the form; for
if they help my devotion infinitely, they may
doe as much to another, if he be disposed as I
am; and he that says they doe no advantage
or singular relish to my spirit, may as well
tell me the meat I eat does not please me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loves it not; but the exceptions
which are against it are so phantastick, and
by chance, that unless it be against a single
adversary, and by personal engagement, they
cannot be noted in the series of a positive
discourse. Sometimes they are too long, and
sometimes they are too short, and yet the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
will make longer and shorter when they
please; and because no law of God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to us in such circumstances, if the
Church leaves the same liberty to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
devotions, it is not reasonable they
should prescribe to her in publick, and in such
minutes, in which the ordinary prudence of
one wise man is abundantly sufficient to
give him Laws and directions, and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greater difficulty.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Of the same consideration is the form
of our Church Collects, which are made plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
by their variety of matter, are made
energetical and potent by that great endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>[per Jesum Christum Dominum
<pb facs="tcp:115790:20"/>
nostrum]</hi> are cleared from a neighbourhood
of tediousness by their so quick intercision
and breakings off, and have for their prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the forms of Prayer used by the religious
of <hi>Palestine</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cassian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De instit. Cleric. lib. 1. c. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Et hae

Diaboli jacula quae infligere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
tum praecipuè insistit cùm oramus, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctâ
vitemus brevitate.</hi> In all these forms
of prayer there is no difference but what is
circumstantial, and therefore although these
circumstances be of great efficacy for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of accidental advantages to our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
which are often swayed, moved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by a manner as much as by an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
yet there is in it nothing of duty and
obligation, and therefore it is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
thing in the world to make any of
these things to be a question of Religion.</p>
            <p n="33">33. I shall therefore press these things no
further, but note that since all Liturgy is and
ever was either prose or verse, or both, and
the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as
well as most others, is of the last sort, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that whatsoever is in her devotions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Lessons, Epistles and Gospels (the
body of which is no other thing, then was the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:21"/>
famous <hi>Lectionarium</hi> of S. <hi>Jerome</hi>) is a
compliance with these two dictates of the
Apostle for Liturgy: the which, one for verse,
the other for prose, <hi>in <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Psalms and <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Hymns
and <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Spiritual songs</hi> [for verse:] for prose,
<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi> deprecations, and <hi rend="sup">5</hi> prayers, and <hi rend="sup">6</hi> interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and <hi rend="sup">7</hi> giving of thanks,</hi> will warrant
and commend, as so many parts of duty, all
the portions of the English Liturgy.</p>
            <p n="34">34. If it were worth the pains, it were
very easy to enumerate the Authors, and
especially the occasions and time when the
most minute passages, such I mean as are
known by distinct appellatives, came into the
Church, that so it may appear, our Liturgy is
as ancient and primitive in every part, as it
is pious and unblameable, and long before
the Church got such a beam in one of her
eyes, which was endevoured to be cast out at
the reformation. But it will not be amiss to
observe that very many of them were inserted
as Antidotes, and deleteries to the worst of
heresies, as I have discours'd already, &amp; such
was that clause <hi>[through Jesus Christ our
Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee
in the unity of the holy Spirit ever one
God]</hi> and some other phrases parallel were
put in, in defiance of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and
all the species of the Antitrinitarians, and
<pb facs="tcp:115790:21"/>
used by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in <hi>Millain,</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi>
in <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Idacius Clarus</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi>
and in imitation of so pious precedents, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath inserted divers
clauses into her Offices.</p>
            <p n="35">35. There was a great instance in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the blessed Sacrament. For
upon the change of certain clauses in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
upon the instance of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi>
instead of <hi>[the bloud of our Lord Jesus
Christ which was given for you preserve
your body and soul unto everlasting life]</hi>
was substituted this <hi>[take and eat this in
remembrance, &amp;c.]</hi> and it was done lest the
people accustomed to the opinion of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
and the appendant practices,
should retain the same doctrine upon inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the first clause. But in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, when
certain persons of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> opinion
would have abused the Church with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentary
doctrine, and pretended the
Church of <hi>England</hi> had declared for it in
the second clause of <hi>1552;</hi> the wisdome of
the Church thought it expedient to joyn both
the clauses; the first lest the Church should
be suspected to be of the Sacramentary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion,
the latter lest she should be mistaken
as a Patroness of Transubstantiation. And
<pb facs="tcp:115790:22"/>
both these with so much temper and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that by her care she rather prevented
all mistakes, then by any positive declaration
in her prayers, engaged her self upon either
side; that she might pray to God without
strife and contention with her brethren. For
the Church of <hi>England</hi> had never known
how to follow the names of men, but to call
Christ onely her Lord and Master.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But from the inserting of these and
the like clauses which hath been done in all
ages, according to several opportunities and
necessities, I shall observe this advantage
which is in many, but is also very signally in
the English Liturgy, we are thereby enabled
and advantaged in the meditation of those
mysteries, <hi>de quibus festivatur in sacris</hi> (as
the Casuists love to speak) which upon so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
days we are bound to meditate and
make to be the matter and occasion of our
address to God; for the offices are so ordered
that the most indifferent and careless cannot
but be reminded of the mystery in every An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary,
which if they be summ'd up will
make an excellent Creed, (and then let any
man consider what a rare advantage it will
be to the belief of such propositions when the
very design of the Holy-day teaches the hard
handed Artizan the name and meaning of
<pb facs="tcp:115790:22"/>
an article) and yet the most forward and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
cannot be abused with any semblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of superstition. The life and death of the
Saints which is very precious in the eyes of
God, is so remembred by his humble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
handmaid the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that by giving <hi>him thanks and praise, God
may be honoured,</hi> the Church instructed by
the proposition of their example, and we
give testimony of the honour and love we owe
and pay unto Religion by the pious venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and esteem of those holy and beatified
persons.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Certain it is, that there is no part of
Religion, as it is a distinct vertue, and is
to be exercised by interiour acts and forms
of worship, but is in the offices of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> For if the soul desires to be
humbled she hath provided forms of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to God before his Church; if she will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and give God thanks for particular
blessings, there are forms of thanksgiving
described and added by the Kings authority
upon the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
which are all the publick, solemne, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
occasions for which by Law and order
provision could be made: if she will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to God the publick and private necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Church, and single persons, the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:23"/>
whole body of Collects and devotions supplies
that abundantly: if her devotion be high
and pregnant, and prepared to fervency and
importunity of congress with God, the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are an admirable pattern of devotion,
full of circumstances proportionable for a
quick and an earnest spirit; when the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Anniversary calls on us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our duty of special meditation, and
thankfulness to God for the glorious benefits
of Christs Incarnation, Nativity, Passion,
Resurrection, and Ascension (blessings which
doe as well deserve a day of thanksgiving as
any other temporal advantage, though it be
the pleasure of a victory) then we have the
offices of <hi>Christmass,</hi> the <hi>Annunciation,
Easter</hi> and <hi>Ascension:</hi> if we delight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
those holy persons, whose bodies rest
in the bed of peace, and whose souls are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in the hands of Christ, till the day of
restitution of all things, we may by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
and days of Anniversary festivity not
onely remember, but also imitate them too in
our lives, if we will make that use of the
proportions of Scripture allotted for the festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
which the Church intends; to which if
we adde the advantages of the whole Psalter
which is an intire body of devotion by it self,
and hath in it forms to exercise all graces by
way of internal act and spiritual intention,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:23"/>
there is not any ghostly advantage which the
most religious can either need or fancy, but
the English Liturgy in its entire constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will furnish us withall. And certainly
it was a very great wisdome, and a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and religious Constitution so to order
that part of the Liturgy, which the ancient
called the <hi>Lectionarium,</hi> that the Psalter
should be read over twelve times in the year,
the old Testament once, and the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thrice, beside the Epistles and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
which renew with a more frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
such choice places as represent
the intire body of faith and good life.
There is a defalcation of some few Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the intire body in the order,
but that also was part of the wisdome of the
Church not to expose to publick ears and
common judgements, some of the secret rites
of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, or the more mysterious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the new Testament, whose sense
and meaning the event will declare, if we
by mistaken and anticipated interpretations
doe not obstruct our own capacities, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from beleeving the true events, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they answer not those expectations with
which our own mistakes have prepared our
understandings: as it hapned to the Jews in
the case of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and to the Christians
in the person of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:24"/>38. Well! thus as it was framed in the
body of its first Constitution and second alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
those excellent men whom God chose
as instruments of his honour and service in
the reformation, to whom also he did shew
what great things they were to suffer for his
Names sake, approved of it with high testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
promoted it by their own use and zeal,
and at last sealed it with their bloud.</p>
            <p n="39">39. That they had a great opinion of the
piety and unblameable composure of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer-book, appears <hi rend="sup">1</hi> in the challenge
made in its behalf by the Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
to defend it against all the world of
Enemies; <hi rend="sup">2</hi> by the daily using it in time of
persecution and imprisonment (for so did Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Ridley,</hi> and <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Taylor,</hi> who also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended

            <p n="40">40. I desire the words may be considered
and confronted against some other words
lately published, which charge these holy and
learned men but with a half-fac'd light, a
darkness in the confines of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the
suburbs of <hi>Goshen.</hi> And because there is
no such thing proved of these blessed Men,
and Martyrs, and that it is easy to say such
words of any man that is not fully of our
minde, I suppose the advantage and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing
authority will lie on our part in
behalf of the Common Prayer-book, especially
since this man and divers others died with
it and for it according as it hapned by the
circumstance of their charges and articles,
upon which they died; for so it was in the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:25"/>
cases of <hi>John Rough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 1848, 1649, 1840.</note>

their indictments, that they used, allowed,

the Service-book of King <hi>Edward.</hi> To
which articles they answered affirmatively,
and confessed them to be true in every part,
and died accordingly.</p>
            <p n="41">41. I shall press this argument to issue in
the words of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> cited to the like
purpose by <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis.<note place="margin">Contra haeres. c. 7.</note> Librum

dare to violate this Priestly book, which so
many Confessors have consigned, and so many
Martyrs have hallowed with their bloud?
How shall we call them Martyrs, if we deny

if we dislike their cause? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them to be crown'd, why shall we deny
but that they <hi>strove lawfully?</hi> So that if
they dying in attestation of this Book were
Martyrs, why doe we condemne the Book for
which they died? If we will not call them
Martyrs, it is clear we have chang'd our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:115790:25"/>
since then. And then it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
whether we are fallen? For the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time died for it,
in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time they avowed it under
the protection of an excellent Princess, but in
that sad interval of Q. <hi>Maries</hi> reign it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
persecution, and if it shall doe so again,
it is but an unhandsome compliance for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
to be unlike their Brethren, and to
be like their Enemies, to doe as doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and onely to speak great words against
them; and it will be sad for a zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
to live in an age that should disavow
K. <hi>Edwards</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Religion and
manner of worshipping God, &amp; in an age that
shall doe as did Q. <hi>Maries</hi> Bishops, persecute
the Book of Common Prayer, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
contained in it. God help the poor
Protestants in such times: But let it doe its
worst, if God please to give his grace, the
worst that can come is but a Crown, and that
was never denied to Martyrs.</p>
            <p n="42">42. In the mean time I can but with
joy and Eucharist consider with what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and blessings the pious Protestant is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
and blessed, and arm'd against all
his needs by the constant and Religious usage
of the Common Prayer-book. For besides the
direct advantages of the Prayers and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:26"/>
some whereof are already instanc'd,
(and the experience of holy persons will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them with more) there are also forms
of solemne benediction and absolution in the
Offices, and if they be not highly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
there is nothing sacred in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Ministery, but all is a <hi>vast plain,</hi> and
the Altars themselves are made of unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
turf.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Concerning Benediction (of which
there are four more solemne forms in the
whole Office, two in the Canon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
one in Confirmation, one in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Marriage) I shall give this short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that without all question <hi>the less is
blessed of the greater,</hi> and it being an issue
spiritual, is rather to be verified in spiritual
relation, then in natural or political. And
therefore if there by any such thing as <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
by the Ministery of the word, and
<hi>begetting in Christ,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Sons</hi>
after the common faith (as the expressions
of the Apostle make us to beleeve) certain it
is, the blessings of Religion doe descend most
properly from our spiritual Fathers, and with
most plentiful emanation. And this hath been
the Religion of all the world, to derive very
much of their blessings by the Priests parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and signal ministration; <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:26"/>
blessed <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> blessed the people. So that here
is benediction from a Prince, from a Father, from
the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priest, from <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> of
whose order is the <hi>Christian,</hi> in whose Law it is
a sanction, that in grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> needs especially, <hi>the
Elders of the Church be sent for, and let
them pray over him that is distressed.</hi> That
is the <hi>great remedy</hi> for the <hi>great necessity.</hi> And
it was ever much valued in the Church, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that <hi>Nectarius</hi> would by no means take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture
of his Patriarchal Sea, until he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the benediction of <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Bishop
of <hi>Cilicia: Eudoxia</hi> the Empress brought her
son <hi>Theodosius</hi> to S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> for his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and S. <hi>Austin</hi> and all his company received
it of <hi>Innocentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage;</hi> It was
so solemne in all marriages, that the marrying of
persons was called <hi>Benediction.</hi> So it was in the
fourth Councel of <hi>Carthage, Sponsus &amp; sponsa
cùm benedicendi sunt à Sacerdote, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicendi,</hi>
for <hi>married.</hi> ... And in all Church
Offices it was so solemne, that by a Decree of the
Councel of <hi>Agatho,</hi> A. D. 380. it was decreed,
<hi>ante benedictionem Sacerdotis populus egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
non praesumat.</hi> By the way onely, here is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for two parts of the English Liturgy.
For the benediction in the Office of marriage by
the authority of the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
for concluding the Office of Communion with the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:27"/>
Priests or Bishops benediction by warrant of the
Councel of <hi>Agatho,</hi> which Decrees having been
derived into the practice of the universal Church
for very many ages, is in no hand to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued,
lest we become like <hi>Esau,</hi> and we miss
it when we most need it. For my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I shall still press on to receive the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of holy Church, till at last I shall hear a
<hi>Venite benedicti,</hi> and that I be reckoned
amongst those blessed souls who come to God by
the ministeries of his own appointment, and will
not venture upon that neglect, against which
the piety and wisdome of all Religions in the
world infinitely doe prescribe.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Now the advantages of confidence which
I have upon the forms of benediction in the
Common Prayer-book are therefore considerable,
because God himself prescribed a set form of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the people,<note place="margin">Num. 6. 23.</note> appointing it to be done not in
the <hi>Priests extempore,</hi> but in an established form
of words: and because, as the authority of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
form is from God, so that this form may be
also highly warranted, the solemne blessing at the
end of the Communion, is in the very words of
S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="45">45. For the forms of Absolution in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
though I shall not enter into consideration
of the Question concerning the quality of the
Priests power which is certainly a very great
ministery, yet I shall observe the rare temper,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:27"/>
and proportion which the Church of <hi>England</hi>
uses in commensurating the forms of Absolution
to the degrees of preparation and necessity. At
the beginning of the Morning and Evening
Prayer after a general Confession usually reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the devotion is high and pregnant,
(whose parts like fire enkindle one another) there
is a form of Absolution in <hi>general, declarative</hi>
and by way of proposition. In the Office of the
Communion, because there are more acts of piety
and repentance previous and presupposed, there
the Churches form of Absolution is optative and
by way of intercession. But in the Visitation of
the sick, when it is supposed and enjoyned that
the penitent shall disburthen himself of all the
clamorous loads upon his conscience, the Church
prescribes a medicinal form by way of delegate
authority, that the parts of justification may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the parts of good life. For as the penitent
proceeds so does the Church: pardon and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
being terms of relation they grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
till they be compleat; this the Church with
greatest wisdom supposes to be at the end of our
life; (grace by that time having all its growth
that it will have here) &amp; therefore then also the
pardon of sins is of another nature then it ever
was before, if being now more actual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
whereas before it was in <hi>fieri</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and smaller
increases, and upon more
accidents apt to be made imperfect and revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:115790:28"/>
So that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in these
manners of dispensing the power of the Keys does
cut off all disputings and impertinent wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
whether the Priests power were Judicial or
declarative; for possibly it is both, and it is
optative too, and something else yet, for it is an
emanation from all the parts of his Ministery,
and he never absolves, but he preaches or prays
or administers a Sacrament; for this power of
remission is a <hi>transcendent,</hi> passing through all
the parts of the Priestly Offices; For <hi>the keys
of the Kingdome of heaven</hi> are the promises &amp;
the threatnings of the Scripture, and the prayers
of the Church, and the Word and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and all these are to be dispensed by the
Priest, and these keys are committed to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
and by the operation of them all he opens
and shuts heaven gates ministerially; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>verbum reconciliationis,</hi>
and says it is dispensed by Ministers, as by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
or Delegates: and therefore it is an
excellent temper of the Church, so to prescribe
her forms of Absolution, as to shew them to be
results of the whole Priestly Office, of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of dispensing Sacraments, of spiritual Cure,
and authoritative deprecation. And the benefit
which pious and well disposed persons receive by
these publick Ministeries, as it lies ready formed
in our blessed Saviours promise <hi>[erit solutum in
coelis]</hi> so men will then truly understand when
<pb facs="tcp:115790:28"/>
they are taught to value every instrument of
grace or comfort by the exigence of a present
need, as in a sadness of spirit, in an unquiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
in the arrest of death.</p>
            <p n="46">46. I shall not need to procure advantages
to the reputation of the Common Prayer, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the imperfections
of whatsoever hath
been offered in its stead: but yet<note n="*" place="margin">Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note>; a <hi rend="sup">1</hi> form of
worship, composed to the dishonour of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
accusing it of darkness, and intolerable
inconvenience <hi rend="sup">2</hi> a direction without a rule: <hi rend="sup">3</hi> a
rule without restraint: <hi rend="sup">4</hi> a prescription leaving
an indifferency to a possibility of licentiousness:
<hi rend="sup">5</hi> an office without any injunction of external
acts of worship, not prescribing so much as
kneeling: <hi rend="sup">6</hi> an office that onely once names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
but forbids it in the ordinary instance,
and enjoyns it in no particular: <hi rend="sup">7</hi> an office that
leaves the form of ministration of Sacraments
so indifferently, that if there be any form of
words essential, the Sacrament is in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to become invalid, for want of provision of
due forms of Ministration: <hi rend="sup">8</hi> an office that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

for the reading the holy Scriptures: <hi rend="sup">26</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
commemorates a departed Saint: <hi rend="sup">27</hi> that
hath no Communion with the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
any more then with the other parts of
the Militant: <hi rend="sup">28</hi> that never thanks God for the
redemption of the world by the Nativity, and
passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of our blessed
Saviour Jesus, but condemnes the memorial
even of the Scripture Saints, and the memorial
of the miraculous blessings of redemption of
mankinde by Christ himself, with the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
it condemnes the Legends and porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
stories of the most suspected part of the

against Judaism condemnes all distinction of
days, unless they themselves distinguish them:
that leaves no signature of piety upon the Lords
day, and yet the Compilers doe enjoyn it to a

by implication undervalue the Lords Prayer,
for it never injoyns it, and does but once permit

(and such a one there is in the world) I

of <hi>England,</hi> which was with so great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
compiled out of Scriptures, the most of it,
all the rest agreeing with Scriptures, and
drawn from the Liturgies of the ancient Church,
and made by men famous in their generations,
whose reputation and glory of Martyrdome hath
made it immodest for the best of men now to
compare themselves with them: and after its
composition considered by advices from abroad,
and so trimm'd and adorn'd that no excrescency
didremain; the Rubricks of which Book was writ
in the bloud of many of the Compilers, which
hath had a testimony from Gods blessing in the
daily use of it, accompanying it with the peace of
an age, established and confirmed by six Acts of
Parliament directly and collaterally, and is of so
admirable a composure, that the most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wits of its Enemies could never finde out
an objection of value enough to make a doubt, or
scarce a scruple in a wise spirit. But that I shall
not need to set a night-piece by so excellent a
beauty, to set it off the better, its own excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are Orators prevalent enough, that it shall
not need any advantages accidental.</p>
            <p n="47">47. And yet this excellent Book hath had the
fate to be cut in pieces with a pen-knife, and
thrown into the fire, but it is not consumed; at
first it was sown in tears and is now watered
with tears, yet never was any holy thing drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and extinguished with tears. It began with
<pb facs="tcp:115790:30"/>
the Martyrdom of the Compilers, and the Church
hath been vexed ever since by angry spirits, and
she was forced to defend it with much trouble
and unquietness: but it is to be hop'd that all
these storms are sent but to increase the zeal and
confidence of the pious sons of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> Indeed the greatest danger that ever
the Common Prayer-book had, was the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
and indevotion of them that used it but as
a common blessing; and they who thought it fit
for the meanest of the Clergy to read prayers;
and for themselves onely to preach, though they
might innocently intend it, yet did not in that
action consult the honour of our Liturgy; except
where charity or necessity did interpose. But when
excellent things goe away, and then look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, as our blessed Saviour did upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
we are more mov'd then by the nearer embraces
of a full and an actual possession. I pray God it
may prove so in our case, and that we may not be
too willing to be discouraged; at least that we
may not cease to love and to desire what is not
publickly permitted to our practice and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p n="48">48. But because things are otherwise in this
affair then we had hop'd, and that in very many
Churches in stead of the Common Prayer which
they use not, every man uses what he pleases, and
all men doe not choose well, and where there are
so many choosers there is nothing regular, and the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:31"/>
Sacraments themselves are not so solemnly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
as the sacredness and solemnity of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
do require, and in very many places where
the old excellent forms are not permitted, there is
scarce any thing at all, but something to shew
there was a shipwrack, a plank or a cable, a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or a Psalm; some who were troubled to see it
so, and fain would see it otherwise, did think it
might not be amiss that some of the Ancient
forms of other Churches, &amp; of the prayers of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
should be drawn together, and laid before
them that need; as supposing that these or the
like materials would make better fuel for the fires
of devotion then the straw and the stubble which
some men did suddenly or weakly rake together
when ever they were to dress their Sacrifice: Now
although these prayers have no authority to give
them power, yet they are humbly and charitably
intended, and that may get them love, and they
have been (as to the matter of them) approved by
persons of great learning and great piety, and
that may sufficiently recommend them to the use
of those who have no other, or no better, and they
no way doe violence to Authority, and therefore
the use of them cannot be insecure; and they
contain in them no matter of question or dispute,
and therefore cannot be justly suspected of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
or partiality: and they are (especially in the
chiefest offices) collected out of the devotions of
the Greek Church, with some mixture of the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:31"/>
               <hi>Mozarabick</hi> and <hi>AEthiopick,</hi> and other Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
and perfected out of the fountains of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and therefore for the material part have
great warrant and great authority: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>if they be</hi> used <hi>with submission to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
it is hop'd they may doe good; and <hi>if they
be not</hi> used, no man will be offended.</p>
            <p n="49">49. I hope there will be no need of an apology
or an excuse for doing an act of charity; If no
man will confess that he needs any of these, they
can be let alone, for they are intended onely for
them that doe; but if there be a need, these pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may help to obtain of God to take that need
away, and to supply it in the mean while. But
there is nothing else intended in this design but
that we may see what excellent forms of prayer
were used in the ancient Church, what a rare
repository of Devotion the Scripture is, how it was
the same spirit of prayer that assisted the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and other Churches of God, how
much better the Curates of souls may help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with these or the like offices, then with
their own <hi>extempore,</hi> how their present needs
may be supplied, and their devotion enlarged,
and a day of Religion intirely spent, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made for some necessities in which our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
and our experience of late have too well
instructed us. For which and for other great
reasons all Churches have admitted variety of
Offices. In the Greek Church it is notorious,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:32"/>
they have three publick Books, and very many
added afterwards by their Patriarchs, their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and their Priests; some are said often,
and others sometimes: and in <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarabick</hi>
office was used until the time of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonsus</hi>
the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and to this very day in six Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
in <hi>Toledo,</hi> and in the Cathedral Church it
self in the Chappel of Frier <hi>Francis Ximenez;</hi>
and at <hi>Salamanca</hi> upon certain days in the
Chappel of Doctor <hi>Talabricensis.</hi> And after all,
these may be admitted into the use and ministery
of families, for all the necessities of which here
is something provided.</p>
            <p n="50">50. He that gathered these things together
intends as <hi>humbly,</hi> as <hi>piously,</hi> as <hi>charitably</hi> as
he can doe in any action whatsoever; and if any
of his brethren can tell his heart better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
I am sure he may say much more of it; but
if any man can think I have in it any purpose less
pious, or less severe, or that there is any obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or any thing but what is here expressed, I
must answer for it if there be, and he must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for it if there be not.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:115790:47"/>
            <head>An Advertisement to them that shall
use these PRAYERS.</head>
            <p>BEcause no <hi>prayers</hi> are the more pleasing to God
for being long, and they are oftentimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
even to good men if they be very long;
and yet on the other side, if the <hi>devotion</hi> be long
it is the better, and if that be lasting, it ought to
be supplied with materials, like gummes to the
Altar of incense, and fuel for the holy fires: he
that collected these devotions did design to serve
the advantages both of length and shortness, that
the most devout may be fitted, and the most secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and imployed may not be wearied.</p>
            <p>1. Therefore, although every thing is set down
at length, that the trouble of references and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
back might be avoided, and therefore seem
longer then they are; and the Hymnes are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
double, that the variety might be more apt
to please and to instruct, and the Offices are made
full, that upon the more solemne days when people
come with a greater and more active devotion and
greater leisure, their time and their piety might be
imployed; yet on other days there is but one
Lesson appointed, and one Hymne to follow it.</p>
            <p>2. The prayers are divided into smaller porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that with ease any of them may be omitted
by persons whose occasions force them from their
attendance on longer Offices; besides that there
are two forms of Morning and Evening Prayer, the
one shorter, the other longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:47"/>3. In the beginning of Morning and Evening
Prayer, some of the devotions which are set down
are desired and intended to be used but seldome;
not onely to avoid tediousness, but for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
very obvious, that the Ministers more solemn
power and office might not be less regarded, by
being daily (and consequently very often without
just dispositions) offered: I mean it concerning the
form of Absolution. The Confession may be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as there is cause, by making use onely of some
of the sections, and leaving out the other.</p>
            <p>4. If upon Communion days, the morning
Prayer and the Communion Office be not read at
one time, but the morning Prayer be read at seven
or eight of the clock in the morning; and the
Communion office at the time of celebration; or
if it be convenient that they be both together, if
then the Sermon be in the afternoon, the length
will be very tolerable.</p>
            <p>5. These Prayers being intended onely as a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
ministery to them who are not permitted
to use those which were appointed formerly, there
is no necessity upon any one, and he may use as
much or as little as he please, and therefore no man
will have cause to complain of length or shortness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115790:48"/>☞ For the Offices themselves, I pray
God bless them to all those ends whither
they are designed, and to which in their
own nature they can minister: And as I
humbly recommend them to Gods blessing,
so I doe submit them to the judgement of
my afflicted Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and particularly to the censure of my <hi>spiritual
Superiours:</hi> and I desire that these
Prayers may no longer be used in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
place, then my L<hi rend="sup">ds</hi> the B<hi rend="sup">ps</hi> upon pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enquiries and grave considerations shall
perceive them apt to minister to Gods glory,
and useful to the present or future necessities
of the Sons and Daughters of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>* Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by
night: nor for the arrow that flieth by day.</p>
               <p>¶For he shall give his Angels charge over
thee to keepe thee in all thy waies; they shall

beare thee in their hands least thou dash thy
foot against a stone.</p>
               <p>* I will remember thee upon my bed, and

be performed.</p>
                  <p>* O thou that hearest prayer
unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
                  <p>* Blessed is the man whom thou choosest,
and causest to approach unto thee, that he
may dwell in thy courts: He shall be satisfied
with the goodnesse of thy house, even of thy
Holy Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115790:86"/>* By terrible things in righteousnesse wilt
thou answer us O God of our salvation, who
art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
and of them that are a far off upon the sea.</p>
                  <p>* Come and hear all ye that fear God, and
I will declare what he hath done for my
soule.</p>
                  <p>* The people that walked in darknesse
hath seen a great light; and they that dwell
in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
hath the light shin'd.</p>
                  <p>* O that men would therefore praise the
Lord for his goodnesse, and declare the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that he hath done for the children of
men.</p>
                  <p>* He turneth the wildernesse into a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
water, and dry ground into water-springs.</p>

house, and to be a joyfull mother of Children.</p>
                  <p>* For unto us a child is borne, unto us a
son is given, and the government shall be upon
his shoulders.</p>

counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
Father, the prince of peace.</p>
                  <p>* Of the increase of his Government and
peace there shall be no end.</p>
                  <p>* He shall sit upon the throne of David to
order his Kingdome, and to establish it with
judgement and justice for ever and ever.</p>

thy holy Spirit upon thy Church in the day

any knowne sin of which ye have not truly

humbly confesse, and are truly sorrowfull
for our many and great, our innumerable and
intolerable crimes of which our consciences
doe accuse us by night and by day, and by
which we have provoked thy severest wrath
and indignation against us. We have broken
all thy righteous lawes and commandements
by word or by deed, by vaine thoughts or
sinfull desires: we have sinn'd against thee in
all our relations, in all places and at all times,
we can neither reckon their number, nor
<pb facs="tcp:115790:100"/>
bear their burden, nor suffer thy anger which
we have deserved. But thou O Lord God,
art merciful and gracious: have mercy upon
us: Pardon us for all the evils we have done:
Judge us not for all the good we have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Take not thy favour from us, but delight
thou to sanctifie us and save us, and work in us
to will and to doe of thy good pleasure all
our duty, that being sanctified by thy Spirit,
and delivered from our sins, we may serve
thee in a religious and a holy conversation,
thorough Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

freedom from actual sin cannot excuse them from
Baptisme: and if we remember that although

unworthiness cannot be the measures of thy

shewing mercy to them that call upon thee, &amp;

children; thou didst blesse the womb of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth

thy mercies are not less then ever, no less then
infinite, and why should not thy servant hope
that thou wilt hear my prayer and grant the
desire of my soul? Even so O gracious father

and have defiled the dwelling places of thy
Name, even unto the ground.</p>

worke thereof with axes and hammers.</p>

make havock of them altogether: thus have
they spoiled the houses of God in the land.</p>

this dishonour? how long shall the enemy
blaspheme thy name; for ever?</p>

teares, and givest them plenteousnesse of teares
to drinke.</p>

and wilt thou stretch out thy wrath from one

us, that thy people may rejoice in thee?</p>

and will he shut up his loving kindnesse in
displeasure?</p>

ungodly to an end, but guide thou the just.</p>

A Hymne consolatory, in time of persecution.</head>

                        <p>¶Blessed is the Nation whose God is the
Lord: and the people whom he hath chosen
for his owne inheritance.</p>
                        <p>* For thou shalt save thy people that are
in adversity: and shalt bring downe the high
lookes of the proud.</p>
                        <p>¶Thou shalt keep them O Lord, thou
shalt preserve them from this generation for

his countenance will behold the
thing that is just.</p>
                        <p>* For the oppression of the poore, for the
sighing of the needy, now will I arise saith the
Lord, I will set him in safety from him that
swelleth against him.</p>
                        <p>¶For the Lord will not faile his people,
neither will he forsake his inheritance: untill
righteousnesse turne againe unto judgement:
and all such as be true in heart shall follow it.</p>

thou shalt keepe them secretly in thy taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle

them, and delivereth them out of all their

the Lord preserveth them that are faithful,

of the Lord: which is also their strength in

they will be alwaies praising thee.</p>

thee, in whose heart are thy waies.</p>

rejoyce in thee: they shall walke in the light
of thy countenance.</p>
                        <p>¶For the Lord God is a sunne and a
shield: the Lord will give grace and glory,
and no good thing will he withhold from
them that walke uprightly.</p>
                        <p>* Many O Lord my God are thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
workes which thou hast done, and thy
thoughts which are towards us: they cannot
be reckoned up in order to thee: if I would
declare and speake of them, they are more
then can be numbred.</p>
                        <p>¶Many shall see it and feare, and put their
trust in the Lord.</p>
                        <p>* The wicked watcheth the righteous, and
seeketh occasion to slay him: but the Lord
will not leave him in his hand, nor condemne
him when he is judged.</p>
                        <p>¶The righteous shall rejoyce in the Lord,
and put his trust in him: and all they that

are true of heart shall be glad.</p>
                        <p>* Keepe innocency and take heed unto the
thing that is right: for that shall bring a man
peace at the last.</p>
                        <p>¶They that sow in teares shall reape in
joy.</p>
                        <p>* He that now goeth on his way weeping,
and beareth forth good seed, shall doubtlesse
come againe with joy, and bring his sheaves
with him.</p>
                        <p>¶The Lord from out of Sion shall so
blesse thee, that thou shalt see Jerusalem in
prosperity all thy life long, and peace upon
Israel.</p>
                        <p>* For God will save Sion, and build the
Cities of Judah, that men may dwell there
and have it in possession.</p>
                        <p>¶The posterity also of his servants shall
inherit it, and they that love his name shall
dwell therein.</p>

thou and the Arke of thy strength.</p>
                        <p>¶Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt;
thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it.</p>
                        <p>* Thou madest roome for it; and when it
had taken root it filled the land.</p>
                        <p>¶The hills were covered with the shadow
of it: and the boughs thereof were like the
goodly Cedar trees.</p>
                        <p>* Why hast thou then broken downe her
<pb facs="tcp:115790:143"/>
hedge, that al that goe by pluck off her grapes.</p>
                        <p>¶The wild boare out of the wood doth
root it up, and the wild beasts of the field
devoure it.</p>

behold and visit this vine, and the place of
thy vineyard that thy right hand hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the branch that thou madest so strong
for thy selfe.</p>
                        <p>¶Turne us againe O God, shew the light
of thy countenance, and we shall be whole.</p>
                        <p>* Let thy Priests be clothed with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
                        <p>¶Let thy Saints sing with joyfulnesse.</p>
                        <p>* So we thy people and sheepe of thy
pasture will give thee thanks for ever.</p>
                        <p>¶We will shew forth thy praise from

and full of calamity, whose onely hope is in

the mercies and loving kindnesse of the Lord.
O doe thou pardon all our trespasses and
debts by which we are in arrears to thee; put
them upon the accounts of the Crosse; for
our Blessed and most gracious Lord hath paid
our price to redeeme us from the Eternal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and be thou pleased to enrich us with
thy holy Spirit; that we may be strong in
faith, abounding in hope, established in a holy
patience, and rich in charity; expecting with
meeknesse and submission when the times of
refreshment shall come from the presence of
the Lord, our Blessed Saviour and Redeemer

who wert brighter then an Angel, purer

O heare our cries from the bottom of our

                           <p>O Almighty God and Father of heaven
and earth, who settest a bound to the sea,
and restrainest his waves by a heap of sand, by
mountaines and by rocks, by thy word and by
thy Spirit, saying, hither shall thy proud waves
passe and no further; looke upon us thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
whose lives are in our hands, and we
dwell in the shadowes of death night and day;
we know O Lord and confesse the floods and
waves of passion doe frequently overrun us,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:158"/>
and we are drown'd in the stormes and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with iniquity. Our [<hi>Oaths, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

then the fiercest winds, and call aloud upon
thee for vengeance; and many of us in our
greatest danger provoke thee with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
unreasonablenesse and violence of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.
But O God our God be gracious unto thy
people who accuse our selves, and confesse
our guilt, and acknowledge thy justice, and
beg thy goodnesse, and pray to thee for safety
and defence, for deliverance and for pardon,
for thy conduct and thy blessing. Keepe us O
God from stormes and quicksands, from Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
and Rocks, from error and impieties,
from all evil contingencies and all evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
let our voyage be safe to our persons and
to our goods; let it be blessed by thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and thy holy Spirit, that we may returne
with comfort and with advantages of trade
[or successe] and thy servants may glorify
thee in the land of the living, in the church
of the first-borne, the congregation of thy
redeemed ones, through Jesus Christ our

who art the wisedome of the Father, and
art made unto us wisedome, righteousnesse,

given life and no understanding. Thou didst
create us of nothing, and gavest us being when
we were not, and createdst in us capacity of
blessings when we had none, and gavest us
many when we did not understand them; thou
bringest infants from the wombe, and from
the state of nature to the state of grace, and
from their mothers breasts thou doest often
convey them to the bosome of Jesus, and yet
they doe nothing, but thou art glorified in

reason can deserve heaven no more then these

which they discerne not, nor the evils which
they cannot understand; keepe them from
all evil and sad mischances, and make supply
of their want of the defences of reason by the

               <q>
                  <p>THen the kingdome of heaven shall be likened unto
ten virgins, which tooke their lamps, and went to
meete the bridegrome.</p>
                  <p>And five of them were wise, and five foolish.</p>
                  <p>The foolish tooke their lamps, but tooke no oyle
with them.</p>
                  <p>But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their
lampes.</p>
                  <p>Now while the bridegrome tarryed long, all slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and slept.</p>
                  <p>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
bridegrome cometh: goe out to meet him.</p>
                  <p>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
                  <p>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your
oyle, for our lamps are out.</p>
                  <p>But the wise answered, saying, we feare left there
will not be enough for us and you: but goe ye rather
to them that sell, and buy for your selves.</p>
                  <p>And when they went to buy, the bridegrome came:
and they that were ready went in with him to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and the gate was shut.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord
Lord, open to us.</p>
                  <p>But he answered, and said, verily I say unto you, I
know you not.</p>
                  <p>Watch therefore: for ye know neither the day nor
the houre, when the Sonne of man will come.</p>
               </q>

                  <pb facs="tcp:115790:165"/>After the lesson as he sees occasion let him adde
some discourse of his owne, short, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

                           <p>O Almighty God and most merciful Father,
who delightest not in the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but that he be converted from his sin, and
thou be turned from thine anger; give unto
thy servant a deepe contrition for his [her]
sins, a perfect hatred of them, a timely and an

and grace to love thee: powers to serve thee,
<pb facs="tcp:115790:166"/>

                           <p>O Almighty and most gracious Saviour
who didst suffer with meeknesse and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
those severe stripes of thy Fathers wrath
which we did deserve but thou didst feele,

of faith and patience, a law of sufferings, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

heaven: give to thy servant thy grace, that
according to thy excellent example and holy
commandement he may beare the burden of
the Lord, with an even and a willing, an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

charge thee foolishly, nor murmure secretly,
nor make too much hast; but with faith and
hope submit his body and soule to thy merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and just dispensation; that he may not
discompose the duties of his repentance by a
new sin, nor provoke thee to anger by his
impatience, nor offend them who charitably
<pb facs="tcp:115790:166"/>
minister to him, nor neglect the doing of
any thing that can be in his power or in
his duty, to his body or his soule. O God
be mercifull unto thy servant and presse not
him [or her] with an unequal load; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that we are but flesh, and vanity, that
we are crushed before the Moth, and die in thy
displeasure: give him ease and rest, a quiet
mind and a peacefull conscience: make thou
all his bed in his sicknesse; and deliver him
not into the will of his Spiritual enemies: but
glorify thy mercies, and make thy goodnesse
illustrious upon thy servant through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

whom thou hast smitten with thy rod, and
brought into the vally of teares, and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of death; O let not thy feirce anger
goe beyond a fatherly correction: let this
rod be discipline, not vengeance; let it kill
his sin, but not the man: but in judgement
remember mercy; take from thy servant all
inordinate feare; give him a present mind, a

thy servants admittance to present our
complaint before the throne of grace, and let
our petition enter into thy presence: thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows

stick fast in us, and thy hand presseth us
sore: Open thy heart, the treasure and spring
of mercie, and thence let comforts and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
descend upon thy servants. Put a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
period to our sorrows, but first put a stop
to our sins; let us not sin against thee, when
for sinne thou art smiting us; Let us never
charge thee foolishly, nor behave our selves
peevishly towards others, but use all the
means we can to ease their sorrows, to lighten
their burdens, to sweeten their lives, that so
we may expect from thy goodnesse a more
plentifull and abundant measure of loving
kindnesse.</p>

wonderfull works that
he hath done.</p>
                  <p>5 For he established
a testimony in Jacob, &amp;
appointed a law in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
which he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
our fathers: that
they should make them
known to their children</p>
                  <p>6 That the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to come might know
them, even the children
which should be born:
who should arise and
declare them to their
children:</p>
                  <p>7 That they might
set their hope in God,
and not forget the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:246"/>
works of God: but keep
his commandments.</p>
                  <p>8 And might not be
as their fathers, a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
and rebellious ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
a generation
that set not their heart
aright: and whose spirit
was not stedfast with
God.</p>
                  <p>9 The children of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
being armed
and carrying bowes, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
back in the day of
battell.</p>
                  <p>10 They kept not the
covenant of God: and
refused to walk in his
law.</p>
                  <p>11 And forgat his
works: and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that he had shewed
them.</p>
                  <p>12 Marvellous things
did he in the sight of
their fathers: in the
land of Egypt, in the
field of Zoan.</p>
                  <p>13 He divided the
sea, and caused them to
passe through: and he
made the waters to
stand as an heap.</p>
                  <p>14 In the day-time
also the led them with a
cloud: and all the night
with a light of fire.</p>
                  <p>15 He clave the rocks
in the wildernesse: and
gave them drink as out
of the great dephts.</p>
                  <p>16 He brought streams
also out of the rock, and
caused waters to run
down like rivers.</p>
                  <p>17 And they sinned
yet more against him: by
provoking the most
High in the wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>18 And they tempted
God in their heart: by
asking meat for their
lust.</p>
                  <p>19 Yea, they spake
against God: they said,
Can God furnish a table
in the wildernesse?</p>
                  <p>20 Behold, he smote
the rock, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
gushed out, and the
<pb facs="tcp:115790:247"/>
streams overflowed; can
he give bread also? can
he provide flesh for his
people?</p>
                  <p>21 Therefore the
Lord heard this, and
was wroth, so a fire was
kindled against Jacob,
and anger also came up
against Israel:</p>
                  <p>22 Because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not in God: and
trusted not in his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
                  <p>23 Though he had
commanded the clouds
from above, and opened
the doors of heaven:</p>
                  <p>24 And had rained
down manna upon them
to eat, and had given
them of the corn of
heaven.</p>
                  <p>25 Main did eate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
food: he sent them
meat to the full.</p>
                  <p>26 He caused an east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
to blow in the
heaven: and by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he brought in the
south-wind.</p>
                  <p>27 He rained flesh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
upon them as dust:
and feathered fowls like
as the sand of the sea.</p>
                  <p>28 And he let it fall
in the midst of their
camp, round about their
habitations.</p>
                  <p>29 So they did eate,
and were well filled: for
he gave them their own
desire.</p>
                  <p>30 They were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
from their lust:
but while their meat
was yet in their mouths,</p>
                  <p>31 The wrath of God
came upon them, and
slew the fattest of them,
and smote down the
chosen men of Israel.</p>
                  <p>32 For all this they sinned still: and believed
not for his wondrous
works.</p>
                  <p>33 Therefore their
dayes did he consume in
vanity, and their years
in trouble.</p>
                  <p>34 When he slew
<pb facs="tcp:115790:247"/>
them, then they sought
him: and they returned
and enquired early after
God.</p>
                  <p>35 And they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that God was their
rock, and the high God
their redeemer.</p>
                  <p>36 Neverthelesse,
they did flatter him
with their mouth; and
they lied unto him with
their tongues.</p>
                  <p>37 For their heart
was not right with him:
neither were they sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
in his covenant.</p>
                  <p>38 But he being full
of compassion, forgave
their iniquity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
them not; yea,
many a time turned he
his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath.</p>
                  <p>39 For he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that they were but
flesh; a wind that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away and cometh
not again.</p>
                  <p>40 How oft did they
provoke him in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse:
and grieve
him in the desert?</p>
                  <p>41 Yea, they turned
back and tempted God:
and limited the holy
one of Israel.</p>
                  <p>42 They remembred
not his hand: nor the
day when he delivered
them from the enemy.</p>
                  <p>43 How he had
wrought his signs in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and his wonders
in the field of Zoan:</p>
                  <p>44 And had turned
their rivers into blood;
and their floods, that
they could not drink.</p>
                  <p>45 He sent divers
sorts of flies among
them, which devoured
them; and frogs which
destroyed them.</p>
                  <p>46 He gave also their
increase unto the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller,
and their labour
unto the locust.</p>
                  <p>47 He destroyed their
vines with hail, and
<pb facs="tcp:115790:248"/>
their sycomore-trees
with frost.</p>
                  <p>48 He gave up their
cattell also to the hail,
and their flocks to hot
thunderbolts.</p>
                  <p>49 He cast upon
them the fiercenesse of
his anger, wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
and trouble,
by sending evil angels
among them.</p>
                  <p>50 He made a way
to his anger, he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not their soul from
death: but gave their
life over to the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>51 And smote all the
first-born in Egypt: the
chief of their strength
in the tabernacles of
Ham:</p>
                  <p>52 But made his own
people to goe forth like
sheep; and guided them
in the wildernesse like a
flock.</p>
                  <p>53 And he led them
on safely, so that they
feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>54 And he brought
them to the border of
his sanctuary: even to
this mountain, which
his right hand had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.</p>
                  <p>55 He cast out the
heathen also before
them, and divided them
an inheritance by line:
and made the tribes of
Israel to dwell in their
tents.</p>
                  <p>56 Yet they tempted
and provoked the most
high God, and kept not
his testimonies.</p>
                  <p>57 But turned back
and dealt unfaithfully
like their fathers: they
were turned aside like a
deceitfull bow.</p>
                  <p>58 For they provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him to anger with
their high places, and
moved him to jealousie
with their graven ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115790:248"/>59 When God heard
this, he was wroth, and
greatly abhorred Israel.</p>
                  <p>60 So that he forsook
the tabernacle of Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,
the tent which he
placed among men:</p>
                  <p>61 And delivered his
strength into captivity,
and his glory into the
enemies hand.</p>
                  <p>62 He gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
over also unto the
sword: and was wroth
with his inheritance.</p>
                  <p>63 The fire consumed
their young men: and
their maidens were not
given to marriage.</p>
                  <p>64 Their priests fell
by the sword: and their
widows made no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
                  <p>65 Then the Lord
awaked as one out of
sleep, and like a mighty
man that shouteth by
reason of wine.</p>
                  <p>66 And he smote his
enemies in the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts:
he put them to a

                  <p>67 Moreover, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the tabernacle of
Joseph: and chose not
the tribe of Ephraim.</p>
                  <p>68 But chose the
tribe of Judah, the

loved.</p>
                  <p>69 And he built his

like the earth

for ever.</p>
                  <p>70 He chose David

                  <p>3 Blessed are they

                  <p>4 Remember me, O

that thou bearest unto
thy people: O visit me
with thy salvation.</p>
                  <p>5 That I may see the

                  <p>6 We have sinned
with our fathers: we
have committed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we have done wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly.</p>
                  <p>7 Our fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not thy wonders
in Egypt, they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
not the multitude
of thy mercies, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him at the sea,
even at the Red sea.</p>
                  <p>8 Nevertheless, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them for his names
sake: that he might
make his mighty power
to be known.</p>
                  <p>9 He rebuked the
Red sea also, and it was
dried up: so he led them
through the depths as
through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>10 And he saved them
from the hand of him
that hated them: and
redeemed them from
the hand of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>11 And the waters
covered their enemies:
there was not one of
them left.</p>
                  <p>12 Then believed
they his words, they
sang his praise.</p>
                  <p>13 They soon forgat
his works, they waited
not for his counsel:</p>
                  <p>14 But lusted excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and tempted God
in the desart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115790:268"/>15 And hee gave
them their request, but
sent leanness into their
soul.</p>
                  <p>16 They envied Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
also in the camp,
and Aaron the saint of
the Lord.</p>
                  <p>17 The earth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and swallowed up
Dathan, and covered
the company of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</p>
                  <p>18 And a fire was
kindled in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the flame burnt up
the wicked.</p>
                  <p>19 They made a calf
in Horeb, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the molten image.</p>
                  <p>20 Thus they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their glory into the
similitude of an ox that
eateth grass.</p>
                  <p>21 They forgat God
their Saviour, which
had done great things
in Egypt:</p>
                  <p>22 Wondrous works
in the land of Ham, and
terrible things by the
Red sea.</p>
                  <p>23 Therefore he said
that he would destroy
them, had not Moses
his chosen stood before
him in the breach, to
turn away his wrath,
lest he should destroy
them.</p>
                  <p>24 Yea, they despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the pleasant land:
they believed not his
word:</p>
                  <p>25 But murmured in
their tents, and hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not unto the voyce
of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>26 Therefore he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up his hand against
them, to overthrow
them in the wilderness:</p>
                  <p>27 To overthrow
their seed also among
the nations, and to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them in the lands.</p>
                  <p>28 They joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also unto Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peor,
and ate the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115790:269"/>29 Thus they provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him to anger with
their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon
them.</p>
                  <p>30 Then stood up
Phineas, and executed
judgement: and so the
plague was stayed.</p>
                  <p>31 And that was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
unto all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for evermore.</p>
                  <p>32 They angred him
also at the waters of
strife, so that it went ill
with Moses for their
sakes:</p>
                  <p>33 Because they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
his spirit, so that
he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.</p>
                  <p>34 They did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the nations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom the Lord
commanded them:</p>
                  <p>35 But were mingled
among the heathen, and
learned their works.</p>
                  <p>36 And they served
their idols: which were
a snare unto them.</p>
                  <p>37 Yea, they sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their sons and their
daughters unto devils.</p>
                  <p>38 And shed innocent
blood, even the blood
of their sons and of their
daughters, whom they
sacrificed unto the idols
of Canaan: and the
land was polluted with
blood.</p>
                  <p>39 Thus were they
defiled with their own
works: and went a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</p>
                  <p>40 Therefore was the
wrath of the Lord kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
against his people,
insomuch that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
his own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>41 And he gave them
into the hand of the
heathen: and they that
hated them, ruled over
them.</p>
                  <p>42 Their enemies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:115790:269"/>
oppressed them, and
they were brought into
subjection under their
hand.</p>
                  <p>43 Many times did
he deliver them, but
they provoked him with
their counsell, and were
brought low for their
iniquity.</p>
                  <p>44 Neverthelesse, he
regarded their affliction
when he heard their cry.</p>
                  <p>45 And he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
for them his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and repented ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his mercies.</p>
                  <p>46 He made them

captives.</p>
