            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue beene (most deere and more intirely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Children) so much burthen'd, pressed down and ouerladen with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, complaints, Miseries and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for your long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, in your vnhappie and vnfortunate (yet no otherwise to bee lookt for) Iourney or wandring Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, that I am almost dead with languishing. But I hope I speake it in the Autumne of my woes and heart-breaking sorrowes; (I pray to my Sauiour I doe.) It is the <hi>Autumne</hi> time of the yeare; yea, of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19821:6"/>
such a yeare: such a lamentable yeare, such a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yeare of Mortalitie by Plague and Pestilence, as in my time, for the time (to my remembrance) is without and beyond any President. Oh woe is mee therefore: But my hopes are, and my assiduate and daily prayers, still shall be to the Father of vs all, who onely can, and none else hath power, to disburthen me of that heauy dead-striking-mace of Plague and Pestilence, that hath euen bruised mee and mine in peeces. And therefore for your sakes (my endeared retired Children) notwithstanding my Almightie Fathers exceeding and great displeasure I will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to plead to him for Mercy in your behalfe: But indeed I may rather say in the behalfe of my selfe: For had not the Lord beene angry with me for my intollerable sinnes, hee would not haue suffered my poore Children to runne away from me, and to leaue me as they did: For which cause I haue indeed a long time taken it to heart, considering with my selfe which was my best and surest course to take, to worke my peace with my God, that he might take pitie and compassion both vpon me and all mine.</p>
            <p>At length, the holy Spirit of that eternall Essence Omnipotent <hi>Iehoua,</hi> possessing my distracted memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with my Sauiours vnfallible promise, <hi>Come vnto mee all you that are heauy laden, and I will ease yee.</hi> Immediatly with teares of Ioy and Comfort, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him on my knees and obtained his exceeding Mercy: For immediatly after my Dread Soueraigne CHARLES (whom the King of Kings euer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect both from his Forreine and Domestick enemies)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19821:6"/>
Commanded a solemne Fast and Prayer to be made and kept throughout my whole Citie, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Diuines continually Preaching and Praying in my behalfe for the appeasing and mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of the great displeasure of my Almightie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which my said Father doth begin to take (and praised be his name) doth daily take more and more to hart, thinking that it is now time to hold his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Rod from further striking: Now the God of all mercy grant it may be so; and I hope my prayer is to purpose; For me thinkes (vnlesse I dreame) I perceiue my Children begin to retire, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe to their Foster-mother <hi>London,</hi> which they would not doe; did not my blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour lessen his weekly Number: Is it so? nay then I perceiue the old Prouerb holds (<hi>Home is Home, bee it neuer so homely</hi>) and the Prodigalls Storie is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fulfilled; For they poore Soules, hauing almost spent all, and finding no better entertainment in the Countrie, are forced to returne of meere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.</p>
            <p>And are some of you returned, (my endeered Children:) and will all the rest of your Brethren follow you do you thinke? I am very fearefull, I shall want some of my number. But howeuer, I must be contented; and in the <hi>interim</hi> I speake to you with a louing Mothers tongue. Oh welcome, thrice wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in very deed, you are louingly welcome, my thoughts perswaded me, that in regard the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God did visit me with the heauy Rod of his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent affliction; you had beene only fearefull of me,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19821:7"/>
and not of him; but surely it now appeareth; and I am very glad of it, that you haue made your peace with God my Father in the Country, and all of you repented of your Sinnes, in that you haue found such fauour at his hands, and that hee hath giuen you life this dangerous time of Infection, which (to say truth) if you had staid with me though in the chiefest of my Territories, I could not haue warranted; No maruell then you fled from mee. Nay, I am further surely perswaded, that you whom God hath blest with longer dayes then many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of your deceased brethren; are such as left your beneuolence behinde you, to and for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and keeping from staruing those poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that did suffer and beare the publike miserie of such a Contagious time as this hath beene without president: Or else with life you could neuer haue entred my Gates: for which I truly thanke you, and no doubt, but my gratitude shall double that with treble loane. But I pray giue mee leaue to question you a little farther? Doe you all cast your dayes Iourneys so, that you will not enter <hi>London</hi> streetes, nay scarce her Suburbes, before the blacke clowdes of the duskie Night eclips the light of <hi>Luna</hi> from my Mother Earth; for feare the small remainder of your poore afflicted Brethren should call you in question for your flight, and vpbrayd yee with the tytle of <hi>Run-awayes?</hi> No surely, not all; for some of you it seemes, made your appearance daily at Noone-Exchange without Dread or Feare. God be thanked the <hi>East-India</hi> Ships are come; and some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19821:7"/>

If it please my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father to continue as he hath begun, to cease the Rod of his affliction and to sheathe his Sword: the Residue of my poore Children to whom he hath giuen life, no doubt but shall see happy dayes, to my comfort, their profit and benefit, and all to the praise and glory of my eternall Father, which the Lord of all Eternitie grant for our blessed Sauiours sake.</p>
            <p>I am now at a stand, whether I with modestie may further question you or no: But I hope you that haue spent so long time in the Countrie may affoord a little time of Conference with your weeping Mother.</p>
            <p>I pray giue my desire satisfaction, and tell mee whether any of my great ones, or men of note, as Iustices of Peace, Aldermen or their Deputies, Common Counsell men, Churchwardens, Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or any other of my Officers which should haue imployed their paines and care in the time of my Visitation; did they, or had they any desire of repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring home, when they heard that my Poore cryed out for reliefe, and they absent which should relieue them (a Letter was all could giue them this notice, which <hi>Tom Long</hi> the Carrier brought, and neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered it, for he durst not.) But I dare answer for them; that had they doubted of their entertainment in the Countrie; they would rather haue continued at their owne Mantions vnder my gouernment; then to be so slighted by base ignoble <hi>Drones,</hi> as they were. Which I leaue further to treate of: But they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19821:8"/>
left their Charitie behinde them, which was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and gaue content to that clamour, and ceast the Rumour.</p>
            <p>But now good Children I will yet further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine you, did not your illiterated Peasants your Hobnayld Clownes, <hi>Raphe, Benedicke, Nick, Tom, Iack, Hodge,</hi> and such like vnder the Iustices tolleration euen almost at mine owne Gates? I am sure it was within the sound of my night Ninth houre warner? Did they not keepe you out, with Pitchforkes, Staues, Hookes, browne Bills, and such like rustick Weapons, and you demanded passage; answer was giuen: No, for you are <hi>Londoners,</hi> true, we are so, wee will not deny it, what then? You come not here; why saith one, you suffer Rogues to passe: so we may one replyes, before any <hi>Londoner.</hi> Can this be true that my poore Children should be thus misused, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst my Neighbours, such as haue daily Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with me; If they bring me Food, I giue them Money, the Land-lord must be paid. But thou foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish simple Countriman; hee will not bee paid with Corne, Oxen, Hay, and such like good blessings which my eternall louing and mercifull Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes vpon thee: For (saith the Land-Lord) I haue of goods great store, I need them not; but as the greedy Vsurer he comes, giue me my money; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cloath my Wife and Children with Hey, &amp;c. Well, if it be so then, that thou must of necessitie haue money, or be vndone, and thy Lease forfeited, and thou, thy Wife and Children cast foorth of dores; what resteth then to be done? Must thou not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19821:8"/>
of force come vnto mee thy charitable Neighbour <hi>London</hi>; and doe not I from time to time, nay, at all times helpe you in the midst of your extremitie; Is not my Exchequer continually open vnto you: I haue no Barrocadoes to keepe you forth; but my Gates all houres of the night are open for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Hynde or Swaine that comes. I, nor none of mine examine what Countriman thou art: from whence thou camest? or whither thou wilt? but come and welcome. This is and euer hath beene my carriage to my Countrie people: And now in the time of my Visitation, did my poore fearefull Children, come amongst you into the Countrie for a little refuge or recreation, presuming vpon the like welcome there, as you found here, and did you giue them <hi>Iack Drumes</hi> entertainment. Oh vncharitable, inhumaine and ingratefull people: Indeed it argued no Christianitie in you. Put case my dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Children, should (as I cannot blame them if they doe) take this to hart; and should shut my Gates against you, and debarre entrance to such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humaine Creatures: where would your Landlords haue their Rent then? <hi>Michaelmas</hi> you know is come: the halfe yeares Rent must be paid: the last day of payment is at hand; Therefore because I will make you blush at your owne folly (if my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Father will illuminate your darkened eyes of Ignorance, that you may soe the same) and that my Children (which will be ruld by me) may shew loue for hatred: See our Charitie is such, that all my Gates are open to giue you all entertainment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I will not examine you, or shut my Gates against you for feare of your pestilent Feuer: No, I craue your pardon, it is but an Ague; But as the plaine Country-woman said, I cannot tell whether it bee but an Ague, wee and the <hi>Londoners</hi> both are visited within the Countrie; but I am sure after they are dead, they haue the Spots vpon them: But howeuer my honest Country-men, let vs in the name of our blessed Sauiour, ioyntly: entirely and hartily pray to the Lord for mercy, that our Plague and Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the Countrie Ague (if you call it so) may at once and together cease with a full period. Our Visitation here, and their affliction there in the Countrie, that my poore Remainder, which at home haue endured the <hi>Front</hi> and heate of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pestilent Battell, may not bee shaken in the Reare with their pestiferous <hi>Ague</hi>; which I am very confident he will grant, vpon our harty prayers and sincere repentance.</p>

                  <hi>Eccho</hi> I heare too much, I will trouble thee no farther, my hart is almost burst with sorrow. See my poore Children; you were ashamed to tell the truth. But had those rustique irrationall Beasts: (as I may rightly tearme them) either reason, humanitie, or faith in my Sauiour Iesus Christ? they would shame, and feare euer to enter my Gates, to looke me in the face; their base abuse to my distressed Children, was so insufferable and intollerable.

               <p>Many of you in the Countrie style your selues Countrie Gentlemen; Few or none of you, haue showne any gentle cariage or respect, to many of my Children, that might euery way equall the best of you, that haue offered them such base affronts, and begger-like barbarous vsage. Nay I can averre it for truth, and it cannot be denied, that one of your <hi>Gubernators,</hi> I style him so, because the vulgar should take no notice, whom or what hee was: (did not shame) conuersing at a Meeting himselfe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his like Associats, and some of my Children, (which were faine to dissemble their dwellings, and change their habits, before they could gaine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, concerning Gods visitation vpon my people in <hi>London</hi>) did not shame (as I said before) to say for truth, that the dryed Salt-fish which hee bought of a Fish-monger of <hi>London</hi> at Sturbridge Fayre was Twelue-moneth; this time of affliction, had the Tokens on it, his reason why? was for that he heard, that his Fishmonger of whom he bought it, was now dead of the Plague: Whereupon one of my Cittizens which was then present, made him this answer; Sir, said he, when I am at home in the Towne where I liue, I vse to goe to Market my selfe, and going to the Fish-Market to buy a fresh Cod, two or three; I make a speciall choice of those haue spots vpon them; for they are accompted the best and deerest Fish; and no doubt but yours were such

This; The Landlords or Creditors of some of those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents cannot now (as I am enformed) demaund or require Rent or Debts; but they shame not to offer this affront? That they haue beene and still are so charged with their Children the Apprentices of <hi>London,</hi> that the remainder of their estate is not able to make satisfaction. Woe is mee that this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should bee layd vpon my Childrens Children for being their Seruants, they tooke them for their owne Children as they are bound by my Custome. Therefore sister <hi>Rus</hi> if thou chide not thy Children for their Ignorance, and returne home in safetie my

               <p>One thing more I would entreate at your hands, that you would summon your great Commanders, for Charities sake; there may be order taken, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the remarkable places of my Children, whom God took to his mercy in the High-wayes and other places. Oh shew your selues charitable: though you would not affoord them Christian buriall. Let there no base stakie wooden memoriall be left to view, as if they had Misdone, Hanged or Drowned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, For Christianitie grant it; and withall cleere all the Hedges and Trees of those lamentable obiects which hang vpon them, that are a thousand times more mouing Corasiues, then the Executioners Wardrop at the basest Brokers stall. Now let you and I be friends; For my Children which are left, doe promise me faithfully, neuer to trouble you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in that nature: They will stay with mee in my extremitie; and eate a Capon, drinke a cup of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, an other of Sacke; and feed in that grosse fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; rather then on your daintie Puddings and Hogs flesh. I haue done, and I beseech my Eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the only Omnipotent God, to make an end to, of his greiuous Visitation, by his dangerous and fearefull Ague with you and yours; and his more fearefull scourge of Plague and Pestilence with mee and mine, and that for his dearely beloued Sons sake Christ Iesus his only Sauiour and Redeemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Some few dayes after (as it is customarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them) the Gentlemen of the Artillery Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that were then in Towne, considering the weaknesse of their Number present, and yet might doe no lesse, then giue the deceased Captaine his right and Merit; treated with the then right

Honourable <hi>Iohn Gore</hi> Lord Maior of this said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that he would be pleased to grant a publique Funerall in Armes. And for that most of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were at that time in the Countrie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the rest may strengthen themselues with their Friends that were also Citizens and Souldiers of the Trayned Bands in <hi>London</hi>; to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Company to make the Countrie wonder; whereunto it pleased his Honour to condiscend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saturday, being the 24. day of September last 1625. was the Funerall, when all the Gentlemen and Fellow Souldiers met at the Artillery Garden, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, where they were ranckt by the Officers there (Souldier-like) according to the number, three and foure a brest, all the Musketieres both of the Prime and Reere deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Musketieres, three in Ranke; and the Pikes Foure a brest in the body. Captaine <hi>Von</hi> was Leader that day, Associated with Captaine <hi>Humphrey Smith.</hi> So Marcht they forth the Garden, to <hi>Leaden Hall,</hi> where the <hi>Herse</hi> attended, with an <hi>Epitaphe</hi> thereon diuulging to the world, the worth of that worthy Captaine, the Worshipfull Company of <hi>Ironmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> of whom he was a member; The Masters also of <hi>St. Thomas</hi> Hospitall, of whom in his life time he was likewise one, attended with many more of his Friends.

Armourer, the Gun-maker and their Seruants; and Sixe Gentlemen who carried the Trophies of his Armes before the Hearse. The beholders then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, were at least Ten thousand people, who were eye-witnesses, that what is here related is true. The exact and Souldier-like performance and managing of the businesse, I referre to the iudgement of the discreet and wise Spectators then present. Only I will intreate you (judicious Reader) to take notice, that after he was Souldier-like Enterred, hee had three seuerall Vollies of Shot giuen. Which being finished, the Drums beate a Troop vntill the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came forth of the Church-yard (where the Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies were giuen) into the street vpon <hi>Fishstreet-hill:</hi> where falling into Rankes as before, the Captaine commandeth a March to be beaten, and so Marched thorow <hi>Gracious-street, Cornehill,</hi> the <hi>Poultry,</hi> and <hi>Cheapside,</hi> that the Market people might report through the Countrie, that their rumour was false. And so to the Lord Major his house, who presented himselfe at the gate, and very Honourably and freely caused both Flaggons of Sacke and Claret to bee brought forth, for all such as pleased to drinke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and there likewise were two Vollies giuen; for which his Lordship gaue the Gentlemen many thankes, assuring them, that they had done great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Citie, and greater comfort to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Then tooke they a faire Farwell, and Trooped through <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and so to the Artillery Garden; whereupon lodging of the Cullours, they concluded with their last volly, and so I leaue them, but not you, for I entreate you to reade that which you haue not yet read.</p>
