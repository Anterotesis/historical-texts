            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>MOst writers accord, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> which name in the Arabique signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Indignation or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, was the sonne of <hi>Abdalla</hi> a Marchant in Mecca, a City in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16030:6"/>
Faelix; his mother a Jew, and himselfe in <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 571. borne <hi>Posthumus.</hi> At the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeere of his age his mother deceased, a poore woman that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored for her living bred him up; at 16 yeers of age he became a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bondman, his Master, pleased with his wit and dexterity, made him his Factor: He dead, <hi>Mahomet</hi> being
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16030:6"/>
then twenty five yeeres old, married his Mistris and untill the thirty eighth yeere of his age, he industriously follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his trade of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, avoiding no personall travel (as well in the kingdoms of AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Syria and Persia, as elswhere) where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit might arise. Being then satisfied with wealth, &amp; given to ease, he began to think on his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16030:7"/>
Soule, whereof in his travels he had not been negligent, having been curious to understand the Religions of the Jews and Christians; which compared with the Idolatrie wherein he was originally tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thirty yeeres) did worke in him assurance that Paganisme was the way to perdition, but to whether of these to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, he stood doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16030:7"/>
At last falling in company with two Christian Artificers, inhabitants in Mecca, by conversation with them (who read the old and new Testament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for himselfe was unlettered) he approved Christianisme for the best, and was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thereby, only, a man might attaine unto Salvation, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he framed his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16030:8"/>
life, which bred admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them that knew him, and gave him a greater reputation than he did expect.</p>
            <p>But this hasty spring was quickly blasted; for the Devill, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, enflamed his heart with pride, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> wrought in him a desire to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a Prophet thinking all other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Religion and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16030:8"/>
sanctity to be but vile and base: To aspire unto that opinion he embraced a solitary life, retyring to a Cave in the Mountains, where he lived free from the ordinary conversation of men; repaired seldom to his own home, and his speeches (mixt with gravity and holynesse teaching good life, and beating downe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) moved, not only
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16030:9"/>
such as saw him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, but the rest also (that heard by other mens eares) held him to be a Saint. To increase this opinion of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of the falling sicknesse (wherewith he was afflicted) he made good use; for, he gave it out (when he fell into his fitts incident to that disease) that he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Angell <hi>Gabriell,</hi> by whom the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16030:9"/>
pleasure of <hi>God</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him, and that his Trances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded through the weaknesse of his earthly Carcase that was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the divine presence of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ambassador.</p>
            <p>Grown now famous he thought it necessary to divulge into the world some works in wrighting, whereby his name might encrease:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16030:10"/>
His best help was a Jew scribe, who for want of a better scholler he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained; but shortly after, his Master the Divell (the Church of Christ then laboring with the sicknes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Haeresies) procured the acquaintance of a Christian called <hi>Sergius</hi> born in Alexandria, by profession a Monke, and by infection a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, wittie, eloquent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16030:10"/>
and learned, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mist of some Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall preferment which in his opinion he had deserved) full of despight and revenge, in a divelifh discontent, sought as well to raise a scandall upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, as upon the professors thereof; the readiest way to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this fire, he found to be <hi>Mahomet</hi>; who (as is already said) had won
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16030:11"/>
some extraordinary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of sanctity. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, the Jew for insufficiency was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. <hi>Sergius</hi> being fully informed how <hi>Mahomet</hi> had hitherto proceeded, made him to understaud how weakly and grossly he had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in fundamental points, necessary for the advancement of a new Religion; and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16030:11"/>
shewed him, not only the meanes how to smoothe his past errors without scandall, but to compose a new treatise, collected out of the old and new Testament (with devised additions that should give credit to his Doctrine and humor the hearers) which being divulged amongst the Idolatrous people (who were easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caught) spread the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16030:12"/>
poyson it contained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Arrabies, but the wiser sort fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as they had cause) that the setling of a new Religion, might also draw with it a new forme of government; opposed themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, calling <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> an Imposter, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hypocrisie, and taxing his sensualitie and drunkennesse (of both which hee was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16030:12"/>
guilty) and sent to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him; whereof <hi>Mahomet</hi> from some of his frends in Mecca ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice left his Cave, and fled to the Desarts [the sixteenth of July 622 from which flight the Turks begin their computation A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegira] unto whom divers Novelists resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as also such as the Estates had banished for approving his late

            <p>To make a smoothe way to his enterprise,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16030:14"/>
by underhand meanes, he exasperated the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Novelists (whereof there were many of wealth and estimation) to be sensible of their banishment, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their wrongs by force; himselfe recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which assured him that <hi>God</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, for the rigorous persecuting of him and

            <p>His next conquest was the City of Mecca where he triumphed in the blood of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Citizens, which was not spared; and proclaimed death to all those that did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Doctrine.</p>

subjection) hee gave him notice of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served deaths, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, before he would be guilie to his own dishonor, in submitting himselfe to an Heathen, or renounce the faith wherin he was Baptiz'd he would die if he had then a thousand lives; Dated in the ninth of July 715/94. As <hi>Tarif</hi> was sorie to understand his resolution, so was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16030:63"/>
hee extreame glad to heare that <hi>Don Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> was dead, whereof untill then hee had not assurance, and in post dispatched a Packet to <hi>Almanzor</hi> giving him accompt of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, how that all Spaine (the Mountains of Biscay and the Astu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, into which a few Chistians were sled, and the Cittie of Sivilla not yet free from the plague
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16030:63"/>
excepted, were reduced to his obedience. Never<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theles because his garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were many, &amp; the Mountaines by their natural strength almost in accessible, hee humbly besought supplies not doubting but to yeeld him contentment in his charge. Lastly he recommended unto his favor the good service of <hi>don Iulian</hi> and of <hi>Habdilbar,</hi> who in the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16030:64"/>
stead of the Prince of Tunis hee had made Governor of Cordova, being in his opinion the meetest place for the Royall seat. <hi>Almanzor</hi> though well pleased with <hi>Tarif</hi>'s relation, yet for his better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation returned his pleasure by the same post, Commanding him to make his present and personall repaire to his Court, to substitute

In this meane while <hi>Don Iulian</hi> attended his domestick affaires at his towne of Villa Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosa, now called Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, which being put in some good order, hee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16030:65"/>
sent into Affrica for his wife, and daughter, who during the war remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Tangier.

her parents to come forth, unto whome she desired to say somthing before shee died. This stragicall summons being by them obeyed she cursed the day of her birth aswell in respect of the dishonor done to her, as to be the cause of the slaughter of so many Christians, the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of Religion and the utter subversion of so flourishing a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16030:66"/>
shee accused her father for his over-sharp revenge, and her selfe shee censured unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of life in being the cause of such irreparable mischeifs, after her prayers to <hi>God,</hi> her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to her father was, that from thence forth that town should be no more called Villa Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osa, but Malacho (which signifieth Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que mala) in memorie

of her that there ended her life, being the most unfortunate ill woman that ever lived; and there with all; not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eare to the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and teares of her aged parents, shee cast her selfe head-long to the ground, and dyed.</p>

the Governor (with an armie of 12000 foote and 1000 horse) sate downe before it.

            <p>The time now drew on for the Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the intended marriage between the yong Prince <hi>Abilqualit</hi> and the King of Tunis daughter. <hi>Tarif,</hi> with a fleet of fortie saile, was sent to fetch her; The King of Tunis, as he had reason to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much honored to

matched his daughter with the great <hi>Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi>'s Heir, so he forgot not to demonstrate his affection by the rich Presents hee sent to the Calipha, and by the rewards hee gave <hi>Tarif.</hi>

Governed by a Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which signifies an Hermit, where with an infirme bodie (Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing for the space of seaven yeeres in conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuall devotions) hee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Hee that should write at large the storie of this Prince, discourse his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious actions as they merrit, set downe his virtues, and anatomize al that was good in him,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16030:74"/>
should undertake a taske of great labor; for had he been a Christian, his equal could hardly been found, but his better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, wherefore not to bury so great worth in oblivion it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent briefely to say somwhat of him. In his tender yeeres the hearts of all men began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and affect him, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel for his person which in beautie, and form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled

the children of his age, as for the goodnesse of his disposition, and sharpnes of wit, which was admirable, as his yeeres increased so did his perfections, all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues striving which should be predominant in him, which produced feare and love in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects hearts evenly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced towards him. His stature was tall, and seemly, his gesture grave
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:16030:75"/>
and pleasant; the thoughts of his heart were not discovered in his brow, his limbs stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and active, valiant, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, devot, wise and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; being reproved by the king his father for giving a way to the poore in one day by handfulls of Gold the some of 20260. pounds [22 Arrobas and 13 pounds of Gold] for an instruction, told him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:16030:76"/>
that a poore King was as a dead man among the living, hee replyed, that Avarice in a prince was base and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Kings in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Creator (by whose power they rule and reigne) ought to give to the well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, &amp; needie; heaps of treasure could not adde one day to his life; and being dead nothing but a poore winding sheet

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:16030:77"/>
they were deceived, for the shortnes of a good sword in the hands of a valiant man that dares come up close to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie was so far from defect, as it brought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage with it: the king pleased to see in so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeeres so bold a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his son, fastned the sword to his side, saying that he only did mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to weare it that found no fault with it: Before

he was 21 yeeres old, he wrote divers bookes of the Mathematiques, Astrologie, art of War, Philosophie, pollicie of state, and a large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Aristotles works [three books of Philosophy upon the tents of <hi>Arist</hi>: in forme of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment] he could perfectly write and speake eleaven severall Languages, expressing his minde, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Ambassadors in them with out the help of a Truchman, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being old, joying in his sons perfections, upon the tenth of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 654 resigned his Scepter to him, which addition of greatnes bred no other Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him, then a greater desire to increase in goodnes, his Ambition striving no lesse to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted virtuous then to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16030:79"/>
keepe and enlarge his Dominions, his aparell ordinarily was plaine; but on festivall daies no prince more sumptuous At his meat, which for the most part was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, he seldome had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two dishes, and that but once a day, two servants to attend him, and never dranke in gold, or silver cup though of them his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were royally sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16030:79"/>
Surfetters, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants he compared to beasts voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:16030:80"/>
for them to resort unto, winter or summer, except he were sick; he was readie before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, yet never slept in the day for a preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of health; he bathed often in his Listine. He was never known to make a Ly, nor to his knowledg spake an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, he termed Lyers disciples of the Divell, the plague of the world, betrayers of truth,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:16030:80"/>
destroyers of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the right hand of iniquitie, no man that lyed unto him escaped unpunished but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his punishment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the weight of his Ly, the least was onblik disgrace, but lies of moment he Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with whipping, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of tongues, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, disabling to be witnes, and in some case life was taken, which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16030:81"/>
rigor bred terror in wicked dispositions, and restrained false informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and unnecessarie suits, the dayes of the weeke he designed in their order to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per distributions, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them (when ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion inforced not the contrary) were daily observed.</p>
            <p>The Friday which is the Arabians Sabbath he spent in devotion,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16030:81"/>
never missing his houres in the Mosquetaes, his progression thither was solemne, attended by his cheife Alcaydes, Counsellors, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the guards of horse, and foot; when prayer was ended, not far from the Mosque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, set in his royall seat, he remayned a good space to receive petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the poorest not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debarred his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16030:82"/>
before hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, an officer, or cryed with a loud voyce gave notice to the suitors to attend the next morning at the Court of Justice where they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive answer.</p>
            <p>Upon Satterdaies, personally, he sat in Judgment, the cheife Justice produced the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions exhibited the day past, which being read, and the suitors
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16030:82"/>
questioned withal, who durst not aver an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, the causes were or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dered; where difficulties did arise such were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his Councell, but the longest delay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceeded fifteen dayes. In cases criminall Sentence at the farthest was pronounced within nine dayes. Suits of debt had the expedition, but where it appeared that the debtor was rather
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16030:83"/>
faultie by accident then by his defaults, the king oftentimes out of his own treasurie would pay poore mens debts. His severe punishing of lies, bred the expedition of Justice: for untruths were never suggested, wherof ensued quietnes among his Subjects, and few suits. The like severitie he exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theeves, never sparing the lives of the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16030:83"/>
guiltie; wherby in the end his subjects for feare of his Justice were so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as if any thing had been lost in the high wayes, or in the streets, the partie that first saw it [this custom was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed among the Moores of Granada even to our dayes and seemeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to them] durst not touch it before he had some witnes to test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifie that he found it; and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16030:84"/>
that done, placing it in view of the world publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely relating where he had it, that the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner might have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therof.</p>
            <p>The Sundaies were assigned to determin Martiall affaires, of that Councell he had but foure, the eldest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor presented the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches of the Leivete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and generalls that were imployed in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16030:84"/>
and after snfficient debating, the answers were referred to him to be ingrossed: when he resolved to enter into a new War, he advised only with him that shold be Generall of his land-forces, and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, saying that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were needles being their offices to obey, and execute. The first day of his consultations was only to heare what they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16030:85"/>
could object against his propositions, the second what men and Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were needfull, and how to dispose of them; the third, and last was to give directions to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to put their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells in execution; He ordained that his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by land while he was upon the Sea, should be commanded by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, and upon the shoare the Admirall to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16030:85"/>
obey the land Generall, hee never bestowed charge, or office upon men of War, although they were of good mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that sued for them; Places that were voyd, hee conferred upon worthie men recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by his General. Parentage and Allies wrought no partiallitie, in him merrit only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, of all his men of war that were of note,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16030:86"/>
he ever kept a List, and caused memorialls to be abstracted of their time spent in the wars, their particular services, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of byrth, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; He was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that before all others they were meetest to be preferred to great places as well in peace as war, for they had the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est spirits to execute Justice, their experience best knew the humors
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16030:86"/>
of all sorts of men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their judgements were ripened, the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which themselves had felt, gave them a true feeling of poore mens wants. They which knew how to win, and defend king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, in reason should be best able to hold them in obedience: and concluded that valiant men were more sensible of honor, honestie and

humility, to be just, in judgements, charitable, and in his wayes direct, and then he might be sure, that <hi>God</hi> would blesse him both in this world, and in the world to come, [from his house of Albasadin the twentith day of Rageb <hi>anno</hi> 96.] Although he felt his disease incurable, yet the Phisitions ceased not to put him in hope of recovery, after some

him) rather to have been his prisoner, then to have seene him dead. In mourning garments with teares he followed his Corps to the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders, and Captaines did the like, and was in pompe interred with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in the Cittie of Zarvall. In this battaill also <hi>Tarif</hi> received a sleight wound in the arme wherof he died,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16030:114"/>
to do him honor <hi>Abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualit</hi> in black attended him to the grave, wept over him, and laid him by his brother, these fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls ended, with a wrathfull heart (in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other forme) he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med others, causing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution to be done upon the cheifest that ranne his brothers fortunes, the rest were pardoned, and having ordered his affairs (lately distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16030:115"/>
lived in peace.</p>
            <p>In Spaine the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Habdilbar</hi> (by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of his King) prosecuted <hi>Don Pelago</hi>; to be enformed of his strength he hyred a Renegado Spaniard to view his forces, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and abyding places: but taken by <hi>Don Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>'s guards was brought to him and tortured; yet his wit and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy quit him of suspition,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16030:115"/>
and being freed he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Cordova recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Habdilbar</hi> his perils, and discovery, assuring him that <hi>Don Pelago</hi> was weake in men, and Arms, and victuals; that is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest places were not dificil to winne, and that the Christians were full of feare; upon trust of these relations, the governor selecting out of his garrisons twelve
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:16030:116"/>
thousand choice foot (for of horse there was no use) marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Mountaines. All the force that <hi>Don Pelago</hi> did make, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not obove two thousand, with these he resolved to make the best defence he might, and reposing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his wit than in his sword, he divided them into many parts placing them upon
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16030:116"/>
straits and advantage of ground, yet so as they might upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons second one another, in the very first encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was in a bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie wood full of rocks (formerly possest by the Christians and where an armie could not march informe) <hi>Habdilbar</hi> was beaten put to a running retreit, and lost two thousand besides hurt men and prisoners,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16030:117"/>
wherwith enraged, to ease his Choller he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Renegado Spie and in dispaire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against men that were inhabitants in such inaccessible grounds (fortified by nature) he lost the enterprise till a further time, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Cordova.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abilqualit</hi> living in peace by an unlooked for accident was drawn into a new war which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:16030:117"/>
by the death of his father in law the King of Tunis, who decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing without any other heire than his daughter <hi>Omilhaire (Abilqualit</hi>'s wife) that kingdome in right did appertaine to her. Upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his death, the Arabian Monarch sent one of his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders <hi>Abenmarchan</hi> in his name to take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Realme,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16030:118"/>
which without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was effected, and the principall subjects sware their allegeance to him in the name of <hi>Abilqualit,</hi> proclaming him King; for a few monthes, no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance appeared, untill one called <hi>Haaken</hi> next heire male in blood to the deceased king (repy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the kingdome should fall to a distaffe, and therby in subjection

to a stranger) valuing himself worthie therof, by promise of reward, and under-hand meanes (alured many of the best qualitie) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and favor his clayme, his first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise was acted upon the person of <hi>Abenmarchan</hi> the governor, in assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his house, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and that done proclamed himselfe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16030:119"/>
King unto whom obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was sworn, <hi>Abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualit</hi> having advertis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his rebellion, dispatched a Post the second of Aprill 719/98 to <hi>Mura</hi> his governor in Moroccoes (with such forces as he could make) presently to repaire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who (with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream expedition) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse and foot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and victualled, and

shortly after arived in the port of Vaffa, in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, where <hi>Abilqualit</hi> had drawn to a head twentie five thousand foot, and eight hundred horse, with these troops (over whom <hi>Mura</hi> was ordained Leivetenant general) the king in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son put himself to Sea, and with favorable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther landed in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Tunis. To withstand the Assailant,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16030:120"/>
               <hi>Hacen</hi> (the usurping King) leavied forces consisting of fortie thousand foot, and eight thousand horse: In the first encounter <hi>Abilqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit</hi>'s losse was more than <hi>Hacens.</hi> Among others of note <hi>Ismael</hi> (the son of <hi>Mura</hi>) was wounded to the death, for which disaster <hi>Abilqualit</hi> being pensive: Sir said the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Mura</hi> (his father) my sonne came not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The day following being the ninth day of October 121/100 the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies joyned, <hi>Hacen</hi> was overthrown, and <hi>Abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualit</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:16030:121"/>
in triumph made his entrie into the Cittie of Tunis; but not accompting his victorie compleat (except <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>'s sonne were in his possession) he procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med large rewards to him, or them that could bring him alive or dead. Miserable <hi>Hacen</hi> (dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to extremities) was glad to cover himself in a desolate Cave, where being bayed by Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards

               <hi>Abilqualit,</hi> being for two yeeres together free from rebellion, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in blissefull peace, after the example of his father, and Grandfather resolved in his life time to settle the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his sonne <hi>Iacob Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor,</hi> a child of tender age, and to that end the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16030:126"/>
first day of March in <hi>anno</hi> 725/104 he assembled all his great men to his Court at Zarvall, who approving his intent, sware there obedience to the Prince as to the rightfull snccessor of that ample Monarchy. The forme used in the Ceremony ensueth. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilqualit</hi> Cloathed in royall Roabes, with Crown and Scepter, his Kingly ensignes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestically
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16030:126"/>
sitting in chiar of estate, his sonne upon his right hand, and the high priest upon the left, his Princes and guards being assembled, the high Priest with a loud and audible voyce declared the cause of summoning that royall Court, demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sweare their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obedience unto the Prince, they answered
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16030:127"/>
yea. Then said the high priest, in testimony that you have assented, all of you must doe as I and the king will shew you, thereupon the King rose, set his son in his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; the Prince in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his filial obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence kissed his Fathers right hand, the father blessed his child, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in humble reverence kissed his hand, and sate in his sonnes seate: the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16030:127"/>
high priest, and (after him) all the great men, falling at his feet did the like; then a priest appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in a Ceremoniall habit upon a board (in the middest of that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly) laid the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; the high priest ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from his seat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether they were all content to sweare by the living <hi>God</hi> and the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that book, to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:16030:128"/>
maintaine and defend <hi>Iacob Almanzor</hi> to be lawfull heire and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor to his father, King <hi>Abilqualit,</hi> in all his kingdoms and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, wherunto they answered content; the high Priest replyed, whosoever doth not constantly fulfill, and maintain his assent here given, let him be held a person infamous, a traytor to the royall
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:16030:128"/>
Crowne, and let the vengeance, and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne <hi>God</hi> fall upon him, and his; the assemblie answared Amen. Then the King rose from his seat, kissed the booke, and laid it upon his head, and returned to his place; the same was done by the high Priest and the rest; the high priest then turning to the Prince said. Your
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16030:129"/>
Highnesse must sweare by the most high and Soveraigne <hi>God,</hi> and by the contents of this holy booke (as King and Lord of these king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms) that you will administer and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Justice indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that you will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill and preserve unto them al the priviledges, and franchises (justly <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>ted by the Kings)
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16030:129"/>
your predecessors where by they may live in peace without grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Prince said he would be sworn unto it, if you do not said the high Priest accomplish your promise and oath, let that Vengeance and Malediction of the high and Soveraigne <hi>God</hi> fall upon you as upon him that is perjured, the Prince replyed Amen. Then the Prince rose
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16030:130"/>
from his Regall seat, kissed the booke, laid it upon his head, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his place, where pausing a little while, attended with all the guards in pompe, trumpets, and musicall instruments sounding: he rode to the principall Mosquita, prayed, and returned to his Palace where King <hi>Abilqualit</hi> attended his comming. The next day was spent
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16030:130"/>
in feasting, triumphs and other Martiall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, the day following they repaired againe to the Chamber of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, where the high priest demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were content to ratifie and affirme the oath they had taken, they answered, yea. Then the King <hi>Abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualit,</hi> the high priest, and the rest (according to their degrees) one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16030:131"/>
another with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reverence kissed the Princes hand, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them thanks the Ceremony ended.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the king sickned, his disease grew strong, and the Phisitians skill too weake to remedie it; the tender yeeres of his son required a Governor, to which office by his test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, he made electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one of his neere
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:16030:131"/>
men (in whose faith he reposed trust) called <hi>Mahomet Amzarij.</hi> Then laying aside all wordly busines, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred only with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, prayed inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly, died.</p>
            <p>The Queene Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager pleased with the ayre and seat of the Monastery where <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor</hi> died removed the yong King thither and in her motherly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16030:132"/>
love staid with him. The Kingly power was established in <hi>Mahomet Amzarij</hi> who finding himselfe obeyed as king despised the estate of a subject, and resolved to set the Crown upon his own head: the way unto it he conceived to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality towards all, but especially to the great officers, governors of Provinces, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; The men of war
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16030:132"/>
being his Creatures the rest were easily to be wrought. Unto them he was bountifull, and courteous, denying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sued for, and often giving before it was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. With this carriage he so inchanted their hearts, as his partie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med strong, but yet acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of great weight can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected without advice and ayde. The first man to whom he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16030:133"/>
discovered his pretence was <hi>Abenzulayman</hi> his creature, advanced by him to be one of the foure Councellors at war: but his heart detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horrible treason, used perswasions to him to give over the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, laying before his judgment the generall love borne to the yong king their naturall sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; the little hope of prevailing, the intestine
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16030:133"/>
war, and the hazard which the Empire should runne into, by it, and that the murther of the King (for murthred he must be) would make him odious unto all men, and not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the principall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors hearts from him, but raise the like ambition (by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in others to revolt and establish themselves kings in their particular
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16030:134"/>
governments. Though the traitorly Protector liked not the reply, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing squaring to his end, yet he gave him not over, hoping at last to win him to his bent, but he like an honest loyall Patriot stifly persevered in his disswasions; after many assaults, seeing no end of the Protectors tentations, afflicted in his Soule to ease him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and give remedy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16030:134"/>
to the danger which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily must ensue if he smothered it unto himselfe, he resolved to breath it out unto <hi>Mura</hi> the Governor of the Moroccoes (then being at the Court) and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, wisdom, wealth, and dignitie, unto him he discovered the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; to prevent it, they found no other meanes so good, as to know
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16030:135"/>
what course the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector would take in the execution therof; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was agreed, that <hi>Abenzulayman</hi> should seeme to like of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he repaired to the protector approved the designe, who told him that he had resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poyson, as the safest from danger, and least subject to hurt, which was not by the other contradicted. <hi>Abenzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layman</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:16030:135"/>
with a heavie heart returned to <hi>Mura,</hi> and in detestation of the intended plot, they resolved to take the Protectors life; but if they failed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise (lest perill might ensue to the yong king and his mother) <hi>Mura</hi> by consent went to the Monastery to give her a foreknowledg of it; who at the first stood fearefully amazed;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16030:136"/>
but by <hi>Mura</hi>'s stronger spirit received comfort, and he poasted back to the Protectors Court. In this meane while, the Protector attended his treasons, and sent the king for a present, a rich garment imbroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with pearle and stone artificially, and substantially poysoned.</p>
            <p>The carefull Queene, fearing what she found true, would not suffer
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16030:136"/>
the King (who was glad of his new Coat) to put it on; but the same night fastned it about a Greyhound, who in the morning was found dead swolth, and readie to burst. The Queene, like a wise Ladie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled her just displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, returned letters, and messengers of thanks both in the kings name and her own, and earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16030:137"/>
him to make his present repaire to the King about businesse of importance, which could neither admit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, nor his absence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his comming guards were set upon the gates by whom he was taken, bound, and brought to the Queene, where being charged of manifest treason (which could not be denyed) he was suffocated in a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16030:137"/>
of water; his dead bodie laid upon an Asse and carried through the streets, a cryer publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cause of his deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death <hi>Mura</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benzulayman</hi> had their severall hopes to succeed in the Protector-ship; but the Queene foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the troubles that might ensue, either in joyning them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, or to preferre the one before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:16030:138"/>
assumed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the King and his estate into her own hands, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased neither. <hi>Mura</hi> highly rewarded, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the government of his Provinces, and <hi>Abenzulaman</hi> had the kingdom of Tunis committed to his charge, but died upon the Sea in his passage thither.</p>
            <p>All things being in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:16030:138"/>
peace, and orderly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Queene in her government feared, and loved. The yong king in perfect health suddanly (when no cause of feare appeared) sorrow and discomfort tryumphed, the instrument of their victorie was a Spyder (which accidentally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the roofe of the Chamber) lighted upon the Kings face where he slept, and bit
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:16030:139"/>
his eyelid, the venom wherof infecting the blood, inflamed his face, and from thence disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it selfe into the other parts, where getting the masterie, within seaven daies he died, and the Queene the fifteenth day following with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch abstinence from meat ended her life in sorrow.</p>
            <p>The death of this yong King was the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
