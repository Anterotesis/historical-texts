            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Faire <hi>Berseba</hi> to Court he drew,</l>
                  <l>and made of her his royall Quéene.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then God that saw his wicked déed,</l>
                  <l>was angry at King <hi>Davids</hi> sinne:</l>
                  <l>The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> then with spéed,</l>
                  <l>came thus complaining unto him.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>O <hi>David,</hi> ponder what I say,</l>
                  <l>a great abuse I shall thée tell:</l>
                  <l>For thou that rul'st in equity,</l>
                  <l>shouldst sée the people ruled wel.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Two men within the City dwell,</l>
                  <l>the one is rich, the other poore:</l>
                  <l>The rich in Cattell doth excell,</l>
                  <l>the other nothing hath in store,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Saving one silly little Shéepe,</l>
                  <l>which yong he did with money buy:</l>
                  <l>With his owne bread he did it feed,</l>
                  <l>amongst his Children tenderly.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The rich man had a stranger came</l>
                  <l>unto his house that lov'd him deare,</l>
                  <l>The poore mans Shéepe therefore he tooke,</l>
                  <l>and thereof made his friend good chéere.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Because that he his owne would save,</l>
                  <l>he us'd the man thus cruelly:</l>
                  <l>Then by the Lord the King did sweare,</l>
                  <l>the rich man for that fault should die.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thou art the man, the Prophet said,</l>
                  <l>thy Princely Crowne God gave to thée:</l>
                  <l>Thy Lords wives thou thine owne hast made,</l>
                  <l>and many more of faire beauty.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Why hast thou so defilde thy life,</l>
                  <l>and slaine <hi>Vriah</hi> with the sword,</l>
                  <l>And taken home his wedded Wife,</l>
                  <l>regarding not Gods holy Word?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Therefore behold, thus saith the Lord,</l>
                  <l>great warres upon thy house shall be,</l>
                  <l>Because thou hast my Lawes abhord,</l>
                  <l>much ill be sure Jle raise on thee.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Ile take thy wives before thy face,</l>
                  <l>and give them to thy neighbours use:</l>
                  <l>And thou thereby shalt have disgrace,</l>
                  <l>for men shall laugh at thine abuse.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then <hi>David</hi> cryed out pittiously,</l>
                  <l>sore have I sinned against the Lord,</l>
                  <l>Have mercy God therefore on me,</l>
                  <l>let not my prayers be abhor'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But as the Prophet told to him,</l>
                  <l>so did it after chance indéed.</l>
                  <l>For God did greatly plague his sinne,</l>
                  <l>as in the Bible you may read.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The scourge of sinne thus you may sée,</l>
                  <l>for murther and adultery.</l>
                  <l>Lord grant that we may warned be,</l>
                  <l>such crying sinnes to shun and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
