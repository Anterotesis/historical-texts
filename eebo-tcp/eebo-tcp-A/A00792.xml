            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAuing receiued your letter, &amp;
therby vnderstanding aswel
what brute hath lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in your partes, concernyng
the deliuery of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City of Chester, from a most
monstrous and horrible kynde of
torment and disease, as also howe
desirous you are to learn the truth
therof: I am contented in gratefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
this your request, to signifye
herein as is for truth knowen and
accepted. The storye therfore was
thys:</p>
            <p>Anne Mylner a Mayden of the
age of .xviii. yeres, daughter to Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphe
Mylner, and broughte vp
<pb facs="tcp:20333:4"/>
in her Fathers house, wythin the
bridge strete of the same City, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the .xviii. daye of October last, to
bring her Fathers Kyne into the
fieldes. And at her returne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in the high way neare to the
City, was sodaynlye taken wyth
great feare, and thoughte that she
saw a whyte thing compassing her
round about, and so amased, came
to her fathers house, &amp; in the nexte
morning felt her selfe greued, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sore in al the partes of her body,
which so increased, that thereupon
she was enforced to keepe her bed,
beyng verye sicke. And during the
space of fyue dayes then next ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did not take anye kynde of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
sustenance, as her Parentes
hath sundry tymes declared. She
had her fyt and traunce almost fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
houre to houre, and had neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
three houres rest in the day &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20333:4"/>
night. Neyther did eate during the
time of her sycknes, but once in ech
xxiiii. houres, and then most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a litle quantitye of breade
and cheese, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
was done with wonderfull snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and rashnes.</p>
            <p>The maner of her disease and
sycknes was suche (as here after,
touching the time of her cure, shall
be more perticularly described) that
vnto her out of al partes of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
repayre of verye manye was
made. Yea, insomuche that after
Maister John Pierce, one of the
Canons of the Cathedrall churche
of Chester, and Reader of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinity
Lecture there, with diuers
persons of reputacion had sene the
Mayden, he with his Auditorye in
December last, at the ende of hys
Lecture, kneling vpon their knees
made speciall prayers vnto God,
<pb facs="tcp:20333:5"/>
for her deliuerace.</p>
            <p>After this it chaunced Mayster
John Lane, late fellow of Christs
Colledge in the Uniuersity of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
&amp; now a famous and godly
Preacher of the Gospell of Jesus
Christ, within the County of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
preaching at Torperley, at the
request of Raufe Done Esouyer, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout
the xxi. of Januarye last, met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with two men of the sayd Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the one being a nere neyghbour
to this woful woman: who then a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong
other talke, demaunded of
Maister Lane, whether ther were
not some possessed wyth spirits as
in times past, and for confirmacion
hereof spake of the sayd Mayden,
&amp; alledged the horryblenes of her
torment to be suche, at the time of
her traunce, that it could argue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but that she was posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with some spirite. And further
<pb facs="tcp:20333:5"/>
said, that she had remayned in that
miserable plight .xv. or. xvi. wekes,
and (as I suppose, hauing hearde
howe it is well knowen to diuers
credible persons in these partes,
what rare and syngular remedye
god hath wrought by M. Lane, to
some that sustained of late no smal
decay of minde and memory, or els
being of that religion, as in theese
dayes seeke myracles to confirme
Gods woorde) desyred him at his
next comming to the City of Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to see the tormented May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and they would bring him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her.</p>
            <p>Maister Lane then condecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their request, &amp; at his next
repayre vnto the sayd City, lodged
in the house of Syr William Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerly
Knight, wheron Friday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the .xvi. of Februarye laste (at
which time the Assise was hloden
<pb facs="tcp:20333:6"/>
in Chester) met agayne by occasion
with the sayd two men: who after
they had put hym in remembrance
of hys promise, &amp; had disclosed the
maner of the Maydens torment to
Syr William Caluerley, syr Wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Sneyd Knightes, and my La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye
Caluerley, with diuers other
then desirous to see the Mayden,
went al together, and brought mai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster
Lane vnto the sayd Mylners
house (to see the Mayden, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to hym vnknowen) about two of
the clocke in the after noone of the
same .xvi. day of February, &amp; there
finding the Mayden in her traunce
after her accustomed maner, lying
in a bed within the haule, her eyes
halfe shut, shalfe open, looking as
she had bene agast, neuer mouyng
either eye or eye lyd, her teeth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
open, with her toung doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
betwene, her face somewhat
<pb facs="tcp:20333:6"/>
red, her head as heauy as leade to
lift at, she lay stil as a stone, and fee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
her pulce, it beat with as good
measure, as if she had bene in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
health. And in this sort behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her, almost during the fourth
part of an houre, her bellye began
to moue, swelling vp &amp; down, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
beneath her chest, sometyme
vp to the throte, in suche vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that a man would haue thought
she would haue burst. Then soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
she lifteth her self vp in her bed,
bending backwards in such order,
that almost her head and fete met,
falling downe somtime on the one
syde, somtime on the other, but ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
againe so sodenly, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
could not imagine howe if
might bee possible so quicklye shee
coulde without ayde of hande, cast
her selfe (her belly being vpwarde)
into the fourme of a hoope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20333:7"/>
Maister Lane demaunded of
her that kepte this cruell handled
creature, whether shee coulde not
keepe her downe? Who answered
no, and sayd that she had once try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and then was almost cast into
the fyre. Then desired he that she
woulde permitte him to assay if
hee coulde holde this dolefull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
downe. Shee aunswered
yea, but yet sayd it woulde not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l said Maister Lane, by
the grace of God it may preuayle.
And therupon after that this piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had lifted her self. 4. or
v. times in such wonderful maner
as before is noted, hee tooke her in
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; with much ado pluckt down
her feete, and wyth more ado kept
them downe, holdinge her handes,

she was possessed.</p>
            <p>The people present, seing hym
so to continue with her, and her
paines encrease, some thought best
he should let her alone, saying that
it woulde haue the course. Whom
maister Lane desired to be quyet,
and let God woorke, willing them
to pray to God for her, for asmuche
as in him onely consisteth her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
from that payne, and that
god was as stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as euer he was.
And when she was in the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
panges the beholders called vpon
god for her, maister Lane secretly
sayd the fifty Psalm, &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desired
God, through the bloud of his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
Jesus Christ, to ease the Maiden,
not doubting of his mercye in that
behalfe.</p>
            <p>And when he had thus striued
with her the space of two houres,
that the drope trickled downe hys
<pb facs="tcp:20333:8"/>
face, he had thought to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her vnto God: but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
it came to mynde to tary the
end, and so began a freshe to striue
with her, euer secretly praying &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud of Christ, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
her belly was pressed downe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as
much weight &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth as could be,
by those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wer present, she stryued
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, and diuers times
with the vehement swelling of her
bellye, shee was verye like to haue
throwne them ouer, that so helde
downe her body.</p>
            <p>At the last Maister Lane cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for viniger, wherat the sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders
by marueiled, saying, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing
with muche more had bene often
tymes attempted, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Notwithstanding he ceased
not to call styll for it, saying, that
God might do that then, which he
did not before, and so receiued vini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger,
<pb facs="tcp:20333:8"/>
put it into his mouth &amp; blewe
it into the Mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nostrels, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
she cryed a Lady, Lady. He the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
willed her to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, and the
bloud of Christ, &amp; in these doinges
she being astonied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he called againe
for more viniger. Wherat she cried:
No, no, no more for Gods sake.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maister Lane willed her to
speake &amp; say after him, &amp; so he &amp; all
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> present, said the Lords prayer
&amp; <hi>Te deum,</hi> she saying after them.</p>
            <p>After this her deliueraunce, she
then continually called vpon God,
and by the appointment of maister
Lane, she had her clothes put on, &amp;
meate brought, wherof she did eat
a little. This done, maister Lane
willed to try whether she could go.
Whereunto, albeit that those then
present answered that it was not
possible, for that shee had not gone
in al the time of .xvii. weekes then
<pb facs="tcp:20333:9"/>
last past, yet master Lane affirmed
that the same God which gaue her
speche, could geue her strength also
to go: and so departing the place,
vntill the women had gotten on
her hosen, and then comming in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
wyl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other syde of the house, whych
she did. And thereupon after talke
had wyth her of the maner of her
taking, &amp; admonishing her to haue
a stedfast faith in Christ, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
her selfe in praier, left her.</p>
            <p>My Lady Caluerley, maistres
Erauenor, wyfe to John Eraue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
with diuers other credible per
so as wer present, during such time
as mayster Lane was wyth the
mayden, and are eye wytnesses to
these his doinges.</p>
            <p>The next day following, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Lane preached at saynt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:20333:9"/>
within the sayde Citye, before
John Chrogmarton Esquier, the
Quenes maiesties high Justice in
the Countye of Chester, at whych
sermon the late recouered Maiden
was present.</p>
            <p>Upon this so wonderful a cure
great talke was had in eche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
within the City, that therup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on

maister Lane afterwardes vppon

maister Rogers. Archdeacon of
Chester, in his sermon made in the
Cathedrall Church of Chester, the

Assaphats, with a great multitude
of the Citizens besides, hauing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb facs="tcp:20333:10"/>
offered by the wordes of the
then present Gospel, touched thys
fact: Alledging that what so euer
was the originall cause of so great

cure wonderfull, and wrought by
God, either to the great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
