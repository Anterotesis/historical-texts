            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE occaſion of writing this Treatiſe was to hinder
the miſchief that the Book it is deſigned to Anſwer
was like to do, which having lain ſo many Months
without an Anſwer, I did reaſonably preſume
there was none deſign'd, and therefore I thought ſuch a one
as I could ſupply, would be better than none at all. I ſhould
never have troubled the World with this, if I had had the
leaſt <hi>Item</hi> of Mr. <hi>Long</hi>'s deſign; but that was perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to me till theſe Papers were wrote out fair for the
Preſs.</p>
            <p>As to the Method I have taken in the anſwering this Book,
I have followed the Authour in his own, and have given <hi>his</hi>
Titles to each of the Chapters. In thoſe Chapters, in which
he moſt impugns our Saviour's Divinity, I have traced him
ſtep by ſtep, and given an Anſwer to every Shadow of an
Argument that he brings. In other Chapters, where there
are only oblique ſtroaks againſt the Doctrine of the Trinity,
or which are only Introductory to his main Deſign, I have
only ſummed up the Subſtance of them, and ſo given an
Anſwer to them in general; or at leaſt to ſo much of them as
ſeemed to make againſt the Truth of this Doctrine, or any
other important Truth of our Religion. Now, it may, by
ſome perhaps, be thought unfair, when I uſe theſe Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>The Authour would inſinuate, would pretend,</hi> &amp;c. when he
does not, in expreſs Terms, aſſert that thing in his Book.
But it muſt be conſidered, That it was the Authour's deſign,
<pb facs="tcp:45010:4"/>
not to let his Book appear with too Heretical a Face, but to
lay his Premiſes ſo, that the Reader ſhould often draw his
Conſequences for him, without his ſetting them down in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Words. This is a Subtilty which is common to all ſuch
ſort of Writers, that dare not ſpeak out their full Minds;
though, by the way, I think this Authour has as little min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the matter as any. But however, I have carefully endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
not to pervert his Senſe; but to take his words in that
meaning, which any indifferent Reader would think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
deſigned they ſhould be underſtood in. If I have any where
miſt his Meaning, 'tis thro' Miſtake, and not thro' Wilfulneſs.
And in truth, I am not abſolutely ſure, after the greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
that I have always hit his Senſe: for he has a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
way of Writing, different from all the Writers of the age,
his Periods are long and uneven, filled with odd ſort of Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and affected Phraſes, broken with unnatural <hi>Parentheſes,</hi>
and almoſt conſtant <hi>Hyperbatons;</hi> which, to be ſure, will
occaſion Obſcurity in his Book: ſo that if I have miſtaken
his Meaning upon this account, he is to charge that upon
himſelf, and not upon his Anſwerer. In ſhort, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
this Task, with all the fairneſs I could, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
not to triumph over my Adverſary, but to evince the
Truth; to vindicate the Honour of my Bleſſed Saviour,
which was here ſo highly calumniated, and to aſſert the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Holy, undivided Trinity, into the belief of
which I was baptized, and in which I hope, by God's grace,
to die.</p>

               <head>AN
ANSWER
TO THE
PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THE Authour in this, by as much as can be gather'd
from him, goes upon two Arguments to overturn the
Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity; the firſt is, Becauſe,
as he pretends, the Diſputes about this have been the
decaying of Chriſtianity, and the prevailing of Mahometaniſm
in the Eaſt: the ſecond is, Becauſe, as he ſays, this Doctrine is
contrary to the great Simplicity in which the Goſpel was deliver'd,
and, which it does recommend. In the proof of the firſt of theſe
he ſpends half his Preface, and indeed has got through four of
his long Columns, before he comes to any thing that looks like a
Concluſion from his Premiſes. Soon he is admiring the ſwift Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of Chriſtianity through the World, notwithſtanding the
Power and Malice of its Adverſaries, and the Meanneſs of its
Propagators; and ſoon again he is as humble an Admirer of the
good fortune of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion; and withal, makes this moſt
Chriſtian concluſion, That <hi>the wonderful Progreſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
was not a more powerful evidence of its Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than the Progreſs of Mahometaniſm was for that of
the Alchoran.</hi> But then again, upon ſecond thoughts, he is a
little for recalling himſelf, and gives the Advantage ſomewhat on
the Goſpel ſide, from the power of Arms, which the Arabian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
uſed, and ſomething from the imparity of his Doctrines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:45010:9"/>
and the life of their Authour, whom he calls a <hi>lewd,
brain-ſick Scoundrel,</hi> with much more good manners and reverence
than he termed our Saviour, juſt before, <hi>a crucified Vagabond.</hi>
And then, a little after, he is ſo juſt to Chriſtianity again, as to
grant, that Mahometaniſm had not the advantage againſt her in
truth of Doctrine, but only by permiſſion of Divine Providence,
which had predicted the removal of the Candleſtick out of its
place; but the great occaſions of this removal, he tells us, were
the great Innovations made in Chriſtianity, and the hot Diſputes,
eſpecially concerning the Firſt and Second Perſons of the Trinity;
which had ſo changed the Goſpel, that <hi>were an Apoſtle to return
into the world, he would be ſo far from owning, that he would
not be able to underſtand it;</hi> and ſo leaves it as a moot Point, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Mahomet <hi>or the Chriſtian Doctors have more corrupted
the</hi> Goſpel. Though at laſt he ſeems to determine it againſt the
Doctors, and for <hi>Mahomet;</hi> becauſe he allows him to have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
all the Doctrines</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith, which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
it ſeems had deſtroyed, and becauſe their Doctrines (of the
Trinity) <hi>had provoked our Lord to divorce himſelf from his
Churches, and ſo did incourage,</hi> and impower <hi>the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to ſeduce and ruin them.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of half his
Preface, the parts of which hang ſo looſe, without any connection,
and are ſo odly jumbled together, that I dare ſay, hardly ever any
Man of Letters, before our Author, drew a Concluſion from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
ſo looſely laid; and I am afraid his Friends, the Socinians,
are too great Lovers of Reaſon to hope for much credit or advantage
to their Cauſe, from one that is ſo little a Maſter of ordinary Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.
For in all this <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ddle of words, here is not one tittle of proof
of the thing he would be at; and what is worſe, 'tis ſomewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to know what that is; all that one can gueſs from what he has
been ſaying, is, That the determinations of the Councils, and the
Writings and Diſputes of the Fathers, concerning the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
againſt the Hereticks, were the chief cauſes of the prevailing
of the Mahometan Religion. He mentions indeed with theſe the
Doctrine of Image-worſhip, but that is only to ſhew the Doctrine of
the Trinity in bad Company; for 'tis plain, by the tenour of his
<pb facs="tcp:45010:9"/>
Book, that his deſign was not against the worſhip of Images. I ſhall
therefore ſhew, Firſt, That the Doctrine of the Trinity could give
no occaſion to the progreſs of Mahometaniſm. Secondly, What
were the occaſion of the prevailing of it; and this, I preſume,
will be a full Anſwer to the firſt half of his Preface.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Doctrine of the Trinity could give no occaſion
to the progreſs of Mahometaniſm.</p>
               <p>As for the Doctrine it ſelf, I cannot ſee how that ſhould gain
<hi>Mahomet</hi> Proſelytes, any more than any other Doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:
the Impoſtor himſelf diſliked it, 'tis true; becauſe as long as
this Doctrine was believed, his pretended Revelations would never
be received; for 'twould be in vain for him to offer to the World
his Doctrines, which were contrary to thoſe that were before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Eternal Son of God. He pretended to be no more than a
meer Prophet, and therefore could never preſume to undo what was
believed to be ſetled perſonally by God himſelf. Beſides the ſillineſs
of his arguing againſt the Generation of the Son, ſhewed, that he
little understood the merits of that Cauſe, one of whoſe Arguments
is, what <hi>Servetus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Debuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ergo dicere, quòd habebat ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualem; vel quòd ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ipſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculo-ſoemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, aut Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus, &amp;c. <hi>Serv. de Err. Trin. Lib.</hi> 1.</note> the Reviver of this Authour's Hereſy, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from him, becauſe God, forſooth,<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Alch.</hi> cap. 15.</note> has no Wife. So that
there is the ſame reaſon why this Deceiver ſhould condemn this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Lord's Divinity, which obſtructed his Ambition, as
he did that of Chriſtian Mortification and Self-denial, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
his Luſt. And the Author, with the ſame reaſon, might
arraign all the admirable Lectures the holy Scripture gives us of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
and Chaſtity for falſe Doctrine too, only becauſe they were
condemned by this Impoſtor.</p>
               <p>But as for the diſputes about this Doctrine, at the time of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s
appearing, they were well-nigh laid aſleep; the Arian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
were almoſt forgot by the eager diſputes in the <hi>Apollinarian,
Neſtorian</hi> and <hi>Eutychian</hi> Controverſies, and the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
had fully determined the laſt Controverſy nigh 200 years
before the World heard any thing of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The number of
the <hi>Arians</hi> at this time was very ſmall, and they were chiefly at
that time, according to<note n="*" place="bottom">Sand. Nucl. Eccl. ad annum.</note> 
                  <hi>Sandius</hi> himſelf, in <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Where they were Condemned by the firſt Council of <hi>Toledo.</hi> An. 587.</note>, and their
<pb facs="tcp:45010:10"/>
Diſputes there could not give any great ſcandal to the Saracens on
the other ſide the World. The greateſt Controverſies now on foot were
in the Eaſt, the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> or the Aſſertors of one Will in Chriſt;
in the Weſt was ſtill remaining the Controverſy about the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> And theſe the Impoſtor takes no notice of, unleſs
he includes them in the general, amongſt the Diviſions which he did
condemn amongſt the Chriſtians.<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>2. Now ſecondly, As to the certain reaſons why Mahometaniſm
ſhould with ſuch a violent inundation of a ſudden over-run the
Eaſtern World, they can be known only to God himſelf, the great
Diſpoſer of all Events, whoſe Judgments are unſearchable, and his
ways past finding out. But if we turn our Eyes upon ſecond Cauſes,
we may find ſeveral at this time, which either of themſelves helped
the ſpreading of this falſe Prophet's Impoſtures, or at leaſt provoked
God to permit this contagion to prevail. Which were firſt, The
Calamitous Eſtate of Chriſtendom at that time; nay, the whole World
was under that commotion which it never felt before, and by God's
Grace never may again. The Goths, and Hunns, the Avares,
Lumbards and Bulgarians, were ravaging all the Weſtern Empire,
the Saxons not long before had over-run <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Perſians
were making as great devaſtations in the Eaſt; ſo that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were not in a Capacity of reſisting their other Enemies, much
leſs of hindering the Incurſions of the Saracens. Secondly, The
Negligence of the Popes and Patriarchs, who lay wrangling in the
defence of their Errours, and in gaining Privileges and Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to their Sees<note n="†" place="margin">A little before this time, according to <hi>Bede,</hi> A. D. 1612. the Supremacy and Title of Oecumenical Biſhop, was granted to <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, by the wicked Parricide <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> who murdered his Maſter and Predeceſſour in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>Mauritius.</hi>
                  </note>, and did not lend any aſſiſtance
towards the ſecuring their Flocks from this Wolf,
till 'twas past all recovery; and even the holy Wars
which the Popes were ſo zealous for afterwards,
ſeem'd deſigned more to keep the hands of active
Princes a-work, leaſt they ſhould attempt any thing
againſt their See, or out of an odd Superſtition to
the Holy Land, and our Saviour's Sepulcher, than
out of any truly pious deſign to revive Chriſtianity. Thirdly, The
Method he took to propagate his Religion by Fire and Sword; for
he had no ſooner Conquered any City or Country, but the poor wretched
<pb facs="tcp:45010:10"/>

his Forgeries, or<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. de Oppido. Vincentius. Alch. <hi>Cap.</hi> 52.</note> elſe were immediately to be butcher'd by his
Souldiers. Fourthly, But the great cauſes of all which provoked
God to ſuffer the Candleſticks to be removed from theſe Churches,
were, the great decay of Piety in the World, and the many Errours
and Superſtitions which had then crept into the Church, whoſe Doctrine
and practice had then ſo vaſtly degenerated from thoſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the firſt Ages. That Love and Charity, which was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
in the Primitive Profeſſors, was turned into Pride and
Contention, and a pertinacious obstinacy in diſputes and deſire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
the former ſtrictneſs and circumſpectneſs of Life, was
changed, after the peace in the Church under Chriſtian Emperours,
into diſſoluteneſs and Luxury, and the other concomitants of thoſe
Vices. Errours and Superſtitions were every day crowing into the
Church, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, Prayers for the Dead, Reliques,
Doctrine of Merits, Prayers in an unknown Tongue, Purgatory,
Prohibition of Marriage in the Clergy, Monaſtick Life, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Meats, Veſts, Tonſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which were brought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or in ſome meaſure uſed by this Age; and Image-Worſhip,
which our Authour mentions, began a little to appear<note n="†" place="margin">And Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done by them. <hi>Niceph. Hiſt. Lib. 18. cap. 41, &amp;</hi> 42.</note>, though it was
far from ſetling till the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice, A. D.</hi> 787. So that
our Authour is a little out in his Chronology, when he ſays, <hi>the
then late eſtabliſhment of Image-worſhip, gave a tempting
opportunity to the Impoſtor,</hi> &amp;c. For that Impoſtor ſet on foot
his Doctrines above 150 years before the eſtbliſhment of Image-worſhip.
For from the year 622, the year of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s ſlight,
ſometime after he had diſſeminated his Doctrines, to the year 787.
are preciſely 165 years, and ſo much the Authour is out of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and his Chronology; unleſs he will allow the <hi>Arabian</hi> Doctor,
by his prophetick Spirit, to have foreſeen ſo far the determinations
of this Council. And now, I hope, I have made it appear, that
the determinations of the first Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> about the Trinity,
which was 300 years before <hi>Mahomet,</hi> gave no more incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Impoſture, than the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did, which
was 150 years after; and if I have done ſo, I am very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45010:11"/>
I have but one word more to ſay in vindication of the Orthodox
Belief from this aſperſion, which is, That I do not find any of her
Profeſſors to have been Abettors of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Doctrine; but I
wiſh our Authour's Friends, among the Heterodox, could ſay ſo
much; for we read, that there aſſiſted him in his Forgeries, one
<hi>Sergius</hi> a Nestorian, and <hi>Johannes Antiochenus</hi> an Arian.<note n="*" place="margin">Zonaras Tom. 3. Paul. Diac. Lib 18. Vincent. lib. 23.</note>
Nay, 'tis a report commonly received, that <hi>Servetus</hi> borrowed his
Hereſy from the Mahometans in <hi>Africa</hi>

of the Arian Doctrine did aſſist in compoſing the Alchoran,
and the Alchoran did conduce to the reviving of Arianiſm; and
now let the Reader judge which have contributed more, the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
or the Hereticks, to the propagation of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion.
As to his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian aſſertion, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> profeſſed all the
Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith, which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in their Decree, it may be expected I ſhould ſay ſomething
to that; but that is an expreſſion ſo horrid in all Chriſtian Ears,
that it needs no Antidote; 'tis a Blaſphemy ſo loud and palpable,
that it exacts rather the Iron of the Hangman, than the Anſwer of
a Christian. Bleſſed Jeſus! that ever thy holy Religion ſhould be
thus vilified! that a Christian ſhould aſſert, that ſuch a profligate
Wretch, that carried on his Impoſtures by Villainy and Lewdneſs,
that tolerated in his Followers, Murders and Thefts, Rapes and
Sodomies, and was himſelf most eminent in all theſe wickedneſſes,
that he ſhould be ſaid by a Christian to profeſs all the Articles of
thy holy Religion, which commands the utmoſt goodneſs and purity,
both of Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II.</hi> The ſecond Argument which our Authour goes upon to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
the Doctrine of the Trinity is, becauſe, as he would inſinuate,
it is contrary to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel. And in proving of
this he uſes as much prevarication and ſhuffling, as if he had been
trained up in a College of Jeſuits. For when he ſhould ſhew his
Reader, how much the Doctrine of three Perſons, being one God, is
contrary to the Goſpel ſimplicity, he runs off from this to ſeveral
other corruptions which have happened to the Goſpel, and which the
maintainers of this Doctrine are not the least concerned to anſwer
for. 'Tis one of the excellencies of the Christian Religion, as he
<pb facs="tcp:45010:11"/>
well obſerves, that the poor have the Goſpel preached unto them;
that is, that the Doctrines of the Christian Religion are ſuch, as
the meanest capacities may understand; the Truths which it does
deliver are not strange Philoſophical notions, or expreſſed in high,
Rhetorical strains, or (as the Apostle ſpeaks) in enticing words
of Mans Wiſdom. But how does he prove that it may not be ſo for
all the Doctrine of the Trinity? Why, the Authour is pretty civil
as to that point, and becauſe he would not be too hard upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
turns the point of his Argument againſt the old Gnoſicks,
and fetches a Text or two out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to confound them. <hi>If any
one preach another Jeſus whom we have not preached—you
might well bear with him,</hi> or as the Authour tranſlates it,
<hi>could you well bear with him?</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 1. Which, by the way,
is a falſe tranſlation: for there is no Authority for any ſuch reading
by way of Interrogation. The words in the Text are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ye <hi>might well bear,</hi> without the word <hi>him.</hi> And if our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were to be altered, it ought rather to be, <hi>you might well bear
with me;</hi> for that is moſt agreeable to the Apostle's deſign: for he
is deſiring the Corinthians to excuſe his boaſting, as <hi>v.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>and I pray bear with me.</hi> The like he endeavours to
prove from <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed
from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Goſpel, which is not another. If an Angel from Heaven
preach any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed.</hi> From all which
he draws theſe four Theſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis poſſible the Goſpel may be ſo diſguiſed by Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that though it ſtill retain its genuine Principles, it may appear
another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis poſſible ſuch Innovations may be ſo obvious, that
people may diſcover them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe that depart from ſuch Innovators are not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
but faithful Believers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Be the Innovators never ſo high in Authority, we
muſt be ſo far from paying them Implicit Faith, that we muſt not
pay them ordinary Charity, but hold them accurſed.</p>
               <p>The Author has been here at a great deal of pains to lay his
<pb facs="tcp:45010:12"/>
matter in order, though I believe it will make little to his purpoſe.
For we will grant all that he has been here ſaying is true, if he lets
the matter lie, as the Apoſtle left it, againſt the Gnoſticks. Nay,
but perhaps the Trinitarians will not ſo eaſily get off here. And
truly any one that underſtands the deſign of the Authour's Book,
would expect from theſe Propoſitions ſome wonderful confutation of
the Trinitarian Doctrines. But our Authour very cunningly lets
that alone, and by a <hi>Hocus-Pocus</hi> trick, claps before our Eyes ſome
Romiſh corruptions, which were occaſioned, he tells us, <hi>by people
that heaped to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears,</hi> and
thoſe Teachers <hi>heaped to themſelves Doctrines to ſcratch that
itch;</hi> and ſo the Monks by ſcratching and clawing one another,
ſcratched themſelves into all the errours of the School-Divinity.
Therefore he concludes, that there being ſuch errours that deſtroy
the Goſpel ſimplicity, and we being not to be ſaved <hi>by the greateſt
humane authority</hi> (he means general Councils) or <hi>to put our
Souls in a Lottery;</hi> we muſt therefore ſee what thoſe Doctrines
are, which deſtroy the Goſpel ſimplicity; which cannot better be
managed, he tells us, than by the three enquiries of his Book.</p>
               <p>Now though for all the Authour has ſaid to this point, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity is very ſafe, yet becauſe he would ſlily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that this Doctrine is one of thoſe Romiſh Errours that
deſtroy the ſimplicity of Chriſtianity, I think fit to make him this
Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the belief of the bleſſed Trinity is very conſiſtent
with the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Religion. For if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in that Doctrine, but what a Man of ordinary capacity may
underſtand, as much at leaſt as is requiſite for his belief, and as far
as his judgment tells him 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe ſuch a thing
ſhould be understood; I cannot ſee why this Doctrine ſhould dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from the ſimplicity of Chriſtianity. Now Firſt in this doctrine
there is nothing but what a Man of mean parts may underſtand, as
far as is requiſite for his belief; for 'tis not requiſite that ſuch a
Man (or indeed any Man) ſhould fully underſtand all that he does
believe; for that would not be belief but ſcience: 'tis enough for
belief, that a Man has undoubted Teſtimony that ſuch a thing is
<pb facs="tcp:45010:12"/>
ſo, whether he underſtands the manner, or perhaps the poſſibility of
its being ſo or not. We are wont to take many things upon Truſt
from the Mouths of Men learned in their reſpective Sciences, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of which we are far from understanding; and Mathematicians
can demonstrate many Truths, and which Men unlearned in their
Science take upon their words, though to them they ſeem otherways
impoſſible. Now if it be reaſonable, that a plain unlearned Man
ſhould believe many things which he does not understand from the
teſtimony of wiſer and more knowing Men, I think it a leſs impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
upon the underſtandings of plain Men, to require them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a revealed Truth from the Teſtimony of the All-wiſe and
All-knowing God. Secondly, A plain Man underſtands as much
in this Doctrine, as his judgment tells him it is reaſonable he
ſhould underſtand in a matter of that nature; and 'tis highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
for any Man to expect more. If any one indeed, how
wiſe ſoever, ſhould tell the plain Man that Bread is Fleſh, the plain
Man would think this unreaſonable to believe; becauſe he knows
the difference between Bread and Fleſh, as well as any one can tell
him; and becauſe then he is required to disbelieve his Senſes in a
matter of which they are the properest Judges. But if this plain
Man be informed, by an undoubted Teſtimony, of ſomething which
indeed he does not underſtand concerning God, whoſe nature and
eſſence his reaſon tells him is not to be understood, or any one elſe,
though of the greateſt learning or reaſon; this he is with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſubmiſſion ready to believe, and when he has full aſſurance of the
undoubtedneſs of the Teſtimony which confirms this, his belief does
not in the leaſt boggle at what 'is ſo delivered. For a Perſon
of the ordinarieſt reaſon that believes a God and his Attributes,
must be ſure, that in that infinite being there are infinite mysteries,
that is, Truths which are not to be understood by finite capacities;
and if it has pleaſed God's Wiſdom, to reveal the <hi>Eſſe</hi> of one of
theſe mysteries to us, that there are Father, Son and Holy-Ghost,
three Perſons and one God; though the <hi>Modus</hi> of this Truth does
ſurpaſs our understandings, yet he acknowledges, that this belief is
reaſonable, becauſe 'tis irrational for him to think his finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
ſhould comprehend all the mysterious Truths in an infinite
Deity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45010:13"/>
Secondly, 'Tis not requiſite that every plain ſimple Man, of whom
the belief of the Trinity is required, as being a divine Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in Scripture; that he ſhould underſtand all the Questions,
which are controverted by learned Men about this Doctrine: All the
diſputes about Hypoſtaſis's and Perſonalities, Generations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions;
for there were thouſands of good Christians went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before theſe Controverſies were started in the World, or before
theſe terms were ever heard of. So that 'tis a great mistake of the
Adverſaries of this Doctrine, to think that we impoſe it as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to every ordinary Man's Salvation to underſtand, and to give
an expreſs aſſent to all the determinations of theſe Queſtions: 'tis
enough for him to believe the Doctrine in general, as he finds it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in Scripture; and to leave the more particular diſquiſition of
it to more learned Men. And beſides, 'tis not the fault of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
in the Church, that ever theſe Diſputes happened, or that
ever theſe names were coined: we may thank the Hereticks for all
this, for they began first to oppugn the received Faith by new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and ſtrange gloſſes upon Scripture, and then the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
in their own defence, were forced to vindicate the Orthodox
Faith; and ſo becauſe by reaſoning upon ſupernatural Truths, which
never came into ſo strict diſquiſition before, they had occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
new words to expreſs theſe Truths by, to prevent long ambages
and circumlocutions in diſcourſe; or otherwiſe the World had never
been troubled to this day with Hypoſtaſis's, <hi>Homoouſios</hi>'s, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiality.
But after all this clamour against the Orthodox,
the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves (not to mention the <hi>Arians)</hi> build their
points of Faith upon greater niceties, or elſe how come they to bring
in their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into Divinity? that <gap reason="foreign">

the ſupream God, but not with it; which is a falſe as well as
a fooliſh Criticiſm. Or elſe how come they to make uſe of that pretty
distinction of a God by Nature, and a God by Office?</p>
               <p>Then follow his three Queries, in which he promiſes <hi>to act no
leſs ſincerely than courageouſly,</hi> but I am afraid he has failed
in the former; for if, I mistake not, his Confidence has generally
the tranſcendent of his Sincerity, which is the common fate of all
Hereticks. His Queries are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45010:13"/>
1. What was that Goſpel which our Lord and his Apoſtles
preached as neceſſary to be believed?</p>
               <p>2. What alterations or additions have after Ages made in it?</p>
               <p>3. What Advantage or Damage hath thereupon enſued.</p>
               <p>Now as to theſe Queries, I am willing to follow him in the
ſearch of them; and I pray God to give him grace to be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in them hereafter, than he was, or at least would be thought
to be, when he was writing this Book. And ſo I ſhall take my

               <head type="sub">What was the Goſpel our Lord and his Apostles preached, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation.</head>
               <p>HERE the Authour ſhews a little Sophiſtry, whilſt in
his Query at firſt he ſays <hi>neceſſary to be believed,</hi> but in
his tranſcribing it in the Front of this Chapter, he
ſays <hi>neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> The firſt expreſſion he
uſes, as the more ſoft, to make his Queries, as they
lie together, ſeem more reaſonable; the ſecond he
makes uſe of, as the more harſh, thereby to inſinuate the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of the Orthodox, who make a right Belief of the Trinity neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Salvation. Now, though we will not quarrel with the Authour
about this change of his Terms, which is never to be allowed in fair
Diſputes, eſpecially in the Queſtion it ſelf which is to be diſcuſſed;
yet we muſt allow a great deal of Difference between a thing's being
neceſſary to be believed, and being neceſſary to Salvation. A thing
may be neceſſary to be believed, when it is a certain Truth plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in Scripture; ſo that a man cannot, in all points, believe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
without the belief of that too, and the belief of that Point is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
required to make him a full, compleat, Orthodox Believer;
but then, a thing is neceſſary for Salvation, when it is ſo of the very
Fundamentals of Religion, that the Scripture does not allow of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
without the belief of this; but whether the Doctrine of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45010:15"/>
Bleſſed Trinity be of this neceſſity is another diſpute: only from
hence it appears, That neceſſity of believing, and neceſſity in order
to Salvation are not equivalent Expreſſions, and which, I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Authour did not uſe without deſign.</p>
               <p>The Authour, in the beginning of this Chapter, gives an account
of the excellence of the Chriſtian Religion, and that it was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by our Saviour, to deliver us from the diſcipline of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, and to exalt natural Religion to its utmoſt perfection:
and ſo far right—Then he goes farther to tell us, that its Doctrines
were the ſame which were ſo legibly imprinted in the moſt ignorant
minds, that every one, without any Inſtructer, might read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
And ſo, with this notion of the Chriſtian Religion in his
head, and <hi>this Teſt,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>in his hand,</hi>  very champion-like,
<hi>as he ſafely may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 1. What was the
Goſpel which our Saviour and his Apoſtles preached?</hi> And here our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
to make ſhort work, at firſt daſh reduces the Doctrines to
Two, Faith and Repentance; and then to Faith and no Repentance;
and then again to Repentance and no Faith; he might as well have
rung the changes once more, and have reduced it to no Faith and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and then he had cut the Goſpel ſhort enough. Now from
all this he would make us believe, That the Doctrine of the Bleſſed
Trinity, which the Orthodox require to be believed of good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is contrary to what our Saviour required of his Followers. Now
here are <hi>Three</hi> things which lack a little animadverſion. <hi>Firſt.</hi> His
ſaying that the Doctrines of Chriſtianity were ſo legibly imprinted
in the moſt ignorant Men's minds, that every one, without any <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor,
might read and underſtand them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity is contrary to this Plainneſs. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
this Doctrine is contrary to the ſewneſs of the Chriſtian Precepts.</p>
               <p>As to his <hi>Firſt</hi> aſſertion, I will readily acquit our Authour of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> as to this point; for the Gentlemen of that perſuaſion are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

from <hi>Moſes,</hi> not only to have rectified and

would have our Bleſſed Saviour, who, himſelf tells us

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to fill up the Law, and to compleat
it; and of whoſe Doctrines the Apoſtles give the great Eulogiums of
<hi>a ſpiritual Law,</hi> and <hi>a perfect Law;</hi> only to have told the World
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45010:15"/>
ſomething which they knew well enough before, and <hi>which any Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Who the Authour calls ignorant Men I know not; I am ſure,
ſome Men of the greateſt natural Knowledge have not been able, by
the light of Nature, to come up to the Knowledge of ſome of thoſe
Laws which our Saviour does recommend in his Sermon upon the
Mount. The Jews, who one would think ſhould be moſt knowing in
theſe Truths, as having the aſſiſtance of ſo many particular Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet they lived in opinions contrary to them all, as appears by
the whole tenor of that Diſcourſe of our Saviour: and even the
moſt Learned of the Heathen were far from embracing the generality
of them. 'Twould be too long here to ſhew the great defect of the
Heathen Philoſophy, in reſpect of this admirable Lecture of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
But to let our Authour know how far ignorant Men are from
coming up, by the pure light of reaſon, to the Knowledge of theſe
Laws, let him conſider how much <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicera,</hi> two Men of the
greateſt ſtrength of natural Reaſon, perhaps, that ever were in the
world; how much, I ſay, theſe great men were miſtaken in the Rules of
Charity which our Bleſſed Saviour does deliver. He commands
us <hi>to love our enemies, to do good to them that hate us,</hi> Matth. 5. 44.

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that <hi>That man is void of all

does not ſeek revenge. But 'tis the part of a Slave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contumeliouſly uſed, to bear it.</hi> So <hi>Cicero,</hi> among
the rights of Nature, places Revenge,<note n="†" place="margin">Per quam vim aut contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliam defendendo aut ulciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo propulfamus. <hi>Cic de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. lib.</hi> 11.</note>

                  <hi>I hate the man, and I will
hate him, and I wiſh I could be revenged of him.</hi> Now
I ſuppoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> were none of the moſt
ignorant men; and, if they could not ſearch out
theſe Truths without an Inſtructor, I cannot imagine
how our Authour's ignorant Men ſhould. So that,
in ſhort, this opinion of our Authour's is not <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> but 'tis
<hi>Socinianiſm</hi> revers'd; 'tis a Heterodoxy of his own coining; 'tis ſuch
an odd piece of ſtupid Hereſie, as not only his beloved Rationaliſts,
but even his <hi>ignorant Chriſtians</hi> will be aſhamed of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to what he would inferr, That the Doctrine of the
Trinity is contrary to the plainneſs of the Goſpel, I have given an
Anſwer already to that when I conſidered his Preface. I ſhall only
add, That the Doctrine of our Saviour's Divinity ſhould, I think,
give greater Credit and Authority to his Laws; and ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45010:16"/>
ſhould ſooner believe and practiſe them upon account of their
having ſo admirable and divine an Authour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Doctrine of the Trinity its being contrary to the
fewneſs of the Chriſtian Doctrines, which our Authour would have
but Two at moſt, Faith and Repentance: I anſwer, 'Tis true, Faith
and Repentance, in a large acceptation, are the Summ of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion: and 'tis as true, That the Doctrine of the Trinity is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Faith nor Repentance by way of Identical Predication; but, I
hope, it may be contained under one of them as a <hi>ſpecies</hi> under its
<hi>Genus.</hi> Faith and Repentance, in a large ſenſe, do take in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity;
under one are contained the <hi>Credenda,</hi> and under the other
the <hi>Agenda</hi> of our Religion. But then, what is this to our Authour's
purpoſe? If it be any thing it muſt be this, Our Saviour has reduced
all his Religion to Faith and Repentance; nay, ſometimes to each of
them: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Doctrine of the Trinity ought not to be believed,
or thoſe that teach that Doctrine preach another Goſpel. Now, how
glorious a piece of Logick is this! Would not this be as good a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
to all intents and purpoſes? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, That all things
in the world are Subſtance or Accident; nay, he has reduced both
theſe to <hi>Ens;</hi> therefore there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Homo</hi> or <hi>Brutum;</hi> or
therefore he that ſays ſo teaches another Philoſophy than <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
Certainly every one that underſtands any thing of his Religion muſt
know, That Faith, in this general acceptation, muſt take in a firm
Belief of all things neceſſary to Salvation, a ſtedfaſt Truſt and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon God, and an undoubted Hope in all his Promiſes, and an
expreſs Aſſent to all Truths he has revealed in his word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that
Repentance does contain not only a bare turning from Sin, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practice of all Chriſtian Vertues. So that our Authour, by this
Argument, might have as well proved Hope and Charity to be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Graces, that there is no ſuch Vertue under the Goſpel as Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or Chaſtity, becauſe our Saviour has only preached Faith and
Repentance.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Faith, in what Senſe it juſtifies.</head>
               <p>OUR Authour, in the beginning of this Chapter, is of a ſudden
turned pretty Orthodox, and falls a-diſputing very ſhrewdly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Antinomians:</hi> and then he applauds himſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45010:16"/>
mightily, in his bringing an Illuſtration out of <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 18. of St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying to the <hi>Centurion, Except the Mariners ſtay in the ſhip, we
cannot be ſaved,</hi> when he had told them before, that <hi>there ſhould not be
the loſs of any Man's life;</hi> now, by this Inſtance, he illuſtrates the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of good works to Juſtification; and tells us, that by this all
the Queſtions about Juſtification may be ſolved; <hi>though he knows not of
any one before him, which has honoured it with a mention.</hi> I ſhall not go about
to diſturb him in his diſpute againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> though I think
'tis a little unſeaſonable in this Place; nor ſhall I go to rob him of the
honour of his Inſtance, nor that place of Scripture of <hi>the honour of his
Mention:</hi> for I don't remember I have read it uſed in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
before; though I am ſure it has been urged with greater
Advantage againſt the Patrons of abſolute Predeſtination. And now
one would think the Authour had a mind to have a little Controverſie
with <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or to ſtate the Queſtion of
Juſtification among the Moderns; but truly he leaves it juſt as he finds
it, and runs off to a long Indictment he has drawn up againſt
Faith, by which, I ſuppoſe, he would prove its Ineffectualneſs to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.
Which, in ſhort, he brings to this <hi>Dilemma:</hi> Either by
Faith, we believe what is reaſonable, and ſo we can't help it, and
then we have no pretence to a Reward; or elſe, we believe without
Reaſon, and then we are Fools: <hi>Ergo,</hi> We are not juſtified by
Faith.</p>
               <p>One may be apt to wonder to what purpoſe the Authour ſhould
bring in this Queſtion into his Book; for one would think, at firſt
ſight, that the deciſion of it for Works, would make more for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
than the <hi>Anti-trinitarians:</hi> But yet, upon ſecond thoughts, one
may eaſily find, that the Authour was aware that the uſual Solution of
this Queſtion, by the merits of Chriſt who is our Righteouſneſs,
would too far advance his Satisfaction, and conſequently his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
and that, for a true Juſtification by Faith, there would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a full, Orthodox Belief in all Fundamentals: and therefore,
this Chapter was, I ſuppoſe, to obviate theſe Objections. Though,
for ought I can ſee, there is nothing proved againſt any but the <hi>Anti-nomians,</hi>
unleſs he would have all ſuch that are not <hi>Socinians.</hi> But
becauſe the Authour does here endeavour to deſtroy the Effectualneſs
of this divine Grace, the expreſs Atteſtation of God's word, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Suffrage of the Church, and the Satisfaction too of our Saviour's
ſufferings. I ſhall give him an Anſwer, by ſhewing theſe <hi>three</hi> things;

and lively Faith, in ſo much that a true and lively
Faith may be known by them, as a Tree is diſcerned

do juſtifie: for they, having no intrinſick value of
their own, cannot conferr it on any, but Faith alone,
which takes hold, as ſome ſpeak, of the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

ſpeaks,<note n="*" place="margin">

and by which we embrace the Promiſe of God's Mercy and of the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Sins; which thing none other of our Vertues or Works
properly doth, therefore the Scripture uſeth to ſay, That Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Works doth juſtifie. Not that even Faith it ſelf is a proper and
neceſſary cauſe of Juſtification; but that it has pleaſed God to accept
it as a cauſe or means, by embracing or taking hold of the merits
of Chriſt, which are the true, proper, meritorious cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

that the Gentlemen of the Authour's perſuaſion are ſo unwilling
to have Faith onely to juſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45010:17"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ought to be an Orthodox Faith, in all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>All the admirable Effects, which the Scripture does attribute to
Faith, muſt be underſtood of a true Faith, ſuch as is agreeable to
God's word, which is to be the rule of our Faith, and not of a falſe
or Heterodox Faith, which any one takes up from a Party of Men, or
from his own Imagination. A Heterodox Faith is no more Faith than
a dead man or a painted man is a Man, they agree in one common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal
Name, 'tis true, and in nothing elſe. So that an Heterodox
Faith can no more pretend to thoſe ſupernatural Effects, which a true
Faith, by God's grace, does produce, than a dead Man can pretend to
all the Properties and Operations of a live one. There is but one
Faith as well as one Baptiſm; ſo that to hope to be juſtified by a falſe
or another Faith, is as unreaſonable as to expect to come into the
Church by another Baptiſm. So that they that teach a Juſtification
by works, or any other Faith than an Orthodox one, do themſelves,
for ought as I ſee, <hi>teach another Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The reaſon why Faith is ſo pleaſing to God, as that
he ſhould make this the great Means of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>And here I hope to give an Anſwer to the Authour's <hi>Dilemma;</hi> and
to ſhew that our Faith in Chriſt is not irrational, and then <hi>we are no
Fools,</hi> and as for our merit by Faith, we are far from pretending to it:
we acknowledge it as an infinite mercy of our gracious God, that he
will accept our Faith in Chriſt's blood for our Juſtification, and do
not go about to argue the worth of it, which is none. And as for
the grounds of our Faith in Chriſt for Juſtification, I know not what
can be more reaſonable, than to expect only to have our weak Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
accepted, for the ſake of his all-ſufficient Merits. And of
all our Actions that we can perform, I know not what can be more
pleaſing and acceptable in the ſight of God, than for an humble and
deſponding Chriſtian, conſidering his own unworthineſs and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
of his Repentance it ſelf, and all other Vertues, to incline
God to mercy, ſo far as for their ſakes to accept him for juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
he, as the laſt refuge he hath, quitteth all worth and merit
in himſelf and fleeth with a full and undoubting Faith in all God's
revelations, and a firm confidence in all his promiſes, unto the free
grace of God revealed in Chriſt Jeſus, and hopes, for the ſake of his
Righteouſneſs alone, that he will juſtifie his imperfect Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
This certainly, when we have done the utmoſt of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
is more pleaſing to God than any action we can do more.
For if we could be juſtified by our works, it would tempt us to reflect
with Pride upon our vertuous Actions; but this teaches us a pious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45010:18"/>
deſpondency in our ſelves, and to caſt all our hopes upon our bleſſed
Saviour. And this is the ſumm of the Apoſtles Arguments, <hi>Eph. 2. 8.
For by Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, not of your ſelves, nor of works,
leaſt any one ſhould boaſt.</hi> And the learned<note n="*" place="margin">Georg. Caſſand. in Conſul. de Art. 4. Aug. Confeſſ. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Caſſander,</hi> though a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
ſays thus much in favour of this Doctrine of the Proteſtants, <hi>that
in this Queſtion,</hi> by the word <hi>Faith, they mean only the grace of God
which is correſpondent to faith</hi> (quae fidei ex adverſo reſpondet); <hi>and to
be juſtified by faith alone, ſignifies the ſame as by grace alone, in oppoſition
to all kind of works.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">What figure Faith made in natural Religion?</head>
               <p>OUR Authour, in the beginning of this Chapter, lays down
Faith as a duty in natural Religion, that it is a branch of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
by which we pay to God what is due to his Veracity; that this
was before all poſitive Law, and that upon this the Goſpel is built;
becauſe the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which is recommended for our pattern,
<hi>Rom. 4.)</hi> was nothing elſe but this Juſtice; that the lack of this Faith
was reproved by the Angel in <hi>Sarah,</hi> and was puniſhed in <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. and in the incredulous Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. And that this is the
Faith laſtly which is commended in the Worthies mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
And laſt of all he endeavours to ſhew the excellency of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Faith, to conſiſt in believing God againſt ſo many difficulties, from
this natural notion of his Veracity.</p>
               <p>Any one that underſtands the nature of the Authour's Book, will
eaſily ſee into his deſign here; which is to bring down all Faith to be
a meer Creature of Reaſon, to be no longer that which the Schools
call an infuſed Habit, or the inſpiration of God, but only a bare ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
belief upon divine Teſtimony. Now as to his notion of Faith,
its being a branch of Juſtice, and that by the light of nature we are
taught to believe God upon his Teſtimony; this is in ſome meaſure
moſt certainly true, as appears by the practice of the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<note n="†" place="margin">Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niorum quae ſunt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra? Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; Humanum.

                  </note>, who had nothing but the light of nature to walk by, in their
believing their Oracles, Auguries, Propheſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in ſuiting
their actions according to them. So that 'tis plain, that natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45010:18"/>
tells us, God is to be believed upon his Teſtimony; ſo that
when a Man under natural Religion does believe any thing upon God's
Teſtimony, our Authour may, if he pleaſes, call this Faith. But Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Faith, or Faith under the Goſpel, is quite of another kind;
this is not only an aſſent of the underſtanding, but a divine Grace, or
Habit infuſed, though our Authour would have them the ſame, by
ſaying the Goſpel is built upon this: and moreover, That Faith in
<hi>Abraham,</hi> which the Scripture does recommend for our Pattern, was
not this bare rational aſſent but an inſpired Vertue, that was founded
and excited in him by the preventing and co-operating Grace of
God.</p>
               <p>1. For firſt, <hi>Faith under the Goſpel is a ſpiritual Grace, or an inſpired
Habit, 'tis a true and ſtedfaſt belief in, and reliance upon God, through
the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and the ſanctification of the holy Spirit, not by
the bare aſſent only of our reaſon, but by the co-operating Grace of God.</hi>
I know not for my part any truth in all our Religion more expreſly
revealed, than that Faith is a Grace inſpired by God. It is ſaid to be
the <hi>gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 8. And again, <hi>for unto you is given in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of Chriſt, not only to believe on him but to ſuffer for him,</hi> Eph. 1. 29.
Upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s confeſſing our Saviour's Divinity, Chriſt tells him, <hi>fleſh
and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Matth. 16. 17. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as
of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>It is God that
worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>No man can come unto
me except the Father which ſent me draw him,</hi> Joh. 6. 4. And ſo <hi>Gal.
5.</hi> 22. Faith is reckoned among the gifts of the Spirit. And the Father
of the <hi>Demoniack, Mark</hi> 9. 24. cries out, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
Now if all our Vertues and good thoughts are the effects of
God's Grace, moſt certainly this eminent Vertue of Faith muſt; if
the Inſpiration of God be requiſite, even for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith, it muſt
ſurely likewiſe be ſo for ours; if we are to be drawn to the belief of
the Goſpel by God, we cannot come then upon our own pure
accord; if the belief of one that was an Eye-witneſs of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Miracles, did lack help and improvement from God, ours
likewiſe cannot ſtand in need of leſs. I do not ſay, that God inſpires
this belief into us without any concurrence of our own judgments,
that he moves our Aſſents as if we were meer Machines; but his
preventing Grace does firſt excite our belief, and his aſſiſting
Grace does ſtill further it, by giving a bleſſing and effectualneſs to
the word; and without this divine aſſiſtance, according to the preſent
meaſures of God's diſpenſations, it is impoſſible we ſhould ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>2. Now as to his making the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by which he is ſaid
in Scripture to be juſtified, to be only a natural Faith; I anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi>
Though we ſhould not allow this Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the true
Chriſtian Juſtifying Faith, or a Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; yet we cannot
allow it to be only a plain moral Act or Habit: for if it were only a
bare credence out of Juſtice to God's Veracity, that too muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to come from God, becauſe without him we are not able to
think a good thought, much leſs to do a good action. Though by the
light of Natural Religion a man might be covinced that it was his
duty to believe God in all his promiſes; yet when theſe promiſes,
by their difficulties, ſeem ſtrangely incredible, Fleſh and Blood will
be apt to ſhrink and give way, and rather to fall a diſputing the
poſſibility of them, than readily, upon God's Authority, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
unleſs their Faith be ſtrengthned by the aſſiſting Grace of
of God's holy Spirit. And ſo<note n="*" place="margin">Philo lib. quis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Haeres.</note>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But beſides, this Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was a formal, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
juſtifying Faith, or a Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. It was the opinion of
the Ancients, That all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and all other Good Men, both
before and under the Law, were ſaved by an expreſs Faith in Chriſt.

                  <hi>Cyril</hi> goes farther, and makes <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the ſeeing of the
three Angels, <hi>to have believed in the Conſubſtantial Trinity.</hi> And if
we look into Scripture, we ſhall find that theſe great Men had reaſons
enough to ground them in this Opinion: for our Saviour tells the
<hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 8. 56. <hi>Your father Abraham, rejoiced to ſee my day, and he
ſaw it and was glad.</hi> Now, what ſhould all this gladneſs and rejoicing
be for? but that from the Promiſe which God had made him, <hi>Gen.
11.</hi> 35. that <hi>in his ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed:</hi> he
was fully perſuaded, That God, in his good time, would ſend ſuch a
Perſon as Chriſt into the world, that ſhould ſave the People from their
Sins, that ſhould die for the Sins of the whole world, to reconcile them
to God; now the conſideration of this was matter of the greateſt Joy
to him then, as it is now to all good Chriſtians: ſo that (as St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
ſays) <hi>there is little difference in this between his Faith and ours, but
that ours is after and his before Chriſt's Paſſion.</hi> So likewiſe St. <hi>Peter</hi>
tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> Act. 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other but
Chriſt, for there is no other Name under heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we muſt be ſaved.</hi> Now, whereas 'tis certain, by Scripture, that
theſe good <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were ſaved, as appears by God's declaring
himſelf to be their God, and by making a lying down with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to be an expreſſion for Everlaſting Happineſs;
it from hence follows, That they muſt be ſaved by a Faith in Chriſt,
or elſe they would be ſaved by Faith in another Name. I ſay, They
muſt be ſaved by Faith in his name; for that is the onely Means of
Salvation God has propoſed. That was one of the expreſs terms
of Reconciliation agreed upon with the Father to be performed on
Man's part; ſo that they could reap no benefit from this Covenant,
without performing that condition.</p>
               <p>As to his other Inſtances to prove Faith in the old Teſtament, to
be only a natural Faith, as of <hi>Enoch, Moſes, Joſuah, Rahab,</hi> &amp;c. I
anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis very certain that the word Faith, in Scripture,
is taken in very diverſe acceptations, ſometimes for the Profeſſion of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45010:20"/>
the Goſpel, ſometimes for a belief of Chriſt's being able to cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
ſometimes for a truſt and reliance upon God's promiſes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
which are all diſtinguiſhed from the particular reliance upon
God's mercy and Promiſes through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, which
is the only true juſtifying Faith. Now, 'tis true, the Apoſtle, in the
eleventh of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he reckons up all thoſe eminent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Faith, does not underſtand by Faith here, ſtrictly the juſtifying
Faith; but only a firm reliance upon God's promiſes, that he will,
in his good time, deliver his Servants; and therefore he urges theſe
precedents of Faith and truſting in God, to encourage the Chriſtians
to a chearful undergoing of their Sufferings, and a perſeverance in
their Belief, that God will ſhortly deliver them, by deſtroying the
<hi>Jews,</hi> which were their bittereſt Enemies: for in the Verſes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
preceding this Chapter, he comforts his fainting Converts in
theſe words, <hi>Yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will
not tarry. Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith, but if any Man draw back,
my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> By which it is plain, That the
Examples that are afterwards brought to comfirm thoſe wavering
Chriſtians in this ſort of Faith or Perſeverance in their Sufferings,
muſt be famous for their Perſeverance in Afflictions, upon account of
this Faith or reliance upon God's promiſes to deliver them; and that
this ſort of Faith is that which is chiefly recommended here. But
then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It no ways follows that theſe good men, whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are here propoſed, had no other Faith but this. Theſe, and all
other good men under the old Teſtament, had a formal Faith in the
<hi>Meſſias</hi> or Chriſt Jeſus, which is the true juſtifying Faith. <hi>Moſes
wrote of Chriſt,</hi> Act. 3. 2, <hi>to the end,</hi> as our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews,
that they might believe on him,</hi> Joh. 5. 46. <hi>And many Prophets and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men have deſired to ſee the things which they ſaw,</hi> Matt. 13. 17. and
that <hi>many Kings have deſired it,</hi> Luk. 10. 24. <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he was
dying ſaid, that he had <hi>waited for the Salvation of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 49.
18. <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs ſpake of Chriſt <hi>to all them that looked for
redemption at Jeruſalem,</hi> Luk. 2. 38. <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid that <hi>he had found him
of whom Moſes in the Law, and the Prophets did write,</hi> Joh. 1. 45.
The <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman knew <hi>that Chriſt cometh,</hi> Joh. 4. 25. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſpeaks in his Oration to <hi>Agrippa, of the Promiſe made unto the Father,
unto which the Twelve Tribes inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope
to come,</hi> Act. 26. 6. From all which it is plain, That all theſe good
Servants of God did believe in Chriſt the Saviour of the World;
and that this Faith of theirs was imputed unto them for Righteouſneſs.
And ſo now what is become of our Authour's natural Faith which he
makes to be the Mother of the Evangelical? The Faith of theſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45010:20"/>
good Men was the gift of God as well as ours, they were juſtified by
Faith, and ſo are we, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. they live by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus as
well as we, they diſclaimed all righteouſneſs in works as well as we;
ſo that if theirs be a natural Faith, ours muſt be ſo too. And ſo now
by our Authour's natural Faith, and other Mens moral grace, we are
in a fair way to have all Chriſtianity dwindled into downright Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">That Credulity is not Faith, but an oppoſite Vice.</head>
               <p>OUR Authour being reſolved to carry on his notion of natural
Faith, and to make it a compleat Heathen Virtue, has reſolved
to bring it to the teſt of the Heathen Philoſophy; and to make it to
ſuit the better with the <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Vertues, has gotten it two extream
Vices to ſurround it, Infidelity in the defect, and Credulity in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
But 'tis Credulity is the Vice that our Authour has the pique
againſt; and therefore ſpends all this Chapter to prove, that Credulity
is not Faith. And this we could readily have granted him, without
all his pains of proving it. Now one would think, that this was eaſy
enough to prove, and yet he has unluckily failed in the attempt. For
inſtead of proving, that Credulity is not Faith, which is eaſy enough
of all Conſcience to do, he firſt goes to prove, that Credulity is an
exceſs of Faith, as Fool-hardineſs is of Valour, or Prodigality of
Bounty. And ſecondly, That they that believe contrary to reaſon,
are guilty of Credulity. Now one would think, that when our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
had before laid down, that Faith was only Juſtice to God, he
would make Credulity, which he would have the exceſs of this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
to be <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> and ſo conſequently, to be <hi>ſumma injuria</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; and this he ſhould do, if he kept up to his own Rules,
and the analogy of theſe moral Vertues. But he very fairly lets that
alone, and falls again to proving, that which no body will deny;
That Men muſt not believe, in contradiction to their reaſon, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with any humane Authority. Now for ought that the Authour
has gained of his point in this Chapter, he might as well have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that a Bear was not a Man, or a Man was not a Mouſe; all that
ever he could propoſe to himſelf, was, to inſinuate into his unwary
Readers, that our Faith, in the Bleſſed Trinity, is not Faith but Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity;
and that we are therefore Credulous, becauſe he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45010:21"/>
we ground that Faith only upon humane Authority, by which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
means chiefly the Authority of ancient Councils. Therefore what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſhall ſay to this Chapter, I ſhall reduce to two heads, and ſhew,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Credulity is not exceſs of divine Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That an acquieſcence in the determinations of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils in matter of Faith, is not Credulity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Credulity is not an exceſs of divine Faith.</p>
               <p>Credulity is a Vice by which we eaſily give our aſſent to the relation
of another, without juſt reaſons and motives for it. Now this Vice,
in its ordinary notion, is only oppoſite to that juſt humane belief that
is owing to one another, as we are Men. For humane Faith or Belief
of what another Man ſays, when neither the matter it ſelf, nor the
Relater, is liable to any juſt exception, is a ſocial duty; and which
any Man that ſpeaks truth, and has not juſtly loſt his reputation, may
claim from us, as Fellow Creatures. But when the matter related is
incredible, or which my Reaſon tells me is not enough probable, or
when the Relater is ſufficiently exceptionable, or if any thing elſe
accompany the Relation, which will give ſufficient ſuſpition of falſity
to a prudent Man; then if I believe ſuch a Relation, I am truly ſaid
to be Credulous; becauſe there I make my Belief exceed its juſt
bounds, I give more credit to the Relater than he ought to have:
whereas my Faith in this caſe ought to ſtop at the confines of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
I let it paſs over them, and believe things improbable. But
there can be no ſuch thing in a divine Faith, for taking that in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's
ſenſe to be only a piece of juſtice to God, there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in believing what he reveals or relates to us: 'tis impoſſible there
ſhould lie any exception againſt him as a Relater, for he is moſt true,
and cannot deceive us: as to whatever difficulty there lies in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
related, he is moſt powerful, and can make good what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
his Wiſdom is infinite, and knows exactly the expreſs <hi>Modus</hi> of
thoſe Truths he had revealed to us; which our finite underſtandings
cannot comprehend. It is impoſſible for us to believe too much what
God affirms, unleſs we could ſuppoſe, that our Belief could be greater
than God's Veracity, or that God could ſay ſomething was ſo which
we knew impoſſible to be ſo. So that to make Credulity an exceſs of
Faith, is to preſcribe bounds how far Men ſhould believe God, and to
give them caution, that they ſhould not credit him any farther than
they ſaw reaſon for it; but when his Relations began to them to ſeem
unreaſonable, that then they ſhould chooſe whether they would believe
him or no, that then they ſhould ſtand upon their own guard for fear of
being cenſur'd for eaſy Men, and being thought the worſt of all Fools,
the Credulous. So that in ſhort, whatever Credulity is, 'tis not an
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45010:21"/>
exceſs of divine Faith, unleſs we could believe God too true, or that
God could tell us ſomething was true which was manifeſtly falſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That an acquieſcence in the determinations of General
Councils, though in matters of Faith, is not Credulity.</p>
               <p>I would not have our Authour think, that we ground our Faith in
the Bleſſed Trinity, upon the determinations only of general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
which he means by his <hi>greateſt humane Authority,</hi> as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Scripture to urge for it; we have Arguments enough from
thence to confound all the force and ſubtilties of our Heretical Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
and ſeveral learned Men in the beginning of this Age, have
brought ſo much from thence, as perfectly ſilenced this Hereſy for a
time, and has baffled their Cauſe for ever; I am ſure, at leaſt, againſt
all ſuch eſpouſers of it as this Authour ſeems to be. And as for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
when we rely upon their determinations, in aſſerting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the Ancient Faith, I do not think we are ſo much credulous,
as theſe fort of Gentlemen are ſaucy, to ſay no worſe, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter
theſe Auguſt Aſſemblies, with ſo much Contumely and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry
as they uſe to do. There are none of our Church, that look
upon the determinations of general Councils, to be the infallible O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of God; they are, as our Authour ſpeaks, humane Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but then they are the greateſt humane Authority upon Earth, they
are the Repreſentatives of the Church Univerſal; and if our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are apt to be inclined by the Authority of ſingle Doctors, they
ought to be much more ſo, by the Authority of ſuch a number of
good and learned Men, convened from all the parts of the Chriſtian
World. We do not run up the Authority of Councils ſo high, as to
give them power to conſtitute new Articles of Faith, as the Papiſts
do; but then we look upon them to be the beſt Judges in the World
of old ones, and of what was the true, ancient and Catholick Faith; to
declare what Doctrines, according to<note n="*" place="margin">Vinc. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. contr. Haer. Cap. 3.</note>

and Traditions of their Fore-fathers. Neither yet do we allow
them, if they ſhall oppoſe their Opinions or Traditions againſt the
expreſs word of God; but only when they declare the truth of their
Doctrine, as <hi>Theodoret</hi>

and the moſt authentick Expoſitors. And yet though we cannot grant
it to be an Article of our Chriſtian Faith, That general Councils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
err, becauſe there is no ſuch propoſition found in Scripture, nor
by any neceſſary conſequence to be deduced from thence; but moſt
good Men look upon it as a Theological Verity, for which there are
ſome probable Arguments out of Scripture alledged, as <hi>Mat. 18. 20.
When two or three are gathered together in my name, I will be in the midſt
of them,</hi> and Joh. 16. 3. <hi>When the ſpirit of Truth is come, he will guide
you into all Truth:</hi> and the moſt good and learned Men in all times,
have generally thought, that the inerrability of a general Council,
that was fairly called, and duly celebrated, was one of the <hi>piè credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
which a good Man, though he is not neceſſitated, is yet well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to believe. For if we conſider the great love which God does
bear to his Church, and the peculiar Providence he does exerciſe over
it; if we conſider the promiſes that he has made to it, that it is his
deſire, that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all neceſſary Truth; there is no good Man but will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to believe, that God out of his infinite love and goodneſs,
which he has declared to bear to his Church, will not ſuffer the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
of it in theſe ſacred Aſſemblies, to err in any important
matter of Faith; that he will not permit any deadly poiſon thus to
ſink into the bowels of his Church, when they uſe all the fair and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
means they can to avoid it; but that he will give his holy Spirit
to direct them in ſettling the true Faith, as may be beſt for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Church.</p>
               <p>But though general Councils have not a divine inerrable Authority,
yet they have in matters of Religion, the greateſt humane and coercive
one; eſpecially when owned and confirmed by the ſecular Power:
therefore though we were certain, that they had determined ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
erroneouſly, and which our own reaſon and judgment told us
was ſo; yet we ought to keep this reaſon to our ſelves, and not to
oppoſe the concurring judgments of ſo many great and holy Men, with
our private ſentiments: 'tis more probable, that we ſhould be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than they, and though God might pardon our miſtakes when we
take care they ſhould go no farther than our ſelves, yet we cannot be
ſo ſure of that, when we endeavour to bring others likewiſe into our
errours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A good Man, though he could not be convinced of the
truth oft heir determinations, yet out of duty and reſpect to ſo great
an Authority, would not go openly to condemn them; for though he
looked upon their determinations not as inerrable Declarations of
Faith, yet he would take them for the beſt expedients of Unity; ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45010:22"/>
that if he happened to be miſtaken in his Sentiments, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their Declarations, and ſhould withal endeavour to corrupt
others by diffuſing them; this would be to make breaches in the
Church, which would be more prejudicial to him than his own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
this might make him guilty, at the ſame time, of Hereſy and
Schiſm too. So that I take an acquieſcence in the determinations of
general Councils, or any ſuch like humane Authority, to be ſo far
from Credulouſneſs, that 'tis a great part of prudent Caution and
Warineſs; and that we ſhould be far the more credulous and conceited
Fools, if we could believe, that our private opinion was ſufficient to
weigh down theirs; or that God would ſuffer the eſtabliſhments of
theſe great and holy Men, to be pulled down and deſtroyed by the
propagation of our conceptions.</p>

               <head type="sub">Why Faith made a greater Figure under the Goſpel, than it did
under the Law?</head>
               <p>THE Authour ſpends this long Chapter in ſhewing, what a greater
neceſſity there was in the Primitive Times of Chriſtianity of a
ſtrong Faith, than there is now; which made our Saviour to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it then ſo much to his Diſciples. Which he illuſtrates by the
inſtance of Loyalty; which is but mean and inconſiderable in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
times, and not worth a reward from the Prince: but in time of
danger, when a Man ventures his Life to ſerve him, 'tis then a Virtue
of a larger extent, and ought to be encouraged by the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
He proceeds to ſhew the particular neceſſity of Faith at that
time. Firſt, From the difficulties which hindred the believing of the
Goſpel, to the Gentiles who deſpiſed the meanneſs of the Goſpel, to
the Jews who were prejudiced by the fond opinion they had of their
own Law, and by the expectation of a pompous Meſſias. Secondly,
From the danger which the Goſpel brought, in expoſing its Profeſſors
to Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Upon account of the Methods of the
Goſpel, which was to be Preached to the whole Heathen World.
Theſe are the extraordinary means, he ſays, why Faith was ſo much
recommended at that time; the ordinary were, the ſerviceableneſs of
this Vertue to Religion and Holineſs, which do continue ſtill, ſo that
God does not load his Servants with more Faith than is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45010:23"/>
to Salvation; for if he ſhould do this, he ſays, he muſt do it
with reaſon or without reaſon; if without reaſon, that would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
his Wiſdom; if with reaſon, that can be no other but in order
to the piety and happineſs of Man. And this is the ſum of this
Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now any one may ſee what the deſign of all this is, to make the
belief of our Saviour's Divinity, and the Doctrine of the Trinity, to
be no part of the Faith delivered to the Saints; and that thoſe great
exhortations to Faith the Scripture gives, had no relation to the Faith
of our Saviour's Divinity; and that they were not urged to ſtrengthen
them againſt any difficulties they might conceive in this Doctrine,
but only to confirm them againſt thoſe other difficulties and dangers,
which he there mentions. Now though 'tis very true, that theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
which the Author mentions, were ſuch as did deter many
from eſpouſing Chriſtianity; ſo that there was need of a greater Faith
than ordinary at that time to conquer them, yet he does not enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
all the difficulties their Faith was to ſuperate, but leaves out that
principal end of Faith, which was to give life to all the reſt, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt was the eternal Son of God. This Doctrine was ſo ſtrange
and wonderful, both to Jews and Gentiles, that it frighted many Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
away from Chriſtianity; ſo that how much ſoever the fondneſs of
the Jews, to their own Law, and the meanneſs of our Saviour's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
might hinder them from complying with his Religion; yet this
Doctrine of his, being the Eternal Son of God, and equal with his
rather, was ſuch a hard ſaying, a truth ſo difficult to mens natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at firſt appearance; that they ought to have had as great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to confirm their Faith in this point, as to ſupport them againſt
any of thoſe difficulties which our Authour mentions. And this we
find to be the great ſcandal all along to the Jews. For <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. when
our Saviour declares to them his original, his being the Son of God,
and his co-operating with the Father: <hi>My Father worketh hitherto
and I work, therefore the Jews ſought the more to kill him, becauſe he not
only had broken the Sabbath, but ſaid alſo, that God was his Father, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelf equal with God.</hi> And ſo <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 58. when our Saviour
declares himſelf to be the Bread which came down from Heaven, <hi>many
of his Diſciples when they heard this, ſaid, This is a hard ſaying, who can
bear it?</hi> And ſo likewiſe, <hi>v. 52. What if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man
aſcend up where he was before?</hi> It follows, <hi>that from that time many of
his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> And again, <hi>Joh.
8.</hi> upon our Saviour's declaring to the Jews, that he was the Son of
God, they are all ſo enraged, as to tell him, <hi>that he is a Samaritan,
and hath a Devil,</hi> Joh. 8. 15. And ſo likewiſe <hi>v.</hi> 58. upon his ſaying,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45010:23"/>
                  <hi>before Abraham was I am, they took up ſtones to caſt at him.</hi> The like
offence they took at his forgiving ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 11. or at any other
word or action of his, which did any ways ſeem to infer his Divinity.
So that there was a great deal of need of a very ſtrong and vigorous
Faith, to believe in the Divinity of Chriſt at that time, eſpecially
when they had ſo many prejudices to deterr them from it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
we find, that our Saviour does greatly incourage and commend
thoſe, that did heartily believe, and make a ready profeſſion of it.
Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. when <hi>Peter</hi> made that eminent confeſſion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Divinity, <hi>Thou art the Son of the living God,</hi> he immediately gives
him his bleſſing, and entails that great Promiſe upon him, <hi>Thou art
Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell
ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Joh. 16. 18. And ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 28. when
<hi>Thomas</hi> made that moſt expreſs confeſſion of our Lord's Divinity, upon
occaſion, of his being certified of the Reſurrection, <hi>My Lord and my
God,</hi> our Saviour gives his bleſſing, not only to him, but to all thoſe
that ſhall believe this, without being Eye-witneſſes of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to confirm them in it: <hi>Bleſſed are they which have not ſeen, and yet
have believed.</hi> And thus we find our Saviour did many of his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Cures, in requital of their Faith, and their ready confeſſion of
his Divinity; as on the blind Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. that cryed out ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
<hi>have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David:</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 17.
when the blind Man cries out <hi>Jeſus, thou Son of David, have mercy on
me,</hi> our Saviour tells him upon his Cure, <hi>thy faith hath ſaved thee,
v.</hi> 4.<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Chald. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph. in Gen. 49. 18. &amp; Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol. in loc. eundem, &amp; Phil. de Agr. Lib. 2.</note> Where by the Son of <hi>David</hi> is meant the Meſſias, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Jewiſh Doctors was to be God. So that this Confeſſion of
his being the Son of <hi>David,</hi> was a Confeſſion of his Divinity, which
was a great means to incline our Saviour to work their Cure; and to
tell one of them that his Faith had ſaved him. And thus we have let
our Author know there was ſome other uſe of Faith, at the beginning
of the Goſpel, than what he mentions; and that there was not only
a need of Faith to ſtrengthen them againſt the dangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the
Goſpel brought on them; but to make them believe in Chriſt's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and to profeſs that moſt important Article of our Chriſtian
Faith.</p>
               <p>2. The next thing which the Authour in this Chapter would have,
is, That Faith in the Goſpel has no relation to Chriſt's Divinity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
he ſays, <hi>God like a good Prince, would not load his good ſubjects
with unneceſſary burdens,</hi> but only ſuch as there was reaſon for, and
which were neceſſary to Piety and a good Life.</p>
               <p>Now I hope that our Authour and his Friends, for all their pretence
to reaſon, will not be ſo bold with God Almighty, as to give the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45010:24"/>
of all his Commands, and exactly to ſhew the motives that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
his Eternal Will, whoſe Judgments are unſearchable, and his
ways paſt finding out. I confeſs I have always lookt upon it as a very
daring piece of Confidence in theſe ſort of Authours, to ſay in caſe of
a poſitive Command, That God has not Commanded ſuch a thing; or,
This Command muſt not be underſtood in this manner, becauſe there
is no reaſon that he ſhould thus command us: or as our Authour ſays,
'Tis to diſhonour God, to believe him to require Faith for any other
reaſon, than becauſe it is neceſſary for our incouragement to Holineſs;
or as he ſays afterwards, For its ſerviceableneſs to the Divine Life.
For though we could ſee no reaſon for ſuch a Command, yet God may:
and 'tis but reaſonable as well as modeſt to think, that God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the reaſon of his own Laws beſt, and that he that gave us theſe
Precepts, beſt underſtood the ends for which he deſigned them. But
becauſe the Authour ſhould not triumph too much over us poor dull
Trinitarians, or think there is no reaſon to be given, why Faith in the
perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity, ſhould be commanded us; or in
particular, that the Belief of the Divinity of our Saviour (which it is
our Authour's chief deſign to impugn, as appears by his following
Chapters) leaſt I ſay he ſhould think, this Belief does contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Religion and Piety, let him be pleaſed to take with him theſe
conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That to believe the Divinity of our Saviour is neceſſary to
Religion, becauſe by it there is gained a greater Authority to his
Laws. For we find that Men are more and more inclined to reſpect
Rules and Laws from the dignity of the perſon that gives them. The
Rules and Injunctions of ordinary perſons are uſually contemned and
ſlighted, though if the ſame came from a great and magnificent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they would be embraced with a great deal of eagerneſs and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Therefore in compaſſion to this infirmity of Mankind, it has
pleaſed the infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to let a Perſon of the
Divine Nature, the Son of his Boſom, to take our nature upon, him to
be himſelf the propounder of theſe Heavenly Rules of his holy Goſpel,
to be himſelf the Promiſer of all thoſe glorious Rewards, which he
vouchſafes to propoſe to thoſe that ſhall obey his Precepts. Now ſuch
a Perſon as this could be liable to no exceptions, though a Prophet
might be miſtaken in his Revelation, might outgo or miſapply his
Credentials; yet when God himſelf undertakes the Embaſſage, malice
it ſelf can except nothing here; ſo that this will be proof againſt the
utmoſt Infidelity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Belief does further Religion becauſe it improves
our Love and Gratitude to God upon conſideration of ſo immenſe a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45010:24"/>
benefit. Indeed it had been a great token of God's love to Mankind
any ways to have contrived our Redemption, to have reſcued us from
that forlorn miſerable Eſtate into which we were fallen; and to have
placed us in a Capacity of attaining Everlaſting Happineſs. But then
his love is far greater to us, when he hath ſent his only begotten Son
to die for our ſins, and to purchaſe our Redemption by ſuch an unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
price. And we may take notice, that the Apoſtles do place
the choiſeſt mark of God's love, in chuſing ſuch extraordinary means
to work Mens Salvation by, as the Incarnation and Death of his own
Son. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> Joh. 3.
16. <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> Rom. 8. 32.
<hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his
Son to be the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 10. And truly this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
that a Perſon of the glorious Trinity, one that is God
bleſſed for ever, ſhould for the ſake of us wretched Sinners, undergo
ſuch an exinanition, as to take our nature upon him, to live a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Life, and to die a ſhameful Death, to reconcile us unto God;
this conſideration, I ſay, is of all moſt apt to work upon generous
Minds, to hinder them from offending ſo good and gracious a God,
after ſuch an unparallel'd Mercy; and nothing can be ſo effectual to
make Men aſhamed of the ingratitude of their Sins, if they have any
the leaſt ſpark of Generoſity or Vertue, when they reflect upon this ſo
inexpreſſible goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe this Belief does ſecure us of the remiſſion of our
ſins, by an aſſurance we now have of the compleat ſatisfaction which
Chriſt has made for the ſins of all Men. We know our Saviour came
into the World, that Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be
Preached in his Name. Now we are certain, that it <hi>is not poſſible for
the blood of Bulls and Goats to take away ſin,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. and we are as
certain, that the blood of meer Man would be as far from doing it as
the other; ſo that we could have no aſſurance of our Redemption at
all, unleſs we were <hi>redeemed by the blood of God,</hi> Act. 10. 28. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our ſins had received an infinite aggravation, by being againſt
a God of infinite Dignity, as all offences are increaſed proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as the perſon offended is of greater worth; and therefore theſe
ſins had entailed upon them an infinite puniſhment; it was impoſſible
that any ſatisfaction could be made by any thing leſs than an infinite
Perſon, becauſe none but ſuch an one could pay the infinite price that
was due; and he might do it, becauſe the temporary puniſhment in the
infinite dignity of his Perſon, was a full equivalent to the infinity of
puniſhment which was due to us. So that this belief of our Saviour's
Divinity, is neceſſary to the believing the remiſſion of our ſins, and ſo
to be ſure is neceſſary to Piety.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Faith in Chriſt as the Saviour of the World.</head>
               <p>THE Authour here divides the Faith of Chriſt into two objects of
Belief. I. The Perſon in whom we believe. II. The Word in
which we believe upon the credit of the Perſon. In treating of the
firſt of theſe, he declares, Firſt, What kind of Perſon our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
us to believe him to be. Secondly, What is meant by believing
in him. And when he comes to ſhew what kind of Perſon our Saviour
declares himſelf to be, he makes a fine Company of Socinian gloſſes
upon Scripture, which it will be worth our while a little to conſider.
For whereas he is mightily afraid, that the titles of the Son of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be a pregnant proof of our Saviour's Divinity, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to diſtinguiſh them of by a few Poliſh Criticiſms. For firſt he
ſays, that God in Scripture is uſed to expreſs ſomething which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
and which implies more than we can readily expreſs. From
whence he would inferr, that the Title of <hi>Son of God,</hi> is no Argument
for Chriſt's Divinity; but only that he is ſome extraordinary remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Perſon. But let us a little examine the Inſtances he brings. The
firſt is <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo.</hi> Now can any mortal Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from hence, that the word <hi>God</hi> is uſed to ſignify ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite?
The word <hi>more</hi> does ſignify ſomething indefinite indeed,
but the word <hi>God</hi> ſignifies no more than it does in other places, and
the Authour might as well have tranſcribed all the Texts in the Bible,
in which he found the word God as this; and they would have been
as much to his purpoſe. I know not what particular Text the
Authour does refer to for this expreſſion, for 'tis in many; and as far
as can be collected, 'twas a form of Curſing in uſe among the Jews, about
the time of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſome time after; for 'tis found only in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Writers of thoſe times, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 17. and 4. 44. and 25. 22.
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 9. and 35. 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 3. 1 Kings 2. 23. 2 King.</hi> 6. 13.
Sometimes by way of adjuration to another, as of old <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel,
God do ſo to thee, and more alſo if thou hide any thing from me of all the
things that he ſaid unto thee,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 17. that is, I charge thee to tell
me all the threatnings which God tells thee; or elſe may all, and
more than he threatens, light on thee. Other times by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
of miſchief on ones ſelf, as in the caſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 King 2.
23. <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo, if</hi> Adonijah <hi>have not ſpoken this
againſt his own life;</hi> i. e. I will for this Crime take away <hi>Adonijah</hi>'s
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45010:29"/>
Life, or elſe may God take away mine, or puniſh me worſe than I intend
to puniſh him. And ſo in the other places, where the word God has
not an indefinite Senſe; but there is only a wiſhing of ſome Evil or
Puniſhment which is indefinite, greater than the Evil there pointed
at, but not expreſſed of how large a Degree of Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Second</hi> Inſtance is out of <hi>Joel 4. 12. Becauſe I will do this unto
thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> Now, I don't ſee what more
indefinite ſignification there is in the word God here, than in other places.
Indeed there is the ſevereſt denunciation of God's Judgments
upon an irreclaimable People, after Famine, Peſtilence, Sword, and
Fire; ſo that God tells them, ſeeing they are proof againſt all theſe
ſcourges, he will try what they can do againſt him, when he perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
becomes their Adverſary, and ſee if they are able to cope with
him too. <hi>Prepare</hi> then <hi>to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> 'Tis not the word
God, here, that does ſignifie any indefinite number of Evils; but
that God does Sarcaſtically upbraid their Obſtinacy, after all his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
having been ineffectual upon them, by propoſing his infinite
Power as a Match for them, if nothing elſe can be. <hi>Prepare,</hi> &amp;c.
A bitter <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> ſays the excellent<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon</hi>'s Ser. <hi>vol.</hi> 2. Serm. 1.</note> Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, as if a man
could be a match for God, and a poor weak creature be, in any wiſe,
able to encounter him to whom Power belongs. Another Notion the
Authour has got, Why Chriſt ſhould be called the Son of God, is,
becauſe he is a conſiderable Perſon, one of great Note and Eminence;
it being the Scripture Idiom, to advance things, by entitling them
to God; as the Mountains of God, and the Rivers of God, were
thoſe that were moſt eminent in their kind. It is true, That this
ſort of Expreſſion is uſual in Scripture, to denote ſomething that is
great; as the Mountain of God, the Cedar of God, <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a
mighty Hunter before the Lord, or a Hunter of God. With great
Wreſtlings have I wreſtled with my Siſter, ſays <hi>Rachel,</hi> or with the
Wreſtlings of God, <hi>Baptholi Elohim, Luctationibus Dei.</hi> But it does
not follow from hence, That our Saviour was called the Son of God,
becauſe he was a great Perſon. By this way of ſpeaking, he might
well enough be ſtiled the Man of God, or the Prophet of God, to
denote him a great Man, or a great Prophet, but in no propriety of
ſpeech the Son of God: for the word Son does not denote the Perſon
but Relation; ſo that the Son of God is one to whom God does bear
the relation of a Father. Therefore 'tis not his Greatneſs that enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
him thus to God, but his Filiation; for if it was only his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that entituled him to this Character, the mighty <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or the
great Mountain might, upon this account, be called the Sons of God
as well as he; becauſe they were great in their kind as well as he.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45010:30"/>
Well, but, ſays the Authour, <hi>Daniel</hi> makes the Son of God be a
Character of one of great Beauty and Majeſty, by calling the Fourth
Perſon in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furnace by that name. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to aſſert, That this Fourth Perſon here, was the Second Perſon of
the Bleſſed Trinity: for, as the Authour ſays, we can't ſuppoſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>
to have ſeen the Son of God before, and, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
to have known him. All that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi>
who relates this matter, underſtood by the Son of God, was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
who from their nigh Converſation with God, from the great
Portion of Happineſs and Glory he communicates to them, and their
ſo reſembling him by their Purity and the Spiritualneſs of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and from their living in Heaven with him, like Children under
the wing of their Parent; from theſe and the like circumſtances, they
were, and not improperly, called the Sons of God; as we find in many
places of Scripture, as <hi>Pſal. 82. I ſaid ye were Angels, or the Children of
the Moſt High.</hi> So <hi>Job 1. 6. There was a day when the Sons of God,</hi> or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>preſented themſelves before the Lord.</hi> And the LXX. tranſlate this

                  </gap>, <hi>the form of the Fourth was like
the Angel of God.</hi> So that we muſt grant, That the Son of God, here
mentioned, was an Angel of God. But our Bleſſed Saviour was the Son
of God in another manner than his: for his Sonſhip is not founded upon
any ſuch <hi>Analogy</hi> as theirs is; but upon the eternal generation of the
Father; for <hi>he being made ſo much better than the Angels, as he hath by
Inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they,</hi> Heb. 1. 4. In ſhort,
'tis impoſſible, that our Saviour's Sonſhip ſhould be ſuch a Sonſhip as
that of the Angels; becauſe the Apoſtle ſpends this whole Chapter to
prove him a Perſon diſtinct from and above the nature of Angels,
and does beſides ſet the Son of God in direct oppoſition to the
Angels of God. <hi>And of the Angels he ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. v. 7. <hi>But unto the
Son he ſaith,</hi> &amp;c. v 8. <hi>When he bringeth in his firſt begotten into the
world, he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him,</hi> v. 6. So that Chriſt's
Sonſhip muſt be of another kind than that of the Angels: or elſe
there would be no ground for their contradiſtinction, unleſs he was in
a peculiar manner the Son of God, in a ſupereminent extraordinary
way not at all common to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Authour having made theſe Remarks upon this Title of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
The Son of God, <hi>he proceeds to reckon up ſome others, as the</hi>
Meſſias <hi>or</hi> Chriſt, Onely begotten Son of God; <hi>which Characters he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>
to ſpeak a Perſon of unmeaſurable Greatneſs, <hi>a Perſon like his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,
the Light</hi> ſo glorious, that by our moſt intent view we cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any thing of it, but this, That we cannot diſcover.</p>
               <p>Now for all our Authour's haſte, one would imagine that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45010:30"/>
was diſcoverable in our Saviour, by theſe Eulogies; that God
did deſign to manifeſt or diſcover ſomething to us of him, by theſe
Revelations, and not to make Revelations of things that were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealable.
'Tis not to be expected indeed, that, by the help of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
we ſhould dive into the Nature of our Saviour's eternal Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
for we are ſo far from a poſſibility of doing that, that we are
ignorant of the Eſſential Conſtitutions of the moſt inconſiderable
Being we are converſant with. But though we are ignorant of this,
yet we can tell, when 'tis revealed to us by God, what kind of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
our Saviour's is, whether finite or infinite, whether divine or
humane. The Gloriouſneſs of his Nature does not ſo dazzle our
Eyes as to make us confound diſtinct and expreſs Idea's. I have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
though not an adequate Idea or Notion of God, as a Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
incorporeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when I am informed by Revelation
t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at ſuch a Perſon is that infinite, incorporeal Being; or that he has,
in ſuch Revelation, thoſe Characters aſcribed to him, as are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from the Divine Nature; I muſt conclude, That ſuch a one is a
Perſon of the Divine Nature, ſuch an infinite, incorporeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is my Notion of God. Indeed the gloriouſneſs of this
Being keeps Men from diſcovering its Eſſence, and from prying into
its Nature; but yet we may obſerve ſuch Marks and Properties in it,
ſo as to have a diſtinct Conception of it, from all other Beings in the
World. The Sun is a glorious Body, and the more we ſtrive to pry into
its Conſtitution by gazing on it, the more we are blinded; and what
then? don't we know the Sun when we ſee it for all this? becauſe our
Eyes are ſo weak that we cannot ſtare into the Furnace of the Sun,
muſt we therefore take it for a Candle? The Perſon of our Saviour
is glorious, and if it were a thouſand times leſs glorious than it is, I
might not underſtand its Nature; but when I am told, that this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is God, that he is one of the Perſons of the Divine Nature, my
Underſtanding tells me very clearly, That all the marks and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
I have in my Mind of the Divine Nature muſt be attributed to this
Perſon, and though I underſtand nothing of his Eſſence, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<hi>modus</hi> of his <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> yet I am ſure he is that Being, which I
have a certain Idea of, and which I call God. So that 'tis a great
Fallacy in the Authour to ſay, we don't know what our Saviour is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot dive into his Eſſence: for our diſcriminative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of one thing from another, is not by diſcovering the Eſſences,
or internal Conſtitutions of them, but by regarding their outward
marks and properties; and theſe every one has a Knowledge of: for
a Child knows a Roſe from a Stone as well as a Philoſopher, though
it knows not the Qualities and internal Conſtitutions of either.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45010:31"/>
Therefore when I am infallibly informed, that ſuch a Perſon is God,
I am infallibly aſſured he is that kind of Being I have the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Idea of: though I am infinitely ſhort of underſtanding its Nature.</p>
               <p>II. Our Authour now comes to ſhew what is meant by believing in
his Perſon, which he branches into <hi>Two</hi> Parts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Believing in him
with reſpect to his word. <hi>Second,</hi> In reſpect to his Perſon. The <hi>Firſt</hi> of
which onely he ſpeaks to in this Chapter, and ſays that Chriſt is to
his Followers as the Sun to Travellers. 'Tis no matter what they think
of its magnitude, or whether they think it be no bigger than a Buſhel,
it guides them all alike; and thus it is, he ſays, with the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
'tis no matter what we believe him to be, if we have but
a Practical Faith; which is all our Saviour, he ſays, requires. And this
he attempts to prove out of <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. a place, than which, one would
have thought, he ſhould rather have choſen any Text in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
beſides, <hi>How long doſt thou make us to doubt, if thou be the Chriſt
tell us plainly? Jeſus ſaid, I told you</hi> (by calling God my Father) <hi>and
ye believe me not,</hi> Joh. 10. 24, 25. And preſently after he tell them,
<hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> v. 30. at which <hi>they took up ſtones to ſtone him,
ſaying, thou being a man makeſt thy ſelf God.</hi> Now, what can the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
draw from this? Why, he ſays, our Saviour, upon ſo preſſing
an occaſion as their endeavouring to ſtone him, did not aſſert his right
of Divinity; but contented himſelf with this Anſwer, <hi>Is it not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
in your Law, I have ſaid ye are Gods? If he called them Gods to
whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken, ſay ye
of him whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the World, thou bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemeſt,
becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God.</hi> Let the Authour make
out of this place what he can for his Opinion; I am ſure this place is
as pregnant a proof of our Lord's Divinity, as moſt places in the
Bible are; and whatever the Authour thinks, he does exactly Anſwer
to the Jews Queſtion, and tells them plainly, he is what they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be, the Son of God, and very God. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> in
this place he tells them, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> v. 30. We two
Perſons are the ſame God: and 'tis plain, That the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood
that to be his Meaning, by their great rage which followed, and their
Anſwer to his Queſtion, why they ſhould ſo barbarouſly uſe him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo many of his kind and ſaving Miracles. <hi>For a good work we ſtone
thee not, but for Blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou being a Man makeſt thy
ſelf God.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> he gives them a reaſon why he might claim
the title of God, without Blaſphemy; whereas <hi>Rulers to whom the
word of God came,</hi> or who had their Power and Authority from him,
are called Gods in Scripture, <hi>Pſal. 2. 1, &amp;</hi> 6. Why has not he <hi>whom
the Father has ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. a better claim to this Title? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45010:31"/>
he farther tells them, That he was God in a more peculiar manner
than they, and in a proper and not metaphorical ſenſe, by a perſonal
Union with the Father; <hi>that ye may know and believe that the Father is
in me, and I in him.</hi> This cannot be, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> pretend, by the
Power of God, co-operating in Chriſt: for though 'tis true that then
God would be in him, yet he could not be in God. And beſides, to
ſay he is in the Father and the Father in him, denotes an Equality in
each, and his being in the Father in the ſame manner that the Father
is in him. And thus much to ſhew, That our Saviour did aſſert his
Divinity, and prove it too, upon this occaſion; and ſo conſequently,
did not only require them to believe in his Word, but in his Perſon

               <p>THE <hi>Firſt</hi> Argument which the Authour uſes to prove the Belief
of Chriſt's Divinity to be impertinent, is drawn from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
I ſhall not now diſpute, whether this Letter in <hi>Euſebius</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the ſame which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſent by <hi>Hoſius</hi> into <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
though 'tis certain many of theſe things were feigned or interpolated,
and though the ſame Letter be in <hi>Socrates,</hi> yet, probably he might have
it only out of <hi>Euſebius;</hi> and ſo it ſtill may rely upon his ſole Authority,
who was too great a Friend to the <hi>Arian</hi> cauſe to ſuffer any very favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
opinion to be paſſed upon its Adverſaries. But after all, the
Emperour does not here condemn the Belief of the Orthodox as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;
but writes chiefly to temper the Hearts of Biſhop <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Arius,</hi> who might be both perhaps ſomething too warm;
and therefore exhorts them ſo affectionately to mutual Peace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
becauſe of the Quarrels, and Schiſms, and other Evils,
which this hot and pertinacious Diſputing was like to bring into the
Church. Indeed the Emperour calls the Controverſie <hi>Arius</hi> had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

for truly the ſhuffling of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the ambiguous terms he uſed,
made the Emperour think 'twas only a Controverſie about Words.
But however the Emperour looked upon <hi>Arius</hi> to be in the wrong, as
appears by what he ſays in his Letter to him; <hi>And you</hi> Arius <hi>have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately
aſſerted</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>what you ought not ſo much as
to have thought of at firſt, or when you had thought of it, you ſhould have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it over in ſilence.</hi> But what, after all, though the Emperour thought
'twas no matter who was in the right, <hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> and though
he was of our Authour's Opinion, That a right Belief of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Divinity ſignified nothing? Yet this is but the ſingle opinion of
one, who was but a Novice in Chriſtianity; and 'tis moſt reaſonable
to think, that <hi>Alexander</hi> and the other Learned Biſhops, better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Importance of that Queſtion, than the Emperour, whoſe
Arms and other buſineſs of the Empire drew his Thoughts another way.
But beſides, afterwards when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was better informed, of the
miſchievous Conſequences of the <hi>Arian</hi> Tenets, he quickly alter'd his
Sentiments of their Cauſe, and did not then treat them with ſuch ſoft and
favourable Expreſſions. After the concluſion of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council,
in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he triumphs mightily
that Truth has at laſt prevailed, and bleſſes himſelf at the Thoughts
of the <hi>Arian</hi> Blaſphemies.‖<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>How great,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and how execrable
Contumelies, (Good God! be thou propitious and merciful to us) do they
irreligiouſly and wickedly caſt upon our venerable Saviour, our Hope and our
Life; and have not only impudently aſſerted things contrary to the divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſpired Scriptures and our holy Faith; but have openly profeſſed, That
they believe them too?</hi> In this Epiſtle he calls <hi>Arius, impudent Miniſter
of the Devil,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and in his other Letter to the
Biſhops and People, he ſays, <hi>it ſeems to him requiſite, that</hi> Arius <hi>and his
Followers ſhould be called</hi> Porphyrians, <hi>that they may be known by their
Name, whoſe Manners they follow.</hi> And there orders, if any Book be found
of <hi>Arius</hi>'s, that it be immediately burned, <hi>That not only his Execrable
Doctrine may be throughly rooted up; but that there may be no Monument
left to Poſterity.</hi> And now let the Authour make the beſt he can of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Judgment; and if his other Arguments will ſupport
him no better than this, his Cauſe, I am afraid, will ſoon come to the
ground.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is drawn from the ſimilitude of the Sun, That
'tis not neceſſary the Traveller ſhould underſtand the Dimenſions of
that Body, when he goes by its Light; ſo it is not at all neceſſary to
know what our Saviour is, to practiſe his Commands. But this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
I have already anſwered in the <hi>Fifth Chapter;</hi> when I ſhewed
what Influence the Belief of our Saviour's Divinity had upon Men's
Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45010:32"/>
But his Argument which follows, is very fine and Philoſophical.
That when he conſiders the great diſproportion between our Earth,
and ſo many Worlds, which he fanſies to be from the innumerable
Stars we diſcover with and without the Teleſcope, each Star being
the Sun or the Center of a World, from this conſideration he cannot
imagine, <hi>that our great Creatour ſhould be ſo greedy of a little of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
breath, as to purchaſe it with a fall from Heaven. This would be to
diſgrace our Lord from the dignity of a Benefactor, to the vileneſs of an
unskilful Tradeſman; who buys vile ware, and pays for it infinitely more
than it is worth.</hi> Indeed I have hardly patience to anſwer this abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Blaſphemy; to ſee a fooliſh Philoſopher thus horridly to affront
his Creatour, and in this witleſs Buffoonry to ridicule the infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of his bleſſed Redeemer; becauſe he cannot make it agree
with his ſyſtem of Phyſicks. But pray let him conſider, that we do
not think, the dignity of our nature, or the beauty of our World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
God, who has no reſpect of perſons, to work our Redemption:
this was only the effect of his infinite mercy, which we can never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
admire and praiſe. And beſides, what ſignifies the largeneſs
and gloriouſneſs of the Heavenly Bodies, in compariſon with Mens
Immortal Souls? The Sun is the moſt glorious Body we ſee; and yet
a Fly is a more noble Creature than that. The ſenſitive Soul, that
this is endowed with, advances its excellence far above any the moſt
glorious inanimate being, that can be imagined. But the immortal
Soul of one Man is of more dignity than all the Corporeal Creation,
and if there had been no other way to redeem Mens Souls that were
loſt, but by the deſtruction of all the other Creation, 'twould not
have been unbecoming the divine Wiſdom to have deſtroyed all them,
to have redeemed theſe; becauſe theſe are of infinitely more value
than they. But it may be that the Authour thinks, there are an infinite
number of Worlds, all ſtocked with rational Creatures, of, it may be,
much more dignity than we; ſo that it was not worth God's while to
take care of ſuch inſignificant Creatures as we are. Now we know
nothing of theſe great Bodies, and for what uſe Providence deſigned
them, beſides for the benefits we receive from them; and therefore
Men talk at random when they aſcribe any other to them. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
there were rational Creatures in ten Millions of Earths, that
were moving round their reſpective Suns, muſt God leſs take care of
our World, becauſe he has a great many more to take care of? This
is to attribute a fooliſh weakneſs to the Deity, and to think it is with
him as it is with ſome Parents, who when they have a great number
of Children, do not love any particular Child ſo well, as if they had
but that alone, or but fewer. Certainly God bears a Fatherly Love
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45010:33"/>
to all his Creatures, and will provide whatſoever is neceſſary for
them; 'tis not his providing for innumerable other Creatures, that
can hinder him from providing for us: his Omniſcience cannot be
diſtracted by innumerable Operations, and his infinite Power and
Love can, and will do all things that are neceſſary for us. So that if
it be requiſite to repair the forfeited Souls of Mankind; that a Perſon
of the Godhead ſhould make an infinite ſatisfaction, for ſins againſt
an infinite Majeſty, and which do deſerve an infinite puniſhment; 'tis
not the gloriouſneſs of the other Worlds which ſhould hinder him
from doing it; for his Fatherly compaſſion reaches to us as well as
them, and he would not ſtick to uſe theſe means for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
if no other could effect it. But the Authour ſays, that
then Chriſt has paid infinitely more than the ware was worth, like an
unskilful Tradeſman, as he calls him. I ſhall not now diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God could have pardoned the ſins of the World, any other way
than by the blood of God; 'tis enough for us to know, that God has
done it only by theſe means, and to be ſufficiently thankful to him for
it. And when the Authour, or any of his Party, ſhall think fit to
engage upon a diſpute of ſatisfaction, the Pens of thoſe excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of our Religion of late againſt Popery, will not be ſilent in
this diſpute, if they ſhall think fit to begin it; though all the Tribe
down from <hi>Servet</hi> to this Authour, will not be able to ſhake any part
of the Treatiſes on this ſubject, by the moſt Excellent <hi>Grotius,</hi> and
the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> But becauſe the Authour here offers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his bare aſſertion, and becauſe I have in part anſwered this
objection already in the fifth Chapter; I ſhall proceed to his next
Argument, which is, That it is not ſuppoſable that our Lord ſhould
require a belief in his Divinity, becauſe it was not required of ſome of
the firſt Embracers of Chriſtianity, ſuch as <hi>Philip</hi>'s Eunuch, and the
like; who were baptized into the Chriſtian Faith, he ſays, without
any knowledge of his Divinity. It is very certain, we do not find in
Scripture any ſet Form, to be recited by all Perſons to be baptized,
that declares an expreſs belief in our Saviour's Divinity; but ſuch a
Declaration has been the Cuſtom of the Church in the moſt early
times, and therefore though the Scripture do not aſſert any ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
yet ſuch a ſilence, eſpecially conſidering the compendious
way of writing in the Authours of theſe Books, cannot conclude, that
there was no ſuch form uſed by them, or that all that were to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized
did not give an expreſs aſſent to, and belief in the Doctrine of
the Trinity. It is moſt certain, they were baptized with a form of
words which does imply that Doctrine, <hi>viz. In the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that unleſs we will ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45010:33"/>
they were baptized into names which they did not underſtand, which
we cannot ſuppoſe any reaſonable Men ſhould; they muſt underſtand
the meaning and purport of theſe names, and ſo have a belief in the
perſon as well as in the Doctrine of our Saviour: For how can we
ſuppoſe, but that when any new Converts to Chriſtianity, ſhould ſee
others baptized before them into theſe three names of Father, Son and
Holy Ghoſt, they ſhould never trouble themſelves to know who they
were? If they were Jews, they would by this be afraid of running into
the Gentile Polytheiſm, and would be ſure to be well inſtructed in this
matter, for fear of Idolatry. If they were Gentile Converts to hear
this form without any farther Inſtruction, they would be apt to think
this was but to keep in their own Religion ſtill, and only to retrench
the number of their Gods from 300, to 3; which would be ſtill as
much contradiction to the Principles of their Converſion, as their
former Tenets. So that we muſt needs think, that the Apoſtles did
explain this form of Baptiſm to all that were baptized, how ſuddenly
ſoever, and did inform them, what theſe three Perſons, into whoſe
names they were baptized were, and how they were conſiſtent with
the unity of the Deity; which would give them the full notion of the
Doctrine of the Trinity. And though all that is recorded of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of this Eunuch is, that he believed that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of
God,</hi> yet it is to be ſuppoſed, that he believed in God the Father too,
or elſe <hi>Philip</hi> would not have baptized him; and 'tis alſo very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to think, that he that was ſo inquiſitive about the ſenſe of the
Prophecies, would not be leſs exact in endeavouring to underſtand the
meaning of this ſtrange form of his Baptiſm, a Ceremony which was
of ſo grand import. But we find in latter times, when Hiſtory and
Relations are more diſtinct, that perſons to be baptized were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
their Creed, into which they were throughly inſtructed before by
a full explanation of all its Articles; and if in caſe of extream danger,
they were like to die before they were ſufficiently inſtructed,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> Father tells us farther in
another place, that 'twas a Cuſtom in the Church,
for the forty days before Baptiſm, that in the days
of <hi>Lent,</hi> (they being baptized at <hi>Eaſter)</hi> the
Perſons to be baptized, ſhould be throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Doctrine of the Trinity. So that
whereas it was the uſe of the Church, in the moſt
early times, to inſtruct Perſons to be baptized in the
Doctrine of the Trinity, and this Cuſtom was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
down to them by Tradition, and it being not
to be ſuppoſed, but that Men of ſenſe would enquire,
of their own accord, into the meaning of the form
of their Baptiſm, which would lead them into the
knowledge of this Doctrine; for to be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the name of any one, is to be baptized into the
belief and worſhip of him, ſo that this does neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
inform them of three Perſons to be believed in,
and worſhipped, which three Perſons they are ſure
can be but one God; therefore theſe primitive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes
were inſtructed in the Myſtery of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The next Argument the Authour urges, is from a place in <hi>Juſtin
Martyr,</hi> in whoſe days the Authour acknowledges the Doctrine of
our Saviours Divinity to be the Doctrine moſt received; but becauſe
<hi>Juſtin</hi> ſays in a very ſoft expreſſion, <hi>there are ſome my Friends among us,
who profeſs him to be Chriſt, and affirm him to be Man born of Men;</hi>
therefore they that did believe ſo were reckoned true Believers. I
know not but that the Authour was helped to this Argument by <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
Socinus</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Fauſt. Socini Reſp. ad Jac. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</note>, who brings this Authority of <hi>Juſtin</hi> to prove, that
many in that Age held Chriſt only to be meer Man. But however; if
by Unbelievers the Authour means perfect Infidels, that did not own
the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, or that he was ſent of God, but looked
on him as a downright Impoſter; I do not think that thoſe perſons
<hi>Juſtin</hi> ſpeaks of were ſuch, or were reputed ſuch in the Church at that
time: yet though they were not reckoned Unbelievers in that ſenſe,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45010:34"/>
they were reckoned falſe Believers, or Heterodox; they were proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>Ebionites,</hi> or ſome ſuch Hereticks, that looked upon Chriſt as
meer Man, or elſe an Angel incarnate, or ſomething of that nature:
and though they were reputed Chriſtians, it was never as Orthodox
ones; though they might be thought to be in a ſtate of Salvation, yet
they were always lookt upon to be in very groſs Errours. But it does
not follow, that their Opinions were harmleſs, becauſe <hi>Juſtin</hi> calls
them Friends, he undoubtedly had Friends among the Heathens as well
as the Hereticks; and I ſuppoſe our Authour would take it very ill,
if all Orthodox Chriſtians ſhould commence Enemies to him for his
Opinions in this Book. So that the good nature and charitableneſs
of this good Man, could no more palliate the guilt of theſe Mens wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Hereſies, than their Blaſphemies could leſſen his Vertues.</p>
               <p>The Authour afterwards begins to be very gay and florid, and ſays,
that the Orthodox belief of our Saviour's Divinity, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be contrary to that of the Ancients, is <hi>like Diamonds, coſtly,
hard, and uſeleſs,</hi> that our Saviours being brought into Queſtions of
this nature, <hi>is like Gold being made into a Pin,</hi> which is only to debaſe
his dignity, <hi>and to employ it at Boys-play.</hi> But who ever ſaid, that
our Lord's name, being in any Propoſition, gave truth or dignity to
it purely as ſuch? Our Authour may be as merry with his Puſh-pin ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
as he pleaſes, but I think there is as little ſenſe in this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
ſtuff, as there is (to uſe his expreſſion) <hi>of that noble Metal in
the point</hi> of his Pin. But though the Question of our Saviour's Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
does not receive its importance, by having our Saviour's name in
it, yet it may from the Command of God, who has obliged us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
aright in this point; it may from the conducibleneſs of ſuch a
belief to a good Life, as we have proved before, and then all theſe
fine ſimile's are not to much purpoſe.</p>
               <p>But our Authour as he began this Chapter with the Teſtimony of
an Emperour, he ends it with one of a Lord; though perhaps he had
plaid the Orator better, if he had given out his leaſt Teſtimony firſt,
and have begun with the Lord and ended with the Emperour. Though
this Teſtimony I believe will ſtand him in no more ſtead than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as upon examination will appear. Now this Teſtimony is of one
<hi>Leonas</hi> a Courtier in <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s Court, who was ſent by that Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to preſide in the Council of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> who ſeeing the <hi>Biſhops fierce
and endleſs</hi> (he ſays) <hi>at this puſh-pin Doctrine of our Lord's Divinity,</hi>
diſmiſſed them with this reprimand, <hi>Go and play the Fools at home.</hi>
The Authour quotes <hi>Socrates</hi> for this, though theſe words are not in
him: there are indeed theſe words,<note n="*" place="margin">Socr. Hiſ. Ecc. Lib.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Get you gone, and play the Fool again in the Church, or in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45010:35"/>
Church matters. But I cannot imagine why the Author ſhould tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
it as he does, unleſs perhaps he has met with ſome latin tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> or ſome latin Authour, that quoted this place out of
him, which led him into this errour. And this in all probability is
the true caſe. He finds <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tranſlated by <hi>abite domum,</hi> or <hi>ite
domum,</hi> and ſo thinks the word <hi>[domum]</hi> belongs to the latter part
of the Sentence; not to <hi>[abite],</hi> but to <hi>[nugas agite]</hi> the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo renders it into Engliſh, <hi>play the Fool at home.</hi>
But whether this be the caſe or no, it is no great matter, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is not very conſiderable; and beſides, it does not make any thing
againſt the Orthodox Believers. <hi>Leonas</hi> himſelf, was in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
an <hi>Arian,</hi> as being ſuch a Favourite of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and being ſent
to preſide in that Council which did moſtly conſiſt of <hi>Arians:</hi> and if
any plaid the Fool in this Council 'twas the <hi>Arians;</hi> for the two quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
Parties here were both <hi>Arian,</hi> both agreed againſt the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
in the <hi>Nicene Creed:</hi> the Opinion of the <hi>Acacian</hi> Party we may ſee at
large in <hi>Socrates</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Socr. Lib. 2. Cap. 32.</note>, in their Creed which they ſet forth, when they

the Creed, ſet out by the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was <hi>Arian</hi> too.
So that <hi>Leonas</hi> might well think them to play the Fools, when they
were both agreed upon the point, and were very unanimous, as to
the main of their Hereſy, that they ſhould wrangle, and ſquabble,
and fall to Loggerheads about nothing. For all their buſtle was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhould expreſs their <hi>Arian</hi> Notions, by altering an old Creed

               <p>THE Authour begins this Chapter with a Teſtimony from the
Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> again, who, in his<note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. de vitâ Conſt. Lib. 2.</note> Letter to <hi>Arius</hi> and
<hi>Alexander,</hi> ſays, that the Queſtion they were diſputing about was ſo
abſtruſe, that they could make few among the Multitude to underſtand
it. And what then? the matter of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Belief might be plain
enough, and yet they, by their diſputes might render it abſtruſe and
puzzling. I have known ordinary Queſtions in Logick and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
drawn into ſuch fine Threads by Argumentation, that both the
Diſputants have loſt the ſight of the Queſtion, and have hardly at laſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45010:35"/>
underſtood their own meaning. And this might be the Caſe of <hi>Arius</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> for ought I know. But the Reaſon why the Emperour
thought the Queſtion it ſelf ſo puzzling, was, becauſe he could ſee lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
difference between their Opinions; for he could not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
their diſtinction of a <hi>Generation</hi> and a <hi>Production out of nothing,</hi>
he thought this was only a Metaphyſical notion too tranſcendent for
vulgar Brains, but was not aware of the Conſequence which <hi>Arius</hi>
drew from the Son's being produced out of Nothing, that this muſt
make him a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Creature.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to ſhew, That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was a Perſon of
whom the Scripture did foretel that his Generation ſhould not be
known. But he does not produce any of theſe Prophecies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall not be obliged to anſwer thoſe; which ſome others have
brought to our Authour's purpoſe. All that he brings is a Text out
of <hi>John,</hi> and another out of the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the firſt is, <hi>we know whence
this man is, but when Chriſt cometh no man knoweth whence he is,</hi> Joh. 7.
27. This place does not prove, That Chriſt is not the eternal Son
of the Father; nay, it rather makes for it than againſt it; becauſe,
by the Phraſe, <hi>no man knoweth,</hi> it ſuppoſes a Generation above all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
underſtanding. But it no ways proves, That we cannot tell
whether Chriſt be the Son of God or no; and this it muſt prove, if
it will do the Authour any kindneſs. All that this Text proves, is,
That the <hi>Jews</hi> thought, that Chriſt was to be of no earthly Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not the Son of any Man, but of God. But we know, ſay they,
whence this Man is, that he is born of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> this is the
Carpenter's Son, and therefore he cannot be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who is to
be of a heavenly original, the Son of God in a manner we cannot tell:
for if it was not to be known whether the <hi>Meſſias</hi> were to be the Son
of God or no, why does our Saviour call himſelf ſo, and require o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to believe him ſuch? and if he was the Son of God, then it was
to be known whence he was, in this Senſe; ſo that all that can be
drawn from this Text, is, That Chriſt is not of an earthly Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and this we would have granted him, without his pains of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. The other Text is out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. where <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> being
brought as a Type of our Saviour, and being there declared to be
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>without Father, and without Mother,</hi> without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
therefore Chriſt's original is not known. Indeed Chriſt is
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>without Mother,</hi> in reſpect of his Divinity; but he is not
<hi>without Father,</hi> unleſs that we ſuppoſe him falſly to call God his Father,
in ſo many places. But neither was <hi>Melchizedeck without Father, and
without Mother,</hi> as not being of an earthly extraction; he was <hi>without
Father, without Mother, without deſcent,</hi> in relation to the <hi>Aronical</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:45010:36"/>
Prieſts, whoſe Fathers, and Mothers, and all their Pedigree was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
ſet down and preſerved in the Jewiſh Records; but there was
no <hi>conſtat</hi> of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>'s Pedigree; the Scripture is perfectly ſilent
of his Original, and no other Records give an account of it. But
our Saviour's Original, according to the fleſh, is ſet down by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,</hi>
an exact Catalogue given us of all his Progenitors: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> is no Type of our Saviour, in this reſpect. His
<hi>being like unto the Son of God</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks) in his <hi>abiding a
Prieſt continually,</hi> v. 3. that is, being of that bleſſing kind of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which ſhall always continue, when the other of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall
be aboliſhed. Well, but the Authour ſays, That the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
Chriſt's Pedigree from a wrong Father, and two different ways,
on purpoſe to amuſe us. This is a bold ſtroke, to tax theſe inſpired
Writers with Errour and Deceit, and to make the Holy Spirit of God
the Spirit of Deluſion. But what though the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do ſhew
Chriſt's deſcent two different ways, they may be both true for all
that; the intermingled Marriages of Families, in our modern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where all nigh degrees are prohibited, do often occaſion one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to deſcend from another two ways, which muſt be much more ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were often to marry their nigheſt Relations to
keep up their Families. Therefore 'tis no wonder if the Evangeliſts
relate this Pedigree divers ways, where as it might have been related
ſeveral other ways and all true: for 'twere eaſie to draw his preſent
Majeſties deſcent only from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, in it may be
ſeven or eight different Branches. But if any one has a mind to ſee
the difficulties of this Genealogy explained, he may ſee it at large in
thoſe excellent Men<note n="*" place="margin">Grot. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.</note>

                  <hi>Bochartus;</hi> for it would be too
long to enter upon a Diſcourſe of this nature here. So that 'tis a moſt
impudent Falſity in the Authour to ſay, <hi>That it is left impoſſible to prove
our Saviour deriv'd from</hi> David, when the Evangeliſts have written
theſe Genealogies for that end.</p>
               <p>Next the Authour quarrels with the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to explain the Doctrine of Chriſt's Divinity; or, as he ſpeaks,
for <hi>boldly anſwering, I will declare his generation.</hi> We know not at

us, that<note n="*" place="margin">

of Honour concerning the Trinity, aſſerting an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Trinity.</hi> But
this had been done often before <hi>Alexander</hi>'s time; <hi>Tertullian</hi> had wrote
a Book of it againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> and we may ſee as curious Diſquiſitions,
probably as this was, of our Saviour's Divinity, in many of the Fathers
before <hi>Alexander:</hi> nay, the Authour allows the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45010:36"/>
Divinity to be moſtly received in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot ſuppoſe that it was this curious Diſquiſition of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
that ſo offended <hi>Arius;</hi> for if ſo, he might as well be offended
with <hi>Tertullian</hi> and ſeveral others: But <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives us the true ſtate
of the Caſe,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theod</hi> lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Arius</hi> was nettled at <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Advance to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick,
but could not vent his ſpleen againſt him by any Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him, though he watched him narrowly, by reaſon of the
excellent Circumſpectneſs of his Life, and therefore took this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to cavil at his Doctrine, only for ſaying, <hi>The Son
is of equal honour with the Father, and of the ſame ſubſtance.</hi>
                  </q> This
<hi>Arius</hi> had the confidence to contradict in the Face of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to ſay, what was never ſaid before, (ſays <hi>Sozomen)</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>That
the Son was produced out of nothing, That there was a time when he was not.</hi>
So that let <hi>Alexander</hi> be as wary in his Expreſſions as he could, 'tis ten
to one but ſome time or other he had been catched up by <hi>Arius,</hi> who
only waited for an opportunity to oppoſe him; and probably it would
have been indifferent to him to have broached any other Hereſie, if he
could, with any plauſibility, have contradicted <hi>Alexander.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

deſires only that he would come to a fair Diſpute, to try the
Truth of his Doctrine: and there was a diſpute held, in which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
ſupplied the Moderator's part very calmly (as the Hiſtorian ſays)

of the diſpute he determined it againſt <hi>Arius,</hi> and forthwith commands
him to renounce his Errour, which he and his Followers pertinaciouſly
refuſing, he at laſt excommunicates them. And truly I think the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
had patience enough to ſuffer ſo long the Pride and Hereſie of this
haughty Presbyter; and I cannot but admire his Clemency, in allowing
him a Conference before Excommunication, after ſo impudent an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to his Dioceſan: and one would be apt to think, that when the
Authour blames <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo much for this action, he had ſome little
Foreſight of his own Caſe. Then followed the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
which excommunicated <hi>Arius,</hi> and thoſe Biſhops which would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to its Determinations in this Point; and truly the Authour is ſo
civil to let this Council paſs over without reflection, but runs off again
to the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom he cenſures for his Diſobedience
to the Imperial Letters for the reſtoring of <hi>Arius,</hi> upon account of his
being excommunicated by the Council, and his wanting the word <gap reason="foreign">

no real Diſobedience at all of the Biſhop to the Emperour, as the

he does not think it a Point in which he ought to meddle, but leaves

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45010:38"/>
that any one might ſee he deſigned nothing but ſhuffling;
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was the Teſt of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> was left out, and
<hi>Arius</hi> ſtill as fond of his Doctrines as ever; and moreover, that the
Council which pretended to reſtore him, was but Provincial at beſt,
and moſt of the Orthodox in it retired, and the <hi>Euſebian</hi> Party taking
off his Excommunication by a trick, and therefore thinks, he may very
well, upon theſe conſiderations, refuſe to reſtore him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Imperial Letters. And truly he, or any other Biſhop, that
would take into his Flock ſuch a Wolf as this upon theſe terms, would
little deſerve the name of a good Paſtour; and he that ſhould refuſe to
do ſo, might juſtify himſelf from diſobedience to any Earthly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
whatſoever. He that will ſee more of <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Vindication,
may ſee it in his own Apologies. I have been more full in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of this good Man, becauſe the ſcurrillous Pens, of late, have
made it their buſineſs, after ſo many hundred years, to calumniate him
again.</p>
               <p>The next thing that the Authour offers, is againſt the word Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial,
and this from a ſaying of <hi>Socrates, Lib. 1. Cap.</hi> 18. (not
Book the 2. as he quotes it) in which the Authour would have him
to condemn the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as a word which did trouble Mens
Minds, and which the Biſhops themſelves did not underſtand. Now
<hi>Socrates</hi> is Friend enough to the Orthodox Cauſe, every one knows,
which makes the Authour brand him with the name of partial, and in
many places ſhews, he had no diſlike to the word Conſubſtantial: but
he has one fault which is common to many Hiſtorians, that he makes
too many remarks upon his Relations, and oftentimes in matters, the
true reaſon of which we was far from underſtanding. But 'tis no great
matter what the Hiſtorians remarks are, 'tis their Relations, and not
their reflections which we are to value; and yet after all, <hi>Socrates</hi> does
not in the leaſt reflect upon the Orthodox Doctrine, or the teſt of it,
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He ſhews his diſlike indeed to thoſe that made too nice
explications of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thoſe that
crumbled this queſtion into many little Cavils, and raiſed upon it
ſome nice diſputes, and therefore they that did ſo were to blame;
but they might believe what was ſignified by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of theſe Cavils, and they might without any of theſe Niceties
ſtand up for the word, as being thought, by the wiſdom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
to be the beſt Teſt to diſcover the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy.</p>
               <p>Then the Authour applauds himſelf mightily, in fanſying that the
Doctrine of the Trinity is not the ſame now, as it was in <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s
time; becauſe he in his Dialogues explains this Myſtery by the
ſimilitude of three Men, who are one in their common nature, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45010:38"/>
three in their individual Capacity; this the Authour would have to
infer a Tritheiſm, and as well to juſtify the Heathen Polytheiſm as the
Trinity. Now theſe Dialogues, though bound up with <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s
Works, are not his, but according to the Opinion of moſt learned
Men, are <hi>Maximus</hi>'s: but however, there is nothing in them which
would infer any thing like that which the Authour pretends to. He
and ſeveral other of the Fathers, give many Illuſtrations, to explain,
as far as poſſible, to humane underſtandings, this Myſtery; but yet they,
as all other ſimilitudes, muſt not be ſtrained farther than the Authours
deſigned them; 'tis enough if they bear that Analogy or likeneſs
which are there ſingled out, not that theſe ſhould have, in their whole
nature, an uniform ſimilitude. Now <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Men, and yet agreeing in one common nature Man, are a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good illuſtration of the Bleſſed Trinity; for as <hi>Peter</hi> is Man, <hi>James</hi>
is Man, and <hi>John</hi> is Man, and yet there is but one Man (that is) one
common nature of humanity; ſo the Father is God, the Son God,
and the Holy Ghoſt God, and yet there is but one God, that is, one
common Divine Nature; but yet this illuſtration does not bear an
univerſal Analogy with the Trinity; for <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> agree
only in the ſame common collective nature, and are only collectively
one, but Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, are eſſentially one. So that I ſay,
this illuſtration of the Trinity, may be very good, though it does not
hold univerſally: 'tis enough if the three Perſons in each agree in a
general Unity, though they differ in the ſpecification of this Unity;
'tis enough if both are three and yet one, though one be by a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
and the other an eſſential Oneneſs. So Biſhop, Prieſt, and
Deacon, agree in one common Office of Miniſtry in general, and
this is brought by the ſame Father, as a farther illuſtration of this
Myſtery: and ſo may any other three Species of a Genus, or any three
Individuums of a Species; but then they muſt be carried no further
than it was meant this illuſtration ſhould go; for to expect an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
ſimilitude, is rather to expect a ſameneſs than a likeneſs. And
now if Men ſhould take the boldneſs to rack, and tenter, and ſport
themſelves with the Similes and Parables in the New Teſtament, of
our Saviour's Church, Doctrines, Kingdom and the like, as our late
<hi>Socinian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Pamphlets have done theſe of the ancient Fathers, I dare ſay
they might, with as great eaſe, ridicule the whole Chriſtian Religion,
as they do this Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>As to what the Authour ſays of the word Myſtery, which he calls
an impregnable Fort, and the Papiſts Cock-Argument for Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,
and his ſaying, the contradictions are no leſs in Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
than the Trinity; this is all bold and impudent Aſſertion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45010:39"/>
without proof, and therefore requires no Anſwer: but if any one has
a mind to ſee all theſe Objections for ever ſilenced, let him read the
two incomparable Dialogues printed in the time of the late Popiſh
Controverſy, and Entituled, <hi>the Doctrine of the Trinity and Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation
compared.</hi> Well, but the Authour ſays, if the Trinity be
a Myſtery, why ſhould we diſpute any longer about it? <hi>To diſpute
concerning a Myſtery (ſays he) and at the ſame time acknowledge it a
Myſtery, is a contradiction, as great as any in the greateſt Myſtery.</hi> I ſee
our Authour is all for contradictions, and will have no Myſtery
without them. I thought a Myſtery had been an unintelligible Truth,
and not a contradictious falſity. But however, why ſhould we not
diſpute concerning a Myſtery? If the Myſterious Truth be denied,
it is to be defended as well as other truths: it is not the leſs a Truth
becauſe it is myſterious, any more than a Concluſion in <hi>Algebra</hi> is not
true becauſe I do not underſtand it. But beſides, ſuch a truth has
more reaſon to be contended for, as it is of greater importance, and
ſuch we have proved this Doctrine of the holy Trinity to be. Indeed
if Men did diſpute about a Myſtery as a Myſtery, there would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Authour's Objection; for then Men would pretend to
underſtand ſomething by their Diſputes, whoſe name imported it was
not to be underſtood. But there is no ſuch thing in the Arguments of
the Orthodox, for the defence of the Trinity: they do not diſpute
this Doctrine as a Myſtery, but as a Truth, which in ſome meaſure
may be underſtood; they do not diſpute about the <hi>modus</hi> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which is unintelligible, but about the exiſtence of it, which is
a Truth can be underſtood; they do not pretend to ſhew how they
are Three in One, but that they are Three in One. There is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between underſtanding how things are, and that they are;
for a Man may underſtand there is ſuch an Arts as <hi>Algebra,</hi> by ſeeing
<hi>Oughtred,</hi> or <hi>Diophantus,</hi> and yet underſtand nothing of the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of Equation, nor one tittle of the Rules of that Art.</p>
               <p>But ſtill the Authour will have this Doctrine a Myſtery in his ſenſe,
that is, a falſity full of contradictions, from the contrary determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Councils, and the various expoſitions of others, and by the
wavering, as he calls it, of the Council of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> which changed
their Opinion, and would have called in the Copies of one of their
Creeds. As to the contrary determinations of Councils, that to the
grief of the Chriſtian Church is but too true, if we may call the <hi>Arian</hi>
Synods by that name; for the <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy, by God's Permiſſion, did
ſo much prevail, that by the Countenance of an <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour, the
World almoſt became <hi>Arian;</hi> and then 'twas an eaſy matter for the
Biſhops of that perſwaſion to form themſelves into Aſſemblies, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45010:39"/>
to declare what ever Orthodox Opinions they pleaſed for Hereſy.
The Authour, if he had ſaid any thing to his purpoſe, ſhould have
proved, that the determinations of Orthodox Councils, had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another, but what are the contradictions of the Hereticks
to them. Truth can be but one and the ſame, though errour may be
infinite; and therefore the Conformity of the Orthodox Doctrines to
one another, ſhew their verity, whilſt the diſagreement and claſhing
of the Heretical Creeds, are an infallible proof of their falſity. The
Orthodox always very fairly ſtick to their old Teſt, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
but the Hereticks are ſoon for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſoon for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and ſometimes for neither. Well; but the Council of <hi>Sirmium</hi> has
contradicted it ſelf. 'Tis very true, and 'tis the misfortune or many
Heretical Opiniators to do the ſame. But by the way, I am afraid
the <hi>Arian</hi> Cauſe has but a very poor Patron of this Authour; for
when ever he has a mind to charge any ſlip or miſdemeanour upon a
Council, he always ſingles out an <hi>Arian</hi> one for it. He lately blamed
the <hi>Arian</hi> Council at <hi>Seleucia</hi> for Tumult, and now he charges one of
the ſame ſtamp at <hi>Sirmium</hi> for Contradictions. Now the matter at
<hi>Sirmium</hi> ſtands thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy about the year 357. had gotten large footing in
the World, and<note n="*" place="margin">Epiphan. Her. 37.</note> they began now to diſdain the name of a Sect or
Hereſy, and to affect the name of Catholicks; and to this end would
congregate in Councils, not only to defend their own particular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
but alſo to condemn Hereſies.<note n="†" place="margin">Athan. Lib. de Syn.</note> And upon this account 'twas,
that they met at <hi>Sirmium</hi> in the foreſaid year, to condemn the Hereſy
of the <hi>Photinians,</hi> who following <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Samoſatenus,</hi> would have
Chriſt to have no being before the Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin.
This Hereſy therefore they condemn, and frame a Creed in oppoſition
to it, where are theſe words<note n="‖" place="margin">Socr. Lib. 2. Cap. 25.</note>, <hi>Thoſe that ſhall ſay, that the Son was
from a no being before, and from another ſubſtance, and not from God, or
that there was a time when he was not, thoſe the holy and the Catholick
Church, doth eſteem Aliens from her,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And this Creed, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
ſays, was drawn up by <hi>Marcus Arethuſius,</hi> who was a notorious
<hi>Arian.</hi> Now theſe words 'tis true were very pat againſt the <hi>Photini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and ſerved to excellent good purpoſe for the condemnation of this
Hereſy: But when they came to renew their quarrel againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
they found too late, that they had in a manner given up their
cauſe; for here, at one daſh, they had confounded all that <hi>Arius</hi> had
been contending with his Biſhop <hi>Alexander,</hi> about Chriſt's being <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
from a no being, and that there was a time when he was not;
which though it ſerved to ſilence <hi>Photinianiſm,</hi> yet it totally would ruin
the Cauſe of the <hi>Arians.</hi> Therefore they ſet themſelves to work anew
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45010:40"/>
to frame another Creed, that might be more <hi>Arian,</hi> which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
in Latin, in which every thing relating to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is
left out, and in which they declare, they are ignorant what our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is, and bring as a proof of this, that Text of <hi>Iſai. 53. Who ſhall
declare his generation?</hi> But then, upon ſecond thoughts, leaſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhould laugh at their Inconſtancy, they themſelves revoke this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Creed, and ſtrive to get in all the Copies of it, and procure an
Edict from the Emperour, which threatens all thoſe that ſhall detain
them. Now indeed we may ſee here a very fooliſh inconſtancy in
theſe Hereticks, and that they had a very ill hand at making Creeds,
to oblige all the World, under the pain of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> to believe
ſuch a thing at one time, and the next day to disbelieve it themſelves;
but this is nothing to the Orthodox Faith, which ſtood always firm
and unchangeable.</p>
               <p>After the Authour has been ſpitting his Venom againſt the union
of the three Perſons, he now begins to do the ſame againſt the union
of Chriſt's Divinity, with his humanity. For he would have, that
upon ſuppoſition there are three perſons in the ſame Individual nature,
that either the <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> or the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Doctrine was the true. For,
ſays he, there are but two ways imaginable in reaſon: either Chriſt
muſt be two Perſons, becauſe he has two ſuch different natures; or he
muſt have but one nature, becauſe he is but one Perſon. But for all
our Authours haſt, why can't we imagine a third way, that he ſhould
be two Natures, and but one Perſon? This is as eaſy to imagine, and
I am ſure as reaſonable too. For firſt, It does not follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has two Natures, he muſt be two Perſons, for Nature and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality,
are not reciprocal terms, for there may be two or three, or
more Natures, where there is but one Perſon. The <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed
moſt excellently expreſſes this, <hi>As the reaſonable Soul and fleſh is one
Man, ſo God and Man is one Chriſt.</hi> There is the ſenſitive nature in
Man as well as the rational, there is the rational Soul, one diſtinct
ſubſtance united to the Body, another diſtinct ſubſtance; and yet theſe
two ſo diſtinct Natures, are but one Perſon. Now what more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
does it imply, that there ſhould be a Perſonal Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Divinity and Humanity, than there does between Rationality
and Senſibility? If there be any more difficulty in one than the other,
it is this, That in the former, the union of the Divinity, with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
there is an union of two reaſonable Natures, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Perſons of themſelves as all rational Individuals are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt be as diſtinct Perſons after the union as before? But
why ſo? If they are united they are not diſtinct, for all union is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of diſtinction or diviſion. Two ſingle pieces, or pounds of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45010:40"/>
Gold are two diſtinct Subſtances or Bodies, but if theſe be united by mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down into one, they are ſtill two pounds, but yet they are but one
Individual Body. And ſo it is in the Union of all other Bodies. Well,
but what is this to the Union of Spirits, or rational Beings? Yet it
is ſomething; for if Spirits be united, they muſt follow the Laws of
Union as well as other Beings. If they be united, they muſt be one
in ſomething, for to be one in nothing is no Union at all. Now in the
Union of the Divinity with the humanity, wherein poſſibly can their
Oneneſs conſiſt, but only in their perſonality? Their Natures are moſt
certainly diſtinct, for Gods is one Nature, and Mans is another; and
therefore if they be one in any thing, it muſt be in their Perſonality.
Upon this Union they acquire an Oneneſs, which they had not before;
and as the two diſtinct pounds of Gold, upon their melting become
one Individual piece, which is the Oneneſs they gain; ſo the Divinity
and Humanity upon their Union, gain one Individual Perſonality,
which is the Oneneſs they acquire. Well, but here are two rational
Natures united, which muſt have two Reaſons and two Wills, and
therefore muſt be two Perſons. It does not therefore follow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there are two Reaſons and two Wills, there muſt therefore be
two Perſons, any more than it follows, that a Man is three living
Creatures, from the Union of the Vegetative, the Senſitive and the
Rational Soul in his nature. For as the Subordination of theſe Souls
one to another, make him but one <hi>Vivens,</hi> ſo the Subordination of
theſe rational Natures, one to the other, make them but one Perſon,
or rational <hi>Suppoſitum.</hi> The Divine Nature is indeed the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or governing Principle in the Union of the Godhead with the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as the rational Soul is in the Union with the two other Souls;
and therefore though there are two Reaſons, and two Wills, yet
thoſe of the Inferiour Nature are ſubordinate to the Superiour, and
therefore are determined by the operations of that.</p>
               <p>Nor, <hi>Secondly,</hi> is it neceſſary that if he be one Perſon, he
ſhould be but one Nature; becauſe Nature and Perſon are not reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
terms; and becauſe, as we have already ſhewn, that more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be united into one Perſon: for 'twas the Perſon of the
Godhead that took upon him the Humanity, ſo that he has no other
Perſonality than what he had from all eternity; but yet he has another
Nature than what he had from all eternity: becauſe he likewiſe took
upon him our Nature, which he had not from eternity, but took it
upon him at that time, when he was conceived in the Womb of the
Bleſſed Virgin. Though he ſtill continued one Perſon, yet he had
two Natures, the Nature of God, which he had from all eternity;
and the Nature of Man, which he aſſumed at that particular time; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45010:41"/>
this without any change, but only in the manner of his ſubſiſting
which was before in the pure Glory of the Son of God, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the habit of our Fleſh. All the Properties of each Nature, are
as diſtinguiſhable now, as before, the Properties of the Humanity are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable
to the Divinity, and thoſe of the Divinity to the Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
'Tis proper only to the Divinity to be the cauſe of all things, to be
immenſe, eternal, omnipreſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 'tis proper only to the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to have a beginning, to be circumſcribed in place, to be paſſible
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If, therefore, they have theſe diſtinct and incommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie,
they muſt have diſtinct Natures, from which theſe Properties
flow, though they be united into one Perſon. And thus I think I have
anſwered every thing that is material in this Chapter, and I could very
willingly have done with it, but only becauſe it may be expected I
ſhould ſay ſomething to thoſe invidious Remarks he makes upon ſome
of the firſt holy Councils, for the Determinations they made in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, and the condemnation of Hereticks. As to what he
ſays about the Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> 'tis not worth conſidering; but he
has a little too groſly repreſented the matter of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> which I
muſt not paſs over without a little Reflection. He would inſinuate,
that <hi>Eutyches</hi> was firſt condemned by a Provincial Council, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a General one, which is falſe. The Council indeed at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
—which condemned <hi>Eutyches,</hi> was but Provincial, convened
by <hi>Flavianus</hi> Biſhop of that place, but it did conſiſt of Orthodox
Members, and their Determinations were very free; wherein <hi>Eutyches</hi>
had a fair hearing, to anſwer every thing he would, that was objected
againſt him by <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dorylaeum,</hi> his Accuſer; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the meeting of this Council, did kindly endeavour to reclaim him;
but when nothing would do, he impeaches him in a<note n="*" place="margin">Liber. Brev. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. Niceph. <hi>lib.</hi> 24. Act. 1. Conc. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> Letter to <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
who cites him to the Council; but he reſolutely, at firſt, there
avows his Hereſie, That Chriſt had but one Nature after the Union;
and, at laſt when he began ſomething to abate of his Stiffneſs, he
would by no means recant his Opinion: therefore the Council, who,
after ſeveral Seſſions, could get nothing from him but ſhuffling, <hi>Nemine
contradicente,</hi> condemn him; to which Condemnation not only the
preſent Biſhops ſubſcribe, but 23 of the <hi>Archimandrian</hi> Clergy that
were there. But this ſo General a Council, as the Authour calls it,
which reſtored <hi>Eutyches,</hi> was that, which, for its goodneſ, has
been all along entituled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Thieviſh Council, or the
Synod of Robbers, that packt Conventicle at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which
was obtained by this means. <hi>Eutyches,</hi> vext at his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Council, flies to <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and of <hi>Eutyches</hi>'s Opinion, and perſuades him to eſpouſe his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45010:41"/>
Quarrel: He readily complies, and forthwith procures him an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in the Eunuch <hi>Chryſaphius,</hi> Preſident of the Palace, that was a
late Proſelyte to the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie, and was very angry with <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus,</hi>
for his procedure in the late Council at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> ſo he,
by his own, and the Intereſt of the Empreſs <hi>Eudocia,</hi> obtains of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that there might be a Council held at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> upon
pretence, to give <hi>Eutyches</hi> a fairer Tryal, but in reality to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on <hi>Flavianus,</hi> and to eſtabliſh <hi>Eutychianiſm. Dioſcorus</hi> gets to be
Preſident of this Council, and brings with him a great number of <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi>
Biſhops of his Opinion: and obtains an<note n="*" place="margin">Evag.</note> order from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
That none that were Judges of <hi>Eutyches</hi> before ſhould be ſo
now, in this Council; that though they were preſent, yet they ſhould
not vote as Judges, but only expect the Suffrages of the other Fathers;
becauſe this was to be a Judgment paſſed upon what they had judged
before. What followed after this practiſing may eaſily be imagined:
the Faith of <hi>Eutyches</hi> is approved, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Flavianus</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
But yet it was not eaſy neither to get the Subſcriptions of
the Biſhops to this, till they were frightened to it by the Arms and
Threats of the Souldiers:<note n="†" place="margin">Evag. Lib. 2. Cap. 4.</note> and after all, they ſet their names only
to blank Paper, to which the Abdication of thoſe Biſhops was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
affixed. For thus ſome of the Biſhops complain afterwards in
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Con. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>We ſubſcribed only to the pure paper, with
compulſion and violence, having ſuffered many ill treatments, we did unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and forced by power, ſet our hands. They kept us even till night
ſhut up in the Church, and being ſick they would not ſuffer us to reſt, nor
would grant us any refreſhments; but the Souldiers, with Swords and Staves,
ſtood over us, and made us ſubſcribe.</hi> The Authour indeed grants, that
<hi>Dioſcorus</hi> was accuſed in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> of ſome Uncanonical
Proceedings, and in truth they were Uncanonical with a Vengeance.
For beſides all this underhand dealing, and tumultuous proceeding in
the Synod, he was accuſed of no leſs than the Murder of <hi>Flavianus;</hi>
to whom he gave a<note n="*" place="margin">Evag. Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</note> kick in the Synod, upon which he died three
days after; that he had<note n="†" place="margin">Con. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.</note> contrived the Death of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and uſed
ſeveral other illegal proceedings againſt him, only becauſe he was the
Friend of <hi>Cyril</hi> his Predeceſſour; of no leſs than notorious Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
of keeping Company with one <hi>Panſophia,</hi> an infamous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and according to the information of <hi>Sophronius,</hi> of downright
Adultery; of<note n="‖" place="margin">Ib.</note> Blaſphemy againſt the Trinity; of being an <hi>Origeniſt;</hi>
of uſurping the Imperial Authority; and if all theſe Crimes can be
wiped off with ſo ſoft a word as Uncanonical Proceedings, I know
not what things in the World thoſe are, which Men call Lewdneſs
and Villaniny; unleſs Hereticks by a ſpecial Title, can claim an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45010:42"/>
from theſe names, where they are guilty of the Crimes. This
Council in which theſe things were made out againſt <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> the
Authour ſays was procured by <hi>Leo,</hi> becauſe his Letters were ſlighted
in the laſt, though <hi>Zonoras</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Zon. in Marcian.</note> tells us, that <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Anatolius</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> intreated this Council of the Emperour, <hi>leaſt the
blaſphemous Opinions of</hi> Eutyches <hi>ſhould be left uncondemned.</hi> This
Council the Authour does endeavour to render vain and tumultuous,
by crying out, This is the Faith of the Fathers, Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c. Leo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
ſo, <hi>Cyril</hi> believes ſo. Now I think it a very laudable occaſion
for Chriſtian Mens exultation, when their Faith is defended againſt
the poiſon of Hereticks; for to be ſtill and unconcerned upon ſuch an
occaſion, would ſhew they had little love or regard for the Faith they
profeſs. But the reaſon why they uſed <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi>'s name ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
was, becauſe of their excellent Explications of Faith, which
were publickly read in the Council, and univerſally approved; and
ſuch Defenders of Orthodoxy do in all Ages deſerve as great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
But the Authour would pretend the Council did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
their own meaning, when they propounded the Queſtion,
whether they would agree with <hi>Dioſcours,</hi> who ſaid Chriſt conſiſted
of two, or with <hi>Leo,</hi> who ſaid there were two Natures in Chriſt;
which Queſtion the Authour ſays is a Myſtery, and was deſigned only
to advance the dignity of the Roman See. But yet this is no very
great Myſtery to any one that conſiders <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
who held indeed but one nature in Chriſt, but yet in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Orthodox, would ſay Chriſt conſiſted of two natures.
They would allow Chriſt at firſt to be compounded [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] of two
natures, but then upon the Union or Compoſition, they ceaſed to be
two; but the Orthodox held, There were two diſtinct natures after U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which did both retain their diſtinct properties without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
So that there is a great deal of difference between ſaying, Chriſt
does conſiſt of two natures, and, There are two natures in Chriſt;
for the firſt does ſuppoſe them two only before Union, the latter two
before and after. But the reaſon why <hi>Leo</hi> is put in oppoſition to
<hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> is to confront that Heretick with a ſound Orthodox Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
and to do an Honour to <hi>Leo</hi> for taking ſuch pains, to defend
the true Faith, which <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> had uſed ſo much Artifice to deſtroy.
Well, but the Emperour <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> did not own this Council, but
ſent Circulatory Letters to burn its Decrees. This is very true, and
ſeveral other <hi>Eutychians,</hi> as well as <hi>Baſiliſcus,</hi> had as little kindneſs
for it. But what diſgrace is it to this Council to be Condemned by
an Heretick and an Uſurper, as <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> was both? For he had
drove his Maſter, the Emperour <hi>Zeno,</hi> from his Throne, and had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45010:42"/>
embraced <hi>Eutychianiſm,</hi> by the Inſtigation of his Wife <hi>Zenodia.</hi> But
the Authour need not lay any great ſtreſs upon <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi>'s Circulatory
Letters; for within a little time after (his Uſurpation continuing but
two years, after which <hi>Zeno</hi> was reſtored) he ſends other Circulatory
Letters to Countermand the former, and to condemn <hi>Eutyches</hi> and his
Followers; and whats moſt pleaſant is, he entitles them in the front
<hi>the</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Evag. Lib. 3. Cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>contrary Circulatory Letters of</hi> Baſiliſcus. Now this fickle tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Uſurper, the Heretical Clergy, that had ſubſcribed his firſt
Circulatory Letters, were much afraid of, which made them deſire
him to ſend no other contrary to them, <hi>for fear the World ſhould be
over-run by Sedition, the Council of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>having occaſioned infinte
blood-ſhed:</hi> which expreſſion the Authour would make advantage of
againſt the Council, though it comes to nothing at all. For what
can we ſuppoſe thoſe Men to ſay or do, which out of baſe compliance
to a wicked Emperour, had denied their Faith? To be ſure they
would do all they could to keep up his preſent reſolution; for if he
ſhould alter it, and encourage again the Orthodox, they knew very
well what a condition they would then be in, after ſo ſcandalous a
condeſcention. To hear theſe Men rail againſt the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
would ſignify as much, as to hear one of our Clergy, that had
read the Declaration in the late Reign, to exclaim againſt the Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Laws of the Nation, and the Spirit of Perſecution in the Church;
which no one to be ſure would believe any thing the more for their
ſaying ſo; becauſe every one muſt expect they would have ſomething
to ſay, to juſtify ſo infamous a compliance.</p>
               <p>As to what the Authour mentions farther about the diſpute of the
two Wills in Chriſt, this was in no ways owing to the Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity, but altogether to the Innovations of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
The Authour gives us ſome ſhort account of the riſe of this
Hereſy, but neither ſo fair nor ſo clear as he ought; for as for the
name <hi>Catholicus</hi> he mentions, I cannot imagine whom he ſhould mean,
unleſs <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the Patriarch of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who is the Perſon, I
ſuppoſe, he muſt aim, at, though I cannot find he was ever called by
that name; indeed he pretended to be a Catholick, and<note n="*" place="margin">Baron. Annal. <hi>An.</hi> 629.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> in
the Margin of his Annals, when he relates ſomething of this matter,
writes in large Letters, <hi>Athanaſius ſimulat ſe Catholicum,</hi> and perhaps
this might lead him into this Errour. But in ſhort, the riſe of<note n="†" place="margin">So called as ſome would have it <hi>(Niceph.)</hi> from <hi>Jacobus</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> a great <hi>Eutychian,</hi> or for that they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be converted by <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle. Before the <hi>Council of Chalcedom,</hi> they belonged to the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch;</hi> but afterwards they ſet up a diſtinct Patriarch of their own, ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally profeſſing the Doctrine of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> Their Name has remained long ſince in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, having changed their Opinions, as appears by the Confeſſion of the <hi>Jacobites.</hi>

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45010:43"/>
which was only a Spawn of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie, was this,
as <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> informs us. <hi>When the Emperour,</hi> that is <hi>Heraclius,
was at</hi> Hierapolis, Athanaſius (the Authour's <hi>Catholicus) Patriarch of
the</hi> Jacobites, <hi>a ſubtil Man and of a ſhrewd Wit, coming to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and talking of Religious Matters;</hi> Heraclius <hi>perceiving his Parts,
promiſes him he ſhould be Patriarch of</hi> Antioch, <hi>if he would ſubſcribe to
the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>That there were two Natures in Chriſt. He,
greedy of the Prey, pretends to ſubſcribe; but then, to beguile the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
he ſubtilly ſubjoins, But what think you of the Wills and Operation
in Chriſt? are there Two Wills, and Two kinds of Operations, or but One?
The Emperour, no underſtanding theſe Subtilties, ſends to</hi> Sergius <hi>Biſhop
of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>and</hi> Cyrus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Phaſelis; <hi>who, as they were of
a corrupt Judgment</hi> (that is <hi>Eutychians) anſwer, That he had but one
Will. In this manner the Emperour being entangled, he deſires to draw
others into his Opinion.</hi> This was the Riſe of <hi>Monothelitiſm,</hi> which is
no ways owing to the Doctrine of the Orthodox, it being only a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie; and was propagated only by thoſe
that were poiſoned with <hi>Eutyches</hi>'s Tenets. What the Opinions of
theſe Hereticks particularly were, is no great matter; or what was
determined for them in ſome little by-Synods of their own packing;
it is enough to know, that the Catholick Church condemned this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
as ſoon as it began to gain Footing in the World, by a General
Council, the Second of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

               <head type="sub">It is dangerous.</head>
               <p>AND when the Authour comes to ſhew this, he is for a home
charge at firſt onſet, and makes this danger we incur, by the
Orthodox Belief of our Saviour's Divinity, to be no leſs than that of
Blaſphemy. This is a hard Accuſation; but the beſt on't is, 'tis dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to prove; and the Author is ſo civil, as far as I can ſee, not to
attempt it. He has in this Paragraph a Quotation out of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
not much to the purpoſe, and a little talk about Precipices, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's
walking upon the top of high and narrow Walls, but not a
tittle of the Blaſphemy buſineſs; unleſs this be ſomething, when he
ſays, That this Doctrine makes us have <hi>ſo mean an opinion of our Lord's
Perſon as to think it comprehenſible.</hi> But, by the Authour's Favour,
who ever, of the Orthodox, ſaid, our Lord's Perſon was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45010:43"/>
or ever pretended to comprehend it? He was juſt now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
us for flying to the word Myſtery, as an impregnable Fort in
this Doctrine; and now he is angry becauſe he fanſies we don't think
it enough myſterious. This is a pleaſant way of arguing the Authour
has got, to talk thus backwards and forwards, and within a Page or
two; ſo that I am ſure if the Authour cannot believe, he can write
Myſteries. But why muſt every explication of the Poſſibility of the
exiſtence of a thing make it comprehenſible? Indeed every thing
that is explained, is ſo far comprehenſible as it is explained, and ſo
may any thing that is infinite be ſo far comprehenſible. I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the poſſibility of an infinite diviſion of Quantity, but yet I
cannot comprehend the <hi>modus</hi> of ſuch a Diviſion farther than the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
guide me, which I have a perfect notion of. I can comprehend
the neceſſity of God's being eternal, tho' 'tis impoſſible I ſhould have an
adequate Idea of his particular duration, or of that infinite time he
has already been, or is to be. That our Saviour is God, is all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
pretend to comprehend, but not the manner of his being
God. They endeavour to make this Truth as intelligible as they can,
which the Hereticks would make both falſe and unintelligible.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> Danger of this our Belief, he would have to be,
becauſe, he ſays, <hi>We have no firm ground to go upon. As for Scripture,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>the</hi> Arians <hi>capt Texts with the</hi> Orthodox; <hi>Antiquity they
claim'd with equal Confidence; and Councils determined ſometimes on one
ſide and ſometimes on the other, according as Emperours influenc'd them; ſo
that the only Advantage of the Catholicks, is, long Preſcription and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sentence.</hi> Now this is all bold Aſſertion without one word of Proof,
and I hope the Authour does not expect his Reader ſhould take his
word for it all. But what though they did cap Scripture? they
might do it juſt as the Authour does, nothing at all to the Purpoſe:
their confident Claim to Antiquity does not give them any juſt Title
to it: neither does our Authour's ſaying the Councils determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Influence of Emperours, any ways prove they did
ſo. When he can prove that the <hi>Arian</hi> Arguments from Scripture,
were as good as the Orthodox; That the <hi>Arian</hi> Belief was Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
That the Four firſt Councils were Conventicles pack'd of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Creatures; then he will ſay ſomewhat: but till then he had
better hold his Tongue, than to talk thus impiouſly againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith, and ſo irreverently againſt theſe Auguſt Aſſemblies, and
yet offer nothing at laſt but impudent Aſſertion. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of theſe Three things made out, or ſo much as pretended to be ſo;
but inſtead of making out theſe Charges, he falls a giving a Hiſtory
again, after his manner, of the Controverſie of the Orthodox with the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45010:44"/>
                  <hi>Arians,</hi> with a few of his Heretical Remarks upon it. He ſays, <hi>This
Controverſie was decided firſt by the great Council of</hi> Nice, and this eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body will allow, <hi>the Authority of which Council has ever been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
equal to Scripture, even by thoſe who in other things reneg its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
which by the way is more than moſt will allow. Well; but he
ſays the Authority of this Council is to be waved rather in this Point,
than in any thing elſe it did. But why ſo? One would have thought
that their Authority had been moſt ſignificant in this point, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
becauſe they were called together to ſettle it. Now certainly
this muſt be ſome very great Reaſon, which muſt invalidate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this Council, even in this Matter above all the reſt. And
truly the Authour has brought a notable one; one of his own I dare
ſay: for no Mortal Man, I believe, ever thought on't before. This
is a Reaſon which he draws from a Saying of an <hi>Arian</hi> Council that of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> which he ſays confirmed the Decrees of the Council, of <hi>Nice,</hi>
which Saying was this: <hi>We do not follow</hi> Arius, <hi>but receive him when
he cometh to us; for how can it be ſaid, that we that are Biſhops, follow</hi>
Arius, <hi>who is a Presbyter?</hi> I believe the Reader does not ſee the Reaſon
yet. But 'tis the Authour's Gloſs upon it, which makes it one. If this
have any ſenſ (ſays he) it muſt be of as good force at <hi>Nice,</hi> as at
<hi>Antioch;</hi> and thereby we may judge of the Sentence which firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Controverſie; not by the Merit of the Cauſe, but by the
Intereſt of the Parties.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe we ſhould ſay this Saying of the Biſhops in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
has no ſenſe at all, then I am afraid our Author's reaſon has none
at all neither. Nay, I will undertake to make out that there is no ſenſe
at all in this Saying, or one that is as good as none at all to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's
purpoſe. But to ſhew how this Caſe ſtands, and how fairly he
has repreſented the Matter, I will give a ſhort Account of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and of the occaſion of this Expreſſion. There was a Deſign, that
this Council ſhould be called in another place, in the Weſtern Parts,
but this the <hi>Euſebian</hi> Party<note n="*" place="margin">Athan. ad Solitar.</note> would not agree to, as not being willing
to have a Council where no Count ſhould be preſent, no Guards at
the Door, and where all things ſhould not be done according to the
Preſcript of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and therefore feign ſome fooliſh Excuſes that
they cannot come to it, by reaſon of the <hi>Perſian</hi> War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon
which occaſion <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> in this Epiſtle, wittily asks the Queſtion,
<hi>What have Biſhops to do with the War?</hi> Afterwards they get an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to meet at <hi>Antioch,</hi> A. Dom. 341. in which Synod there
were Biſhops, according to <hi>Sozomen</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Soz. Lib. 3. Cap. 5.</note>, who reckons almoſt ninety ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and only thirty ſix profeſs'd <hi>Arians.</hi> But then he does not reckon
the <hi>Euſebians,</hi> who were <hi>Arians</hi> in their Judgments, and would, by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45010:44"/>
their Practice upon all occaſions, declare it, though they would often
proteſt againſt the Name, as appears in many Inſtances, and moſt
particularly by their Actions in this Council. Beſides, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough that the Majority of this Council were of the ſame He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
ſtamp, by their chuſing <hi>Georgius</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in the place of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was a notorious <hi>Arian,</hi> and, as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>
ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Athan. Lib. de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note>, <hi>hardly a Chriſtian, but only for his advantage.</hi> This
Council reſolving to eſtabliſh <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> though they carefully avoid
the Name, as being too odious; they preface their Confeſſion of
Faith with this Sentence, which the Authour alledges. Now what
ſenſe is there generally in Mens Excuſes, when they are reſolved to do
an ill thing, and want ſomething to ſay for the doing of it? Here
the Synod is reſolved to make an <hi>Arian</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, but yet
they will not own 'tis <hi>Arian;</hi> though 'tis plain enough 'tis ſuch, by
the Tenour of it; which we may ſee at large in <hi>Socrates</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Socrat. Lib. 2. Cap. 7.</note> Upon
this account they can't ſay, They do not follow that Doctrine which
<hi>Arius</hi> profeſſes; but that they do not follow <hi>Arius,</hi> or the Doctrine
for <hi>Arius</hi>'s ſake, as being Men of a greater Character themſelves in
the Church than <hi>Arius,</hi> they being Biſhops, and he but a Presbyter:
which, at beſt, is but a ſimple Evaſion, to make their Heretical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
among unwary People, to go down the better. But what is
this idle Excuſe of an <hi>Arian</hi> Conventicle to the great Orthodox Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice?</hi> Though they were ſo vain, as to value their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the Intereſt of Parties, this does not found the <hi>Nicene</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
upon this Bottom; though the <hi>Arian</hi> Faith was eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pure telling of Noſes, yet the Orthodox might be grounded upon
Scripture and Antiquity: and till the Authour makes it otherways
appear, we ſhall preſume to take it for granted.</p>
               <p>2. The Progreſs of this Controverſie, the Authour ſays, was of the
piece; from <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s refuſing to reſtore <hi>Arius</hi> upon his Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo that the Controverſie was <hi>tranſplanted</hi> from Biſhop againſt
Presbyter, to Eccleſiaſtick againſt Secular Authority. But the main
of this Matter we have conſider'd in the laſt Chapter. But one thing
the Authour adds more than he ſaid before, which is, That <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s
pretences, in this Matter, were mere Evaſion; becauſe many,
who had ſubſcribed to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſeconded the Emperour
againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and condemned him in the Council of <hi>Tyre.</hi> Now
'tis very true, that many Biſhops ſubſcribed to <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
who had before ſubſcribed to the Decrees of <hi>Nice:</hi> but they
did not do this out of point of Juſtice, to ſecure the Emperour againſt
the pretended Contempt of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as the Authour would have it,
but chiefly to be revenged of ſuch an Adverſary. For every one
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45010:45"/>
knows with what Equivocations Subſcriptions were made by the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Determinations, as particularly in the Caſe of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
of <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> ſo that of all the <hi>Arians</hi> in the Council, there was
none but did ſubſcribe to the Confeſſion then made, and but Five<note n="*" place="margin">Soc. Lib. 1. Cap. 5.</note>
that did refuſe to ſubſcribe to the Condemnation of <hi>Arius.</hi> So that
their Subſcriptions to that Council did not make them the leſs
<hi>Arians,</hi> becauſe 'tis plain they were as zealous for <hi>Arianiſm</hi> afterwards
as before; this did not make them to act what they did to vindicate
the Emperour's Honour, but only to get a fair Riddance of ſuch an
excellent Defender of the Orthodox Doctrine as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was. And
to find here <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and the other of <hi>Nicomedia,
Theognis</hi> of <hi>Nice, Maris</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon, Patrophilus</hi> of <hi>Scythopolis,</hi> &amp;c.
will never make one think them ever the more equitable Judges to
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> for their ſubſcribing to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; when their
Practices, both afterwards and before, did ſo manifeſtly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it.</p>
               <p>Next the Authour proceeds to give a farther Account of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> all which I ſhall not trouble the Reader to
animadvert upon; only what he ſays concerning <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s flying to
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſerves a little Reflection. The Matter, in ſhort,
was this: When <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was frightned away the ſecond time from
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> by the Threats of the Emperour<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 14.</note> upon the feigued Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of obſtructing the coming of the emperour's Fleet; he flies to his
Friend<note n="‖" place="margin">Soz. lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Julius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as any one would to a Friend that
would receive him in diſtreſs, eſpecially being ſo kindly invited by
him. <hi>Julius</hi> then writes a ſecond Letter to the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi>
in favour of him, accuſes them, That they had in a clancular manner
innovated in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that, contrary to
the Laws of the Church, they had not called him to the Council,
there being an Eccleſiaſtical Canon that pronounces void thoſe things
which are done without the Conſent (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome.</hi> In this he reprehends them for the Calumnies they had caſt
upon <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> without good Proof. This is the Subſtance of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>'s
Letter in favour of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Paulus</hi> this ſecond time, which
the Hiſtorians give, and in this there is not a word of any Threatning,
which the Authour would have; though there was indeed in his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which the Authour confounds with this: where he cites ſome of
them, in the Name of the reſt, to give an Account of the Juſtice of
their Proceedings; and for the reſt, he threatens he ſhall not<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>abſtain
from them, unleſs they leave off their Innovation.</hi> But here is not one
word neither of his threatning Deprivation which he talks of. Now
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45010:45"/>
when <hi>Julius</hi> ſaw that this ſecond Letter prevailed no more with the
<hi>Greek</hi> Biſhops than the other he had ſent before, which they anſwered
only, as the Hiſtorian ſpeaks, by a Letter full of <hi>Ironies;</hi> he relates
the whole matter to the Emperour <hi>Conſtans,</hi> who writes to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Conſtantius,</hi> that he might ſend ſome Biſhops to <hi>Rome,</hi> to anſwer
for the Abdication of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Paulus.</hi> And to this end Three
are ſent,<note n="*" place="margin">Soz. lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Narciſſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Irenopolis, Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and
<hi>Marcus</hi> of <hi>Arethuſa.</hi> But theſe being found ſhuffling in giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Faith, and to have delivered in a Form of Belief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Nicene. Conſtans</hi> eaſily perceived that they had perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> not for any Fault, but only for the matter
of their Belief; and therefore ſends them back as they came. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Intreaties of <hi>Conſtans</hi> to his Brother, <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
and <hi>Paulus</hi> could not yet recover their Sees, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the Emperour <hi>Conſtans</hi> that a Council may be called, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
there is one called to meet at <hi>Sardica</hi> in <hi>Illyrium.</hi> The<note n="†" place="margin">Id. cap. 10.</note> We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Biſhops meet, as appointed, at <hi>Sardica</hi> but the <hi>Greeks</hi> meet at
<hi>Philopopolis</hi> in <hi>Thrace;</hi> and from thence write to the Weſtern Biſhops
that they drive the Excommunicates, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> from the
Council, or otherwiſe they will not come thither. But at laſt, to
<hi>Sardica</hi> they come, but then they reſolutely proteſt (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that
they will not enter into the Church, in which thoſe Perſons they had
excommunicated were. To this the Weſtern Biſhops anſwer, by
Letter, That they never avoided Communion with them, neither
would they do it; eſpecially ſince <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
inſpected their Cauſe, and had not condemned them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
That they came thither to juſtifie themſelves, and to anſwer
the Accuſations brought againſt them. So, at length, nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Epiſtolatory Diſpute; the Eaſtern Biſhops being chiefly
<hi>Arian,</hi> will not aſſociate with the Weſtern on theſe terms, and
therefore are reſolved to act ſeparately. Theſe Biſhops being, in all,
but Seventy ſix, according to <hi>Sozomen,</hi> put on a Conciliar Authority,
and the Firſt thing they do, is to excommunicate the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Hoſius, &amp;c.</hi> for communicating with the Abdicates They are
nevertheleſs invited to the Council, by a Letter wrote by<note n="‖" place="margin">Athan. Ep. ad Solitar.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoſius,</hi>
but they ſtill refuſe to come; therefore the Fathers, in the Council,
without them, proceed to the Examination of the Crimes objected
againſt <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> which having conſidered, they pronounce him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
and ſend their Letters into <hi>Egypt, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Libya,</hi>
that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and his Friends were wholly innocent, and that their
Accuſers were ill men, Sycophants, and any thing rather than Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

with one another as before; and from hence
<hi>the ſtate of the Church, as in all probability it would, was
diſturbed by Diſſentions, and lay under Calumnies.</hi> But
here did not from hence ariſe an immortal Schiſm in
the Church, as the Authour would pretend: for the
Orthodox held a good Correſpondence ſtill with their
Brethren in the Weſt, however averſe to their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
&amp; Communion the <hi>Arians</hi> might be; and we may
ſee, in many Councils after this, their mutual Friendſhip
and Agreement. But what though there did ariſe ſome
Troubles in the Church, upon this diſpute of our Saviour's Divinity?
are the Orthodox to blame that aſſerted it, or the Hereticks that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it? Certainly theſe Troubles are owing to thoſe only, whoſe Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous
Aſſertions denied ſo important a Truth, and not to thoſe
that defended it, though their Defence might accidentally occaſion
ſome Troubles to enſue. For the Perſon that does the Wrong is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for all the accidental Damages that follow upon it; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the honeſt Poſſeſſor may be blameable for the defending his own
goods to the damage of the unjuſt Aggreſſour. And in good truth,
Thieves may, with as good a Face, charge honeſt Men with the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
they may accidentally raiſe, in defending themſelves or their
goods; as the Hereticks to charge the Orthodox with making Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in the Church, by defending their Faith which was thus Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
oppoſed.</p>
               <p>The Authour next gives two pretty reaſons why the <hi>Latin</hi> Biſhops
were more eaſily lead by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> than the <hi>Greeks</hi> were, (he
ſuppoſing their Zeal for the Orthodox Doctrine to be only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with that Biſhop) which are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of his City; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Smallneſs</hi> of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
I believe he brought in this Great and Small rather for a
Witticiſm than a Reaſon. But why ſhould they be lead by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his City? Men are wont to be jealous of every over-grown
Power, and are ſooner apt to oppoſe than aſſiſt it. But why ſhould
not the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by the ſame rule, have as many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at his command? And why ſhould not poor <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> a mighty City too, draw as many of his Neighbours of
his ſide? But the Authour is afraid that this Argument from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45010:46"/>
Greatneſs of the City wo'n't do much, and therefore he don't much
inſiſt upon it; but that from the Smallneſs of the <hi>Latin</hi> Biſhops Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,
he thinks, is a good one; and this he endeavours to
back with ſome proof, <hi>viz</hi> with a Story of the <hi>Latin</hi> Biſhops not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
a captious Queſtion, which was put in the Council of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum.</hi>
Now, every one knows how eaſie it is for deſigning Knavery to
impoſe upon well-meaning Honeſty. A little Subtilty, with a great
deal of Diſhoneſty, will over-reach a great number of wiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Men. Several of theſe tricks all that have read this Hiſtory
know, were uſed in this very Council. The Queſtion was put, whether
they believed in <hi>Homo-ouſium</hi> or in Chriſt? If the Orthodox had ſaid
they believed in <hi>Homo-ouſium,</hi> the <hi>Arians</hi> would have ſcoffed at them
for believing only in a word. And when they ſaid they believed in
Chriſt, and not in <hi>Homo-ouſium,</hi> they pretended they had given up
their cauſe by diſcharging the <hi>Homo-ouſium.</hi> Now 'tis but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to find in many great Aſſemblies, that the Eſpouſers of the true
ſide are cheated out of their Voices by the fraudulent putting of the
Queſtion, and that poſſibly might be the caſe here. But beſides, there
was another reaſon for their then refuſing the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe
the Hereticks had gotten a ſenſe of the word which favoured their
Hereſy; ſo that the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Soc. lib. 1. cap. 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> Soz. lib. 2. cap. 11.</note> Fathers did not reject the word, but only their
ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>This long and miſchievous Controverſy (as he calls it) he ſays was
at laſt ſetled by <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which according to his compute in his laſt
Paragraph, was (as he expreſſes it) after a hundred and fifty years
ſtrugling. But I am afraid he is a little out of his Chronology again,
for he is miſtaken but the odd hundred years, or thereabouts. For
ſet the conteſt of <hi>Arius</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> the higheſt in the year 315,
from that time to this Edict of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> in the year 379, are but
64 years, which are much ſhort of his 150. But to paſs over this,
what though this Controverſy was ſetled by <hi>Theodoſius?</hi> Oh! the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
has an abundance to ſay to that in his reflections at laſt upon his
whole relation. That this <hi>Doctrine now eſtabliſhed (i. e.</hi> the Doctrine
of our Saviour's Divinity) <hi>was advanced by groſs partiality of the moſt
guilty kind, and at laſt impoſed by a Novice Emperour, upon implicit Faith,
in two Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo on with a long ranting period of ſome twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lines. But to conſider this a little. A Novice in Chriſtianity, it
is true, this Emperour was, becauſe he received Baptiſm that year, or
the year before he publiſhed this Edict, and yet the Edict might be
never the worſe for all that; but to be ſure he ſufficiently underſtood
the Chriſtian Religion before he was admitted to Baptiſm; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
perſons that come into the Church at thoſe riper years, do take
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45010:47"/>
better care to inform themſelves before Baptiſm, than others do after
it. But why muſt this be an implicit Faith in two Biſhops? He draws
his Conſequence from what<note n="*" place="margin">Soz. Lib. 7. Cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Sezomen</hi> ſays, when he gives an account
of this Edict, that the Emperour wills, that <hi>all his ſubjects ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that Religion, which</hi> Peter, <hi>the Prince of the Apoſtles, had from the
beginning deliver'd to the</hi> Romans, <hi>and which</hi> Damaſus <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome,
<hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>held.</hi> If here be an implicit Faith here
is one in three Biſhops, for <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle was as good a Biſhop as
the other two, and the ſame Faith is ſaid to be of all three. But
how can he draw from theſe words, that he had an implicit Faith in
the other? One certainly may uſe anothers Summary of Faith, having
found it conformable to God's word, without believing implicitly
as that other does; as well as I can uſe another Mans Form of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without praying implicitly with him. Now the reaſon why
theſe two names are uſed by the Emperour is, becauſe theſe Biſhops
were eminent Profeſſours of the Orthodox Faith, amidſt the many
Heretical Doctrines then in the World, and were particular Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it againſt <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> If any Man ſhould ſay, he is for believing
as the Ancient Fathers believed, for continuing in that Faith, in which
the <hi>Athanaſius's Cyrils, Chryſoſtoms, Nazianzens</hi> did; that Faith
which is ſtill embraced and defended by the great and learned Men of
our Church, and not for believing as the little heedleſs Authour of the
<hi>Naked Goſpel</hi> does. This would not be to believe implicitly on theſe
great Men right or wrong, but only to ſhew 'tis more probable,
that their Faith is better grounded, than that of every little trifling
Heretick.</p>
               <p>'Tis not worth while to examine all the Declamatory ſtuff he has
brought towards the end of this Chapter, for 'tis a ſure ſign that Men
want reaſon when they begin to declaim in ſuch ſubjects; but in truth
the Authour has no very good hand at this neither; for his ſtrokes
will raiſe no Mens Paſſions, unleſs their Anger, to ſee their Religion
abuſed by ſuch impudent, and withal witleſs ſcurrility. And indeed
'tis enough to raiſe a Chriſtians Zeal to an unuſual Temper, to hear
him at the end of his falſe and patch'd relation of this Controverſy, to
plume himſelf and vaunt, as if he had ſtruck the Orthodox Cauſe for
ever dead. <hi>Behold now the ground</hi> (ſays he) <hi>on which one of our fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles of Faith is built. Behold the juſtice of that Plea, which
from ſuch a poſſeſſion would preſcribe to our belief.</hi> This, and what after
he ſays, that <hi>the</hi> Athanaſian <hi>are to be numbred with the Roman Doctrines,</hi>
is but common-place talk, and what may be ſaid upon any thing a Man
has a mind to vilify, though it be never ſo ſacred.</p>
               <p>The Authour, in the cloſe of this Chapter, has hooked in ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45010:47"/>
Arguments to make us have a favourable Opinion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and
their Tenets, though 'tis nothing at all, as far as I can ſee, to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in this Chapter. The firſt is a very good one. If <hi>Alexander</hi>
himſelf, the head of the Party, could tolerate the <hi>Arians,</hi> we can ill
pretend to Charity, if we allow them no title to God's Favour, or the
Churches Communion. What <hi>Alexander</hi>'s thoughts were of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
as to God's favour, I believe our Authour can't tell, nor any one
elſe at this diſtance, and therefore he can be no rule to us as to this
matter. That he did Excommunicate ſome of theſe Hereticks, <hi>Arius</hi>
himſelf, and ſome others mentioned by the Hiſtorians, are ſufficient
Inſtances; that he did not more was owing to their numbers, and
not to his Opinion of their not deſerving it. But as to his ſaying,
we allow them no title to God's Favour; I ſuppoſe few will preſcribe
rules to that, any further than they find them preſcribed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
God Almighty may ſave, for ought as we know, thouſands of
Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, but he has not in any ways let us know ſo
much in his holy word: we find but one Faith there that we can be
ſaved by, but one Church to communicate in, and to both which the
promiſes of the Goſpel are made; whatſoever God may do more is
unknown to us, 'tis poſſible that he may do it, but he has no where
declared he will. If he does afford Salvation to ſuch Perſons, 'tis
not by the ordinary Methods of the Goſpel, and what his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Methods are, God himſelf only knows. The ordinary way he
has marked out to us there, is the rule for us to judge by, and thoſe
that do not walk by this, we may with Charity ſay, they are out of
the common way of Salvation.</p>
               <p>The next excuſe the Authour makes for them is, becauſe they may not
ſee the ill conſequences of their Doctrines, for he ſays, <hi>if this make
them Hereticks it is only in Logick.</hi> As for the <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine, that
was not Hereſy by conſequence, but a downright denial of our Lord's
Divinity, and that was plain enough by <hi>Arius</hi>'s diſputes at firſt, though
his Followers afterwards began to mince the matter, and to ſpin
their Hereſy a little ſiner when it became too odious to the vulgar,
after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Determinations. But however, Hereſy by deduction
is ſtill Hereſy, as the Concluſion is vertually contained in the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the Corollaries in a Propoſition. The Heretical Conſequence
is not leſs Hereſy, becauſe it is a little further removed than ordinary;
for whatſoever is true after a thouſand deductions, is true ſtill, and
'tis the ſame in all manner of falſities. Nay there is a guilt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from this reductive Hereſy as well as from the other; though
ſuch Heretical Perſon may not obſerve himſelf theſe Heretical, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked conſequences. For as in matter of practice, if a Man
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45010:48"/>
does a thing unlawful, though he may not apprehend all the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
that may attend ſuch an Action, he is anſwerable for theſe
conſequences when they come to paſs; becauſe he has entred upon an
ill Action at firſt, and therefore muſt bear himſelf off afterwards as
well as he can: thus it is in Hereſy, though the Heretick denies a
Truth in God's Word, the denial of which, at firſt ſight, does not
ſeem to have ſo much of Impiety; yet for this firſt fault, he is charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the other impious Conſequences, which are drawn from it.
Thus when the <hi>Arians</hi> ſaid, there was a time when Chriſt was not,
though they did not expreſly deny his Divinity, yet they are guilty of
this too: though they pretend to abhor Idolatry, yet they are guilty
of this, if they believe Chriſt to be a Created Being, and yet do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him.</p>
               <p>A third excuſe for the <hi>Arians</hi> is upon account of their expounding
Scripture, becauſe, he ſays, they reconcile places, ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
by the faireſt Methods; and ſo becauſe 'tis not the Cuſtom of
Writers ever to diminiſh, but generally to advance the Character of
the Perſon they write of; therefore 'tis reaſonable, that thoſe places
which make Chriſt equal to the Father, ſhould ſtoop to thoſe that make
him inferiour. This would be very true, if the Perſons here ſpoke
of had but one nature. If a Poet or Oratour, ſhould call <hi>Achilles,</hi> or
<hi>Alexander,</hi> a God, and in other places a Man, 'twould be but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the Reader to take the latter compellation to be the trueſt,
and the other title of God to be only an Hyperbolical expreſſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe perſons, according to their Characters, could not be Gods
and Men too, becauſe they had only one humane nature, but were
only ſtiled Gods from ſome great and godlike qualities, which were
inherent in them. But our Saviour having two Natures, the Divine
and the Humane, united into one Perſon, both compellations, in a
Grammatical ſenſe, might agree to him, without any Figure or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole.
But beſides, our Saviour does not claim the name of the
Son of God, as a great magnificent Title, to aggrandize his Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as Princes uſe to emblazon their dignity by great ſwelling Characters;
he came with another deſign into the World, than to make a fine gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſhew here; he came to preach up Meekneſs and Humility, and
was the moſt perfect Inſtance of them that ever was in the World.
Therefore if Chriſt was not God really and eſſentially, and ſhould
withal take upon him this Title of God, which is the greateſt of all
Titles, on purpoſe only to raiſe him an eſteem in the World, as all
Hyperbolical Titles are aſſumed for; he would be then far from main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his Character of being a Perſon of the greateſt Humility; as
he moſt certainly is, if being by Nature really God, he has conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45010:48"/>
to take upon him our Fleſh. So that here is no need of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to a Figure to interpret theſe places, we may underſtand them
eaſily enough in their bare Grammatical ſenſe; for there is a thouſand
times more to be ſaid for this, than for any of the <hi>Socinians</hi> Figurative
Conſtructions. And ſo I think I have ſpoke to every thing material
in this Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Word or Matter which is the Object of Faith.</head>
               <p>THE Authour begins this Chapter with a Diſcourſe about Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Belief, and by the way caſts an odd ſort of cenſure
upon the Excellent Treatiſe of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on that ſubject; which
he ſays, <hi>is like an Advertiſement in a Gazette, which however cannot ſecure
one from miſtake, if he meets the Man deſcribed.</hi> I am ſure that is an
Excellent Treatiſe, whatever the Authour thinks of it, and I am ſure
too, that admirable Man, has handled this ſubject a thouſand times
more learnedly and honeſtly, than the Authour has done it in this
Chapter. 'Tis certain, that the Authour's Hereſy will not ſtand with
the Doctor's Enumeration of Fundamentals, and that's the reaſon, in
all probability, that he ſpeaks ſo ſlightingly of it; and moreover, to
ſay, <hi>the Doctor's Enumeration every one will not receive for adequate,</hi>
for I believe he is one of that number: but certainly it is no defect in
that Diſcourſe, that it cannot ſecure every one from miſtake that will
blind his own Eyes; for the Fundamental Doctrines of Religion are
plainly enough deſcribed there, but if the Authour wo'n't ſee them, the
Doctor can't find him Eyes and deſcription too. But let us ſee how
the Authour has mended the matter in his handling the point. But
inſtead of giving us an enumeration of the particulars, he has given
us only ſome marks and qualifications of things to be believed,
which too, if he had done it fairly enough, would have been pretty
well.</p>
               <p>1. And now the firſt qualification he makes for matters of Faith, is,
<hi>That they be eaſily underſtood by the meaneſt capacity.</hi> I hope the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
does not mean, that Men muſt underſtand every thing as far
as they believe them, and to believe nothing but what they have a
perfect knowledge of; for this would be to exclude all Faith out of
the World, and to make Men Scepticks in every thing, but of which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45010:49"/>
they had demonſtrative Science. If he means that there are no Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Truths to be believed, but what the meaneſt capacity can
adequately comprehend the expreſs <hi>modus</hi> of them, this, I am ſure,
is more than ever he will be able to make out, however he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. As for what he brings of <hi>the poor</hi> having <hi>the Goſpel preached
unto them,</hi> and that the <hi>light of the Goſpel cannot be hid, but to thoſe whoſe
eyes are blinded,</hi> and of <hi>the ſimplicity which is in Chriſt;</hi> theſe Texts the
Authour has foiſted in to no purpoſe, and contrary to their intent and
meaning; for they are ſpoke only to ſhew, that the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
did not conſiſt in Phariſaical Gloſſes, or deep Philoſophical ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties,
knowable only by a few learned Men; but in plain truths, which
any one of a mean capacity might perceive, as far as was requiſite for
his Salvation. And one of theſe I have ſhewn the Doctrine of the
holy Trinity to be, as to the belief of its exiſtence, in the Anſwer to
the Preface. But the Authour will have the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom.
10. 9. to judge it a great defect of Faith, if there were any difficulty
in it. For my part, I ſee nothing like ſuch a judgment in this place
of the Apoſtle, that it argues a defect of Faith to have the matter of
it difficult to believe. Nay the reaſoning of the Apoſtle there ſeems
to be grounded upon the contrary to this. <hi>If thou ſhalt believe in
thine heart that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
That is, if thou ſhalt believe ſuch a wonderful thing as Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
which is ſo ſtrange and difficult to be believed by all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Men, thou ſhalt be ſaved. But why ſhould difficulty make a defect
of Faith? it has been generally looked upon as a great increaſe and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Faith, when the matter has been hard to believe, as in <hi>Abraham,</hi>
who believed againſt hope, and whoſe Faith, for this very reaſon, the
Authour did extraordinarily celebrate a Chapter or two before, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he may have forgot himſelf now. The calling of the Gentiles
indeed, he allows to be ſomething of a Myſtery, and difficult to believe
under the Goſpel, but he is very poſitive, that <hi>in no other word of
Scripture we meet the leaſt intimation,</hi> that Faith hath any hard <hi>task for
the underſtanding to perform.</hi> But I thought there might have been
ſome difficulty in the belief of the Goſpel it ſelf; by reaſon of our
Saviour's calling his Religion a Yoke, wherein Mens Carnal Reaſons
were to be ſubjugated as well as their Affections, by his being ſet for
the fall of many; by reaſon that the Goſpel was a ſtumbling block to the
Jews, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which plainly ſhews, there
is at leaſt ſome intimation of a difficulty for Faith under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>2. His ſecond Qualification, is, <hi>That matter of Faith muſt be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
word of God.</hi> This rule of the Authour holds well enough, yea
ſo well, that I am afraid he will never ſtand by it, when it comes to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45010:49"/>
the Iſſue. For if the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or other Oppoſers of Chriſt's Divinity,
would once come to be determined by expreſs Texts of Scripture, that
controverſy would quickly be at an end. For there are ſo many expreſs
Texts againſt them, that we cannot deſire more; and theſe they will
own are expreſs, as to the word and letter, but then are forced to put
falſe and ſtrained Interpretations upon them, to make them look ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. For our Saviour is expreſly called God, Joh. 1. 1. <hi>The word
was God. Of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is God over
all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Thomas</hi> calls him <hi>my Lord and my God.</hi>
So Heb. 1. 8. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> So the Divine
Attributes are aſcribed to him. Omnipreſence <hi>Joh. 14. 23. Matth. 28.
20.</hi> and 18. 20. Omnipotence <hi>Phil. 3. 21. Rev.</hi> 1. 8. Immutability
<hi>Heb. 1. 11, &amp;</hi> 12. Omniſcience <hi>Joh. 21. 17. Joh. 11. 25. Rev.</hi> 11. 23.
So likewiſe the Holy Ghoſt is called expreſly God, Act. 5. 4. <hi>Why hath
Satan filled thy heart to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt,—thou haſt not lied unto
men, but unto God,</hi> v. 4. So are the Divine Attributes aſcribed unto him.
As Omnipreſence <hi>Pſal. 139. 7. 1 Cor. 3. 16. &amp;</hi> 6. 19. Eternity 1 <hi>Cor.
11. 10. Joh.</hi> 15. 26. Omniſcience 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Omnipotence <hi>Luk. 11. 20.
Luk. 1. 35. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 11. Theſe are not the tenth part of the places in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which may be alledged for the proof of the Trinity, beſides that
expreſs one to prove a Trinity in Unity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. though without
that, there is enough to eſtabliſh this Doctrine in the minds of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
Men. And to ſee what work the <hi>Socinians</hi> make to invalidate
theſe proofs, what jejune and fooliſh interpretations they paſs upon
them, ſo contrary oftentimes to the whole deſign and tenour of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours,
this would make any one think, that they had taken up a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox
to defend, and were reſolved to ſay any thing to maintain it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to be perfectly ſilent, Well! but what <hi>if the relation between
the written word and the rational conſequence, be ſo remote, that none but a
skilful Herald can drive its Pedigree?</hi> Why this is not the caſe of the
Doctrine of the Trinity, for all the Authour's haſt. For firſt, this is
plainly aſſerted in that famous place of St. <hi>John, 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 7. And the
Authority of this Text is good for all our Adverſaries appeal to
ſome Manuſcripts to the contrary; and we have<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Cypr. Cum notis Epiſc. <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to
vouch for it, who is older than any Manuſcripts they can pretend to.
But ſecondly, ſuppoſing this Text was wanting in Scripture, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity is plain enough for all that. We have expreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
there, that each of the three Perſons are God, by the places for
inſtance we juſt now alledged; and we are likewiſe aſſured, as well from
natural reaſon as from Scripture, that God is but one, <hi>Hear, O Iſrael,
thy God is but one God,</hi> Deut. 6. 9. Now any Man, without any great
skill in Heraldry, or Logick either, can from hence conclude, that
God is in ſome manner, he does not underſtand, three and yet one,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45010:50"/>
which is all the notion any one can have of the Trinity. Here is no ſuch
remote diſtance <hi>between the word and the conſequence,</hi> but any one of the
meaneſt Capacity may find out; for Men in their ordinary buſineſs
every day make concluſions at a wider diſtance from their premiſes
than this, or elſe I am ſure they are not fit to live or deal in the
World. As to what he inſtances in the conſequence, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
draw from Chriſt's bidding <hi>Peter</hi> ſeed his Lambs, the Papiſts,
when they think fit, may anſwer that for themſelves.</p>
               <p>3. The Third Qualification he gives for Matter of Faith, is, <hi>That
it be expreſly honoured in Scripture with the promiſe of Eternal Life.</hi>
Now 'tis a little arbitrary methinks in the Authour, to lay down
a Rule here as he does, and give no reaſon for it, eſpecially ſuch a
one as he might reaſonably expect would be conteſted: and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> one
ſhould make bold to deny it, he would, I believe, have a difficult
Task of it to prove, That every particular Article, of only the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
Creed, had the Promiſe of Eternal Life expreſly annexed to
it in Scripture He firſt tells us a wonderful thing, That every thing
in Scripture, though it be equally true, yet it is not equally Goſpel;
and for the Proof of this, he brings in the buſineſs of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cloak, which
he left behind him. But, I hope, the Doctrine of our Saviour's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
is of ſomething more Importance, to thoſe that believe it eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
than the Relation of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cloak. And if we ſhould ask any <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
in the World, whether, ſuppoſing it true, it was not of greater
Importance than this; I believe the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> himſelf would give
ſuch an Anſwer, as would make the Authour aſhamed of ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
and ſaucy Compariſon. And now one would think, that the
Man that would be ſo bold, as to make this Compariſon, would bring
ſomething to prove, That the Belief of Chriſt's Divinity had not Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life promiſed to it; or that all other Doctrines, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed, had. But, inſtead of this, he brings one Text
of Scripture which makes perfectly againſt the Doctrine he deſigns to
eſtabliſh; and that is <hi>Mark 16. 15. Go ye into all the World and preach the
Goſpel to every Creature. He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,
and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Now if the Doctrine of our
Saviour's Divinity be revealed in the Goſpel, as we have ſhewn it is,
and the Belief of the Goſpel have Eternal Life promiſed to it; then
the Belief of Chriſt's Divinity has a Title to this Promiſe, as well as
the Belief of the Reſurrection, or any other Chriſtian Doctrine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is revealed in the Goſpel as well as that. From this Rule,
thus firmly eſtabliſhed, he draws four Corollaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no need of an Interpreter of Scripture, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer
of Doubts in Matter of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scriptures cannot be denyed to be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45010:50"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We need not, ought not to be uncharitable to any,
who differ from us in other Doctrines, to the Belief whereof
the Promiſe is not appropriated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is no need of a Catalogue of Fundamentals.</p>
               <p>How well theſe Corollaries follow from his Propoſition, I ſhall not
now diſpute; though upon examination, I believe, the Conſequence
would not be ſo genuine, and there might be ſome occaſion for one of
the Authour's Heralds to derive it; but as for the Two firſt of them,
they make nothing at all againſt the Orthodox Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which the Authour knows well enough we do not ground upon
Infallibility and pure Tradition; but only he has a Mind to give us a
Caſt of his Heretical Malice, by blackening this Doctrine as much as
he could, and by making it look ſomething more of a <hi>Romaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
               <p>As to his Third Corollary. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That is grounded upon Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
That the Belief of Chriſt's Divinity has not the Promiſe
of Eternal Life annexed to it. Now I wonder with what Confidence
the Authour can go about to invalidate a Truth, which is ſo firmly
eſtabliſhed even upon his own Principles. How often in one Chapter
of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. is Eternal Life promiſed to Belief in the
Son? <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3.
16. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned,</hi> v. 18. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
on the Son hath eternal Life.</hi> By all which believing is meant a
believing in Chriſt's Divinity, and not a believing the Truth of his
Doctrine: for <hi>believing in</hi> is only attributable to God, as implying an
unlimited Truſt and Relyance in him; which it is Idolatry to afford
to any Creature.<note n="*" place="margin">Nunquam aliquis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolorum dicere au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret, Qui credit in me.

               <p>But beſides there are other Texts of Scripture, which do promiſe
Eternal Life, namely and expreſly to the Belief of Chriſt's Divinity.

Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. Now what can be meant
by knowing Jeſus Chriſt, but knowing or believing his Divinity?
That he was Man they could not chuſe but know, that he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
his Miracles ſhew'd; ſo that they could know him no other way
truly, but only by knowing his Divinity. And this was the Purport of
our Saviour's Prayer juſt before, That God would glorifie him, that
is, would make his Divinity conſpicuous to the World, <hi>v.</hi> 1. which
he puts out of all doubt, by his explaining his meaning, <hi>v. 5. And now,
O Father, glorifie thou me with thy own ſelf, with the glory which I had
with thee before the World was.</hi> Now that Glory which he had before
the World, could be only the Glory of his Divinity; therefore the
Promiſe of Eternal Life was made, to the knowing or believing Chriſt's
Divinity. The ſame thing is as plainly expreſſed, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 20. And
hath given us an underſtanding, that we may know him that is true: and
we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. This is the true
God, even eternal life.</hi> Where he that is the true God is ſaid to be
Jeſus Chriſt, and the knowing him to be the true God <hi>(i. e.)</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to be ſuch, is promiſed to be rewarded with Eternal Life.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his ſaying we ought not to be uncharitable to thoſe,
that differ from us in Points which have not this Promiſe; this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the Truth of his Aſſertion, that thoſe Truths, he means,
have not ſuch a Promiſe in Scripture, which we have proved the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Saviour's Divinity to have. So that, upon our Authour's
own Principles, we may reaſon thus. If Eternal Life be promiſed to
thoſe, and to thoſe only, that believe Chriſt's Divinity, then thoſe
that do diſ-believe it have no Title to Eternal Life. But we have
proved that Chriſt has promiſed it to thoſe, and to thoſe only, that
believe his Divinity, therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Chriſt's promiſing Eternal
Life to thoſe that ſhould believe his Divinity, ſuppoſes the Promiſe is
to them only; for if it were to be given to others, it were no kind
of Invitation and Encouragement to them for to believe it; ſeeing
then they might attain it without it. If the Conſequence, which is
naturally drawn from this, be uncharitable, 'tis what reſults from the
Author's own Principles, which he himſelf has laid down; and then
he may thank himſelf for that.</p>
               <p>As to his Fourth Corollary, <hi>That then there is no need of a Catalogue of
Fundamentals;</hi> this is a ſtroke too of his uſual Confidence, by which
he taxes no leſs Men than the very Apoſtles themſelves, of a fooliſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
labour. For if there was no need of a Catalogue of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
why ſhould the Apoſtle exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> ſo earneſtly <hi>to hold
faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> which was undoubtedly in our Authour's
Phraſe, a Catalogue of Fundamentals, or ſome brief Summary of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45010:51"/>
Faith, probably that Creed which we have now under the Apoſtles Names?
Why ſhould the Apoſtles, or ſome other Apoſtolical Men ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to collect together the Chief Heads of our Chriſtian Faith, for the
Inſtruction of their new Converts, if it were nothing but a needleſs
Work? The Apoſtles hands were then too full of buſineſs, to do
any thing but what was abſolutely neceſſary; and the Holy Spirit,
which was to guide them into all Truth, would certainly keep them
from writing what was unneceſſary, as well as what was falſe; for
Impertinence, though it is not a Contradiction to, yet, is a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
of Truth as well as Falſhood. I ſhall not inſiſt here how he
reflects by this upon the Actions of ſo many Venerable Councils; for
'tis the uſage of this Gentleman's Tribe to be ſaucy with thoſe Sacred
Aſſemblies; but methinks he ſhould be more civil to his beloved
Friends, the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians.</hi> Will he allow, that <hi>Arius,</hi> and
<hi>Euzoius,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea, &amp;c.</hi> were only playing the Fools,
whilſt they were drawing up their Creeds? Will he own his celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Arian</hi> Councils of <hi>Antioch, Ariminum, Seleucia, &amp;c.</hi> to be only
at his <hi>Puſh-pin,</hi> whilſt they were contriving their Heterodox Forms
of Faith? And had the <hi>Socinian</hi> Brethren nothing to do, when they
wrote their Summaries of Religion, which are Catalogues of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals?
I am afraid this is ſomething more than, upon ſecond
Thoughts, he will readily grant. But for all our Authour's Poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
a Creed is no ſuch unneceſſary Work as he may think. What
though the Scripture be a compleat Rule of Faith, a Creed may not
be a needleſs one for all that. Though the Scripture contains every
thing neceſſary to Salvation, yet Comments upon Scripture, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and Catechiſms, I hope, are not wholly impertinent. All the
neceſſary Points of Faith, 'tis true, are found ſomewhere or other
diſperſed through the Bible, but 'tis too difficult for Children and
Novices, and many others, who have not ſo much leiſure to ſearch
them out there; therefore 'tis very neceſſary, for theſe, to have a
brief Summary of Faith to be drawn up out of them for their uſe;
which they may quickly read over, and eaſily remember. Beſides
Creeds are of great advantage in the Church, to ſhew us the Belief of
the Primitive Ages; which as they were nigher to the Apoſtolick
times, ſo they could know better the Apoſtolick Faith, than others,
that were at a remoter diſtance; and therefore by theſe we have a
better Knowledge of the Primitive Faith, than if we had the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Scripture only. Though the Scripture it ſelf is a good
and ſufficient Rule, yet theſe Ancient Creeds are uſeful Explanations
of it: though the Scripture be the great primary Rule of Faith, yet
the Creeds of the Ancient Church may be ſecondary ones, as being
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45010:52"/>
formed by the firſt, and more adapted to ſome particular Capacities,
and ſome peculiar Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The Authour next, I find, is afraid that he has not laid his firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
firm enough, upon which he has been building all theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries;
and therefore he is for buttereſſing it afterwards, as well as
he can. But inſtead of this he has unluckily made his Foundation
weaker than it was before; for whereas at firſt he allowed ſome
Truths to <hi>be honoured with the Promiſe of Eternal Life,</hi> here he will
allow but one in all the Bible to be ſo; and that is the Belief of
our Saviour's Reſurrection. And now having brought the Q.
of the <hi>10th.</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> v. 9. to prove this, <hi>If thou ſhalt believe
in thy heart that God hath raiſed [Jeſus] from the dead thou ſhalt be
ſaved;</hi> he very triumphantly asks the Queſtion, <hi>Do we in the whole
New Teſtament find any other Doctrine ſo honoured?</hi> Yes, we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Doctrine of our Saviour's Divinity to be ſo honoured; and I
wonder what the Authour thinks of the Doctrine of Repentance;
whether any Man can be ſaved without that, or whether Eternal Life
be not promiſed to it? Whether it is not promiſed to the Belief of
the true God? <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the onely true God,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. In ſhort, Eternal Life is promiſed, either expreſly or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
to every Article of the Chriſtian Belief, and to the Practice of
every Chriſtian Precept, but not to one ſingly without the other.
The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom. 8. 24. We are ſaved by hope:</hi> and yet undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
he requires the Exerciſes of other Vertues with it: and though
Salvation is promiſed to the Belief of Chriſt's Reſurrection, yet, to
be ſure, God expects our Aſſent likewiſe to all other Articles of the
Chriſtian Faith. Bare Hope will as well ſave a Man without Faith
and Charity, as a bare Belief of our Saviour's Reſurrection without a
Belief of his Divinity; for one is revealed in Scripture as well as the
other, and each of them have the ſame Promiſes of Eternal Life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to them. But ſuppoſe one of them lacked this Promiſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made to it, it were not leſs to be believed for all that; any more
than we do not think our ſelves at liberty to neglect the Practice of
Charity, becauſe we are not in Scripture ſaid to be ſaved by it, as we
are by Hope. The Reaſon why the Scripture, particularly the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of the Apoſtles, does often back the Belief of the Doctrine of
the Reſurrection with this Promiſe, is, becauſe this Point, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Chriſtian Religion, was the moſt difficult to go down
with the Heathens which the Apoſtles had to do withal; it was ſo
contrary to the received Principles of their<note n="*" place="margin">This was a Point ſo difficult to be believed, that <hi>Syneſius</hi> the Philoſopher could not be perſwaded of the Truth of it, not only till after he became a Chriſtian, but till he had for ſome time been Prieſt. <hi>Evag. lib. 1.

               <p>I cannot imagine why the Authour ſhould ſingle out this Heterodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy

                  <hi>Smaltzius</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> will have this
to be underſtood only in a figurative ſenſe, that nothing is meant
here but the Calling of the Gentiles; that by the Dead are meant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens
from the Faith; that by hearing the Voice of the Son is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Hearing the Goſpel preached: but how fooliſh this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is, may be known from the Diſtinction which is here made,
of thoſe that are to ariſe, into Good and Bad. For if here be meant
only ſuch a Reſurrection as he means, from Sin to Grace, then all were
Bad, becauſe they all were in a ſtate of Sin; and ſo there is no room for
the other Branch of the Diſtinction, <hi>thoſe that have done good,</hi> ſo that
this muſt be perfectly ſuperfluous. And ſo again, this is as plain
from <hi>Rom. 8. 11. He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
your Mortal Bodies by his Spirit which dwelleth in you:</hi> Where thoſe
Bodies which are to be quickned or revived, are the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
the mortal or dying Bodies, and therefore the Bodies to be quickned
or raiſed cannot be any other Bodies, than thoſe which did die. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
thoſe Bodies are ſaid to be quickned, in which the Holy Ghoſt
dwells; now they are theſe very Bodies which are <hi>the Temples of the
Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 16. cap. 6. 15. therefore they are theſe very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
which are to be quickned or raiſed again. To this may be added
the conſtant Conſent of the Catholick Church. The <hi>Latins</hi> underſtood
this by their <hi>Carnis reſurrectionem</hi> in their Creed, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> by the

ſhould that be more hard to be credited, than that
God could cloath it with a Body at firſt? For he
that gave it a Body at firſt, could with as great eaſe
give it another Body, when that was gone. Here is
no difficulty at all here: but this was the thing that
confounded their Faith,<note n="‖" place="margin">Durius creditur Reſurrectio carnis qudm una Divinitas. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. de reſ. Carnis Cap.</hi> 1.</note> how a Body ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

Secondly, As to the anſwering of the objections which the Authour
makes againſt the truth of this Doctrine, I ſhall conſider them ſingly
as they lie in his Book, which I ſhall do within a little compaſs; for
though his Chapter is long, his Arguments are but few, and what is
ſomewhat better, thoſe not over-ſtrong neither.</p>
               <p>His firſt Argument is grounded upon the words of the Apoſtle,
Thou <hi>Fool thou ſoweſt not that body which ſhall be, but God giveth it a body
as it hath pleaſed him. Doth not this</hi> (ſays the Authour) <hi>plainly deny
a Reſurrection of the ſame numerical Particles?</hi> As plain as this is, no
one can ſee it without a pair of <hi>Socinian</hi> Spectacles, and how clear
ſighted they may make a Man, I thank God I do not know. But let
us ſee a little, how plain this is. This place alledged is at beſt but a
ſimilitude the Apoſtle uſes, to explain the Reſurrection by, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt not be drawn further than the Apoſtle deſigned it ſhould;
we muſt not extend it beyond his purpoſe, which was only to inform
us of the quality of the bodies we are to ariſe with, and not to aſſert a
ſubſtantial diverſity. But to keep to the inſtance; the Body which is
here ſown is not the Body which ariſes in reſpect of the quality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but yet it is in reſpect of the ſubſtance; the ſubſtance is the
ſame ſtill, though it be changed by alteration of quality, or augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of quantity; it does not ariſe <hi>ſuch</hi> as it was ſown 'tis true, but
yet it does ariſe the <hi>ſame;</hi> it ariſes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, though
not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For Augmentation does not make a thing not the ſame,
it only increaſes the Bulk, but does not diverſify the <hi>Individuum;</hi> as
a Tree, which is grown to a fathom or two about, is the ſame Tree;
as when it was but an inch or two over. But however, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that this ſimile of the Seed ſhould hold univerſally, as to the
matter of the Reſurrection; for there is no need of that extraordinary
addition of quantity to our Bodies which are to ariſe, as there is to
the Grain to be changed into the Blade. 'Tis not neceſſary that our
Bodies ſhould be larger than they are now, that there ſhould be need
of growth to increaſe them, as there is to increaſe the Grain: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Bodies will be more the ſame, than the Bodies the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in are; for they need not ſo great an Addition of matter as
the Grain does and ſo may be the ſame as to quantity too.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument is, that there is no reaſon, that the ſame nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
Body ſhould ariſe upon that account, which many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
have given; that thoſe Bodies which were ſharers in the Sin,

Cor. 15. <hi>and from whence probably the Authour has his Argument.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe Matter (ſays he) has
no ſhare in either; it neither acts nor perceives, and therefore is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45010:54"/>
not liable to puniſhment. This indeed is an Argument which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Ancients uſe to prove a Reſurrection of the ſame Body,
which they do not lay ſuch ſtreſs upon, as if the whole Truth of this
Doctrine was built on this: they uſe it as a probable Argument, which
though by it ſelf is not of ſo great weight, yet when joined with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it may add ſome ſtrength to them. But to examine this a little.
It is true, matter in its own nature is not capable of being puniſhed,
becauſe it has no perception; but yet matter is capable of undergoing
the divine Malediction, God may ſet a mark of his diſpleaſure upon it,
or in the Scripture Language Curſe it, and that in inanimate beings
is analogous to puniſhment in ſenſible ones. And thus we find God
frequently Curſes inanimate things, for ſome relation they have or
had to guilty perſons; thus he is ſaid, Gen. 3. 17. <hi>to curſe the ground
for mans ſake.</hi> Thus the places where the wicked Inhabitants of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> dwelt, lie under ſuch a Malediction, <hi>ſuffering the
Vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jud. 7. Thus the Prophet tells the People
of <hi>Judah, becauſe of the Abomination they have committed, their land is
become a Curſe,</hi> Jer. 44. 22. Now though the Body, being conſidered
purely as matter, cannot undergo puniſhment, properly ſo called,
becauſe it cannot ſuffer pain; yet it may undergo the Divine Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as other inanimate Bodies do, and ſo be raiſed up to ſuffer this
in lieu of a proper puniſhment, for being ſo nighly related to a wicked
Soul. But however the Body is not to be eſteemed as only pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
Matter, and only an inſtrument of pain and pleaſure; for the
Body it ſelf is ſenſible by an internal principle of its own, and not
by the rational Soul, though that be the governing Principle; and is
therefore of its ſelf capable of ſuffering pain, and enjoying Corporeal
Pleaſure, without relation to the Soul. Now though the Body, in
this ſenſe, cannot be ſaid to deſerve puniſhment, becauſe it cannot
contract guilt, as wanting reaſon, yet as being an eſſential part in
the compoſition of a Man, it is reaſonable, that that ſhould partake of
all the rewards and puniſhments, which the Soul doth: and becauſe
it was the whole Man, the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> of Body and Soul that ſinned,
ſo likewiſe it is reaſonable, that the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> ſhould ſuffer.
And upon this account<note n="*" place="margin">Natura carnem non inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum praeſtat in operatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, ſed miniſterium. Ita &amp; miniſterium tenebitur judicio etſi de ſuo nihil ſapiat, quia portio eſt ejus quae ſapit, non ſupellex. <hi>Tert. de Reſ. Car.

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> would have the Body, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to undergo a judgment; becauſe it is not ſo much an inſtrument
of the Soul as a Servant; which though it does not act of it ſelf, is
yet a portion of that which does act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:45010:55"/>
His third Argument is, that though God might by his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
raiſe up the ſame numerical Bodies, yet it would argue a defect
in his Wiſdom, to exerciſe his Omnipotency when leſs means will
ſerve. I am ſure the Authour, by this Argument, does undervalue
the Divine Nature a thouſand times more than that opinion he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to overthrow by it. For he ſuppoſes things are difficult and
eaſy, in reſpect of God, which is a manifeſt abſurdity. For to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
and eaſy, for any thing to do, does ſuppoſe an imperfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſuppoſes a limited power. For a thing is then difficult to be
done by any perſon or thing, when the power that reſiſts is almoſt
equal to the power which acts; and a thing is eaſy to be done, when
the power which acts is much greater than the power which reſiſts;
but this always ſuppoſes a limited Power. But in an infinite Power
there is no proportion with any thing that is finite, and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be difficult or eaſy in reſpect of that. God does every thing
by his Omnipotent Power, he does one thing with as great eaſe as
another, becauſe the greateſt thing he does, is as far from ſetting his
Omnipotent Power as the ſmalleſt; his Power to act is infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any Power to reſiſt, and though one thing may ſeem more
difficult than another to us, becauſe we find their reſiſtibility to be ſo
much greater or leſs than our limited Power of acting, yet God's
Power is infinitely greater than the moſt difficult of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can do one as eaſily as the other. It ſeems to us indeed, that
have a finite narrow underſtanding, that can attend to and diſcern
only a few things that are juſt before us, very difficult, to find out ſo
many ſcatter'd Atoms, that lie it may be in ſo many Millions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places; becauſe we cannot diſcern different things lying in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places, and therefore all ſuch diſorder confounds our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but God, who is Omniſcient, and knows exactly all things
every where, nothing can lie diſorderly to him; he knows where every
ſuch Atom lies, as well as when it poſſeſſed its place in the Organized
Body; and can, with as great eaſe, make them return to their former
ſtation, as to make the new ſeparated Soul go back to the Body, that
lies yet entire. Nay 'tis not ſo great an act of God's Power to range
all this ſcattered matter together, as to create another Body for the
Soul to be united to; for 'tis poſſible, that all this matter might be
gathered together from never ſo many different places, by a finite
Power only; and 'tis not improbable to think God may do this by
the Miniſtry of his holy Angels: but 'tis God alone that can create
another Body, and therefore this would be rather (in our Authour's
phraſe) to make God unaccountably exerciſe his Omnipotency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would put God to the expence of a new Creation, to make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45010:55"/>
a Body to be united to the Soul, when the old one would do as
well.</p>
               <p>His fourth Argument is againſt thoſe that make it ſome advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the joys at the Reſurrection, that we ſhall be united to our
old Bodies, which will be like the joyful meeting and embracing of
old Friends; which he ſays will not be of old Friends but of old Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
becauſe of the War between the Fleſh and the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
and therefore the Soul cannot rejoice at her being united to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Body. 'Tis true indeed, that ſeveral Ancient and Modern Writers
have made uſe of this, as a Rhetorical Argument, to ſet forth, in ſome
part, the joy of that happy day; and truly I think not without ſome
reaſon. For we find the Soul has a great love to the Body, both by
reaſon of its being ſo loth to part with it, and becauſe it is found to
hanker after the Body, after its ſeparation; which is the account
which ſome give of <hi>Spectrums.</hi> But beſides, we find in Men a ſecret
love and eſteem for every thing that has any relation to themſelves;
they love their Relations, as being born of the ſame ſtock, they have
an eſteem for every thing belonging to their native Country; they
have an extraordinary kindneſs for their <hi>nutriculi Lares,</hi> the Houſe in
which they were born and bred: and this Love ſeems always greater,
after a conſiderable time of abſence from them. Now when a Mans
Body is the moſt nighly related to him, as being an eſſential part of
himſelf, he cannot but be more joyed to be united again to that which
is ſo near to him than to ſee his native Country, or the Houſe he
was born in after a long time of abſence from him. As for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between the Fleſh and the Spirit he mentions, that is only an
Enmity Metaphorically ſo called; becauſe all proper Enmity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two rational beings, which are endowed with free wills, which
the Soul and the Body are not; nay, that reluctancy of the ſenſual
nature to the dictates of the underſtanding, which is Metaphorically
expreſſed, by War or Enmity, between the Fleſh and Spirit, that is
very well appeaſed in the regenerate Man; ſo that he has no reaſon
to hate his Body for that, eſpecially now he has maſter'd it; for
theſe inward ſtrugglings of the Fleſh, have made his Vertue greater to
overcome them, and therefore he may reaſonably expect for this a
greater Reward in proportion to his Vertue.</p>

                  <head type="sub">What Changes or Additions latter Ages have made in
Matters of Faith?</head>
                  <p>OUR Authour has been hitherto giving us a Hodge-podge of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi>
and <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and ſome Hereſie of his own which wants
a Name; and this he calls giving us an account, <hi>What was the Goſpel
our Lord and his Apoſtles preached, as neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> which was
the firſt Enquiry. And now, when he enters upon his ſecond, <hi>What
Additions latter Ages have made in Matters of Faith,</hi> one would expect,
that, according to the Tenour of his Book, he ſhould give an account,
how the Doctrine of the Trinity came into the World; what <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Notions gave riſe to the Opinion of our Saviour's Divinity;
that <hi>Plato</hi>'s Doctrine of the <hi>Logos</hi> came from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical
Jews,</hi> and ſo from them to the Chriſtians; one would, I ſay,
have expected ſomething of this matter, which is uſed to fill up the
Books of the late <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> when they have a mind to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
the ever Bleſſed Trinity. But our Authour, I find, either
wants Courage, or Reading, or ſomething elſe to ſet upon this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and therefore contents himſelf only with a little nibbling
at this Doctrine; but turns the whole Current of his Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and their Innovations. Indeed his Charge of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
ſeems to lie againſt the Orthodox in general; but when he
comes to make good his Challenge, he ſhams us off with an Inſtance
or two againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Errours. But let us conſider what theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
are, he ſo boldly charges us with.</p>
                  <p>1. He ſays, <hi>We extend the Empire of Faith as far as poſſible;</hi> and
this he proves very ſtrenuouſly, by <hi>that vaſt Army of new Doctrines of
Faith, which the School-men have got,</hi> by <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome's <hi>ſetting
up for an Oracle to declare that Matter of Faith, which was before Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Curioſity; by implicit Faith in the Church,</hi> &amp;c. But what does all
this ſtuff ſignifie to us of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> or who elſe does
he mean by this <hi>We?</hi> If he means <hi>We Papiſts,</hi> and ſo reckons himſelf
one of that number, his Brethren will give him little thanks for thus
exclaiming againſt their Corruptions. If he means <hi>We Proteſtants,</hi> or
Church of <hi>England,</hi> here is not one Tittle of Proof of the Charge
againſt us; we abhorr all theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Corruptions, as much as the
Authour poſſibly can do. We extend Faith no farther than the Holy
Scripture does; what that tells us we ought to believe, that we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45010:56"/>
do believe; but do not take into our Belief anything, but what
the Scripture does expreſly aſſert, or but what may, by manifeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
be drawn from it. And when the Authour ſhall offer any
proof that we do, he ſhall not want an Anſwer. But I hope he does
not take this for proof, to lay down Propoſitions againſt the Orthodox
in general, and make his proof only againſt the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. His ſecond Charge of Innovation is, <hi>That we exalt Faith above
Holineſs, and againſt it too.</hi> But here he lets the <hi>Papiſts</hi> alone, and
turns his Pen chiefly againſt the maintainers of Juſtification by Faith
alone, and thoſe that hope to be juſtified by the Application of
Chriſt's Merits to themſelves: And is very angry with ſome modern
Authours, for uſing the Expreſſions, <hi>of application of Chriſt to our ſelves,
the Hand of Faith, imputed Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no intimation,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of any ſuch Doctrine as this in the
Scriptures, but it was invented by falſe Apoſtles.</hi> This is a bold Charge,
in good truth; and if the Authour's Arguments were as good as his
Confidence, he would make ſomething of it. But inſtead of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he gives us nothing but a ſimple Parable about a Phyſician and
his <hi>Noſtrum;</hi> which as it proves nothing, ſo 'tis not worth reciting.
As to Juſtification by Faith alone, I hope I have made that Point
good, in Anſwer to the ſecond Chapter, and there too we ſhewed how
the Doctrine of our relying on Chriſt's Merits, for our Juſtification,
was founded on Scripture. I know not how ſome Men may abuſe
this Doctrine, by talking ſo much of, and infuſing ſuch Notions of
Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs into their Diſciples, as to exclude all
good Works of their own, and to make them take little Care, what
Wickedneſs they do themſelves, if they have but Confidence enough
to think they ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. This is a
wretched Abuſe of a good and comfortable Doctrine; but after all, 'tis
by Faith, and not by Works we are juſtified: 'tis Chriſt's Infinite
Merits that God does accept as the true meritorious Cauſe of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and 'tis Faith only can apply theſe Merits to our ſelves; I
ſay apply theſe Merits to our ſelves: for theſe terms of applying and
taking hold of Chriſt's Merits are not only to be met with in <hi>Calvin</hi> and

                     <hi>She is the beſt conſtituted
Church in the World, becauſe in her departure from the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>ſhe departed not from Charity.</hi> But beſides, we extend our Charity as
far as we can with our Duty; we make the Terms of Salvation as
large as the Goſpel allows them; but we muſt not, with our Charity,
make other Terms of Salvation, than what our Saviour has done:
We may hope, and have a charitable Opinion that a Man does perform
theſe Conditions of Salvation; but we can never hope that a Man
can be ſaved without them. We hope that ſuch a one has repented,
and is therefore ſaved; but 'tis unreaſonable to hope he can be ſaved
without Repentance. Now Faith is as much neceſſary to Salvation as
Repentance; and therefore we cannot hope that any one can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
without ſuch a Faith as the Goſpel does require. What God may
do by diſpenſing with his own Laws is nothing to us; but 'tis his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His next charge of Innovations upon us, is, That we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Faith above Reaſon, and againſt it. But here is not a word of
the Proof of this. He tells us indeed that we muſt not believe God's
word any further than we have reaſon to believe it is God's word;
and that it is unreaſonable to believe a Myſtery; and that is all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45010:58"/>
he ſays to this Point. 1. Now, as to the Believing in God's word, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſay, but that our Belief is grounded upon better Reaſon than that
of the <hi>Anti-trinitarians</hi> is, for all their great pretence to it; and I
am ſure our Arguments, from Scripture, are a thouſand times more
rationally deduced than our Adverſaries are; and as to Antiquity,
they have not the leaſt pretence to that. Indeed we do not pretend to
underſtand all that our Reaſon tells us we ought to believe; and I
think it is more reaſonable to think we ſhould not underſtand God's
Nature, than that we ſhould. 2. As to our believing a Myſtery, that
is not leſs to be believed upon that account, if we are ſure it is
true; for we do not believe it becauſe it is a Myſtery, but becauſe it is
a Truth, Well, but he ſays, this word Myſtery has not the ſame ſenſe
in the Scripture, and other ancient Authours as we put upon it. As to
the uſe of this word among prophane Authours, they underſtand by it,
a Truth, which is known only to ſome few Men, and is not further to
be divulged. And ſo principally the Rites of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine</hi> were
called Myſteries, becauſe they were eſteemed to be of ſo great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs, as in no ways to be revealed. And therefore<note n="*" place="margin">Suid. in verb. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>But then, by Analogy, all other things that were kept ſecret
were called Myſteries. So <hi>Tully,</hi> ſpeaking of his Letters, ſays,
<note n="†" place="margin">Quae tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum habent Myſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ut nè Librariis quidem committa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Cic. Ep. At. l.</hi> 3.</note>
                     <hi>which have ſo much of Myſteries in them, that I ought not to truſt them
to my</hi> Amanuenſes. And in the holy Scripture there are other ſenſes
of the word than what the Authour mentions; for every thing that
is called a Myſtery there, is not a ſpiritual Truth wrapped up in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
nor yet only a Truth hidden from ſome Ages; which two ſenſes
only the Authour will allow. For ſometimes a thing altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible,
as the Trinity is, is called a Myſtery. 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16.
Without controverſie great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the
fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Where the incomprehenſible Truth of Chriſt's Incarnation is
called a great Myſtery. And therefore ſays an ancient Father admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

                     <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs; not that
it is unknown, but becauſe it is incomprehenſible; for it
exceeds all power both of Expreſſion and of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
This perhaps the Apoſtle calls a great Myſtery,
in alluſion to the Ceremonies of thoſe Deities, that
were called <hi>Great,</hi> far inconſiderable Myſteries in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of this. Thus <hi>Diana</hi> who was worſhipped
with theſe Myſterious Rites, is called <gap reason="foreign">

were ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">

Now, whereas theſe Myſteries and Deities were great only by their
not being diſcovered; this Myſtery of our Saviour, in a more peculiar
manner, is great, by its being incomprehenſible. Now the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> gives of a Myſtery, takes in all theſe notions
of the Word,<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>A Myſtery is that which is unknown and ſecret, and has
alſo a great deal wonderful in it, and a great deal incomprehenſible.</hi> But
the Authour ſays 'tis more than a hidden Myſtery, that is, in his
phraſe, a plain contradiction, that the ſame thing ſhould be hid and
open to the ſame Perſons; and who denies it, if he mean in the ſame
reſpect? But a thing may be hid in one reſpect, and open in another:
'Tis open and reveal'd to us, That our Saviour's Divinity is, <hi>de facto,</hi>
united to his Humanity; but the expreſs <hi>modus</hi> how this Union is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
is hid to us. That Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt are one
God, is revealed or open to us, but the manner of their Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Union is altogether hid. That theſe things are ſo, is plain and
open to us; but how they are ſo is altogether unintelligible. And
this I think is no Contradiction.</p>

                  <head>ENQUIRY. III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">What Damages or Advantages have enſued upon the Changes and
Additions which latter Ages have made in the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>THere need little be ſaid to this Chapter, becauſe I hope I have
made it, in ſome meaſure, appear, That the Doctrine of the
Trinity, and particularly of the Divinity of our Saviour, is no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
made to the Goſpel; but is that which was firſt delivered by
our Saviour and his Apoſtles: and therefore this Suppoſition of the
Authour's being falſe, whatever Concluſions he draws from it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado, will fall of themſelves. But becauſe he has before
reckoned the Doctrine of the Trinity among the Papal Corruptions,
or, as he ſpeaks, <hi>the</hi> Athanaſian <hi>among the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Doctrines;</hi> and,
by the Tenour of his whole Book, has been proving this Doctrine
an Innovation, though he do not particularly mention it here, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Innovations in general: I ſhall therefore follow him in his Method,
and ſhew, That this Doctrine has in no ways occaſioned thoſe Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Corruptions in the Church, which he would ſeem to lay to its
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45010:59"/>
charge; and which 'tis apparent thoſe Papal Doctrines he mentions
have.</p>
                  <p>He tells us there have enſued upon theſe Changes and Additions,
I. Damages. II. Advantages. The Damages which have enſued he
ſays are. 1. To our Lord's honour. 2. To private Chriſtians.
3. To the Chriſtian Church in general.</p>
                  <p>The Damages which he would have to proceed from theſe Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to our Lord's honour. Firſt, Becauſe they make him Capricious
and humourſome, by commanding things to be believed without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Secondly, Becauſe they hinder the progreſs of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now how far the Romiſh Corruptions deſerve this cenſure, I ſhall
not examine; but I am afraid the Authour will have a difficult task to
prove this upon the Orthodox Doctrine of the Trinity, or the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of our bleſſed Saviour. I have before ſhewn, how unreaſonable
it is to expect we ſhould be able to give an account of the true Reaſon
of all God's poſitive Laws, and how impudent it is for Men to refuſe
their Obedience to them, becauſe they do not underſtand thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
that inclined his Eternal Wiſdom to command them. It no
ways follows, that he is a humourſome or capricious Being, becauſe
we do not underſtand the Reaſon of his Commands; becauſe he may
have reaſons that lie far beyond the fathom of our finite underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
A wiſe Stateſman, or a Mathematician, is not therefore capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and humourſome, becauſe he does ſeveral things which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
Spectator can give no account of. And certainly God may
have commanded us ſeveral things for our belief, which we cannot
imagine how they ſhould any ways conduce to our good and happineſs,
ye he himſelf may know it, as his Providence does ſeveral things for
our benefit, by means to us ſeemingly contrary. But beſides we have
proved, that the Doctrine of our Saviour's Divinity is an admirable
motive to our Piety, and it were as eaſy to do the ſame, if it were
not too long here, as to the Divinity of the holy Spirit. So that it is
ſo far from Capriciouſneſs, that it ſhews the inexpreſſible Wiſdom of
the Deity, that every perſon of the Bleſſed Trinity ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
concerned in the Salvation of Mens Souls in our Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Sanctification, and each of them ſhould lay the ſtricteſt
obligation upon us to Piety. 2. Neither does the Doctrine of the
Trinity hinder the progreſs of the Goſpel, though the Romiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
may. The Idolatry of that Church is an Eternal Bar to Jews
and Mahometans, but the Doctrine of the Trinity is not ſuch. We
worſhip one God as well as they, and acknowledge only in that unity
of eſſence, a Trinity of Perſons, which was a truth the Ancient Jews
had ſomething of a notion of in their Doctrine of the <hi>Logos,</hi> or Word,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45010:59"/>
as appears from their Rabbins, and other Writers; nor can we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that the Mahometans ſhould ſo ſtand out againſt this Truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they had been prejudiced againſt it by their falſe Prophet, whoſe
Intereſt it was to have it denied. But when ever it ſhall pleaſe God
to call home the Jews, and to bring in the fullneſs of the Gentiles,
this Truth will be no obſtacle to it, this Divine Myſtery ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in, and adored, when all the Romiſh Hay and Stubble ſhall be
burnt up.</p>
                  <p>2. He makes the Damages which have proceeded from Innovations,
pernicious to private Chriſtians. Firſt, By hindring Godlineſs.
Secondly, Inward Joy and Tranquillity of Mind. Now we have
proved often enough, that the Orthodox Doctrine is ſo far from
hindering Piety, that it does extraordinarily improve it. If there
happen what the Authour mentions, too much eager diſputing about
it, then the fault is not in the Doctrine, but in the undue managing
of it; if Men have taken more care to contend for the Faith, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Luſts, and endeavoured more to confound Hereticks, than
to obey God's Commands; they are to anſwer for that themſelves, but
their faults are not to be charged upon this Doctrine. So ſecondly,
If the Joy and Tranquillity of the Church has been diſturbed by the
defending of this Doctrine, that is a thing purely accidental to it, it
does not make it leſs true, becauſe it has coſt the Orthodox ſo much
pains to vindicate its Truth againſt the Fraud and Violence of ſo many
Hereticks. Whatever damages good Men have ſuffered in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy,
that is, to be charged upon thoſe wicked Hereticks that
have denied this Doctrine, and not upon the Doctrine it ſelf, or the
Defenders of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He makes theſe Innovations prejudicial to the Church of
Chriſt in its general Capacity. But in the proof of this, he only tells
us ſome ſtories of the Slaughter of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and
the Cruelty of the Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> &amp;c. which have no relation at all
to the Doctrine of the Trinity. He cannot ſay, that the Orthodox,
in the Primitive Times, butchered the Hereticks, as the Papiſts have
done the Proteſtants, and therefore the Orthodox Doctrine has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to anſwer for upon this Account.</p>
                  <p>II. He then proceeds to ſhew the Advantages which have accrued
by the Changes which latter Ages have made in the Goſpel. But here
is nothing offered, as to the Doctrine of the Trinity, nor which can
any ways conclude againſt this, and therefore I ſhall ſpare my ſelf and
my Reader, the trouble of ſaying much to this Paragraph. He tells
us here a great deal of the Pope's Merchandiſe, and by the honour and
power which he has got, by pretending to be Chriſt's Vicar, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45010:60"/>
brings ſome ſayings from the Papiſts, that the Pope is as much better
than the Emperour, as the Sun than the Moon; that a Prieſt is as much
better than a King, as a Man than a Beaſt; that Catholick Kings are
Aſſes with Bells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſome other proofs of the Roman Clergies
aggrandizing themſelves by their Doctrines; which would have done
well enough in a Controverſy in the late Reign, but are ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
in a Book deſigned againſt the Trinity. But what though
the Popiſh Doctrines of Pardons and Indulgences, Merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have
for ſo many years kept up the Apoſtolick Chamber, though the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Purgatory has gained them ſo many ſtately Monaſteries, tho'
the pretended Supremacy and Infallibility of the Pope has raiſed his
Authority ſo high, though Tranſubſtantiation and the being able, as
they ſometimes blaſphemouſly call it, to make a God, has raiſed the
eſteem of their Prieſts among the People; yet the Doctrine of the
ever Bleſſed Trinity, never brought any advantage to the Clergy, and
therefore this can never be juſtly cenſured upon this Account, as a
humane Invention, and the product of Prieſtcraft, as thoſe others
juſtly are.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>AND here the Authours ſays, <hi>the end of all,</hi> what he has been ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I ſuppoſe he means, <hi>is to determine between Faith and Love,
to give unto Faith the things that are Faiths, and unto Love the things
that are Loves.</hi> But I wiſh he had made his words good throughout
his Book, for that had ſaved me all this trouble, and the World all the
miſchief that his Book has done. As to Love he has not ſaid much
to that, but as for Faith, he has given ſo little to that, that granting
his Principles, it would be hard to find ſuch a Chriſtian Vertue in the
World. For all that belongs to Faith he has given to Reaſon, and what
would not go down with his Reaſon, he is reſolved ſhall neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Faith nor Reaſon, but ſhall paſs for downright contradiction.
But now at laſt for a parting blow, to ſhew how little Faith is to be
eſteemed, eſpecially in reſpect of Love, he brings the Opinion of
our own Church, that in her Offices of Baptiſm and Viſitation of the
ſick, <hi>declareth, that our Faith is not to extend beyond the ſimpleſt of the
Creeds, and therefore if ſhe ſays any thing elſewhere, that ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
this, it is her Charity, in becoming a Papiſt to the Papiſt, that by all
means ſhe might gain ſome of the Papiſts.</hi> Of the admirable Charity
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45010:60"/>
of our Church, I am very well convinced of, but I never heard of
her Hypocriſy before, or at leaſt to have it commended too. And
truly if what our Authour would make us believe, be true, that ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds, only in complaiſance to the
Papiſts, when in reality ſhe disbelieves them, ſhe is guilty of the moſt
abominable Hypocriſy in the World. 'Tis true indeed, ſhe uſes the
Apoſtles Creed only in thoſe Offices he ſpeaks of, becauſe they are the
moſt ancient, and the ſhorteſt, and therefore the fitteſt for theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
but yet by the words of the Apoſtles ſhe underſtands the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of what is contained in the other, which ſhe looks upon as
Comments upon this. But however, to be ſure her uſe of it in thoſe
Offices, does not ſhew her to disbelieve the other Creeds any more,
than the uſe of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> or <hi>Nicene</hi> in the other Offices of the
Prayer-Book ſhews, that ſhe disbelieves the Apoſtles. One would
have thought, that her uſing all three, did ſhew her belief of all three,
for that I am ſure is the more natural conſequence, and not that her
uſing one in one place, does ſhew that ſhe does not believe the other
two ſhe uſes in other places. Well, but this may be in compliance
with the Papiſts that ſhe uſes them. But how does he prove that? Has
he any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that the Compilers of the Common-Prayer deſigned any
ſuch thing? Do the Rubricks, Canons, Articles, or any other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Authority of the Church ſay any thing like it? Till the Authour
could have found ſome ſuch grounds to have gone upon, he had better
have kept his fooliſh ſurmiſe to himſelf, and not ſo ſenſleſly have tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beſt Church in the World with ſuch a wicked compliance. But
what more ample ſatisfaction could our Church have given to the
World, of her believing theſe two Creeds, and the Injunction of the
ſame to all her Members, than by what ſhe has done? She recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
all the three Creeds in her Articles, and tells us,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl. Ang.</hi> Artic. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>they ought
throughly to be believed: for they may be proved by moſt certain warrants
from holy Scripture.</hi> In her Rubricks ſhe has ordered the <hi>Athanaſian</hi>
Creed to be uſed upon all the great Feſtivals of the year inſtead of
the Apoſtles, by which it is plain, ſhe looks upon it, at leaſt, an
Equivalent to it. And this is to be ſaid by the Miniſter, not as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Declaratory to the People, but as ſomething they do aſſent to,
and in his words do they openly profeſs; as appears by the Rubricks,
ordering the People to ſtand at this Creed, as at the Apoſtles, which
is a token of their aſſenting to, and of their making an open profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of what is then read. Now can we ſuppoſe, that the Church
ſhould exact ſo ſolemn a profeſſion of the Faith contained in this Creed,
upon theſe great days, if ſhe did not expect they ſhould believe what
they ſo ſolemnly profeſs? If the Authour can believe this, he ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45010:61"/>
never tax the Orthodox again with the Abſurdity of their Faith. The
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is ordered to be ſaid every Sunday and Holiday, and
in the Communion Service juſt before the receiving the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if a Sermon does not intervene, in the ſame manner the other
Creeds are recited. And can we ſuppoſe, that the Church ſhould
oblige her Members to make ſuch an Hypocritical Confeſſion, at a
time when ſhe ſuppoſes them to have the beſt thoughts, and the moſt
pious Reſolutions, and to ſeal this their Hypocriſy with no leſs than
immediate Perjury? If ſhe did do this, inſtead of being the beſt, ſhe
would be the moſt wicked Church in the World, this one Injunction
would ſerve to ſet againſt forty Romiſh corruptions; but in truth the
Romaniſts had never Forehead enough to object this againſt her, ſo
that it ſeems the Hereticks, upon occaſion, can outdo the Jeſuits in
this qualification; for this Authour, by this one Calumny againſt
the Church, has ſaid enough to ſilence all the lying Slanders of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
down from <hi>Sanders</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> to the little Scriblers in the late
Reign. As to his ſaying (ſpeaking of the Convocation laſt year) <hi>that
it will be a great diſappointment to his Majeſty, and his good People, if
ſuch an opportunity prove fruitleſs,</hi> I cannot ſo well underſtand what he
means; if he means fruitleſs towards the incouraging his Opinions, or
for the taking away of theſe Creeds; I believe it was more than his
Majeſty, or any of his good People ever thought of, or would have
been ſatisfied with, if it had been done; nor could any but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
be ſo ſimple to imagine, that when the State, ſo lately, by an
Act of Parliament, had excluded the Anti-Trinitarians, even from
the Benefit of Toleration, that they ſhould be let into the Church by
an Act of Convocation.</p>

REFLECTIONS
UPON THE
Naked Goſpel.
As it is laſt
Publiſhed and Owned,
By D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY.</head>
            <p>SInce theſe Papers were in the Licenſers hands, the Bookſeller
told me, it would be expected, I ſhould ſay ſomething to the
Book Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> has ſince Publiſhed, under his name, ſo much
altered from what it was before. I do not think this is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to do in point of juſtice to the Authour; for I have
not concerned my ſelf at all, who was the Authour of that Book: I
only took care to Anſwer the Falſe and Heretical Doctrines I found
there, which were like to do any miſchief in the World, which might
ſtill do harm enough, for all its Authour's retractation. It is his firſt
Book that requires an Anſwer, and not this laſt; for that is ſuch a
poor Toothleſs Adder, the poiſon of which is ſo much drained out,
that we may venture it any where without an Antidote: Indeed 'tis
eaſy ſtill to diſcern here the Tracts of the Hereſy in his former Book,
but now they appear ſo thin and diſcoloured, that the Reader, whoſe
guſt lies the <hi>Socinian</hi> way, will throw aſide this inſipid Heterodoxy,
for ſomething of the ſame kind that is more ſubſtantial. Here is ſtill,
for the moſt part, the old Heretical Body, with here and there an
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45010:62"/>
Orthodox Limb; ſo that his Book looks now like one of our old Saxon
Idols, half Man, and half Monſter. Now whatever of his Erroneous
Opinions he has altered, or retracted in this laſt Book, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my ſelf with them at all; and truly, I am glad he is come to own
them to be ſuch; I ſhall only make a tranſient Remark or two upon
thoſe places in this Edition, where inſtead of recanting, he has mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
his Heterodoxies.</p>
            <p>But by the way, it will be worth while a little to conſider the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
the Doctor makes for his firſt Book, in his Preface to this. He
ſays this was drawn up againſt the ſitting of the late Convocation, <hi>at
a time he had not patience to be ſilent in, to enlarge ſome of their minds
with a more comprehenſive Charity, with an intention to communicate what,
he had wrote to the members of that Convocation, and therefore he penned
it with leſs caution, than was neceſſary, for what was to be expoſed to every
vulgar Eye.</hi> Now is not this a pretty excuſe after ſo long hammering
out? The Doctor writes a <hi>Socinian</hi> Book, wherein he condemns the
belief of nineteen parts in twenty of all the Chriſtians in the World,
only <hi>to enlarge the minds of the Convocation with a more comprehenſive
Charity.</hi> This would have been a pretty piece of comprehenſive
Charity indeed, to have damned all the Members of the Catholick
Church for ſo many Ages, for worſhipping a Creature for God, out
of pure tenderneſs to <hi>Socinian</hi> Conſciences. Well, but he penned it
with leſs caution than if it had been to be expoſed to every vulgar
Eye. Now I ſhould have thought it had been requiſite to be more
exact in compoſing what was to be viewed by the more judicious; and
that it had been a little too preſuming to offer a parcel of uncorrected
ſtuff to ſo learned an Aſſembly. I am ſure 'tis but a courſe Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Authour's to thoſe learned Gentlemen, to write what was
to be read by them at that rate, as he would not care ſhould be view'd
<hi>by every vulgar Eye.</hi> But though we ſhould let this Excuſe paſs for
ſome of his uncouth Expreſſions, or little ſlips in his Quotations and
Chronologies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am afraid it will never bear him out for all the
premeditated Hereſy of his Book. Though he be ready to own, that
there are ſome ſcattering <hi>Sphalmata</hi> in that Treatiſe, yet I believe he
would be loth to have it thought one Total and Uniform <hi>Erratum.</hi> Are
all his Chapters about the <hi>Socinian</hi> Notions of Faith nothing but ſlips
in the penning? Are ſo many Arguments againſt our Saviour's eternal
Generation nothing elſe? Are all his ſcandalous Reflections upon the
Doctrine of the Trinity and the Aſſertors of it, his malicious Cenſures
upon ſo many good and holy Counſels only owing to the want of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
caution in the writing? If this be ſo, 'tis impoſſible to know any
Author's miſtakes from his general Deſign; for if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45010:62"/>
deſign to invalidate the Truth of Chriſt's Divinity, he deſigned
nothing at all; for there is not one Chapter in his whole Book, but
ſome how or other, tends that way. But he deſigned, he ſays, only
to communicate his Book to the Members of the Convocation; this is
a very fine excuſe indeed, to make that venerable Body, whoſe buſineſs
it was to detect and condemn all Hereſies, to become Patrons to his:
but however, this is but an uſual piece of <hi>Socinian</hi> Confidence, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
that of the Editor of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechiſm, who dared to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
ſo Heretical a piece to ſo Orthodox a Member of the Church, as
King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt. But, why this to the Convocation? Whom of his
ſtamp did he find there, that he could dare to communicate ſuch a
Book to? This is ſuch an infamous ſcandal to thoſe great Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
of our Church, that he can never atone for; to preſume that
ever they would ſteer their Actions by the direction of ſuch an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Treatiſe as that. What would a Foreigner upon reading this Plea
be apt to think of the Members of that Auguſt Aſſembly, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
ſhould deſign that Book for their uſe, which the Univerſity as ſoon
as detected, condemned to the Fire? But after all, What conſtat is there
that he deſigned this to be handed only to thoſe Members? Which
by the way can be no excuſe neither; for ſuch a private handing to all
the Members of ſuch a publick Body gathered from all the different
parts of the Nation, is as effectual a ſpreading of his Hereſy as any
publication whatſoever. But I ſay, What conſtat is there that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
only this? Why, truly none at all, but only his ſaying ſo; and
how far his word will go in this matter, I cannot tell. 'Tis plain, the
Copies of his Book were not eſſayed to be ſpread, till the <hi>Lent</hi> after
the Convocation was broke up. The Gentlemen in <hi>Oxford</hi> to whom
he delivered Copies were not all Members of that Body; and the 500
which<note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Litchfield</hi> in his Depoſition ſaid he printed, were more far than
the number of which the Convocation did conſiſt. Thoſe Copies
which were ſent to the <hi>Bookſeller,</hi> and afterwards upon the diſlike of the
Book recalled, were not I preſume all deſigned to be ſold to Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
Men. Nay, if the good Providence of God and the watchful
Care of ſome of our excellent Governours in the Univerſity had not
interpoſed, we might have had every yound Lad in the Univerſity to
have gotten one of theſe wicked Books into his Study. So that 'tis ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
evaſion, for the Author to ſay in the Title page of this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Book is now firſt publiſhed by him; for he publiſhed it,
as much as he could, before he put the Copies of it into the Publiſhers
hands, which was all he could do for his part; and that they were
ſtopped there, was owing to the Intervention of other Authority.
And ſo much for the Doctor's excuſes; to paſs by his ſaucy Treating
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45010:63"/>
of the late Convocation by the reproachful names of Uncharitable,
Stubborn, Stiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſuch <hi>Billingſgate</hi> ſtuff, as is like calling
Whore firſt; to faſten thoſe ill names upon them to avoid, if he can,
the deſerved one of Heretick upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>I now come to ſpeak a word or two to the Errors of this New Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And thoſe I think moſtly lie within his<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 7. of the New Edition.</note> Chapter of the Trinity,
which is the only New one in his Book; for all his others are but the
old Hereſy pared away, and ſomething better varniſhed over than
before. And indeed in this Chapter there is ſomething New, for
there is ſuch an explication of the Trinity, as no mortal ever heard
before. Here is a mixture of <hi>Platoniſm, Hobbiſm</hi> and <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> with
ſome other peculiar Notions of the Doctor's own, jumbled together.
<hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> Is this the Author that has been declaiming
ſo much againſt Myſteries, and the explaining of Myſteries, and has at
laſt ſtuffed us out a Chapter with ſo much myſtical Jargon? But after
all, this ſecond Notion of the Doctor's is no farther diſtant from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm,</hi>
than a Trinominal Deity is different from him that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
one, without ſuch nominal Diſtinction; or juſt ſo much as the
Doctrine of <hi>Sabellius</hi> differed from that of <hi>Samoſetanus</hi> or <hi>Photinus.</hi>
Now the firſt thing that the Doctor does to advance this Notion, is to
be angry with the terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Subſtance and Perſon.

there. There were indeed ſome Rules given for caution in uſing
them; becauſe they ſaid the <hi>word</hi>

               <hi>decreed that theſe words were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
becauſe they do explode the Opinion of</hi> Sabellius; <hi>that we may not
through want of words call God under three Names, but that every Name of
the Trinity ſhould ſignify God under a diſtinct or proper Perſon</hi>

               </gap>.
And what other uſe do we deſire to make of them than this?
Indeed we will allow the Doctor, that ſome of his celebrated Councils
in his other Book, to have done as much as he would have this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to have done, or more. His good Council of <hi>Sirmium</hi>

               <hi>Ariminum</hi> did
the like. Next, he is much diſpleaſed that the <hi>Latin</hi> Schools have
<hi>over-tranſlated</hi> the firſt of theſe terms <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by rendring it Subſtance,
which bears too great a Cognation with matter. But whatever Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45010:63"/>
ſignifies in its primitive acceptation is no matter at all here;
it is enough if we underſtand what is meant by it in its Philoſophical
or Divine Senſe. We know as well the preciſe ſignification of a
word uſed Metaphorically, when we know 'tis uſed ſo, as we do when
it is uſed properly; ſo that 'tis a ſilly exception againſt this word, to
ſay it is Metaphorical; for unleſs ſome words were to be uſed Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
ten times as many words as we have, would not ſerve us.
But if the <hi>Latins</hi> mean the ſame by <hi>Subſtance</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> do by
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Where is all the harm that is done then? Now the only way of
knowing the ſenſe of words is by their Definitions; and both the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>

               <hi>Suidas</hi> to the ſame

is no injury done by rendring <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> by <hi>Subſtantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So again, I can ſee no harm in tranſlating the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> by <hi>Perſona,</hi>
if the ſame thing be underſtood by both Words, as 'tis plain the later
Authors in both Languages do underſtand. Indeed the <hi>Latins</hi> at firſt,
did very much except againſt the word <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed it,
becauſe they generally tranſlated that word by <hi>Subſtantia,</hi> (who<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Greg. Naz. Orat. 21.</note> by
the ſcantineſs of their Language, could not diſtinguiſh <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> from
Eſſence or Subſtance) and not by <hi>Perſona</hi> or <hi>Subſtantia;</hi> and therefore
to aſſert three <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> was the ſame with them as to make three
Gods. Now this miſtake indeed about the ſenſe of the word, did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſome contention for a while, till the Council of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was
celebrated in the Year 372, and then they came to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and<note n="†" place="margin">Greg. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zian. Or. 39.</note> ever after, both <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed the word alike.
Indeed the <hi>Arians</hi> did always except againſt the word <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> as
<hi>Acacius</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Soc. Lib. 2. Cap. 41.</note> and his Faction in the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the

               <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia;</hi> but that I hope
will be no prejudice againſt it, for they excepted againſt the word
and the ſenſe of it too. So that we have no reaſon to quarrel with
theſe terms which ſerve ſo excellently to expreſs theſe Divine Truths
of this Holy Myſtery: we only ought to take care to underſtand and them
aright, which is eaſy enough to do by their ſo long and conſtant uſe in
the Church; and not to run off from theſe to any new whimſical Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:45010:64"/>
Next the Doctor ſets to work to his expoſition of the Trinity,
which becauſe he will not have it be myſterious, he is reſolved to have
it demonſtrable by the Light of Nature; for he ſays, <hi>the Light of
Nature doth demonſtrate what St.</hi> John <hi>affirmeth, There are Three Perſons
that bear witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. There are a great many in the world that the
Doctor would oblige with a little of this Demonſtration; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we may expect from him hereafter, ſince this wonderful Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I am ſure, what he has given us in this Chapter, is far enough
from it. He tells us, That the Three Perſons in the Trinity are
<hi>Mind, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>Logos</hi> is begotten or
conceived of the <hi>Mind, the Father,</hi> both which are imperfect, unleſs
perfected by <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> which is the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> Now, is
this the Explication <hi>that agrees to a Syllable, both to the Holy Scripture,
and the Church of</hi> England? is this <hi>the putting the old Materials into a
new and better Frame,</hi> which he ſo boaſts of? They are old Materials
indeed, as old as <hi>Sabellius</hi> and the other Hereticks of his ſtamp, but
neither older nor newer than their Hereſies. For, I pray, what
difference is there between <hi>Sabellius</hi>'s Explication of the Trinity and
the Doctor's? <hi>The</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;c. Epiph. Haer. 62.</note> Sabellians <hi>taught, That the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt
were the ſame; ſo that there were Three Names in One Perſon;
and as in a Man there is Body, Soul, and Spirit or Mind,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>So the Body is, as it were, the Father; the Soul, the Son;
and that which is the Spirit in Man, is the Holy-Ghoſt in the Deity.</hi> All
the Difference between theſe two Notions of the Trinity, is, That
<hi>Sabellius</hi>'s inclines a little more to the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and the Doctor's to
the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophy; but both of them are far enough from
Truth and Scripture. Nay, the Doctor's Explication is the more
<hi>Sabellian</hi> of the two, becauſe his Diſtinction of the Perſons is the more
nominal; for <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are more diſtinct than <hi>Mind,
Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Operation.</hi> So that by ſtriving to avoid <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> as he
pretends, he has out-done <hi>Sabellius</hi> himſelf in his own Hereſie. But, after
all, what can we make of our Author's Trinity, which any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi>
will not agree to! <hi>Mind, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Action</hi>—why, are not all theſe in
every Man, and every rational Being, as well as in God; and I hope he
will not make as many Trinities as there are intelligent Beings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Mind, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Energy</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> are but divers <hi>Modus</hi> of
the ſame thing. <hi>Mind,</hi> is the rational Principle, ſimply conſidered;
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> is the ſame Soul, conſidered Diſcurſive or Reaſoning; and
<hi>Action</hi> or <hi>Energy,</hi> is the Soul putting the determination of ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
into act: but ſtill theſe are but diſtinct <hi>Modus</hi>'s of the ſame
Soul. But what are theſe to Three diſtinct Perſons in one Eſſence?
There every Perſon is, by a proper perſonal difference, diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45010:64"/>
from each other, not by any particular modality, but by a true and
real ſubſiſtence. But when the Doctor makes the Son to be only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he can only make him an accident, or at beſt but a Modality of
the Father. For if he only be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to it, the internal Conception of the Father's Mind, he would
be only an Accident, or Attribute, or Mode, or what elſe you'll
pleaſe to call it, but would be far enough from that which the Church
has all along called a Perſon. And therefore the learned Fathers in
the Church have been always careful, to diſtinguiſh between this

which I confeſs I do not underſtand, and which perhaps St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf had no clear conceptions of when he wrote them; but
however there is enough in thoſe Books to ſhew, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> never
deſigned ſuch a nominal diſtinction in the Trinity, as this Authour
does. What Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſays on this matter, I have not time now
to conſult; though when I read his Book, I don't remember he gave
any Countenance to this Opinion; nay, on the contrary, ſome have
been diſpleaſed<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> with that Learned Doctor, for making too great a
diſtinction between the Perſons of the Trinity; not for making them
three Names, or <hi>Modus</hi>'s, as our Doctor does, but for making
them three diſtinct Minds or Spirits, which are one by mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But what though theſe great Men ſhould ſpeak more nicely than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
of theſe Myſteries, though they ſhould wade deeper into them
than other men, The great Genius's of theſe admirable Perſons, and
the ſtrength of their natural reaſon will help to bear them out; but
I would adviſe our Authour to a little more cautiouſneſs; he poor
Gentleman may be out of his depth before he is aware, and therefore
I am ſure 'tis his beſt way to keep within the ordinary Compaſs.</p>

HISTORY
OF
SOCINIANISM.</head>
            <p>THE Heretical Perſuaſion of our Bleſſed Saviour's being
only mere Man, and the conſequent Doctrines which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
thereupon, have, of late Years, been called <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi>
from the two <hi>Socinus</hi>'s, the moſt famous Inventors
and Propagators of this Doctrine, in the laſt Age: for though the
Hereſie it ſelf, as to ſome parts of it, was much older, yet it had been
altogether unknown for many Ages, till by the Books of <hi>Servet,</hi> the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>'s,
and ſome other Hereticks in the laſt Age, it was revived.</p>
            <p>The firſt that ſet up this damnable Doctrine, was the Heretick <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
who lived in the Apoſtlick times, and was Contemporary with St.
<hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt. He aſſerted,<note n="a" place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That Jeſus was mere Man as others were,
and that he did not excell the reſt in Juſtice, or Wiſdom, or Prudence.</hi> The
Confutation of this Hereſie<note n="b" place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. cap. 11. Hier. in Prol. Joh. Auguſ. Haer. 1. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyl. Prol. in Joh.</note> was a ſpecial motive to St. <hi>John</hi> to write
his Goſpel, or at leaſt to be more expreſs than the reſt of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,
in aſſerting our Lord's Divinity. <hi>Ebion,</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Epiph. Haer. 30. Euſeb. Eccl. Hiſt. lib. 4.</note>followed after his Maſter in this Hereſie, and propagated his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in <hi>Aſia, Cyprus, Rome,</hi> and elſewhere; he aſſerted, That

               </gap>]
<hi>only common and mere Man.</hi> This Hereſie, in the Second
Age, was propagated by one <hi>Theodotus Scytes,</hi> or the Currier, who
taught likewiſe, That Chriſt was [<gap reason="foreign">

               <note n="f" place="bottom">Euſeb. ib. Niceph. Hiſt. lib. 4. cap. 21.</note> for this Blaſphemy.
<hi>Artemon</hi> followed <hi>Theodotus,</hi> who ſaid,<note n="g" place="bottom">Theod. Haer. Fab. l. 2. c. 5.</note>

               </gap>] <hi>than the Prophets.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this <hi>Artemon</hi> there was a famous Book wrote, which<note n="h" place="margin">Hiſt. Eccl. lib. 5. cap. ult.</note> 
               <hi>Euſebius</hi>
mentions, in which it was proved, That the Ancient Chriſtians did
not believe his Doctrine as he pretended; and, in which the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Miltiades, Tatian, Clemens,</hi> are brought to
confute him. Sixty years after his Death,<note n="i" place="margin">Auguſt. Haer. 44.</note> in the Third Age, about
the Year 270, <hi>Paulus Samoſetanus</hi> diſſeminated this Doctrine; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
<note n="k" place="margin">Euſ. Hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 24. Theod. Ep. 104.</note>That <hi>Chriſt had only the common Nature of Man.</hi> He was
condemned in the Council at <hi>Antioch</hi> 272. Much about this time, or
ſomewhat before, <hi>Sabellius</hi> broached his Hereſie, not much unlike the
reſt of theſe; he held,<note n="l" place="margin">Baſ. Mag. Ep. 64.</note> That <hi>there was but One Perſon in the Deity,</hi>

ſays upon this account) deny Chriſt's Divinity. <hi>Arius</hi> who followed
after, and made ſuch a noiſe in the World with his Hereſie, whatever
his thoughts might be, yet he did not expreſsly aſſert Chriſt to be
mere Man; but only <hi>to be a Creature produced in time; yet one that had
a Being long before his conception in the Womb of the Virgin:</hi> and
therefore he cannot ſo properly come into the Liſt of theſe Hereticks.
But ſoon after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Determinations againſt <hi>Arius, Photinus,</hi> one
of the old <hi>Cerinthian</hi> Race, ſtarts up, who was Biſhop of <hi>Sirmium,</hi>
and aſſerts again, That Chriſt was mere man, and<note n="m" place="margin">Soz. lib. 4. cap. 5.</note>

&amp;c. the prevailing Hereſies of the ſucceeding Ages: And
indeed this Hereſie ſeemed to be quite loſt, till <hi>Petrus Abelardus,</hi> in

He in the year 1531, publiſhed his Book, Entituled, <hi>Lib. 7. de
Error. Trinitatis,</hi> which was printed at <hi>Baſil.</hi> This Book was filled with
innumerable Blaſphemies and impious Mockeries upon the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
upon which account moſt of the Copies of it were ſoon after
publickly burnt at <hi>Frankford.</hi> But notwithſtanding this, they were
privately handed about, ſo that many that were inclinable to a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errours, were poyſoned by this Book into
worſe. And therefore <hi>Philip Melanchton</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Epiſt. Phil. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan. Lib. 1. p. 335.</note> writes a Letter from <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,

Hereſy. But <hi>Servet</hi> in the mean time uſes all imaginable diligence, to
diſſeminate his Doctrines; and to this end, goes from place to place,
practiſing Phyſick under the feigned name of <hi>Michael Villonovanus;</hi>
when he wrote a Book of <hi>Syrops,</hi> and as <hi>Munſter</hi> ſays, a Comment on
<hi>Ptolemies</hi> Geography. He afterwards wrote ſome other Heretical
Pieces alike blaſphemous with the other; as one Entituled, <hi>A Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
de Reſtitutione Chriſtianiſmi,</hi> quoted by <hi>Bullinger,</hi> an Apology
to <hi>Melanchton</hi> and the Miniſters of <hi>Geneva, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> in which Books

Diabolical Phantaſm, the Monſter Gerion, the illuſion of Satan,</hi> &amp;c.

he publiſhed at <hi>Vienna Allobrogum,</hi> where for the ſame, he was caſt
into Priſon; but he eſcaped from thence to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he was
diſcovered, and afterwards condemned and burned in the year 1568.
by the deſire of the Evangelick Cantons.</p>
            <p>The next follower of <hi>Servetus,</hi> and the fore-runner of <hi>Socinus,</hi> was
<hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</note> born at <hi>Conſenza</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who agreed with
<hi>Servetus</hi> in his Doctrine, that the Father was the only Divine Eſſence;
but aſſerted that the Son was eſſentiated by him, and made another
God, as likewiſe the Holy Ghoſt: So that there were not three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in one Eſſence, but three diſtinct Eſſences in the God-head, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one Primary God, and two Secundary or Deiſied Ones. Theſe
Blaſphemies he having for ſome time vented in the World, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at <hi>Geneva,</hi> he was by the Magiſtrates of that City thrown into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
where not having ſtaid long, he of his own accord, promiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
recants his Errors, and deſires to be freed. But the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
reſolved not to free him, unleſs he will undergo the Pennance
they preſcribe him, which accordingly he did,<note n="y" place="margin">Vid. Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij vit. Val. Gentilis.</note> 
               <hi>to be ſtripped to his
Shirt, and barefooted and bareheaded to kneel down and beg pardon for his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45010:67"/>
Crimes, and with his own hands to throw his Heretical Writings into the
Fire, to be prepared for that purpoſe, and in this Habit to be led through all
the Streets of the City, declaring his Repentance before all the People.</hi> This
having performed, he petitions again for his enlargement, which
would not ye be granted, unleſs he would ſwear not only to forbear
the ſpreading of his Hereſy, but that he would never go out of the
City without leave from the Senate. And this too he readily did.
But no ſooner was he freed, but he little valuing his Oath, flies from
<hi>Geneva</hi> to his Friend <hi>Gribaldus,</hi> living at a place called <hi>Farges</hi> in the
Canton of <hi>Bern;</hi> where he had conference with <hi>Alciat</hi> a famous <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi>
in order to the ſpreading their Hereſy. From thence he went
to <hi>Lyons</hi> to diffuſe his Doctrine there; from thence to <hi>Grenoble;</hi> from
thence to <hi>Cambray,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Farges</hi> again; where the Governour of
<hi>Gaia,</hi> to whoſe Juriſdiction <hi>Farges</hi> does belong, impriſons him again;
but upon promiſe of living quietly, releaſes him. From thence he
goes again to <hi>Lyons,</hi> and was there impriſoned a third time by the
Governour of that City; but he perſwading the Papiſts there, that
his Controverſy was only againſt <hi>Calvin;</hi> they thinking thereby to do
<hi>Calvin</hi> a ſpight, forthwith releaſe him. Afterwards, he having
ſpread his Poyſon in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> flies to <hi>Poland,</hi> where he joyns
with <hi>Blandrata</hi> and <hi>Alciat</hi> to infect the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Church. Here not

preſently after <hi>Gentilis</hi> did, ſuſpecting that the Magiſtrates had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi>
but tho' he agreed with the reſt of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> in denying the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45010:68"/>
There were beſides theſe ſeveral others, that were fore-runners to
<hi>Socinus,</hi> or elſe contemporaries with him, who did not agree to all the
Syſtem of his Hereſy, which now the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do generally maintain.
Such as were <hi>Nicolaus Parula</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> a great Friend of <hi>Laelius
Socinus; Andreas Tricicius Modrevius,</hi> a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Knight; <hi>Adam Paſtor,</hi>

in the building up the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſy; but the two great Maſter-builders
were <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Fauſtus Socinus,</hi> of whom now we come to
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laelius Socinus,</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">LAELIUS SOCINUS.</note> was born <hi>A. D.</hi> 1525. at <hi>Siena</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family; his Fathers Names was <hi>Marianus Junior,</hi> a famous Lawyer
in <hi>Italy</hi> at that time; his Mothers Name was <hi>Camilla,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Paulus Salvettus.</hi> He was an Auditor of <hi>Servetus</hi> when he was in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and before he was of Age, he began to model a New Syſtem of
Divinity upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Principles. He as the<note n="*" place="margin">Vit. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. per Eq. Polon.</note> Author of the
Life, ſays,<note n="l" place="margin">Id. p. 10.</note> reading the Scriptures chiefly to further him in the Study
of the Laws, and relying only upon his own Judgment, <hi>finds many of
the Doctrines of the Church contrary to the Divine Teſtimony,</hi> as he
thought, and therefore explains them, without farther ſearch, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Judgment. He, having thus for a conſiderable time
been laying the Grounds of his Hereſie, travelling into <hi>England,
France, Holland, Germany,</hi> he fixed his ſeat, at laſt, at <hi>Zurick</hi> in <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetia;</hi>
yet not ſo, but that after this he goes twice into <hi>Poland, A. D.
1551,</hi> and again 1557; where he infected many of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
He infected alſo his own Brothers <hi>Celſus, Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi>
and <hi>Fauſtus</hi> his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Son. And <hi>Zanchius</hi> in
his Preface to his Book <hi>de Tribus Elohim,</hi> further ſays, <hi>He, for many
Years purſued the</hi> Samoſetanian <hi>Hereſie, and drew as many as he could
into the ſame Errour, and thoſe were not a few: He endeavoured likewiſe
by many Temptations to pervert me into the ſame Errour, and to involve me
in the ſame eternal Deſtruction with himſelf.</hi> Whilſt he lived at <hi>Zurick,</hi>
or in his Travels, he contracted ſome Familiarity with <hi>Melancton,
Brentius, Muſculus, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> and therefore <hi>Calvin,</hi>
when he heard of his audacious Curioſity in Divinity, wrote to him,
to diſſuade him from it, <hi>Si tibi per aëreas illas Speculationes volitare libet,
ſine me quaeſo humilem Chriſti diſcipulum ea meditari quae ad fidei meae aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem
faciunt.</hi> You may, if you pleaſe, fly through theſe aereal
Speculations, but ſuffer me, an humble Diſciple of Chriſt, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45010:68"/>
upon thoſe things which ſerve to the Edification of my Faith.
And now ſo many of the Family of the <hi>Socinus</hi>'s being perverted by
<hi>Laelius,</hi> the whole Family began to be ſuſpected for Hereſie; which
brought a ſtorm upon all the Houſe; ſo that, as the Authour of
the Life ſays, <hi>the Harveſt was ſpoil'd in the springing Blade,</hi> Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
<hi>being impriſoned, and the reſt being either forced to fly, or afraid to
profeſs their Opinion.</hi> This Fear drove young <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> being now but
Twenty Years old, not only from his place of abode but from <hi>Italy;</hi>
who went to live for ſome time at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1559.</note> in the ſame Year,
in which the Magiſtrates of <hi>Baſil</hi> digged up the Body of <hi>David George,</hi>

on the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> He was the firſt that brought to light that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Perſon of Chriſt, and his Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
do ſince maintain, and was forming ſome great Deſigns for
the furthering his Hereſie, but did not live to perfect them. The
only Books that he publiſhed, were the Dialogue between <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Vaticanus,</hi> againſt the perſecution of Hereticks upon the occaſion of
<hi>Servet</hi>'s execution, in which he makes <hi>Calvin</hi> a great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which Book was reprinted in <hi>Holland,</hi> by ſome of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant
Party 1612. and has commonly been attributed to <hi>Caſtellio;</hi>
though 'tis apparent it is not <hi>Caſtellio</hi>'s by the Reflection that is made
upon his Tranſlation of the Scripture. He wrote likewiſe a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Sacraments, and a Book <hi>de Reſurrectione Corporum,</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by <hi>Crucellaeus.</hi> Whatever other Deſigns he had projected, and
whatever Books he wrote fell into his Nephew <hi>Fauſtus</hi>'s hands; who
made all the poſſible haſte he could to <hi>Zurick,</hi> to ſecure his Books and
Papers, fearing leaſt it ſhould fare with <hi>Laelius,</hi> as it had done before
with <hi>David George.</hi>

               <hi>Caſtellio,</hi> in his defence, ſaid, he only publiſhed them as a Tranſlator,

were the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> themſelves wanting to carry on their deſign; for
in the Year 1566, there was a Book printed at <hi>Alba Julia,</hi> with this

            </p>
            <p>The next Year,<note place="margin">1570.</note> being the Year 1570, <hi>Fauſtus Socinus</hi> publiſhed his

that Model of Divinity, which was left him by his Uncle <hi>Laelius;</hi> for

And in the Year 1578. he publiſhed another Diſputation, <hi>of the ſtate

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> concerning the Adoration of Chriſt; eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Blandrata</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Davidis;</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>Alba Julia</hi>
ſiding with the one, and thoſe of <hi>Claudiopolis</hi> or <hi>Clausburg</hi> with
the other. Upon this, <hi>Blandrata</hi> invites <hi>Socinus</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> to be
Moderator in this difference, and gets <hi>Socinus</hi> to lodge in the ſame houſe
with <hi>Fr. Davidis Blandrat,</hi> during his ſtay, bearing all his Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>So that within a few Months afterwards followed that famous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
held at <hi>Clausburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1579.</note> concerning the Invocation of Chriſt,
which was afterwards Printed in the Year 1594. After the end of
which Conference, <hi>Franciſcus Davidis</hi> being very ſtiff in his Opinion,
and his Antagoniſts exaggerating the Wickedneſs of it, he was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
impriſoned by Order of the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in a few Months was either made away there, or died. From
hence was raiſed a great Clamour by the <hi>Anti-Adoration</hi> Party againſt
<hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Blandrata,</hi> that they had been the Authours of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
which was ſo much credited, that they loſt their Eſteem with
many. This forced <hi>Socinus</hi> to write an <hi>Apology to the</hi> Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
<hi>the Followers of</hi> Franciſcus Davidis, to ſhew that <hi>Franciſcus</hi>
drew this Calamity upon himſelf, <hi>That contrary to his Promiſe given
to him and</hi> Blandrat, <hi>he had procured ſeveral things in the Synod of</hi>
Thord, <hi>to be decreed againſt the Invocation of Chriſt; and once, when
he preached in the great Church, he expreſly aſſerted, That it was the
ſame thing to pray to Chriſt, as to pray to the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any
other of the dead Saints.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Franciſcus Davidis</hi>
the <hi>Anti-Invocation</hi> Party in <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> were not quiet, but did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
maintain, That as Chriſt by Nature was not God, ſo without
Idolatry he could not be worſhipped; and for this ſide of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
there appeared ſtrenuouſly <hi>Franciſcus Davidis</hi>'s Son, <hi>Palaeologus,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45010:70"/>
Glirius, Sommerus,</hi> and others, who in their Books and Diſcourſes did
grievouſly accuſe <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Blandrata. Socinus</hi> not being eaſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all theſe Contradictions and Accuſations, forthwith leaves <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi>
and being now 40 Years old, goes for <hi>Poland,</hi> and there
joyns himſelf to the Congregation of them, that following <hi>Servet,</hi>
do pray to Chriſt as the Son of the Eternal God, but not the Eternal
Son; <hi>Who,</hi> as<note n="*" place="margin">In the Title of his Book, <hi>Quid Regni Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> &amp;c.</note>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> after a
while, objected againſt this new mode of <hi>Socinus,</hi> but only <hi>Nemojevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and <hi>Czechovicius,</hi> who reſiſted him ſtrenuouſly for a time, and <hi>Nemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jevicius,</hi>
after a while too, aſſented to him, and <hi>Czechovicius,</hi> though
he held out to the laſt, ſeeing no body to abett him, was forced to be
ſtill. So that within four years time, all the whole Church of the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> did ſubſcribe to the Doctrines of <hi>Socinus,</hi> which they had
ſo lately almoſt univerſally Condemned. Thus was this Hereſy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
after ſo many ſtruglings among the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> themſelves,
which is ſwallowed down ſo crudely, and without conſideration, by
many in our Ages, that make pretence to the greateſt Reaſon and
Cautiouſneſs. <hi>Socinus</hi> lived ſeveral years after the general Reception
of his Doctrines, and died in the year 1604.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> that have been famous ſince <hi>Fauſtus Socinus,</hi>
have been but as the Schoolmen to <hi>Lumbard,</hi> have commented only
upon his Text, and only more audaciouſly ſometimes explained his
notions.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> of note, after <hi>Socinus</hi> had formed his Hereſy,

Churches in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and Moderator of the <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> at <hi>Clauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi>
He was a follower of <hi>Socinus</hi> in moſt of his Doctrines, only in
the matter of Invocation, which <hi>Socinus</hi> endeavours to diſſwade him
from, in a long Letter to him A. D. 1596. He wrote the celebrated
<hi>Socinian</hi> piece upon the <hi>Texts of the old and new Teſtament, upon which
the Trinity is grounded,</hi> though the other Tracts attributed to him are
doubted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſtorodus</hi> was another Diſciple of <hi>Socinus;</hi>

Cruſius,</hi> a Phyſician, <hi>Petrus Morſcovius,</hi> and <hi>Andreas Wiſſowatius,</hi>
were famous <hi>Socinians</hi> likewiſe at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines had hitherto contained themſelves within
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and there was only ſome little Colony of
them lurking among the Remonſtrants in <hi>Holland,</hi> but other parts of
the World were generally free from this infection, eſpecially our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till in the time of the late Rebellion and Uſurpation it became
the ſink of all Hereſies.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>John Bidel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bidel.</note> Maſter of Arts of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
brought in this Hereſy here, and held a Congregation of <hi>Socinians</hi> in
<hi>London.</hi> He wrote two <hi>Socinian</hi> Catechiſms, a large one, and a ſhorter
for the uſe of the more ignorant; which were tranſlated into Latin by
a young Scholar of his, one <hi>Nathaniel Stuckey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Son of one Mr.
<hi>Stuckey</hi> a Cloathworker in <hi>London.</hi> He wrote likewiſe a Treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Diety of the Holy Ghoſt, wherein he does not follow <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
in making him only an Attribute, but a Perſon, and one of the
higher rank of Angels. There were ſeveral Books of the <hi>Socinian</hi>
ſtamp publiſhed about that time, by ſome of the other Sectaries, as
one againſt the Eternity of Torments, entituled, <hi>The twelve Pillars of
Hell Torments ſhaken,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome other Papers of the ſame nature
ſent abroad, which occaſioned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to write his Excellent

Soon after this,<note place="margin">1658.</note> in the year 1658. came out the Edict of <hi>John Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimire,</hi>

But for ſome conſiderations or other this time was ſhortened,
and in the year 1660.<note place="margin">1660.</note> they who would not renounce their Hereſy,
were forced to leave <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> which accordingly many

            </p>
            <p>Since which time <hi>Chriſtoph. Sandius</hi> has been the only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> of
note, famed moſt for his <hi>Nucleus Hiſt. Eccleſiaſticae,</hi> his <hi>Tractatus de

in moſt points he was a <hi>Socinian,</hi> yet as to the matter of our Saviour's
Perſon, he was a violent <hi>Arian.</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Chriſtopherus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
a <hi>Pruſſian</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian,</hi> who was Counſellour and Secretary to

of his Offices 1668. He was born at <hi>Koningsberg</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia,

            <p>In <hi>England</hi> we have ſince that time been free from this infection,
till Mr. <hi>F—n</hi>'s Papers of late came out, and the Book called the
<hi>Naked Goſpel;</hi> but God be thanked, the ſtrength of theſe pieces is
not ſo great, as to fear from them any mighty Contagion: For though
they have all the Malice and Hereſy, they have little enough of the
Wit and Reaſon of the former <hi>Socinians.</hi>
