            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>THE Apoſtle having declared that all the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, which God was pleaſed to beſtow upon his Church in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, were of very little or no Conſideration, if they were not joined with Charity; he deſcribes that, which only was able to give any real Value to all the reſt, by ſome of the moſt genuine and proper Effects of it: As that it <hi>Suffereth long,</hi> that it is <hi>Kind,</hi> that it <hi>Envieth not,</hi> and the like. He then commends it from its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58703:4"/>
becauſe that all the other Gifts and Abilities, how neceſſary ſoever they might be for the propagation of the Chriſtian Religion for the preſent, ſhould yet <hi>fail, ceaſe</hi> and <hi>vaniſh away,</hi> as things that ſhould be of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe in the other World. But this alone ſhould <hi>never fail,</hi> but continue with us for ever in that bleſſed State of Happineſs and Perfection. He then mentions the three moſt eminent Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> but gives the preference to the laſt, and concludes poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>The greateſt of theſe is Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning he had affirmed, that without this, <hi>the ſpeaking with the tongues of Men and of Angels,</hi> was no better than a loud and inſignificant Noiſe: And that <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and the deepeſt <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Myſteries of Religion, and the glorious Power of working Miracles, were in themſelves of no more Account than the other. He then proceeds to aſſert the ſame concerning the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Liberality to the Poor, and the laying down our very Lives, which ſeems to be the utmoſt that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be required of us, upon any Occaſion. But yet, ſays he, <hi>Though I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is here manifeſtly implyed, that a Man may part with his whole Eſtate, and his Life too, and yet that he may want Charity. This may ſeem a very ſtrange and ſurprizing Suppoſition to us, that can ſee no further than the bare outſide and appearances of things; but God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58703:4"/>
that is intimately acquainted with all the ſecret motions and imaginations of our Hearts, knows that too often the moſt ſpecious external Acts may proceed from a falſe or corrupt Principle. And then, tho' they may be highly eſteemed and magnified in the Opinion of the World, they cannot be acceptable to Him that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with nothing that does not flow from a ſincere and truly pious Diſpoſition of the Soul.</p>
            <p>I ſhall confine my Diſcourſe to the former part of the Words; and here I ſhall ſhew:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is that Charity that will make our Alms any way profitable to our Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That without this, whatſoever we give, it ſhall be of no Advantage at all, as to our Eternal Concerns.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What are the Reaſons that whatever we beſtow on the Neceſſities of our poor Brethren up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Principle of true Charity, ſhall through God's gracious acceptance, be Profitable to us in the great Day of Accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is that Charity that will make our Alms any way profitable to our Salvation: For in this Senſe we muſt underſtand the Apoſtie, who was perfectly crucified to the World, and therefore could eſteem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58703:5"/>
really Profitable, that had not ſome tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the procurement of a better Life, which was the only thing that he valued. And when it is ſaid here, that without Charity all that we can beſtow is not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or Conducive to the promoting of that great End, it muſt be implyed that with it, it is.</p>
            <p>Now the Charity that produces this excellent Effect, is a Charity that ariſes from the Love of God; that loves him as the ſupream and original Good, and every thing elſe for his ſake; that admires and adores his infinite Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and eſteems other things as the Streams and Ema<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nations from that inexhauſtible Fountain.</p>
            <p>When we have not a due regard to this heavenly Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of our Affections, our Love will quickly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a ſilly Fondneſs, or a covetous Deſire, or ſome turbulent, uneaſy and exorbitant Paſſion. But when the Love of God rules in our Hearts, when it preſides over our very Thoughts, and governs the moſt ſecret and inward Motions of our Spirits, it will keep all ſteddy and even; in a due compoſure, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs or irregularity.</p>
            <p>The Love of other Things, whether it be of Pleaſure, or Profit, or Honour, or if there be any thing elſe that vain Men are wont to ſet their Hearts upon, it is the univerſal Grievance of all the World, the unhappy Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all the Miſeries that Mankind has groaned under ever ſince the Fall of our firſt Parents. All the Fraud and Treachery, all the Violence and Injuſtice, all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58703:5"/>
Rapes and Murders, all the Cruelties and Barbarities that ever were committed, are owing to nothing but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Love of ſome earthly Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>The Divine Love, as it is placed on a different Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo it has very different Effects; it rejoyces the Soul, and fills the World with a ſettled Calmneſs and Serenity; it puts an end to all Strife and Contention, all deceitful and undjuſt Dealing; it conſiders that whatever it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is all received from the good Providence of God; and in gratitude to him, it makes ſome returns to any of his poor Creatures that it ſees in a worſe Condition than it ſelf. It has a tender and compaſſionate Senſe of all Mens Calamities; and is ready to the utmoſt of its Power, to aſſiſt their Infirmities, ſupport their Weakneſs and relieve their Neceſſities; and where it can do no more, it will comfort them at leaſt with its good Wiſhes and hearty Prayers. It is like the Sun in the Firmament that enlivens all things that come near it, and caſts a chearful and pleaſant Smile on thoſe frozen Regions that lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the influence of its Heat. This exceſſive and univerſal Charity is the very Temper of Heaven, the Image of the Divinity, <hi>the Wiſdom that is from above,</hi> which is ſo gloriouſly deſcribed, <hi>James</hi> iii. 17. <hi>It is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58703:6"/>
The Philoſopher tells us, that Prudence is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tie and ligament by which all the Vertues are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the Apoſtle ſays the ſame of <hi>Charity,</hi> that <hi>it is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> Col. iii. 14. Without the one there can be no moral Vertue, and no Chriſtian Grace without the other.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law. For this thou ſhalt not commit adultery, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not ſteal, thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, thou ſhalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment it is briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this ſaying, namely, thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Rom. xiii. 8, 9, 10. This is a Duty of ſo wide and comprehenſive a Nature, that there muſt be a mixture of it in all our good Actions, and in our Alms in an eſpecial manner. And it is this that gives them the only Value and Eſteem in the ſight of God. It was this that inhanced the Price of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow's Mite, and made it outweigh all the abundance of the Rich. When it is given with a good inclination, a Cup of cold Water ſhall not go without its reward. For <hi>if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> And whatſoever we thus do with a ſincere and honeſt Heart ſhall turn to our eternal Advantage in the great and terrible Day. The Proceedings then ſhall be determined by Acts of Kindneſs and Benificence; and whatever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58703:6"/>
we ſhall do for any of his poor diſtreſſed Members, ſhall be rewarded as if it had been done to our Bleſſed Lord himſelf. For ſo it ſhall be declared before that general Aſſembly of Men and Angels: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But if this Charity be the only thing that makes our Alms profitable to us, then Secondly, without this whatever we give ſhall be of no Advantage at all, as to our eternal Concerns.</p>
            <p>In all Matters of a Moral Nature the End and Motive upon which they are done, is always the thing that is to be principally conſidered. It is that which ſpecifies the Action, and makes it Good or Evil, when it was before in it ſelf indifferent. And therefore, tho' a good End can by no means juſtify a bad Action, yet a bad End does certainly ſpoil a good one. It will not ſanctify a Murder, if a Man ſhould imagine he committed it for the Glory of God; but it will turn our Charity into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge, if we relieve one poor Man, with a deſign to inable him to ruin another. It muſt be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to our Neighbour, and Obedience to Almighty God, that can make our Liberality to the indigent and neceſſitous any way acceptable. When a thing is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be beſtowed with an ill will, or a ſiniſter intent, it does not oblige even him that receives it: The poor Man may be glad of the Dole, but he cannot have a good Opinion of him that gave it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58703:7"/>
But taking it for granted in the general, that it is the kind and charitable Intention of the <hi>Donor,</hi> and not the bare diſtribution of our Goods, that makes our Bounty really valuable in the Eyes of God and Men; I ſhall lay down a few particular Inſtances of ſome of the falſe Ends, which Men may ſometimes propoſe to themſelves, and which are too often the chief inducement they have to be Liberal to the Poor.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the firſt, and it may be the moſt common of theſe, is Vain-Glory.</p>
            <p>This may incline Men to give freely enough to the Neceſſities of thoſe that are in Diſtreſs, but it is only to purchaſe a Reputation, and gain the good Opinion of the People, and to be admired and applauded for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of noble and generous Minds. This was that which oppened the Hands of the proud <hi>Phariſees;</hi> they were griping and rapacious to the higheſt Degree, but their Ambition and Thirſt after Praiſe, was ſtronger than their Covetouſneſs. They would therefore give Alms, but it was <hi>that they might be ſeen of men.</hi> They would have their good Deeds proclaimed and publiſhed, as it were, by the ſound of a Trumpet. If they happened to find an object of Pity in the Street, or the Market-place, or the Synagogue, where the People might crowd about them, to obſerve what they did, they would not fail to relieve him; but if they had met the ſame Perſon in the Wilderneſs, where there had been no Witneſs of their Actions, they would have ſuffered him to periſh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58703:7"/>
without any remorſe. This is the Charity of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>But he that is ſincerely Charitable, rejoyces at all opportunities of doing Good, and rather prefers that which is the moſt Secret, and is beſt pleaſed when he has no other Witneſſes of his Bounty, but only God and his own Conſcience. 'Tis true, indeed, it is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works and glorify,</hi> not you, but <hi>your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> We muſt not altogether decline the being ſeen when we do Good, but we muſt not do it only to be ſeen. It muſt be for Example and not for Oſtentation; that others may be excited and encouraged to do the like; to benefit our Neighbours, and bring praiſe unto God; and not to gratify a fooliſh itch of popular Applauſe. <hi>Otherwiſe,</hi> as we are expreſly told, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 17. <hi>We have no reward of our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> For he that ſeeks Honour to himſelf by an external ſhew of Charity or Piety, or whatever it be, makes himſelf his own Idol. He ſerves not God, but an idle vain-glorious Humor, and he may poſſibly gain what he ſo earneſtly deſires; he may be admired and magnified here, but he ſhall get nothing hereafter, but <hi>ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second falſe End that Men may have is an opinion of Merit.</p>
            <p>This miſtake we know is mightily favoured, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly nouriſhed by thoſe of the Romiſh Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58703:8"/>
They perſwade their Votaries to be liberal to the Poor, (and ſo far it is very well done) eſpecially, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to be very bountiful to the Mendicants and other Religious Orders, (as they call them) who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have renounced the World, and make profeſſion of a kind of voluntary Poverty: And in this, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they may have, we are not ignorant; but whatever it be, their Doctrine of Merit is a very high Preſumption, and that which will looſe them the Fruit of their Labours they might otherwiſe have expected. For <hi>when we have done,</hi> if we could do, <hi>all thoſe things which are commanded us, we muſt</hi> yet acknowledge and <hi>ſay, that we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants.</hi> For tho' God has been pleaſed of his mere Goodneſs and ſpecial Favour, to accept of the little Services he inables us to do him, and has incouraged them with the promiſe of eternal Life; yet we cannot claim it, as that which is in ſtrictneſs due to our weak and imperfect performances. <hi>The Reward is of Grace, and not of Debt. The Wages of Sin is Death:</hi> indeed, it is that which it has earned and moſt juſtly deſerved; <hi>but the Gift of God is eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> This is a <hi>Gift,</hi> a Thing freely beſtowed, not purchaſed with Alms or any Works of ours, but by the precious Blood of our bleſſed Redeemer. And he that ſhould exact it as in Juſtice due to any thing he had done, would ſet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>up a wrong Title, and let fall that by which he held before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58703:8"/>
The Caſe is much the ſame, as if a Sovereign ſhould not only Pardon one of his rebellious Subjects, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, ſettle an Inheritance upon him of an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Value, and only require him to be kind to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Traytors, and diſpoſe of ſome ſmall matter of what he had given him among them for his ſake, and not the hundredth part, it may be, of what he owed him neither: Now if this inſolent wretch, upon the laying down ſuch a pitiful trifle, ſhould imagine that he had made a real purchaſe and refuſe to accept the Eſtate, as it was conveyed to him by an act of mere Grace, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it as his undoubted Right; he would by that Plea totally quit his proper Claim, and forfeit all, and incur the higheſt diſpleaſure of his Lord, for the unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable arrogance of ſuch a proud and groundleſs Demand. It is dangerous pleading of Merit, when the matter in queſtion is a pure Favour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third falſe End is near a kin to this, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſame Church, and that is, a Conceit that Men by their Alms may make Satisfaction for their Sins.</p>
            <p>When the Guilt that has been contracted lies as a heavy Burden upon the Conſcience, and Men are frighted with the dreadful apprehenſions of what muſt be the neceſſary conſequence of a lewd and vicious Life; they will think nothing too dear to procure a Pardon. The miſerable Worlding will then be willing to part with ſome of his ill-gotten Goods, to eſcape the Puniſhment he knows to be due to his Rapine and Injuſtice; eſpecially when the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58703:9"/>
Terrors of Death are upon him, and he cannot retain the Treaſures of Unrighteouſneſs any longer; he will then gladly throw any thing, or all that he has into the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Bank of the Church, for the hopes of an Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This Fancy has erected many ſtately Monuments, and given large Endowments to many rich Foundations.</p>
            <p>And it muſt be confeſſed that when ſuch things as theſe are done, with an humble ſenſe of our own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are very good, if not ſome of the beſt expreſſions of our Love to the Brethren, and our Gratitude to the Almighty. But then we muſt beware, that they are not polluted with a fond Opinion, as if they were able to take away the gilt of a Sin. We muſt not to think expiate a Murder, by building a Monaſtery; nor to make an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the wickedneſs of our whole Life, by found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Hoſpital when we are dead: No; <hi>We were not redeemed with corruptible things.</hi> There is no ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting in the Court of Heaven; there is no bribing of Juſtice there, nor buying off the Sentence with Money. God will be merciful unto us, and accept our Alms, when they are given in the way of Acknowledgement and not of Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is one falſe End more, which I ſhall name, and that is, when Men will give only for the ſupport of a particular Party.</p>
            <p>All mankind is the complete and adequate Object of our Charity; common Humanity gives every one an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in our Affections, and intitles him to a ſhare of our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58703:9"/>
Bounty. It is the Apoſtle's command; <hi>As we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, let us do good unto all men.</hi> Gal. vi. 10. 'tis true, he immediately adds; <hi>Eſpecially to them who are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> And it will be readily granted, that we may and ought to have a more peculiar regard to theſe, but not to the total excluſion of others. We ſhould be more liberal where the Obligations of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are ſuperadded to thoſe of the ſame humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or where it is not in our Power to Relieve both; we may lawfully prefer a Relation before a Stranger; a Chriſtian before an Infidel; one of our own, before one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. But no Chriſtian of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination whatſoever, no <hi>Jew,</hi> no <hi>Turk,</hi> no Heathen, no Man whatever he be, but ſhould have ſome ſmall Portion, at leaſt, of the good Things we poſſeſs, if his Neceſſities require it.</p>
            <p>This is the true Chriſtian Charity that extends it ſelf over the whole World; but it is nothing but peeviſh Bigotry to be kind to none but our own perſwaſion. Like the <hi>Jews</hi> that could be Bountiful enough to their own Nation, but had no manner of Bowels or Pity for a poor <hi>Samaritan.</hi> This is a bitter Zeal, that quickly runs out into down-right Cruelty; as when ſome ſhall be content to give profuſely to the good Catholicks (as they call them) only to animate and abet them in the extirpation of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. This is a Love that is begotten of Hatred; this is to be Charitable in Spight, and to do ſome kind of Good for the ſake of a greater Miſchief. At beſt, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58703:10"/>
that reſtrains his kindneſs to a Party, has, indeed, no kindneſs for any but his own dear ſelf: for he loves others only becauſe they Act and Think as he does.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the things that will make our Alms-to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us nothing: When they are corrupted with Vain Glory, or an Opinion of Merit or Satisfaction, or when they are too much confined to one particular ſort of Men.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I proceed now to the third Thing, to ſhew, what are the Reaſons that whatever we beſtow upon the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of our poor Brethren, upon the Principle of true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhall through God's gracious acceptance be Profitable to us in the great Day of Accounts. And that it ſhall be:
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe Acts of Beneficence are neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Principle.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe they are the ſureſt Evidence of our Love of God.</item>
                  <item>3. Becauſe they are the plaineſt demonſtration of our Faith and Truſt in Him.</item>
                  <item>4. And becauſe they do in a peculiar manner incline Him to be merciful unto us, when we are thus merciful unto others. Theſe are the Reaſons for which our Alms are profitable to us, and pleaſing to God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe Acts of Beneficence are neceſſary to preſerve the Principle. The Principle by which theſe are to be produced, and which is the only thing that can make them accepted, is Charity; the true inward Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58703:10"/>
of the Heart, as I have ſhewed, and which I have endeavoured to deſcribe unto you, tho' very imperfectly. Now where this Principle has no other opportunity of exerting it ſelf, a ſincere deſire only of doing Good may be ſufficient to keep it alive. The kind wiſhes of the Poor and Impotent ſhall be enough, when they have not Ability to afford any further Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But thoſe whom God has been pleaſed to bleſs with a plentiful or but a competent meaſure of worldly Goods, if they do not communicate ſomething of what they enjoy, to thoſe that are in want and neceſſity, it is an undeniable Proof that they have no real Affection for them. For if a Man doth not do that which lies within the compaſs of his Power, it is a plain indication that he has not any deſire or intention to do it; or if he had, yet if he frequently ſuppreſs it, and will not ſuffer it to diſcover it ſelf in ſome Overt Acts; this will by degrees ſtifle and extinguiſh that very Deſire. A Fire may be kindled and begin to burn, but if it be ſtopt up in a cloſe place, it will ſoon be ſmothered and go out in its own Smoak; But when it has room to dilate it ſelf, and is ventilated by the open Air, this increaſes and ſpreads the Flame, and it grows ſtronger, and enlightens and warms all that is about it. In like manner, Charity ſhut up within our own Breaſts, languiſhes and decays and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but when we give it Vent by frequent exerciſe, it feeds it ſelf by being ſpent, and one good Deed fits and diſpoſes us for another. Like the Widow's Oyl,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58703:11"/>
the more Veſſels it fills, the more it multiplies. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and confirmed like other Habits by the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Acts; but it is weakened, and at laſt quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by a long intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>And from hence we may gather, that Almighty God is very well pleaſed with thoſe Expreſſions of Kindneſs which do maintain and coroborate that excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Charity; which is a faint reſemblance and ſome kind of imitation of his own eſſential infinite Goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Such Acts as theſe are the ſureſt Evidence of our Love of God.</p>
            <p>We may indeed, deal our Bread to the Hungry, and caſt our Money among the Poor, and all this may be nothing but an hypocritical Pretence of Kindneſs. We may do it upon wrong Motives, as I have ſhewed; and this notwithſtanding, we may have no true Love neither for God nor our Neighbour. But of this he is the only Judge; we muſt have a charitable Opinion of every thing that is Good, tho' it ſhould be but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>But tho' we cannot tell whether he that gives has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any real Love of God, yet we may know that he that refuſes to give, has certainly none. For he that will not part with any thing for God's ſake, is that covetous Idolater that loves his Money better than God, or rather, he makes a God of his Money. <hi>Who ſo hath this hath this world's good,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John, and ſeeth his brother have</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58703:11"/>
               <hi>need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> It cannot be: for as the ſame Apoſtle obſerves in another place, <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> It is a vain thing to talk of Raptures and Extaſies, and being wonderfully affected with inviſible Things; and not to be at all moved or concerned at that which lies before our Eyes.</p>
            <p>The beſt way to ſhew our Regard to our Creator, is by our Tenderneſs to his poor Creatures. <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 12. The Love of God and our Neighbour, are ſo intimately united, and ſo cloſely joined together, that they cannot be ſeparated. And the moſt convincing and ſenſible Argument that we unfeignedly love the one, is to be really kind to the other. And with this God is highly pleaſed and honoured: For every Ray of Mercy, every Beam of good Will, that falls directly upon our poor Brethren, is by conſequence, reflected upon Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Theſe Acts are the plaineſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith and Truſt in God.</p>
            <p>That in which the Men of the World are wont to put their greateſt Confidence, is, their plentiful Eſtates, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of their Riches, and the largeneſs of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. But he that is willing to reſign up theſe or any conſiderable Portion of them, and caſt himſelf upon the Providence of Heaven, to make what Returns it ſhall ſeem good to the wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, does thereby
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58703:12"/>
declare, that his Chief Dependance is upon God, and not upon his Wealth.</p>
            <p>And this Truſt in God is that which gives us the ſureſt Title to his Favour and Protection; and that which brings Him the greateſt Honour. For it is that by which we do effectually ſhew, that we do eſteem him the Supreme and Sovereign Goodneſs and Truth, and that we are verily perſwaded, <hi>that he will never leave us nor forſake us.</hi> This was the Touchſtone by which our Bleſſed Lord did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times try the ſincerity of thoſe that offered themſelves to become his Diſciples. <hi>Go ſell that thou haſt and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven: and come and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.</hi> He that was afraid to accept the Condition, went away ſorrowful; and we never hear that he made a ſecond Application. But they that durſt believe him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook All, tho' that All were but a little, were immediatly comforted with the Promiſe, and are long ſince entered into the Poſſeſſion of everlaſting Bliſs and Immortality. This was the Reward of their Faith; For he that quits a Treaſure in Hand, for a Treaſure in Reverſion; he that leaves what he has upon Earth for the Promiſe of what he expects in Heaven, gives the beſt aſſurance that it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he does really believe the Truth of the Promiſe.</p>
            <p>But he that will not be perſwaded to give ſomething liberally to the relief of the indigent and neceſſitous, by all the great and glorious Encouragements that are propoſed to induce him unto it, does not heartily believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But he is, indeed, a ſort of an Infidel, that accounts Bonds, and Mortgages, and ready Money a better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58703:12"/>
4. Fourthly, Acts of Charity are Profitable, becauſe they do in a peculiar manner incline God to be merciful unto us, when we are thus merciful unto others.</p>
            <p>It is one of the Beatitudes pronounced by our Saviour, Mat. v. 7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy.</hi> This ſeems extremely congruous and agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God and to the Nature of the Thing. God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inclineable to Mercy; and it is reaſonable to think that he will extend it to none more readily, than to thoſe in whom there appear ſome little reſemblances of that his moſt lovely and adorable Attribute.</p>
            <p>He is ſometimes ſet forth, as if he did temper and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himſelf, as it were, to the different diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and various qualifications of the ſeveral Subjects. Pſal. xviii 25, 26. <hi>With the merciful thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful. With the upright man thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: With the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure; and with froward, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward.</hi> This is but juſt and equitable, that Men ſhould be proceeded with by the Rules and Meaſures they have practiſed themſelves. And therefore the hard-hearted and remorſleſs wretch cannot complain, if he be uſed with rigour and extremity, nor repine when he ſees the kind and compaſſionate Soul treated with the greateſt Clemency and Sweetneſs. This is a way of dealing that is but ſuited to every one's Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The cruel and revengeful ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed, but the pious and charitable ſhall be graciouſly pardoned.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>To do good and to communicate forget not; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> Heb. xiii. 16. Our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58703:13"/>
Almes are called <hi>Sacrifices</hi> here, not that they have any proper expiatory Power to take away ſins. For the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> that were offered under the Moſaical Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had not that; but they were accepted as they were Types of the Grand Propitiation to be made by Chriſt. And through Him, whatever Vertue the Legal <hi>Sacrifices</hi> had, the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Goſpel ſhall be much more Effectual. For even while the firſt Tabernacle was ſtanding, God had frequently profeſſed that the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the fat of Rams; that Incenſe and Oblations, and whatever he had commanded them to bring to his Altar, was nothing at all regarded by Him, in compariſon of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Mercy is the thing which ſhall principally regulate the Proceedings at the great day of Judgment, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned. When the Dead ſhall be raiſed, and all the innumerable Myriads that ever were born, ſhall ſtand before the dreadful Tribunal; then ſhall thoſe that have been relieved by the Merciful Man appear as ſo many Interceſſours for him: As if they ſhould ſay, Lord, This is the Man that refreſhed our Bowels when we were pinched with Hunger, that came in ſeaſonably to ſupport us when we were ready to periſh, that delivered us from the hand of our cruel Oppreſſour, that had pity on our Children, and gave them good Education when they were left poor diſtreſſed fatherleſs Infants.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide thoſe that have been forſaken, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the Covetous Miſer, ſhall look upon him as if they would thus implead him at that impartial Bar: Lord,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58703:13"/>
this is He that ſuffered us to languiſh, and pine away for want, when a very little of that he never made any uſe of would have rejoiced our Hearts; this is He that let us be expoſed to Cold and Nakedneſs, when the Moth conſumed his unneceſſary changes of Apparel: nay, this is He that has griped and oppreſſed us, that has made himſelf drunk with our Tears, that has wearied us out at Law, and born down our righteous Cauſe by Wealth and Power, and robbed us of the little that we had, by Violence and Injuſtice. Thus might they juſtly plead againſt him, if his own Conſcience did not prevent all other Accuſers, and paſs the firſt Sentence upon him, which ſhall be quickly followed by that of the great Judge, who ſhall render to every Man according to his Works. Then ſhall the Good and Merciful be taken up into the Regions of everlaſting Joy; but <hi>they ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, that have ſhewed no Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed what is that Charity that will make our Alms ſome way Profitable to our Salvation, but that without it they are not ſo in themſelves: and now laſtly, I have laid down ſome Reaſons that make them acceptable and advantageous, when they proceed from ſuch a Principle of true Charity; It is becauſe they nouriſh and preſerve that Principle; they are a Proof of our Love to God, and our Truſt and Dependance upon him, and they do particularly incline him to be merciful to Us.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of all that has been ſaid, is to excite you to Give, and to do it ſo, that it may tend to the real Benefit of him that Gives, as well as of him that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58703:14"/>
or in the Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſeek fruit that may redound to your account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe I ſhall lay before you what Expences have been lately made in this way, and what neceſſity there ſtill is of further Expence; what has been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and what yet remains to be done, that is fit Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Charitable Benevolence of this great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable City: And this I cannot do better, than by Reading to you,

                              <p>THE Hoſpital of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is of great Neceſſity for the keeping and curing diſtracted Perſons, whoſe Miſery, of all others, is the more deplorable, becauſe they do not apprehend the ſame, it diſabling the Mind, as well as the Body.</p>

                              <p>The Charge whereof is great, and the Revenue of the ſaid Hoſpital ſo ſmall, as not to amount to one half part of the Yearly Expences thereof; and the Building of the Old Hoſpital of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> being Ruinous and not Capacious to receive and contain the great Number of diſtracted Perſons; for the admiſſion of whom, daily Applications are made to the Governours thereof.</p>
                              <p>Upon a Chriſtian and charitable Conſideration of the Premiſſes, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Common-Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> did lately grant ſufficient Ground to Erect a more commodious Houſe for the keeping and curing the ſaid Lunaticks and diſtracted Perſons.

You ſee here how many indigent and calamitous Perſons of ſeveral ſorts, have been plentifully Relieved by the ſtanding Endowments, and occaſional Bounty of their pious Benefactors.</p>
            <p>How many poor helpleſs Orphans have been careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, liberally Educated, and put out to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58703:15"/>
honeſt Employments, to the great Credit and Advantage of the Publick!</p>
            <p>How many Thouſands of Sick and Wounded have been perfectly Cured, chiefly of thoſe that have bravely ventured their Lives for the Service of their King and Country, and to defend Us from the Fury of an enraged and Potent Enemy!</p>
            <p>How many Vagrants, whom pure Neceſſity, it may be, had driven from their Homes, have been imployed and furniſhed with Conveniencies, and returned to their reſpective Habitations, in a far more comfortable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than they left them!</p>
            <p>How many Lunatick and Diſtracted Creatures, the moſt pityable Objects of all, have been recovered, and are now able to Praiſe and Worſhip God again, with thoſe Senſes and Underſtandings which he at firſt gave them; and to which, by his Bleſſing upon your Endeavours, they have been happily reſtored!</p>
            <p>All theſe great, theſe truly generous and Chriſtian Things have been done. And what remains more to be done, but only that you would be pleaſed to take a due Care, as I know you will, that they may be tranſmitted down to Poſterity without interruption.</p>
            <p>The yearly Revenue of the ſeveral Foundations, tho' very conſiderable, is yet not any way anſwerable to the neceſſary Charge In ſome it ſcarce amounts to the Half. The reſt has beenhitherto, from time to time, conſtantly ſupplied by the voluntary Bounty of Eminent and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Citizens. And it muſt be acknowledged to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58703:16"/>
of this renowned Body, that very great acceſſions have been made in this way; but great as they have been, the Neceſſities of the Poor have been greater. Their Rents have been exceedingly leſſened by the dreadful Fire; and the Expence of Building has lain ſo very Heavy, that nothing but the Generoſity would have undertaken it; and nothing but the Wealth of ſucha City as this could have born it ſo long. But by theſemeans the Hoſpitals are become ſo far indebted, (notwthſtanding the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Management of thoſe that have the Care of them) that one of them in particular, that was wont to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about a Thouſand Orphans, or more, will not, as I am certainly informed, be able totake in one poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Child this enſuing Year, unleſs it receive ſome very unexpected and liberal Aſſiſtance. What pity 'tis, that thoſe Streams that have flowed ſo plentifully for ſo many Ages, ſhould be in danger of being dried up, or at leaſt, of receiving a ſtop in ours.</p>
            <p>But I cannot entertain any ſuch Fear, while you ſtill retain the ſame pious Inclinations of doing Good, which you have always expreſſed. I need not uſe any Arguments to urge you to it; I need not put you in mind of your worthy Anceſtors; I ſhall but deſire you to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate your ſelves; do but as you have been wont to do, and all other perſwaſions will be wholly ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>Some there be, that may be like enough to talk of the Charges of the War, the Decay of Trade, and their Loſſes at Sea, and make this the Pretence for their not Giving. But I know that your Charity will diſdain to make uſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58703:16"/>
of ſuch frivolous Excuſes. The more you have Loſt, the more you ſhould Give of what remains, that Providence may be engaged to preſerve the Reſt. I belive it is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs that many of the Members of it have ſhewn to ſuccour the diſtreſſed, that God has ſeemed to make this City a part of his peculiar Care; that the Fire has but built you more convenient and ſtately Houſes; that the War has ſerved but to whet your Induſtry and declare your Reſolution; and that notwithſtanding the many ſad and amazing Accidents that have befallen this Place within our own Memories, it ſtill continues, God be praiſed, in a proſperous and flouriſhing Condition; if we were but wiſe and grateful enough to know it.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould not make us Rich, Charity will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure us from Want. For Truth it ſelf has promiſed that, <hi>He that giveth to the poor ſhall not lack.</hi> And this is as much as any Man need to deſire. And it is a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance than the moſt plentiful Fortune is able to give us; for that we know may be preſently ſnatched away and leave us abſolute Beggars within leſs than an hour.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I inſiſt upon a Conſideration that has reſpect only to this World, when what we beſtow on the Poor, if it come from a hearty Charity, ſhall be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply rewarded in that which is to come. According to that of our Bleſſed Lord. <hi>Luke</hi> vix. 12, 13, 14. <hi>When thou makeſt a dinner or a ſupper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinſmen, nor thy rich neighbours;</hi> do not ſpend all thy Kindneſs upon theſe, <hi>leſt they alſo</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58703:17"/>
               <hi>bid thee thee again, and a recompence be made thee. But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;</hi> the proper Inhabitants of the Hoſpital: Be kind to them, <hi>and thou ſhalt be bleſſed; for they cannot recompence thee, for thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the juſt.</hi> When we place our Kindneſſes where we may reaſonably expect to have returns made us, God looks upon theſe but as mutual Civilities betwixt Man and Man, and it is enough if they be repaid in kind. But when we do good without any hopes or proſpect of ſecular Advantage; when we give to the Poor who we know are never able to requite us, this being done for his ſake, he is pleaſed to undertake the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he makes himſelf the Debtor, and will be ſure to ſee the Obligation ſatisfied to the utmoſt; and that not as the thing it ſelf does deſerve, but as becomes the Munificence of the Supreme Lord. He will give us Eternal for our Temporal Things, and whatever we have thus done upon Earth, he will Reward it in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <closer>Of which, God of his infinite Mercy make us all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</closer>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
