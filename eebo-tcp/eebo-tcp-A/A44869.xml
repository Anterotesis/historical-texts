            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> With ſome thankful Ejaculations to Heaven, for the Miraculous Eſcape of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> from the Hands of the <hi>Bloody Ruffians</hi>
            </head>
            <l>WHil'ſt with hot Scent, the <hi>Popiſh-Tory</hi> Crew</l>
            <l>A <hi>Presbiterian</hi> Sham-plot do purſue,</l>
            <l>Behold a New and true Plot of their own,</l>
            <l>Againſt a worthy perſons Life made known.</l>
            <l>Blood after blood for God's freſh Vengeance Calls,</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Monmouth's</hi> friend a ſecond Victim falls,</l>
            <l>The bloody Villains Skill'd ith' Murtherous ſin,</l>
            <l>Sr. <hi>Godfrys</hi> Murther new Act or'e ag'in:</l>
            <l>And now the ſhammers muſt together Plot,</l>
            <l>To make, the world think <hi>Thynn</hi> himſelf hath ſhot.</l>
            <l>What was his Crime that thus they fought his Life?</l>
            <l>Was it becauſe deceived by a wife?</l>
            <l>Or was't becauſe that he was <hi>Monmouth's</hi> friend,</l>
            <l>He found ſo fatal and ſo ſad an end?</l>
            <l>In former times ſuch Murthers Scarce were Known,</l>
            <l>Are we Barbarians or fierce <hi>Scythians</hi> grown?</l>
            <l>What Impious Acts are minted in our Age?</l>
            <l>What tragick ſceens are brought upon the ſtage?</l>
            <l>What e're the Heathen did we now can do,</l>
            <l>And tho we'are Chriſtians call'd Surpaſs them too.</l>
            <l>In the laſt end o'th' <hi>Iron</hi> Age we live,</l>
            <l>A Brother won't a Brother now forgive:</l>
            <l>But for ſome ſlight affront or weak offence,</l>
            <l>With Sword or Piſtol he is hurried hence.</l>
            <l>Theſe Murtherous Arts by <hi>Jeſuites</hi> hither brought,</l>
            <l>With their Religion they in ſecret taught:</l>
            <l>For Murthers they have their Commiſſion given,</l>
            <l>And Killing is one Gate that leads to Heaven</l>
            <l>We may believe it, as we do our Creed,</l>
            <l>None but ſome hired Papiſts did this deed.</l>
            <l>A deed ſo horrid barbarous and Vile,</l>
            <l>That it will leave a blot upon our Iſle,</l>
            <l>Which will a ſpot for our whole Age remain,</l>
            <l>Unleſs Strict Vengeance wipe away the ſtain,</l>
            <l>Th'Embaſſador whom we <hi>Barbarian</hi> call,</l>
            <l>When to his Barbarous Prince return he ſhall,</l>
            <l>Amongſt our Crimes with horror will relate,</l>
            <l>This Murther Acted neer the Palace Gate,</l>
            <l>And to his Prince Maliciouſly will ſay,</l>
            <l>Chriſtians can Murthers Act as well as they.</l>
            <l>Hard was the Fate of this moſt worthy Man,</l>
            <l>Whom firſt a wicked woman did Trepan.</l>
            <l>And now more hard, if that he loſt his Life,</l>
            <l>By Murtherous means of his diſloyal Wife.</l>
            <l>But God that ſees, and knowes the Hearts of all,</l>
            <l>Will ſoon on guilty Heads let Vengeance fall.</l>
            <l>And thoſe black Inſtruments now lay'd in hold,</l>
            <l>Shall all the Truth of this black Deed unfold.</l>
            <l>Where Juſtice Runs down like an unſtop'd Flood,</l>
            <l>It ſoon will waſh away the ſtains of Blood.</l>
            <l>The Murther'd's Friends therefore on Juſtice cry,</l>
            <l>And to its ſacred Throne together fly;</l>
            <l>That Vengeance may both great and ſmall purſue,</l>
            <l>O're take the Hirers and the hired too;</l>
            <l>Both thoſe who the damn'd hire for Blood receive,</l>
            <l>And thoſe who to be damn'd their money give:</l>
            <l>For if ſtrict Vengeance on ſuch be not ta'ne,</l>
            <l>Our Laws for Murther will be made in Vain;</l>
            <l>So impious and ſo vile now Men are grown,</l>
            <l>As never in our Age before was known;</l>
            <l>Who cann't but go or Ride the Streets in fear,</l>
            <l>When we have <hi>Bravo</hi>'s and <hi>Banditti</hi> here?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tories</hi> who here have ſhown their Murtherous Skill,</l>
            <l>And know the way as well as they to kill.</l>
            <l>Under our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth Men muſt wear Buff,</l>
            <l>A Coat of Mail, or Armor Piſtol-Proof;</l>
            <l>For fear of ſome revenge from Jilting drabs,</l>
            <l>Or elſe for Friendſhip or Religion ſtabs;</l>
            <l>Poiſon, or Bullet, fraud, or Force they take.</l>
            <l>Both for reveng and for Religion's ſake,</l>
            <l>Juſtice will Viſit vvhen the Murther's paſt,</l>
            <l>And overtake the Criminals at faſt.</l>
            <l>And ſuch black deeds ly open to God,s ſight,</l>
            <l>Who vvill the Murtherous Plots bring forth to light,</l>
            <l>Then vvorthy <hi>Thyn</hi> vve ſhall more ſurely knovv,</l>
            <l>Who vvas thy Barbarous Bloody ſecret foe,</l>
            <l>When to the Bottom of this Plot vve ſee,</l>
            <l>And if the Villains only aim'd at thee.</l>
            <l>Reſt novv thy ſoul in peace, vvhilſt our good King</l>
            <l>Your bloody Murtherers to Juſtice bring,</l>
            <l>Whilſt the Scar'd People on thy death debate,</l>
            <l>And all thy Friends bevvail thy ſudden Fate:</l>
            <l>Whilſt the good Duke bevvails vvith Tears his friend</l>
            <l>Afflicted to behold his ſudden end.</l>
            <l>But let all Loyal Hearts to Heaven pay,</l>
            <l>Their Thanks that <hi>Monmouth</hi> did no longer ſtay,</l>
            <l>That Providence vvho over him takes Care</l>
            <l>Had him diverted then from being there.</l>
            <l>Who Knovvs vvhat bloody Ruffians did intend,</l>
            <l>They might Perhaps have yet a further end,</l>
            <l>Revenge might reach both to the Duke and's friend,</l>
