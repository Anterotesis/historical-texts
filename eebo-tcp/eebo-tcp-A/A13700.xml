         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

called, <hi>The fourth Booke of

               <pb facs="tcp:7721:3"/>

<hi>De sacramento altaris,</hi> and

This I haue tearmed,

with the bookes of Kempisius
by mee heeretofore diuulged,
<hi>The fourth booke of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the dooing whereof, I
haue as little as might bee
varied fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auctors words
and phrazes, and no where
from the sense, but where
himselfe hath varied from
the truth of God, and, I doubt
not, would haue redressed, had
hee liued in these daies of
light, as he did in the time of
most palpable blindnes.</p>
            <p>And this haue I doon with
<pb facs="tcp:7721:3"/>
the greater alacritie, because
I finde (and thou maist reade
it also in the Auctors owne
Preface) that hee not onlie
doubted that hee might vtter
some things both fonde and
offensiue, but also wished to
haue some godlie corrector of
his faultes, and praied vnto
almightie God gratiouslie to
reueale, such thinges offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
either vnto himselfe, or
vnto some other.</p>
            <p>Whose godlie praier, God
hath heard, and discouered
those things for thy benefit,
and testification besides howe
Kempisius, the Auctor, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
liuing in a Popish time,
was yet in hart no Papist, but
would like well of that which
is doon, as I trust thou wilt,
whose aedifieng, and spirituall

            <p>And reaping this comfort

for my comfort
sake, certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
sentences, the better so
to commit them to memorie;
I haue also disposed them as
into a plesant orchard, set out
with all sorts of trees, and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with al varieties of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
flowres, where-into I might
now and then enter both for to
chuse and behold at my neede
such matter as my hart desires
for the refreshing of the minde,
grieued at anie time, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with pensiuenes.</p>
            <p>Now the more cleerlie, and
readilie to finde vnder which
arbor I might repose my selfe,
or which floure were best to be
culled out, I haue made the
<pb facs="tcp:7721:5"/>
heads of euery Chapter to glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as it were) with red titles.
I haue likewise with varietie of
words, as nowe talking, nowe
reasoning, praieng nowe, nowe
conferring, now in mine owne,
now in another mans person,
bewreathed about the text
with a sweete, and delightsome
stile.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I entreate them
whosoeuer shall reade it, first
that they be not moued with
indignation at that which the
writer hath doon, for it was his
minde wholie to talke (with his
God.) Next, that theie wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the stile, considering that
God is more delighted with
words that be simple and pure,
than with those that be artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.
And if happelie the sense
in anie place appeare either not
sounde, or not cleere enough,
<pb facs="tcp:7721:5"/>
my desire is to haue a godlie
corrector of the same, telling
him withall, that what fonde
matter soeuer he shall espie, it
hath escaped from me not of
purpose, but rather for that I
was not heedie enough in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what I writ.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, forasmuch as man
in that iudgement of his which
is most probable, maie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
vnto thee, ô God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,

doo I thine humble disciple
make recourse, and this Sole-talke
(of mine) doo present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the shortnes of my
daies. So long as I am
in this world, I am wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 14, 4</note>:
and while I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
vpon the earth, I am poore, a
stranger, and a pilgrime<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 11, 13</note>.</p>
            <p>I brought nothing into the world<note n="c" place="margin">1. Tim. 6, 7</note>,
and certaine it is I can carrie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thereout: for naked came I
out of my mothers wombe<note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 1, 21</note>, and
naked shall I returne thether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>As a shadow which passeth awaie;
and as a fether, which is tossed vp
and downe with the winde; and as
a ghest of one night, so suddenlie
shall I passe awaie.</p>
            <p>All the time wee haue heere to
liue, is but as the shortest night.
Fewe and euill are my daies<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 47, 9</note>, and
after a little while they shall ende,
and bee as though they had neuer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7721:21"/>
been.</p>
            <p>And when man is dead, what is in
man but filthines? Who will haue
anie care of a stinking carkas? Or
who will enquire of the absent being
dead, whereas beeing aliue hee was
accounted of?</p>
            <p>A small while is man remembred
either of his freends, or of strangers:
but vndoubtedlie the righteous
shall be had in euerlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 112, 6</note>,
because hee shall be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinglie
linked to God, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the same, and shall neuer
die<note n="g" place="margin">Ps. 102, 27</note>.</p>
            <p>Therefore happie is hee which
putteth no trust in man; nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioiceth
in anie worldlie thing, but
hath his hart fixed in heauen<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 2, 12</note>, for

            <p>O miserable and wretched life!
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7721:22"/>
ô fraile, and lamentable life, which
good men doo suffer rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
and wicked men, albe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it, yet can they not long enioie
the same!</p>
            <p>Oah, vanitie of this world, when
wilt thou haue an ende? when wilt
thou cesse?</p>
            <p>Yet the time will come, when all
the elect shall be set free from the
bondage of corruption<note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 8, 22 23</note>, though
now they doo lament, because they
are estranged from the kingdome of
Christ<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 1, 23</note>.</p>
            <p>Would to God, the whole world
would euen wither vp in mine hart;
and my Lord God, euen mine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall

            <p>Vndoubtedlie, the fleeting ioie of
this present life, is but a false and a
most bitter potion. Let them drinke
thereof that list, for afterward they
shall feele a most bitter flixe. And
the more one hath drunke thereof,
the sharper shall his torments bee,
because the whole pleasure of this
world shall more speedelie passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie

            <p>Therefore out of my sight thou

deceiptfull glorie of the world, and
all foolish pleasure of the flesh.</p>
            <p>Manie you doo drawe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue:
but in the ende you leaue and

            <p>Woe to them which beleeue thee;
woe to them which be there drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>But come, and come nigh mee,
most holie humilitie; and the full
renouncing of all worldlie pompes;
and neuer doo thou leaue mee, ô

how iustlie maie I lament, when I
thinke vpon my pilgrimage<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 11, 13</note>, and
how little I am priuie how I shall
ende the same!</p>
            <p>If I liue well, and continue so,
there is no cause whie I should feare
an euill death. But who can glorie
of a good life, and of a pure consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Hee which knoweth himselfe
to be such a one, let him reioice in
the Lord<note n="t" place="margin">1. Cor. 1, 31</note>, and take compassion vpon
mee a sinner.</p>
            <p>To liue I haue no desire<note n="u" place="margin">Phil. 1, 23</note>, because
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7721:23"/>

               <p>Long doo I thinke this life; and

               </hi> Lord, thou art mine
hope euen fro my youth<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 71, 5</note>.</p>
            <p>In this hope I flie
vnto thee, vntill the
last houre and time of
my resolution shall come.</p>
            <p>Oah that I were so well prepared,
that I might euen now die vnder the
hope of grace!</p>
            <p>Oah that I had ended this life
with an happie departure; and laide
off the loade of this bodie<note n="b" place="margin">Wisd. 9, 15</note>; how
manie dangers and feares had I then
escaped!</p>
            <p>Happie is the man whome thou
hast chosen, and taken vp, who is
now gone out of this world vnto the

thee her Lord!</p>
            <p>But, alas that my contrie is so
long kept fro mee<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 120, 5</note>!</p>
            <p>How gratiouslie and mercifullie
shouldest thou deale with mee, if
quicklie I were called awaie, and
bidden to come vnto thee, that
where thou art, I might be also!</p>
            <p>Oah that I had bin taken out of
this world, before euer I had knowen
the filthines of the same, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was affraide to offend euen
in small things; how happie then
had I bin! But now the longer heere
I liue, the more I wander from thee,
and doo sinne in too too manie
things.</p>
            <p>Wo is mee, what haue I doone?
Alas, I haue folowed the desires of
the flesh, and haue drawen vanitie
to my selfe with roapes, but godlines
I haue abandoned, abhorred inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and added sinne vnto sinne,
so that now to my griefe I finde that
true which I haue sometime read<note n="m" place="margin">Isai. 3, 11</note>,
<hi>Woe be to the wicked, it shall be euill with
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Too too late almost I haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto my God, yea verie late it
was eare I began to amend, and then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7721:29"/>
too but slowlie went I on; I was not
zealous enough in my proceeding,
I did not encrease in zeale, but, which
is woorser, I waxed cooler and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
            <p>Hence it was that manie times I
was verie loath to die, because my
guiltie conscience still tolde mee
I had not liued as I should haue
doone.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, in considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the dangerous temptations
(wherevnto I am subiect) and that
my sinnes might not encrease, manie
a time haue I wished for death; and
into these woordes haue I burst, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng:</p>
            <p>Oah that now God in mercie would
take mee out of this world, that I
might sinne no more vpon earth!
Oh that God speedelie would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to take mee awaie, and make an
ende of my labors; in what an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
state should I then bee!</p>
            <p>But, Lord, all things must bee
euen as thou wilt. If thou minde to
doo that which I require, it shall
forth-with bee accomplished: but if
otherwise, thy will bee doon.</p>
            <p>I maie vtter out my desire, and
the miserie which I endure, not as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7721:29"/>
to him which is ignorant thereof,
but that thereby I may finde some
comfort to my soule.</p>
            <p>I knowe I am not yet readie as I
ought to bee, for my conscience is
greatlie out of quiet.</p>
            <p>And what maruell though I, a
sinner, doo stand in feare, seeing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
euen of the holie fathers were
affraide, because thou iudgest not
as man dooth<note n="n" place="margin">1. Sam. 16, 7 Iohn. 8, 15 16</note>.</p>
            <p>But how shall I prepare my selfe?
It were good for mee to prepare my
selfe against that time, which may
come this daie before to morow for
anie thing I knowe.</p>
            <p>Therefore I will more firmelie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my purpose; I will bewaile all my
negligences passed; I will sacrifice
my selfe to thee; and wholie and
henceforth commend my selfe vnto
thy mercie, ô Lord.</p>
            <p>O Lord, my God, all my works doo
stand at thy mercie<note n="o" place="margin">Ephes. 1, 6 7</note>; and without
thy mercie I haue no merits. And
this is mine hope, this is all my
trust.</p>
            <p>But how fareth it with a good and
pure conscience? What saith the
chaste, and deuoute soule? Come,
saith she, Lord Iesus<note n="p" place="margin">Reu. 22, 20</note>, ô come, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7721:30"/>
tarie not; vntie my sinnes, loase my
fetters, bring me out of prison, out of
the lake of miserie, and mirie claie<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 40, 2 1</note>.</p>
            <p>I haue waited patientlie for thee,
ô Lord, incline to mee, and heare my
crie. Leaue mee not anie longer in
this wicked world.</p>
            <p>Let it content thee that hetherto
I haue striuen, that so long I haue
bin in exile; that I haue not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to enioie thee, nor to see thee
face to face<note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 13, verse 12 Reuel. 21, 4</note>.</p>
            <p>Grant mee to enioie the long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
ioie, which no time shall ende,
nor troubles ouershadowe.</p>
            <p>Show mee thy countenance, which
the angels continuallie do behold<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 18, 10</note>.</p>
            <p>Let thy voice bee heard in mine
eares, which they without cessing
doo heare.</p>
            <p>Come Lord Iesu, and take mee
out of this forreine contrie; call mee
wretch home vnto my contrie<note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 11, 10 13</note>, and

            <p>Come gratious Redeemer<note n="u" place="margin">Matt. 1, 21</note>, make
mee partaker of thine eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>It is hie time that I returne vnto
thee; it is now time that I commend
my bodie to the earth, whereout it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7721:30"/>

            <p>The matter is not great where the

if so be the soule be safe, and come
vnto thee.</p>
            <p>Let my spirit doo well, which I
commend into thine hands; and let
my flesh rest in hope to be raised vp
againe in the last daie<note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 15, verse 51 52 53</note>. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

            <p>Remooue mee from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

            <p>Oah, let not the olde serpent<note n="z" place="margin">Reue. 12, 9</note>

Satan with his ouglie sight terrefie,

            <p>These things hee thinketh with
himselfe, and is astonished at that
good thing which passeth all sense,
and gifts. Yea still hee wandereth,
and enquireth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, what thing

            <p>This word now, saith hee, is from

I haue all things from him.</p>
            <p>Furthermore (this spirituall man)
hee woondereth, and lamenteth that
hee so lightlie esteemeth so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a good thing, by the which hee
is not a little blessed; and whie also
he dooth not oftener bend his heart
to heare and to see that, than the
which nothing is more sweete, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7721:34"/>
blessed to be desired.</p>
            <p>And would to God hence-forth
I might thus doo! For this excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie
dooth delight mee, and more
will delight mee, the more I giue
my selfe vnto these meditations.</p>
            <p>Oah that my beloued would come
into mine heart, that I might taste
the sweetnes of his apples!</p>
            <p>Oah that hee would decline vnto
mee, and showe himselfe to mee, and
mee to himselfe! Hee is my felicitie,
and mine onlie delight.</p>
            <p>Now begin I to couet, and desire,
and greatlie to loue this good thing,
in whome all good things are<note n="u" place="margin">Act. 17, 28</note>; this
ioie, in whome is all ioie; this one

created, but without all conceipt of

all the good things which hee hath
formed<note n="x" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 8 17</note>.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that now and then I
would thoroughlie bee replenished
with this good thing, and filled with
that so heauenlie ioie, and I couet
after a sort euen to be swallowed vp

mine insatiable desire might once be

loue, his sweetenes, and the ioiefull

and sigheth for aboue all things else.
And therefore he cannot be proude,
nor boast of anie thing.</p>
            <p>(God) hee is his glorie, his praise,

            <p>For this is his desire and praier,
that God would reueale himselfe to

            <p>All the godlie from the worlds

            <p>Theie haue knowen thee in their

knewe no God. Theie obserued the

            <p>Theie folowed not the foolish i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations

            <p>This when theie heard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
theie cast the eies of their
faith a far off, beleeuing that God
will saue vs; and that he which shall

            <p>Knowing these things afore hand

maruelouslie astonished, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

fainted. But afterward comming by

ioie beholding the power of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching,
theie said, Hee is, euen hee
is the Lord our God, and wee haue
none other. Hee hath taken vs, and
hee will saue vs. Hee cannot denie

consider his waies.</p>
            <p>Returne you and come vnto him,
so will he ioiefullie receaue you into

mercifull<note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 34, 6 Ionas. 4, 2</note>.</p>
            <p>He keepeth not his anger as man
dooth<note n="c" place="margin">Hos. 11, 9</note>, but pardoneth all sinnes, yea

            <p>Onlie returne you with all your

Thus doo the sancts speake in mine

            <p>That which musick is at a banquet,
and sweete smelling frankincense in
a censar: euen that is the word of
God in a pure hart.</p>
            <p>And thy sancts, Lord, filled with
thy spirit, haue thus sounded forth
the memorie of thine abundant
sweetenes; and haue lest their words
vnto vs to be sounded abroade.</p>
            <p>But my speech often-time is stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
so that it hath no passage to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.
But if that fire come from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
then shal my toong be hot: and
if it once be enflamed, I shall forth-with
be consumed.</p>
            <p>I shall not be able to stand in the
presence thereof; for as the winde
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7721:45"/>
driueth awaie chaffe, so shall sorow
be expelled from the hart. And as
the rust by the fire: so shal my sinnes
be consumed.</p>
            <p>The fire of God which consumeth
all things, shall sweep the floore of
mans hart. Descende, and get vp;
tuch me a little, and I shall flee.</p>
            <p>Things passed shall be as though
theie had neuer been, and that to
come shall not be accompted of: for
all sinnes shall vtterlie be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Old things shall passe awaie, new

            <p>Feare shall depart, loue shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse

            <p>Therefore that which I saie is not

            <p>The pensiue hath comfort; the

one thing is not of manie things.</p>
            <p>Cesse to seeke manie things, ioine
thee to one, stick vnto one: for in
one thing all things consist.</p>
            <p>Let others enquire after manifold
and diuers outward things: but doo
thou seeke one inward good thing,
and it is sufficient.</p>
            <p>Lo, this man seeketh a farme<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 22, 5 Luke. 14, 18</note>;
that man traueleth about his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise;

a kingdome: and thus one
wisheth one thing, another man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

spirituall sort, as among the secular.
But fewe doo seeke one thing, and
(other things) purelie and simplie
for one thing. And therefore theie
neither doo finde anie sure peace;
nor yet sauor the inward grace of the
spirit.</p>
            <p>For so manie as are (the seruants)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7721:47"/>

thou canst not.</p>
            <p>For my part, I detest all these
things: for my good thing is but one

but one thing; and this one thing is
better to mee than all other things
either in heauen or earth.</p>
            <p>If thou hast founde such a good

This is the testimonie of the

bridegroome, and the spouse: and it
is a verie fit, and a strong testimonie
of the holie lawe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next is like to this</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 17, 21</note>: I will

            <p>Behold the notable testimonies
of two bookes, whereby it plainelie
appeareth, that the soule, through
speciall grace from aboue, maie bee
linked familiarlie vnto God.</p>
            <p>And although it rarelie come so
to passe: yet is it deerelie to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
of, and not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
to the louer. And againe,
though verie hardlie: yet may it fall
out.</p>
            <p>The soule therefore so conioined
to God, let no man dare to separat,
or to trooble.</p>
            <p>If thou doost woonder at this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous

            <p>If thou lookest for merits, you

shall finde it is his good pleasure to
haue it so.</p>
            <p>O sweete societie with Christ, and
vnder the wings of Christ!</p>
            <p>O gratious coniunction, full of
loue, and sweetenes of the holie
Ghoste, the which is perceaued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than vttered!</p>
            <p>These things belong vnto the soule
that is estranged from all worldlie
matters, and is not delighted with
this present life: but is carried aloft
in godlie meditation.</p>
            <p>The more the louer knoweth this,
the more am I ignorant. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
gladlie would I bee in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
when the deuout soule is in
such an happie case.</p>
            <p>And then is she so, when the spouse
and she is together at the noone daie.
But then it fareth ill with her, and
that verie ill too, if it happen that
Iesus bee awaie; if the perfumes of
grace run not from aboue; if no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
she take in the holie Bible; if it
bee irksome for her to continue in
praier and godlie meditation; if the
cloudes of the hart be so thick, and
hurtfull cogitations doo so preuaile,
that theie cannot be restrained, but
do labor to ouerwhelme in a manner
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7721:54"/>
all the former good things.</p>
            <p>O Lord God, whie doost thou so?
What plaie is this? O blessed Iesus,
what meane you heereby?</p>
            <p>If it were not offensiue to thine
honor, I could wish to haue farther
communication betweene thee, and
thy beloued.</p>
            <p>Forsomuch as she is so greatlie
desirous of thy gratious presence,
whereby she may be nourished with
chaste delightes, I doo much muse
whie sometime you suffer her to fit
so desolate. Thou passest by, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy waie, as though she had no
desire vnto thee. But she is alone all
pensiue. For thus she saith in effect<note n="i" place="margin">Isai. 26, 9</note>,
<hi>With my soule haue I desired thee in the
night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is night with her, when thou,
the true light, art not present. So
that she praieth for thy presence,
that the darkenes of sinne compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
her not. For she feeleth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
discommodities when thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
visitation is taken from her.
For, had she not suffered somewhat,
she had neuer so earnestlie cried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee.</p>
            <p>Another also, which was before
said, cried thus<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 63, 8</note>, <hi>My soule cleaueth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7721:54"/>
vnto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I thinke no trouble is or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
so troublesome to her, as the
want of thy presence.</p>
            <p>And no maruell, if through this
want the waieward soule doo lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
awaie in sorow. For thou art
verie hardlie found at anie time, and
being found, she reioiceth at thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
hoping to spend the daie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie
with thee: but thinking little
of thy departure, she suspecteth no
aduersitie to come. But, handling
another matter secretlie, thou often
takest thy flight.</p>
            <p>For thou departest suddenlie out
of her hands, when she cannot laie
holde vpon thee.</p>
            <p>I doo praise thee, but in this how
shall I praise thee? If thou hast anie
praise and sweetenes, whie doo you
seeme to forgoe it in this deed?</p>
            <p>If thou wert not, she might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
But she can take none of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
at thee, who so mightelie doost
loue her.</p>
            <p>If therefore anie good reason be
signified vnder that lesson, ô God
showe it mee.</p>
            <p>For gladlie would I vnderstand the
same: neither do I thinke it vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7721:55"/>
to learne though it be but little.</p>
            <p>Because no man of himselfe can
behold thy secret iudgements: but
it is thy light which dooth both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
darke, and driue awaie hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things.</p>
            <p>What therefore may the cause be
that sometime so secretlie you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
your selfe from the soule, she
not witting thereof?</p>
            <p>Doo you loue her, or no? If you
doo loue her, then whie do you leaue
her, my beloued? If you loue her not,
whie then haue you visited her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time? Againe, if you loue her
not, whie doo you make returne,
whie knock you at the doore, whie
enter you in againe? What, is it of
lightnes that you doo so both go and
returne? God forbid.</p>
            <p>But so often change dooth not a
little greeue her; yea much it dooth
disquiet her. Yet the griefe would be
the lesser, if thou wouldest saie plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 14, 28</note>,
<hi>I doo goe, and will come vnto you;

               <note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 16, 22</note>.</p>
            <p>But now you cast out neuer a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word;
onlie she thinketh vpon that
speech, which she well perceaueth to
be performed in her selfe, how Iesus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7721:55"/>
hid himselfe, and went out of the
Temple<note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 8, 59</note>.</p>
            <p>A fewe things I haue against you,
but my complaint dooth spring out
of a good roote. I humblie request to
be instructed, I loue not to contend.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
make answere I beseech you.</p>
            <p>Also let the godlie soule saie for
her selfe somewhat for her learning.</p>
            <p>Likewise make you answere bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
when your part requireth.</p>
            <p>O my soule, answere thou thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
boldlie. For thy freend will pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientlie
heare, and meete thee with
milde words, that you maie suffer
none hinderance.</p>
            <p>For if hee bee not thy comforter,
who will comfort thee? And who
more fauorablie will beare thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
than hee which beareth all
things, and yet is not burdened?
And to whome more safelie can you
reueale your miserie, than to him
which perfectlie knoweth all things?
<note n="o" place="margin">Ecclus. 23 verse 19</note> Or in whome maie you put more
confidence, than in the truth which
deceaueth not<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn. 6, 14</note>?</p>
            <p>Now, if anie stranger, or one that
is not a freend to the spouse, shall
heare these things, let him be driuen
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7721:56"/>
from the doores. But if hee loue the
spouse, if he be faithfull, if deuoute
and spirituall, let him haue free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.</p>
            <p>If hee bee a keeper of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
a louer of virtue and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
if hee bee pure in hart<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 5, 3</note>, and
cleere in iudgement; if humble in
himselfe, and good towards others;
if he can neither wickedlie carpe at,
vanelie extoll, rashlie reprooue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudentlie
maintane, nor proudlie
commend things; but contrariwise
if he haue learned both, the things
which hee conceaueth not, to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and also rightlie to interpret
obscure and mysticall matters, let
him haue entrance, and heare the
communication. For the affection of
the hart through the sound of words
ought to be noted rather than the
qualitie of voices.</p>
            <p>And therefore tell me, ô soule, how
doost thou feele thy selfe wanting
now the grace of thy beloued? I for
my part doo see that hardlie I can
take it well, if he keepe himselfe long
awaie: and I conceiue the like of you.</p>
            <p>If you thinke good let vs sit heere
together, and confer we heereof to
our comfort.</p>

               <p>By the lack, I haue now learned

a freend showeth, what his presence
did good.</p>

but I did no whit consider of his
speedie departure.</p>
               <p>He came skipping vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
hee was ioiefull and iocund
in the porches of mine house. And
straight-waie I locked the doores of

               <p>I had either little or no care at all
of anie thing that might delight me;
for I was rauished with loue of him,
and whatsoeuer was not my beloued,
I loathed as altogether vnsauerie.
But he being taken awaie, I am in a

               <p>For my soule depended vpon his
grace, because I had none other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

was sufficient to the making of true

               <p>As I would, so was he; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he enioined mee, I tooke it in

            <p>What meane you? What muse you

            <p>Of all freendship, I beseech you,
ô deere and beloued soule to Christ,
conceale none of these things which
I am to demaund of you.</p>
            <p>You maie so doo me a pleasure, in

            <p>By your talke. I shall be able to

was pensiue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:7721:60"/>
For I haue seene you sometime
merie, and sometime sad, and by and
by glad againe, and by you I did
somewhat consider of my selfe.</p>
            <p>But I suppose the chiefest cause of
this your alteration is that returning
and departure of the beloued. The

how you haue run ouer manie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <p>According to your desire, I will
bend my selfe somewhat to vnfolde
the things which I feele within mee,
both when I am with my freend, and
also when I am alone, looking for
him whome I so doo loue.</p>
               <p>This first vnderstand, I reape not
so much ioie and pleasure by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
but I finde as much sorow and
bitternes through his absence.</p>
               <p>But whie it pleaseth him so to
come and go, rather I had he should
declare than I.</p>
               <p>But you shall heare it when I haue
finished the words of my song, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in the ende we will bring him
in vnto vs, and sitting among vs, hee
shall teach vs his order, the which he
vseth to show vnto such as desire his
presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:7721:60"/>
In the meane while giue attentiue
eare vnto mee, and be not offended
at mine homelie speech.</p>
               <p>For wee are now come together
to stir vp our harts, and either to
weep together, or through loue to
reioice together.</p>
               <p>For wo vnto him that is alone<note n="b" place="margin">Eccles. 4, verse 10</note>,
because when hee falleth into some
sorow or tentation, there is not a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to lift him vp. And if to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
theie will comfort one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
while one being sad, the other
ministreth ioie; or if he refuse to be
comforted, he shall be pittied forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and griefe will be taken for his
griefe; and so it will fall out that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theie will both be glad, or both
sad together. And although some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
doo yet still continue for some
aduersitie, or matter of sorowe: yet
the more patientlie theie beare it,
because their harts be so linked, that
nothing can change or alter their
mindes.</p>
               <p>Now, who seeing this faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

               </p>
               <p>And therefore I can the more

boldlie tel you what I thinke, because
I dread no deceipt, or subtiltie in

               <p>Lo, this all sweete spouse, and best
beloued frend, our Lord Iesus Christ,
the louer of holie soules<note n="d" place="margin">Wisd. 11, 23</note>, euen of
pure loue, not able otherwise to doo,
allured mee vnto him; and when I
was not, he gaue me life<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 17, 22</note>, wisedome,
and power to behold this common
light.</p>
               <p>Hee gaue mee grace to be borne
anewe by Baptisme, and adorned
mee with the roabe of his pretious
merits.</p>
               <p>Ouer and besides, when afterward
I had foulie bespotted my selfe with
sinne, and was far vnfit to loue him,
he cast not his eie vpon my filthines,
but vpon the side of his mercies.</p>
               <p>For when as yet I wandered out
of the waie, hee reclamed mee of his
goodnes<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8, 30</note>, not suffering mee to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in this wicked world.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he hath prouided mee
a place to rest in so long as I liue in
this mortall bodie.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, this dwelling
vnder the shadow of the beloued is
not the true rest, nor the rest which
shall for euer continue: but that is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7721:61"/>
the true rest, which wee shall feele
after the labors of this present life<note n="g" place="margin">Reue. 21, 4</note>.</p>
               <p>Yet for the soule to perceaue her
selfe to be vnburdened of worldlie
cares, and there to rest where she
maie the more fullie serue her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and attend vpon him in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
chamber of silence, it is a kinde
of comfort.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, my freend hath not
left, but assisted mee in my diuers
troubles, and sorest tentations.</p>
               <p>Also, he hath both instructed mee
oftentimes with profitable sermons,
and confirmed mee in his word.</p>
               <p>And as yoong plants are woont to
be watred with showers: so he hath
watered me with inward comfort,
that the virtue newlie implanted
within me maie not wither.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L.</speaker>
               <p>And he said to me, If thou hast a

               <p>If thou wilt choose me, and loue
me aboue all things, all things that
you aske, my father will giue you:
but if you forgoe me, then shalt thou
come to destruction, for my wrath
shall bee incensed against thee; if
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7721:62"/>
thou seeke after another, he shal not
please thee long, but thou wilt loath
and abhor him. Because I am the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.</speaker>
               <p>So I turned mee vnto him which
had doon me good, and expelling my
selfe from out the dust of earthlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
I decreed in mine hart from
thenceforth to serue him onlie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I found nothing better than
him, nor could imagine no couenant
more profitable.</p>
               <p>Let others iet, and seeke what
freendship theie will else-where, I am
thoroughlie perswaded this is the
true man of the soule, for whose sake
me thinks I could gladlie forsake
this world, to enioie his loue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinglie.</p>
               <p>And therefore I stuck vnto him,
for he liked me still; neither could I
finde a better freend.</p>
               <p>For my soule alwaie hath excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie
desired such a one, as is the
greatest, for power, the best for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the woorthiest for dignitie, and
the most happie for all good things.</p>
               <p>And because he is verie curteous,
he gaue me comfortable woords,
warelie fore-seeing that theie should
neither terrefie, nor breake mee
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7721:62"/>
through ouer-much roughnes, but
rather enioine and teach mee that
which should bee both light, and
sweete to be borne, that so my yoong
affection might the better be drawen
on, and the more forceablie addicted
to the freend beloued, and shrinke
not back.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>She shall the better, said he, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and profit, if not by force,
but through gentlenes she be prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
forward. She wil the more easilie
receaue my yoake, rather by loue
with rewards, than by feare with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
And if she neede impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
let it wiselie be vsed, that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
doo not ouerthrowe her.</p>
               <p>For he knew right well what was
best for a yoong plant, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
this his kindnes would bring vnto
mee, especiallie at the time of triall,
when I should easelie call into my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the good things which
at the first he did vnto my soule, and
thereby take courage to proceede in
the battell.</p>
               <p>He would not straight-waie open
vnto me, what and how much trooble
I was to endure in his seruice; but
sometime hee tempered aduersitie
with prosperitie, well considering my
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7721:63"/>
weakenes at the first, vntill through
experience I had gotten strength to
endure affliction.</p>
               <p>After all this he carried me about,
enstructed, and boare me vpon his
shoulders.</p>
               <p>Hee conducted me ouer the holie
Scripture, and with the heate of his
holie Spirit he armed me against the
wicked tentations of Satan.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he placed before mine
eies examples of all the virtues,
namelie, the holie Patriarches, and
Prophets, besides the glorious lights
of the new Testament.</p>
               <p>Euen as a Mother teacheth her
litle childe, so hee instructed mee,
breaking spirituall shales, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the carnels into my iawes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
theie were sweete to be eaten.</p>
               <p>Search if you can what theie sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
and where such maie be found.</p>
               <p>Open the apostolicall booke, reade
aduisedlie, and see if you are able to
comprehend so great mysteries.</p>
               <p>Peruse the Prophet Isaiah; looke
into the Gospell, the light of all
lights, and marke if theie doo not
yeeld most plesant notes of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>In them whatsoeuer you finde
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7721:63"/>
which is obscure, and hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that is a nut in a shel.</p>
               <p>But if you heare it expounded, and
vnderstand that which afore you did
not, then broken is the shel, and the

other darke sentences. Whereby you
maie behold so manie nuts, as you
see hidden sentences.</p>
               <p>And how, thinke you, did he beare
me on his shoulders? That he did so
often as he beheld mine infirmitie,
and yet neither cast me off, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
me, but patientlie and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
did beare with me<note n="k" place="margin">2. Pet. 3, 9</note>.</p>
               <p>Againe, he did beare me on his
shoulders, when he made other men
to beare with mine infirmities, and
whatsoeuer was blameworthie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mee.</p>
               <p>Besides, yet more louinglie he did
beare me on his shoulders when he
bare his crosse vnto the place, called
the place of dead mens sculs<note n="l" place="margin">Ioh. 19, 17 18, &amp;c.</note>, where
hee was crucified. For then was I a
more heauie burden vnto him, than
the crosse was. And my sins were
more grieuous to his bones<note n="m" place="margin">1. Pet. 2, 24</note>, than
this wood of the crosse to his back.
Because for my sake that crosse was
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7721:64"/>
carried<note n="n" place="margin">Isai. 53, 5 6</note>, not for his owne sake.</p>
               <p>Oah, how is hee aboue all things
to be loued, and to be worshipped, by
whose grace and merits I am thus
both found out<note n="o" place="margin">Luke. 15, 4 5, &amp;c.</note>, and redeemed<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 3, 13</note>.
And therefore he shall be as deere to
me, as the child is to his mother.</p>
               <p>But well I knowe, that I am far vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete
to loue him. Notwithstanding
my boldnes commeth from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Neither could I doo otherwise
but run vnto his most freendlie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements,
when hee showed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
so kinde vnto mee.</p>
               <p>I doo well remember what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Dauid in a certaine place doth
saie<note n="q" place="margin">1. Sam. 18, verse 18</note>:</p>
               <p>What am I? and what is my life, or the
familie of my father in Israel, that I should
be sonne in lawe to the King?</p>
               <p>But our affinitie together is much
more excellent, than this of Dauid
and Saul. Because ours is a pure and
syncere kinred, not with flesh and
blood, but betweene God himselfe,
betweene faith vnuiolated, and a
good conscience.</p>
               <p>Of this, did that Disciple whome
Iesus loued, speake on this wise<note n="r" place="margin">1. Iohn. 4, 4</note>:</p>
               <p>Greater is hee that is in you, than hee
that is in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:7721:64"/>
For God is loue<note n="s" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4, 16</note>, and loue brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth this kinred.</p>
               <p>Therefore sith Dauid thought
himselfe far vnmeet to be sonne in
lawe vnto an earthlie King: much
more abashed ought I to be, to enter
into alliance with the King of all
Kings, that vouchsafeth to allure me,
vile wretch, into his freendship.</p>
               <p>So that he hath delt with mee, not
according to my deserts, but euen as
it seemed good in his mercifull eies.</p>
               <p>Oah blessed, and happie art thou,
soule, now thou art fast bound with
the chaine of the heauenlie loue!</p>
               <p>Oah how noble, and free art thou,
seeing thou art priuie euen to the

and comfort vnto mee, that I stil doo
behold the light of faith; that with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7721:66"/>
all submission I seeke the fauor of
my beloued; that I beare toward him
a constant hope; that I will not bee
separated from his loue<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8, 35</note>; and that
I doo rest vpon his prouidence, and
vnsearchable goodnes, more than
vpon my selfe.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though too too often
I doo stagger, yea and fall too some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
into sinne: yet am I not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speire,
but rather continuallie to flie
vnto him, and to crie:</p>
            <p>O Lord my God, haue mercie
vpon mee, and suffer mee not to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
through my manifold tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but assist mee faithfullie, that
valiantlie I maie resist, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>Reach out thy right hand vnto
the worke of thine owne hands<note n="l" place="margin">Iob. 14, 15 Psalm. 95, 7</note>, oah
thou which triest mee by Satan, and
settest mee oftentimes on thy left
hand.</p>
            <p>And if anie such tentation shall
come, as will staie mee from crieng
vnto the Lord, then will I sigh from
the bottom of mine hart. For hee
knoweth euen the verie secrets of
the hart<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 7, 9</note>, and is priuie to the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the spirit<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8, 26 27</note>. It is not his will
that anie one euen of the least should
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7721:67"/>
perish<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 18, 14</note>.</p>
            <p>Oah, how great was his goodnes
to mee-ward, in that it pleased him
to be present with me in my trooble,
when I did not knowe, nor could
marke so much! For often hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
me from beeing vtterlie giuen
ouer vnto my wicked affections.</p>
            <p>Through his secret iudgement it
came to passe now and then, that I
fell, and was foiled euen in trifles,
that I might not waxe proude<note n="p" place="margin">Psa. 119, 73</note>, and
be high minded for great things, but
learne through humiliation, how I
was nothing euen then when I see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to stand vpright, and to florish<note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 4, 7</note>.</p>
            <p>And therefore I wish you not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-rashlie,
or quicklie to commend
mee, though I seeme to prosper in
your sight, but reserue all praise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the good daie of my death, yea
rather praise the Lord, and not mee.</p>
            <p>Giue the glorie vnto God on
high<note n="r" place="margin">Luke. 2, 14</note>, which assisted mee in all my
tentations.</p>
            <p>For hee deliuered mee of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
manie a time, when I was taken
of mine enemies.</p>
            <p>Also, when theie came as a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
to destroie mee, hee sent out
his arrowes, and scattered them<note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 18, 14</note>,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7721:67"/>
and he encreased lightnings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled
them, so that theie left me for
a time. Because he would not haue
mee to be without that, which from
time to time he hath acquainted his
sancts withall<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 14, 22 Psal. 34, 19</note>.</p>
            <p>So that I had afterward a little
quietnes, and peace by the meanes
of my freend.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, I did betake mee not
vnto bodelie, or worldlie, but vnto
spirituall ease, beholding the earth
a far off, and casting my thoughtes
vpon the secrets of heauen<note n="u" place="margin">Colos. 3, 1 2</note>.</p>
            <p>I gaue diligence to see what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of person I am, and how I might
best please him, which had reuealed
vnto me so manie tokens of loue, far
beyond all deserts of mine.</p>
            <p>And so much as in mee laie, I wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
continuallie for this ioiefull
peace, the better to cleaue vnto him,
and to serue him the more freelie.</p>
            <p>But manie times the soule hath
not her desire. But sometime it is
granted, sometime vpon good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
it is differred.</p>
            <p>For who would not wish still to
rest vnder the shade of the beloued,
if it might be granted him, and if
time and place were conuenient?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7721:68"/>
But now my freend worketh with
mee againe.</p>
            <p>I feele not affliction alwaie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet doo I enioie continuall rest,
but by an euening and morning a
daie is made.</p>
            <p>For this mortall life is spent in
comming and going both through
prosperitie and aduersitie<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 14, 22</note>.</p>
            <p>This was in the mind of that sanct
which said<note n="y" place="margin">Iob. 7, 18</note>:</p>
            <p>Thou doost visit him in the morning,
and triest him euerie moment.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, it seemeth a
kinde of rest, if the enimie doo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too often, nor too importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
assaile.</p>
            <p>And therefore when it shall be
granted mee euen a little to rest my
selfe sweetelie in my beloued, I will
take it in good part, and reioice. I
will reioice I saie, yea and alwaie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice
for that grace of God.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it maketh mee bolde
to praie vnto him in all my necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
because he hath freelie preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mee so oftentimes with his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
visitation.</p>
            <p>For when he dooth but approch,
minding to keepe holie daie with
mee, euen then suddainlie there shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7721:68"/>
a light ouer mine hart, which
forthwith driueth out the cloudes of
all wicked cogitations, whereby I doo
enioie the long desired cleerenes of
God his light.</p>
            <p>Because no vncleane, nor filthie
thing can stand where he entereth
in<note n="z" place="margin">Reuel. 21, verse 27</note>, for hee loueth puritie<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 5, 8</note>, and is
the ingraffer of the same; so that of
necessitie all satanicall illusion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the pomps of this world,
must be packing.</p>
            <p>Therefore my passions and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which I did endure being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
I began both the more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie
to knowe, and the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
to loue, and the more hartelie
to praise him, for vouchsafing at the
length to beate back the damned
crewe of the wicked from assailing
mee.</p>
            <p>For theie doo disturbe my peace,
and sin dooth so shut vp my mouth,
that I am ashamed to speake vnto
my welbeloued.</p>
            <p>But in vaine doo theie bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against his power and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
because euen in a moment he
can slide downe into mine hart, and
poure in secretlie good motions, that
I maie both contemne, and vtterlie
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7721:69"/>
neglect all their priuie whisperings.</p>
            <p>O my faithfull, and all happie

thou shalt perceaue mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to be either pressed downe
at anie time with the waight of sin,
or to be held with vnnecessarie busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that I maie not wander far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straie
from thee after the swarme of
wicked cogitations, and so ouerha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelie
be depriued of thy grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which I shall not be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioie
thy freendship.</p>
            <p>For thou art my Lord, and my
God<note n="b" place="margin">Matt. 4, 10</note>, which by thy word doost both
heale, and sanctifie; which holdest
my soule in life<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 66, 9</note>, and sufferest not
my feete to slip, but deliuerest mee
from the euill daie, and from the
snares of death.</p>
            <p>Oah, how manie haue bin cast off,
and vtterlie perished, that haue bin
much more innocent than I am!</p>
            <p>And therefore my soule, praise

mee blesse his holie Name<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 103, 1 2</note>.</p>
            <p>My soule, I saie, praise thou the

            <p>It is all too little, and far vnsuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
whatsoeuer thou shalt either
thinke, or speake, or promise to his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7721:69"/>
praise. For hee exceedeth all praise,
and is much sweeter than anie mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my soule cleaueth to
thee alone, and loueth thee aboue
all other gifts, notwithstanding it be
exceedinglie beutifull and sweete
which of meere good will thou hast

            <p>For thou alone art the spouse<note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 9, 15</note>,
as for all things else theie are gifts,

            <p>In steed of thee I will not loue
them; neither will I beleeue that

can suffice mee, if I haue not thee:
for in so dooing, I maie perchance
forgoe thee with them too.</p>
            <p>Thou giuest me leaue to vse manie

            <p>And therefore, ô Christ my sweete

               <p>I take all things as patientlie as I

               <p>Naturalie I am grieued, but as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
my spirit, I haue inward pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
that my griefe prooue not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.
For I forget not, how hee
that loueth, liueth in paine.</p>
               <p>I liue by faith<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 1, 17</note>; I beleeue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Scriptures; I giue credit to the
words of comfort. And although I
endure affliction: yet I doubt not,
neither in deede ought I to doubt,
but that God (when it pleaseth him)
can send mee ease.</p>
               <p>For true, and to be credited are
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7721:70"/>
those woordes which are declared.
Because the verie sancts themselues
haue bin exercised in manie, and
proued in like things<note n="h" place="margin">Hebr. 11, 4 5 6, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nature continuallie dooth wish for

in some thing: but the spirit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
is readie to sustaine
whatsoeuer the wil of God is I should
endure<note n="i" place="margin">Mar. 14, 38</note>.</p>
               <p>If therefore I shall be lesse zelous,
and lesse willing to doo good, my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
shall be the more greuous.
<hi>Though he slaie me,</hi> saith the wiseman<note n="k" place="margin">Iob. 13, 15</note>,
<hi>yet will I trust in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I loue virtues, patience is a great
virtue: therefore let patience euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
bee retained. For the more
praise we purchase, the more paines
we take in bringing things to passe.</p>
               <p>And that our virtue maie be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and made the more glorious,
we are commonlie exercised by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
euents.</p>
               <p>Therefore whensoeuer anie such
triall shal happen, be not out of hart,
neither fall downe; but reteine thou
patience, and extoll the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God. The Lord is not so hard
and pittilesse, that he can suffer you
to abide long vncomforted.</p>
               <p>

Onlie haue a care, that you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Abide constant in that good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

my presence to my freends.</p>

               <p>I will hide my face for a little sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I will forsake her for a while,
to see if her loue be pure, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained.</p>
               <p>It is a great matter to loue vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlie.
For that is to loue mee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for her owne sake, nor for anie
temporall commoditie, or spirituall
comfort; but to loue mee, and mee
onlie<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4, 10</note>, and that for mine owne sake,
and that to the end, and that in hope
of nothing at mine hands.</p>
               <p>It is not in euerie one thus to loue
mee; but this prerogatiue of pure
louing, is properlie to the perfect
soule.</p>
               <p>But she that is yet vnperfect, hath
great neede often to be prooued, and
exercised, that she maie know both
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7721:72"/>
how much she loueth mee, and how
greatlie she despiseth her selfe.</p>
               <p>For you said in your hart: Trulie
I doo loue (Christ,) yea, and often
you repeate the same thing, I loue
him in deede.</p>
               <p>But I credit not woords, or thoughts
onlie. For I will make due triall of
that loue.</p>
               <p>When I am present, and speake
faire; when I either put, or encrease
good motions in the minde; when
I grante prosperitie most commonlie
or pleasure, then can you saie with all
deuoutnes, <hi>O my beloued, I doo loue
you.</hi> And you saie well. For I am great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

               <p>But for prosperitie, and good turnes
onlie to loue, and to commend mee,
what great thing is it? Because euen
sinners doo the same. For when theie
haue receiued what naughtelie theie

               <p>Make haste to be in the number

               <p>I purpose to trie you, and to turne

your owne conceipt.</p>
               <p>Tribulation, and anger, and mine
heauie displeasure, together with
sore tentations of wicked spirits, shall
come vpon you. Some vniustlie shall
spoile you of your goodes; others
shall take no compassion vpon you;

yea and in greater things you shall
be prooued, whether you are a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant

               <p>I will depart, and not giue ouer,
vntill I haue made sufficient triall,
whether you blesse mee to my face.</p>
               <p>Now if I finde, that from the hart
vnfainedlie you doo loue mee, and
continuallie doo praise my name,
then is it meete that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
I call you Spouse, and that you
shall haue a secret chamber with
mee.</p>
               <p>But if I perceiue that you cannot
Beare my correction, but will iudge
my punishment to be ouer-sharp, and
still bewaile mine absence, wishing

I will sende you my staffe, that
you maie arise thereby, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
my selfe will come, and restore
you againe vnto my woonted fauor.
For it is not my will that you should
vtterlie faint; because him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
mee, I will loue to the ende<note n="f" place="margin">Iohn. 13, 1</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:7721:74"/>
And although your loue be not so
perfect as could be wished; yet I will
not despise you, but prouide that
you maie growe on in louing. For
my care is that you doo well; and
therefore mistrust mee not.</p>
               <p>I knowe what you can endure,
which maketh mee to temper my
course, that you be not tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
your strength, and so faint.</p>
               <p>And if I staie, in your opinion,
some-what too long, looke for mee
vntill the daie of my visitation. For
comming I will come, and performe
my promise.</p>
               <p>Bee you still in praier, still medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
vpon the holie scripture, and
alwaie be patient, and suffer.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant but your griefe
will be much: but so quicklie to be
ouerthrowen, and to bee out of all
hope of my returne, I cannot like
that.</p>
               <p>Where is your faith? A great faith
you had neede of especiallie on this
behalfe: for although you see not
mee, yet are you seene of mee<note n="g" place="margin">Ecclus. 23 verse 19</note>,
into whose hands you are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
both your selfe, and all that
you haue.</p>
               <p>For although you are not priuie

to my iudgements: yet hauing a

saie<note n="h" place="margin">Psalm. 119, verse 137</note>, <hi>Righteous art thou, ô Lord, and
iust are thy iudgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then be of good comfort, for
this affliction is not to your destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but for the glorie of God.</p>
               <p>I denied your petition, because I
would haue due proofe of your faith
and loue.</p>
               <p>For all this I did that you should

               <p>I knowe what you are<note n="k" place="margin">Psalm. 7, 9</note> better

               <p>Wherefore acknowledge the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

how miserable you should bee,
if once I forsake you.</p>
               <p>As yet you haue not profited suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie
in the knowledge of your

my will was that by experience you
should attaine thereunto.</p>
               <p>It is verie good for you to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,

               <p>I knowe right well this will make
you a good disciple of mine. And
what, I praie you, haue you lost, if
heereby you prooue more wise and
watchfull?</p>
               <p>Oftentimes you are too arrogant,
and forgetfull of your selfe, thinking
that goodnes to be within you which
is not; selfe-loue doth deceaue you,
and while you thinke not of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
you doo abuse the gift. I made
you drunke; but you forgat how the
grape did growe vpon mine owne
vine.</p>
               <p>Trie your selfe a little, acknowledge
your strength. If that which you had
came of your selfe, whie did you not
holde it? But if you could not hold
it, confesse that you receaued it from

               <p>Where were you before I called

               <p>I haue let you slip, that beeing

are bound vnto mee, that so often

               <p>And therefore liften now at the

sometime you are forsaken; that you

euerie action, in all places and times,

               <p>It is verie true you thought your

               <p>Sometime I see you to waxe slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish,

               <p>Moreouer, if you loue mee, you

mee, you will seeke mee.</p>
               <p>What? Wot you not, how riches

loue, and that your loue be feruent,
and constant, it is all that I aske.</p>
               <p>But, I praie thee, whose are the
things that doo, or maie adorne a

               <p>As for that of the world, and which
set out the bodie, theie ought litle to
trooble your minde. But the things
which belong to the beutifieng of

that you maie please the Lord in the

light of the liuing.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, you haue well doon in
humbling, and accusing your selfe so
well outwardlie as inwardlie before
the face of my maiestie, by confessing
vnfainedlie your great weakenes,

sighes, for that you are verie vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to chalenge the fauor of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie

               <p>And therefore be euer mindfull
both of your fraile condition, and of
my glorious maiestie, and so with
humble reuerence approch boldlie
into my presence.</p>
               <p>For I am hee that putteth awaie
thine iniquities, and will not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thy sins<note n="s" place="margin">Isai. 43, 25</note>; it is I that iustifie the
vngodlie<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 4, 5</note>, and this I doo for mine
holie name sake; yea and I am still
readie to minister greater gifts of
mercie vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Because I doo euer choose to showe
fauor rather than displeasure, as one
who had rather spare than punish.</p>
               <p>Yea, all this seemeth but little in
mine eies, neither am I so content
with the first grace that I will not add
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7721:80"/>
a second, or a third rather, yea, in
verie deede, as I can set none ende
to my mercies<note n="u" place="margin">Psa. 145, 9</note>: so neither can the
number of my gifts and benefits bee
recited<note n="x" place="margin">Psa. 68, 19</note>.</p>
               <p>Last of all, after that I for my part
haue pardoned sins, and men for
their partes by their goodnes haue
testified to the world their vnfained
repentance, then doo I restore for
the most part the comfort of mine
healthfull countenance, by powring
in most plentifull manner the grace
of mine holie Spirit.</p>
               <p>And although a sinner doo abide
still in the flesh: yet doo I receaue
him into my familiaritie, so that he is
not to feare the vtter confusion for
sins committed: but rather to thanke
and praise God, that old things bee
passed awaie, and that all things are
become newe<note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 5, 17</note>.</p>
               <p>So gratious, and mercifull am I,
that alwaies I am more readie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
than thou art to beg forgiuenes
at mine hands; more readie to giue,
than thou art to aske.</p>
               <p>Therefore whie feare you? What
dismaieth you to approch vnto the
side of such fauor? And whie doo you
estrange your selfe from so greate
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7721:80"/>
kindenes offered vnto you so franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of mine owne accord?</p>
               <p>Doubtlesse, though you did cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie
vnderstand that I were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to giue you the deniall: yet
ought you not to desist from praier,
nor yet to be out of all hope of being
heard; but so much the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
to be instant in crieng, vntill
you were heard.</p>
               <p>For my mercies are infinite, and
what I denie at one time, maie bee
granted fauorablie at another.</p>
               <p>How knowe you whether I will
turne my face vnto you, and grant
you the desire of your hart?</p>
               <p>And what saith the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
mee? Approch vnto him,
and be illightened, so shall not your
faces be confounded.</p>
               <p>Wherefore accuse your slowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vnto mee rather than your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
approching; and rather your
fearefull shamefastnes than your
prompt presuming of forgiuenes.</p>
               <p>To hope well of my goodnes, is a
verie token of true humilitie, and of
a great faith.</p>
               <p>This doo I speake, that you maie
not offend; and that when you doo
offend, you despeire not, but rise
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7721:81"/>
againe with speede. For yet you haue
hope, and an aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="z" place="margin">1. Iohn. 2, 1</note>.</p>
               <p>What? Looke you to be all woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
before you make accesse vnto

you be so?</p>
               <p>If onlie such as are good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,

approch vnto mee, to whome should
sinners and publicans approch?</p>
               <p>So then, what saith the Gospell?

Theie are not cold woords, but to
the vnkinde soule; neither deafe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
but to the hardened hart.</p>
            <p>The louing and zelous soule kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
this well; and is so often infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in hart, as she is pricked with
the desire of eternall peace.</p>
            <p>And therefore shee speaketh to
thee her Lord God, not to men, of
whome she would not be knowen.</p>
            <p>And although sometime she tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with men: yet that which theie
heare is to the outward sense. But
whatsoeuer she saith to thee, it is to
the verie soule, and rather by sighing
of the hart, than by sounding words.</p>
            <p>Lo (saith she) in peace is my most
bitter bitternes. As if she said; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that of thy goodnes I returned
vnto the peace of minde, the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
state of the world began to be
still more grieuous vnto mee. For I
see in this peace, how far I am sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the soueraigne peace.</p>
            <p>And in deede beeing first busied
with earthlie desires, and mooued
with diuers passions, I was greatlie
hindered from spirituall cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and so from heauenlie contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
after which I should haue
much longed: but that could I least
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7721:86"/>
of all doo, because through sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
I did forgo all sense of inward
sorowe.</p>
            <p>But nowe seeing the troobles of
idle thoughts are taken awaie, I doo
somewhat rest in the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and am drawen vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
matters with mine whole
hart, and I do more lament, that I do
not enioie the good things of God,
than erst I did moorne being vexed
with the troobles of this world.</p>
            <p>So that it is bitternes to my soule
euen to liue in this world; and to
go vnder the heauie burden of sin.
But it is bitterest of all, when somuch
as I maie, all mine affections being
gathered together, I doo enioie now
the good things of the hart, and bend
my selfe, euen with hartie zeale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the armes of eternall peace,
and yet maie not attaine thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
because of the bonds of my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
state.</p>
            <p>And this makes mee euen with
griefe of hart to crie vnto thee, and
to saie:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall
deliuer mee from the bodie of this death</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7, 24</note>?</p>
            <p>There is none so greuous a burden
vnto me, as stil to wander fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7721:87"/>
liuing in the world; for laboring in
loue, I wish for no comfort beside
thee.</p>
            <p>For by good experience I haue
long sithence learned, that my soule
can neither be satisfied with the
good things of this world<note n="e" place="margin">Ecclus. 1, 8</note>, nor yet
be blessed vntill she be ioined vnto
thee in the celestiall habitation.</p>
            <p>For as exceedinglie she doth loue,
burne, and vse contemplation while
she is in the bodie: so will her desire
be insatiable vntill the bodie be
laide off.</p>
            <p>And therefore her ende must be
made perfect by attaining the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
felicitie, and the light of thy
countenance<note n="f" place="margin">Reuel. 22, 4</note>.</p>
            <p>O King of heauen<note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 6, 16 Reuel. 1, 5 Reuel. 17, 14</note>, so amiable in

            <p>My soule hath much thirsted after
thee<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 42, 2</note>; and greatlie will be troobled
vntill she attaine thee.</p>
            <p>Liuing in the world, and not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee, I can take no comfort of
whatsoeuer I beholde; so greatelie
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7721:87"/>
dooth zeale waxe hot, that not once,
but often I breake into these words:</p>
            <p>When shall I come, and appeere
before the face of my God<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 42, 2</note>?</p>
            <p>And this loue of mine cesseth not,
but encreaseth more and more, in
such sort, that I am driuen euen to
weepe night and daie, while conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie
I doo thinke with my selfe,
<hi>Where is now my God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is a comfort to the louing
soule to weepe for thy sake, while she
must want her desire; and still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
thy comming.</p>
            <p>And these teares doo more feede
and refresh the louing soule, than if
she enioied all the things of this
world. For did she loue them<note n="l" place="margin">Math. 6, 24</note>, she
would not weepe for thee.</p>
            <p>Oah how blessed, and pleasing to
thee is the sheading of such teares!</p>
            <p>For theie doo both kill the desires
of secular and temporall ioies; and
also theie obteine the celestiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
            <p>And therefore none doo shed such
holie teares, but theie which are
both singularlie in loue, and verie
notablie religious.</p>
            <p>Far of another kinde be the teares
of such as miserablie be troobled in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7721:88"/>
this world.</p>
            <p>For one man weepeth because he
is sick; another for that he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
another because he is iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
another because his minde is
contraried: but it is thou, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
soule onlie which powrest forth
teares euen of pure loue to thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior-ward;
as for temporall damage,
and worldlie causes, theie trooble
thee not, for thou submittest thy
selfe to the righteous iudgement of
God<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 119, verse 137</note>, and art thankefull.</p>
            <p>And for so dooing, let no worldlie
creature iudge thee either foolish,
or impatient: because thy teares doo
not greeue, but comfort; theie doo
not blur the face, but wash it; theie
hurt not the eies, but theie purifie
the sight of the minde.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, let others conceaue
heereof as theie will, I cannot but
thinke otherwise than well of you;
for I doo wish to drinke deep of such

I knowe whome I credit; and sure

Yea, when shall I there bee? I

            <p>Oah that for all my sins wherewith
I haue deserued thine indignacion,
offended greeuouslie thy Father, and
dishonored thee with all the hoste of
heauen, I might once so thoroughlie

anie wickednes hereafter, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue,
I praie thee, all my sins fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past:
so shall I be both the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout,
the more zelous, and the more

my Sauior both in mine hart, and
with my mouth, in companie, and in
my chamber, and in the garden, and
in the field, and in all places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

            <p>And now, what more shall I aske
of thee, ô Christ my Sauior?</p>
            <p>What is better, or more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or more necessarie especiallie
for mee a great sinner, than to finde
fauor in thy sight, ô Christ my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior?</p>
            <p>And therefore it is that I haue
desired, and still do craue, euen that
by thine intercession and meanes I
maie haue the grace of God thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who, as both thy selfe hast said,
and the Apostle doth witnesse, hast
all power giuen thee both in heauen

            <p>There is no praier more welcome

            <p>If I haue the grace of God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

               </gap>ck that? Againe, what can I
not doo, if I be assisted and holpen
thereby?</p>
            <p>I see that manie and diuers are my
wicked affections: but yet against all
passions the grace of God is a most
effectuall medicine; and if once it
come, it will mitigate them all.</p>
            <p>I doo also stand in neede of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
wisedome and knowledge: but
the grace of God is a most excellent
teacher, and instructor of heauenlie
knowledge, and is able euen sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to instruct mee in whatsoeuer
things are necessarie vnto saluacion.</p>
            <p>For to require more than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
or to desire to vnderstand
more than is lawfull to be knowen,
is against the will of God, whose
pleasure is that wee should be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
vnder his hand, and contented
with his grace.</p>
            <p>Wherefore obteine this grace for
mee, ô Christ, which is so noble and
pretious, that in deed I ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to desire or craue any other

all the world culpable before God;
and that no flesh should reioice in

their owne vertues, or good works, to

               <p>For if thou shouldest deale with
mee in iustice, alas, I were then dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the curssed spirits in hell.</p>
               <p>But of thy goodnes, ô Lord, thou
hast spared mee, and forgiuen my
sins, whereby I am not as the childe

               <p>And therefore am I bounde to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great thankes vnto thee for so

God, both in my speech, and in my

answere my calling!</p>
               <p>But Lord, in steede of all thankes,
receaue I beseech thee, my poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
whereby I desire, and in deede
am bound to serue thee.</p>
               <p>Grante also that the debt of my
seruice maie proceede from the hart,
and finallie agree to thy will and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
and that mine hart be neuer
turned from thy loue, but that both
my soule and bodie maie alike watch
and perseueare daie and night in
thine holie seruice, euen so long as
life is within my bodie, and I haue
my wits to remember thee; let thy
praise be neuer out of my mouth,
nor the remembrance of thy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
benefits slip out of mine hart.</p>
               <p>And if thy seruant shall yet liue
manie yeeres, either an hundred,
or howe manie soeuer, grante that
I maie not prooue luke-warme, or
abashed at thy seruice, but be euen
so zelous and so willing to serue thee,
as I was at the first houre and daie
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7721:113"/>
when mine harte was admonished
and confirmed of thee, euen with a
pure and whole minde onlie to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
thee my Lord.</p>
               <p>Neither let anie infirmitie or
aduersitie hinder my purpose; but
euen as now I meane, and purpose
in the hearing of thee my God: so I
beseech thee giue grace, that what
nowe I haue promised, I maie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
               <p>And although through my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
and faultes this my course
shall be broken, as there is no man so
righteous vpon earth but hee sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth<note n="s" place="margin">2 Chro. 6, verse 36</note>;
yet suffer me not to despeire,
and to faint vtterlie, but put into my
minde forthwith to bowe the knees
of mine harte, and with much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
and teares to offer vnto thee
my wofull and wounded conscience
to be healed with the salue of thy
mercie, and that my purpose maie
be bound more surelie than euer it
was.</p>
               <p>Let mee neuer repent mee of this
couenant, but still giue thankes that
I haue founde such fauor in thine
eies, as to be accepted into thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
warfare.</p>
               <p>Thou canst, ô almightie<note n="t" place="margin">Eze. 10, 5 2. Cor. 6, 18</note> and all

I haue committed; supplie what I

place what is out of order;
yea, and alter the whole state of
my minde, that nothing be wanting
to my former purpose, and let all

thee.</p>
               <p>This change, is made by the
right hand of God; this is God his
visitation; this is the manifolde
conference of the diuine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>In steede of all thankes, accept
the deuoute seruice of thine holie
Church where-so-euer, with the

sweete praises of the whole courte of

               <p>And let all the sanctes from the
beginning of the world, which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
thy grace haue bin enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and called; yea and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and Christian people which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be in the world, or haue bin

them I saie together celebrate and
praise thy all sweete and glorious
name, which is aboue all names to
be blessed<note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 2, 9 10</note>.</p>
               <p>Let them repeate againe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with greate ioie, repeate all
praises dulie and deseruedlie to be
saide of thy name, and that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
times, as there be either in the
heauen, stars; or in the sea, fishes; or
in the earth, cornes; or in the Bible,
letters.</p>
               <p>And all this being doon, yet must

               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:7721:115"/>
So that thou seest now my Soule,
the greatenes and the excellencie
of God thy creator and redeemer
his benefits, the which no creature,
nor all creatures may recompense,
whome hee hath made vnto the
praise and glorie of his eternall and
blessed name<note n="z" place="margin">Isai. 43, 7</note>, who needeth no
glorie, but is alone all sufficient for
himselfe; hee that is what he is<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 3, 14</note>,
is his owne glorie.</p>
               <p>The number of his benefits was so
greate, that I could not place them
all before thine eies; and therefore
of a greate manie I choase three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
giftes, euen as the Wisemen
did, which were about to offer to
the Lord<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 2, 11</note>, wherein I thought good
to comprehend the rest.</p>
               <p>For euerie benefit of God, if you
marke well, is either of nature, or of
grace, or of superexcellencie: and
whatsoeuer else is, maie fullie bee
referred vnto one of these three
kindes.</p>
               <p>In the Creation, you haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

the benefit of superexcellencie; in
our Iustification, note the benefit of
grace.</p>

                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:7721:115"/>
