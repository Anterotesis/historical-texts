            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from it, and to dissociate &amp; sever them by death.
But the inordinat fansies &amp; desires of our corrupt
nature have so inveigeled <hi>Adams</hi> seede in manie
places, that men have accostomed to put awaie their wives vppon every
trifling mislike &amp; discontentement: yea Ieuwes supposed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves to
be warranted by Gods<note n="b" place="margin">Deu 24. 1 Mat. 5. 31.</note> lawe to doe it, so that whosoever put away his
wife gave her a bill of divorcement. This perverse opinion &amp; errour
of theirs our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> reproved teaching that divorcements may
not be made for any cause save whoredome onely. For <hi>whosoever</hi> (saith
he) <hi>shall put away his wife except it be for whoredom and shall marry another
doth commit adulterie and who so marrieth her wich is put away, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ulterie.</hi> Now about the meaning of these wordes of <hi>Christ</hi> expressed

hath a doubt arisen: and diverse men even from the primative church<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es
time have been of diverse mindes.</p>
            <p>For many of the Fathers have gathered thereupon, that if a mans
wife co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted whoredom &amp; fornication, he might not onely put her a
way, but marrie another. Some others, and among them namely S.
<hi>Austine,</hi> have thought that the man might put away his wife but mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
another he might not,</p>

               </gap>he Scholedevins of later years, &amp; the Canonists, as for most parte
they were al adicted to S. <hi>Austins</hi> iudgment, did likewise follow him
herein &amp; the Popes mainteining their doctrine for Catholique, have
possessed the Church of Rome with this opinion. But since in our
daies the light of good learning both for artes and tongues hath shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
more brightly by Gods most gratious goodnes then in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ages, and the holly scriptures by the helpe thereof have been the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
understood: the Pastors &amp; Doctors of the reformed churches have
percieved &amp; shewed, that if a mans wife defile her selfe with fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he may nor onely put her away by Christs doctrine but also marrie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Wherein that they teach agreeably to the truth, and not erro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neously,
as Iesuits &amp; Papists do falsly charge them. I will make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
&amp; prove (through Gods assistance) by expresse words of Christ,
the truth it selfe. And because our adversaries doe weene that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie
hereof is strongly proved by sundrie arguements &amp; obiections,
which two of their newest writers <hi>Bell.</hi> the Iesuit &amp; a namelesse author
of an English panphlet, have dilligenely laied together; For the farther
clearing therefore of the matter, &amp; taking awaie of doubts &amp; scruples,
I will set downe al there obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in order, first out of the scriptures,
then of fathers, last of reasons and answer everie one of them particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>larly.
So shall it appeaae to suh as are not blinded with a fore conceived
opinion &amp; preiudice, that whatsoever shew of prbabilities are brought
to the contrarie, yet the truth deliverd by our Saviour Christ allowetls
him whose wife committeth sornication, to put her away, and to mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
another</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The proofe hoereof is evidnnt if the words of Christ be waied in the
nienteuth Chapter af S,</hi> Mat. <hi>gospel For when the Pharises asking
him a question, whether it were lawfull for a man to put away his wife
for every catse, received answer that it was not, and thereupon saide un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
him,</hi> Why did <hi>Moses</hi> commande to give a bill of divorcement and to put her a
way: Our Saviouer sayde unto them; <hi>Moses</hi> suffered you because of the hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of your harte to put awaye<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 19. 1.</note> your wifes: But from the beginning it was not
so. And I say vnto you, that, whosoever, shal put away his wife, except it bee
for whoredom, and shall marrie another, doth comit adultery: and who so marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her that is put awaie, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adultery.</p>
            <p>Now this in sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the clause of exception <hi>[except it be for whoredom]</hi>
doth argue that he committeh not adulterie, who, having put away his
wife for whoredom marrieth another.</p>
            <p>But hee must needs commit it in doeing so unlesse the bande of mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage
bee loosed and dissolved. For who so marrieth another as long
as he is<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 7. 2</note> bound to the former<note n="g" place="margin">vers. 3.</note> is an adulterer. The band then of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33559:3"/>
is loosed &amp; dissolved betwene that man &amp; wife who are put assun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and divorced for whoredome.</p>
            <p>And if the band beloosed, the man may marry another: seing it is
written<note n="h" place="margin">

to marrie another,<note n="i" place="margin">vers. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This argument doth firmly and necessarily conclude the point in
question, if the first parte and proposition of it be proved to be true.
For there is no controversie of any of the rest: beinge all grounded on
such vndoubted principles of scripture and reason, that our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

But as the Iew cannot conclude hereof with any reason, that the word
signifieth a married woman in <hi>Esay;</hi> because the thing spoken of is a
straunge signe and it is not straunge for a married wommen to coceave
and bring forth a Sonne: so neither can the Iesuite conclude of the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer,
that the particle in <hi>Math.</hi> is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t adversatively; because the words
then doe beare noe sence at all; in which sorte to thinke that any wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
spake, were folly; that Christ the word and wisdome of God were
impietie. Nay if some of <hi>Bell.</hi> schollars should say that words must be
supplied to make it perfect sence, rather than their Maiester bee cast of
as a wrangeler: they would be quickely inforced to pluck in this horn,
or els they might chance to leape (which is worse out of the frying pan
into the fire. For adversative particles import an opposition &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
unto the sentence against which they are brought in. Now,
the sentence is, <hi>that who so putteth away his wife &amp; marrieth another, doth
commit adulterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore he by consequent, committeth not adulterie who doth

               </gap>dome: If the particle be adversative, and must have words
accordingly supplied; &amp; understood to make the sence perfect. Thus
the shift &amp; cavil which <hi>Bell.</hi> hath drawen out ef the double meaning of
the Greike worde, is either ydle &amp; beateth the aier; or if it strike any, it
striketh himselfe, and giueth his cause a deadly wound. Yea that which
he sought to confute, he hath confirmed thereby. For sith the worde
hath onely two significations exceptive, &amp; adversative, neither durst he
say that it is vsed here as an adversative, it followeth he must grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te it
to be an exceptive: so the place rightly translated in our Enhelish (agree
able to the other in the 5. of <hi>Math.) exoept it be for whoredom,</hi> which as
in their authenticall latin text also doth out of conitoversie betoken
an exception. Having all passages therefore shutt against him for scap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

when it is sayd, whosoever shal put away his wife excepting the cause of whoredo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

excepted, either because in that case it is not adulterie to marrie another; &amp; this
is an exception affirmative: or because nothing is presently determined touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that cause, whether it be sufficient to excuse adulterie or noe; and this is an

            <p>The next trick of Sophistrie, whereto as to a shelter our adversaries
betake them, is that the exception ought to be restreined to the former
branche of putting away the wife onely. To the which intent, they say
that there are some words wanting in the text which must be supplied
and perfected thus; <hi>Whosoever shall put away his wife (which is not lawfull

preferreth it before all. And surely if it were lawfull to foist in these

that Christ most true and holly, is made thereby to speake an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth.
For a man may put away his wife for other cause, then for
whoredom, and yet not commit adulerie himselfe. Yes he committ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it (saith <hi>Bell in his wifes adulterie, whereof he was the cause by putting

it, another to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit it him selfe. And Christ when he was mynded
to note these several faults, did it with several words<note n="s" place="margin">Poiei autin moichastai &amp; moicharai.</note> expressing them
accordingly. Moreover, undrstanding the tearme, <hi>to put away,</hi> not

            <p>For if whosoever seperateth his wife from him, but for whoredome,
doth commit adulterie in causing her to commit it: Then is it a sinne

And therefore as it may be inferred out of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> that he
who ommitteth the doing of good through ignoraunce, sinneth not
with a loftie hand in resolute stifnes of an hardned heart: Soe conclude

prooueth rather the like conclusions from the like sentences. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde

lyeth for a Vauntage, sinneth not wilfully.</hi> A badd inferrence indeed.
But the fault there of is, in that these sentences are not like to <hi>Christs,</hi>
For <hi>Christs</hi> is from Heaven, full of truth and wisdome: These ofmen,
fond, and imply vntruth, They might have disputed as fitly to their

<hi>Whosoever stealeth, except it bee for neede, sinneth: And whosoever lyeth except

<hi>If the words must be taken with the exception: then he that marrieth a whore

husband, nor marrie another,</hi> But this most absurd, that the lawe of Christ
being most iust, would have her to be in better case &amp; state, that is iustly
put away, then her that is uniustly. For answer unto which reason

then the drift it self or the similytude, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth vrge, if it
requier absolutely that the band of Marriage may bee no way loosed
but onely by the husbands or the wives death: then neither is it loosed
if the vnbele ever doe for sake the Christian: neither if the husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Monke or the wife a Nunne: neither if the Pope see cause to dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pence
with either of them. And will not this fansie of his about that
drift drive him in to greater inconvenieence yet: to weet, that every wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man,
whose husband is dead ought to marry another, because the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
were bound to become Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s after the death of the Lawe? or of

to become Christians, because no widowe is bound vnder payne of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33559:17"/>
death to take another husband? or (if these absurdities bee not great
enough) that dead men ought to marry, because<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 4</note> 
               <hi>The Iewes by duty
should be vnto Christ, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were dead to the Lawe?</hi> or that the men of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, should rather not beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<note n="x" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 8.</note>he wished widowes rather not to marry? Of the wich consequences
if some bee esteemed erroneous by Papists, some not esteemed onely,
but are so in deede, the most have impious folly ioyned with vnttuth:
Let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledg that similitndes must not be sett vpon the
racke, nor the drift thereof bee stretched and pressed in such sorte, as if
they ought iust in length bredth and depth to match &amp; fitt that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to they are resembled. It sufficeth if in a generall analogy and
proportion of the principall poynt wherein things matched, and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared
together; they bee eche like to other, and both agree in one qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
Which here is observed in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> comparison of the state of
Marriage, with the state of man before and after regeneration: because
<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 7. vers. 2. 3</note>as a wife her husband and being dead doth lawfully take another, and is
not an adulteresse in having his company to bring forth fruite of her
body, to him: soe<note place="margin">vers. 4. &amp; 5.</note> regenerate persons, their naturall corruption (pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoked
by the law to sinne) <hi>aud flesh being mortified</hi> are ioyned to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
(the force of <hi>Christ</hi> working in them) as it were to a second husband
that they should bring forth <hi>fruite (the fruites of the Spirit) vnto God.</hi>
And thus seing neither the drift of the similytude, nor the iudgement
of the Fathers, nor the playnesse of the wordes so oftentymes repeated,
doe disprove our answer and exposition of the place: our answer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Scripture standeth firme and sure &amp; therefore the third place by
our adversaries, is sutable to the former,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So is the fourth &amp; last; taken out of the first to the Corinthians the
seaventh Chapter</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">a</hi> To them who are Married, it is not I that givs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maudement,
but the Lord: Let not the wife depart from her husband: but if she
depart too, let her remayne vnmarried, or bee recconciled vnto her husband. Who
rein <hi>(as Bellarmin reasoneth)</hi> the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> If she depart, &amp; so forth
are meant of a woman which parteth from her husband vpon a cause of iust di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vorcement,
as namely for whoredom, haeresie, and the rest whatsoever they bee,
&amp; not of her which parteth without any such cause. But concerning her of
whom the word are meant, <hi>S. Paul.</hi> sayth most playne ly shee may not marrie
another, Therefore even a cause of iust divorcement looseth not the band of
Marriage neither is it lawfull for married folckes to marry others, al though they
be severed &amp; put a sunder by iust divorcement.</p>
            <p>And of this argument <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth say that it is altogether insoln<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble.
In saying whereof he seemeth to confesse that none of the former ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guments
were so, but might bee answered and confuted. His confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33559:18"/>
touching them hath reason with it: I must needs approve it. But his

her which parteth for any other iust cause, yet not of her which for who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redom.</p>
            <p>Moreover the conclusion knitting vpp his argument with <hi>Therefore

so by fraude and faulshood to beare away the poynt in question.
Of both the which to treat in ordre, his proposition he presumeth of as
most certayne, because in (his iudgment) <hi>Paule would not have sayde of her
who departed without some such cause, Let her ramayne vnmarried, or bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled

our Savior allowing it for whordo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only; The example therefore

But neither was there any divorce for adultery made above 500 years
among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil <hi>Bell.</hi> perhaps say, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And I wil help with a stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that among the Cains (a state wel ordered too) 700 years did
passe befor any divorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was made for adultery. For (as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
writeth) there was no adultry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited by the space of soe many yeares
among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But among the Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ans (wil <hi>Bell.</hi> perhaps reply) it is likely
that some was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted within 500 years. True. But the husband then
might put his wife to death (being convicted first of adultery) without
al publique iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, So that if <hi>Bell.</hi> words have any force, this is theire
effect, Among the heathen Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s while good orders florished, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted adultery suffered death: afterward good orders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she was divorced onely. But whether shee were put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by death or by divorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the man might marry again. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foore
the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, both wel &amp; evel ordered, fight
against the popish Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; their Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion, Hereto the example of all

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
it by divorcement. But in both these cases the man being severed
