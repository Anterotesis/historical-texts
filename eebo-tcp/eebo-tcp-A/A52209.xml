            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT being at first the general good
which caused us to publish
this useful and compleat Piece,
we could not chuse but for the
same end give it a new Birth; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when we heard that we had
so well attain'd what we sought,
in regard of the benefit which so
many have receiv'd from these,
which we shall now rather call


<pb facs="tcp:40569:3"/>
Experiments then Receipts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein. In short, we may
say that it hath had a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
travelling up and down
the Kingdoms, and like the good
Samaritane giving comfort to all
it met; neither have we known of
any that have bought it, who have
not testified their high Esteem
thereof. And indeed how should
it otherwise be, knowing out of
what Elaboratories it was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
Nor is it without its variety,
here preserving the fruits of the
Earth with such a curious neatness,
as if it would shew, that though
Summer gave those pleasant fruits,
yet that Art is able to make Winter
richer then her self: or if this
this please not, teaching you to
furnish the Tables of Princes
with such a Grandezza as befits
them. But as for the Physicall
part, what can be more noble then
that which gives the rich such an


<pb facs="tcp:40569:3"/>
opportunity of spending upon
good works, while they succour
the poor, and give comfort to
them in their greatest distresses.
If we have given it too narrow a
praise, for too large an Encomium,
I am sure we cannot attribute to it,
considering its true value; it is not
what we intended, though we are
glad to see its own high deserts,
carrying it so much above the
reach of a more then common
repute. 'Tis true there may be
some faults, and those may justly
cause us to be blamed: but now
we hope your Ingenuity will the
rather forgive us and them, and
with more diligence seek to amend
what is amiss, if not for our sakes,
yet out of Charity to a Work
which is so charitable to your
selves.</p>
