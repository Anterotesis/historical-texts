            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

From whence alſo on the other ſide we muſt note, that all that after their profeſſion of Chriſt in truth, do fall away, are ſuch as begin to be ſluggiſh and idle in their ſervice of God, and from that fall to mind earthly things, which if they do, it is manifeſt, that their light or profeſſion of immortality, is darkneſſe and fooliſhneſſe, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be rich unto themſelves in mortality: their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44927:5"/>become worldly and mortally minded, and then they have only a bare good conceit of themſelves in propriety; but in any tryall they will fall away to ſave their ſoules under the authority of darknes, and for the love thereof, deny to loſe their ſoules in the profeſſion of Chriſt, yea, they will blaſpheme that way of Chriſtianity, and ſo become the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, when yet with their lips they will give him a <hi>Iudas kiſſe,</hi> and ſay, hayle maſter, and profeſſe his word with their mouth; but their deeds and deviſes are with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the power of darkneſſe to betray him and his, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. with <hi>Luke</hi> 22.47, 48, 53.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. The true Chriſtians in all their ſufferings ſight not for mortall ſalvation; but they deſpiſe ſuch ſalvation for the Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. with 12.2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.1. &amp;c. is ſhewed the true ſtate of Chriſtianity by the vine. If a man cut the vine-tree, the better the branches grow. Thus the Father cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vine, Chriſt in the mortall life he ſprang both in the power of his immortall life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the branches bring forth fruites to him that only hath immortality, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. The fruitfull branches that are purged by his husbandry, and chaſtiſed in love, (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) do by their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings bring forth more fruite to immortality: and to the divine nature of God; but if the husband man do for ſome cauſe neglect to cut or purge the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44927:6"/>mortall parts, it is known that the branches that ſo run out without chaſtiſement, do in time come to be wild, that do bring forth bitter fruite as ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, and thereby procure to be cut of from the true vine planted to give fruites unto immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p n="7">7. According to <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29.21. Compared with the proſecution now of Chriſtians, I underſtand how a man is made a ſinner againſt God, by a word, &amp;c. inſnared thus: the Emperour is exalted for good, certain Lawes are ſet down: that if a Chriſtian ſay thus or thus, he ſhall ſuffer death; their Judgement ſits, the Chriſtian is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as the word is made fleſh like us, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. to ſuffer death with us and for us: ſo we are made the word in him, to ſuffer with him and for his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and thus we eate his fleſh, when we apply his fleſh to have Communion in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof in love: and we eate the word when we have it of him and keepe it; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.47, 51. And thus he is the food of immortality which nouriſheth the Devine nature in man, to every one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44927:6"/>to whom he is communicable both in fleſh, and ſpirit; for the word is now both fleſh, ſpirit and life; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.54, with 63. Therefore it canot be, but that the fleſh of man which hath the ſpirit of Chriſt muſt needs be quickned, and not ſe death as a curſe, becauſe the word is ſpirituall and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made voide; for according to the word, he which eateth naturall bread is quickned mortally for the time of a day &amp;c. much more ſhall he live to immortallity, and to God that applyeth to himſelf the body and ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt: the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which life of Chriſt is effectuall to every true member of his body, in that ſuch are made of God to ſome end in the fleſh; Namely, that by the life of the fleſh in Chriſt Ieſus, which is yet of no being before God, they may confound whatſoever hath a being of the world, and in the mind or ſpirit, Chriſt is made unto them from God wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24—28—30. Whereby it is plaine, that every one that in true love of God holdeth community in the fleſh and ſufferings of Chriſt, hath from God the participation of the ſame ſpirit of Chriſt to every uſe. He is chaſt as he is chaſt, He is righteous as he is rigteous: 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3—7, with 4.2. What ſuch do one earth it is confirmed in heaven &amp;c. becauſe the ſame ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt which is in heaven liveth in them, and ſo he ſpeaketh an doth the things on earth by the miniſtery of such choſen and holy veſſels. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22.23. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.18.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15.16.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. The other is called the holy wind of ſpirit

            <p>This holy wind is the ſpirit of truth which the Lord Jeſus giveth to all that he calleth and chuſeth out of the world, which worketh in all Children that walke after that holy wind, minding the things that are above in Heaven, after the life of immortality, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.17.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.14. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>

            <p>The Children of light are they which exerciſe themſelves in the Law and light that ſhineth to mortality, eſchewing evill and doing good: as if they were alwayes with the Father of lights, and

            <p>Thoſe go into light continually, every day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto their ſtrength, and they profit in the true riches which preſerve the man of God to an immortall life: the day and the year they ſpend in the light, going to immortality, and the time fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up to their comfort, and conſumeth their evill ſorrow and ſufferings for the light ſake in this world; when they have ſpent their time, all their labours go with them, they go out of this world, as a good Servant to be refreſhed, and rewarded for his good ſervice, their immortall ſoule is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into <hi>Paradice</hi> and joy; way ting yet for the day of Judgement and Redemption of the body, when according to their good workes, they ſhall be crowned with unutterable and immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

And thus I propoſe it: There are all manner of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propoſed, and threatned to be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whomſoever ſhall confeſſe the Lord Jeſus to be Chriſt the Judge of all, if none dare to confeſſe with his mouth what he believeth in his heart, for of the torments he goeth back from Chriſt; but if any ſee the prize in immortality, namely, Jeſus the Authoux and perfecter of that faith raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the dead, and believeth in his heart, that if he ſuffer death with Chriſt, God will alſo raiſe him by Chriſt to life, this faith will encourage a Chriſtian to enter the conflict in the love of Chriſt, and without feare to confeſſe to his name: If after they enter combate with the ſeede of the ſerpent, are at length vanquiſhed by intollerable payne, and are not able to indure the agony and

            <p>I Have obſerved the courſe of Religion in the world, and I find that another word and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth alter the Religion: As in Chriſtian Religion the word or Law of the Church is Chriſt manifeſt in the Scriptures, and Doctrine from the beginning, The authority thereof is from Heaven manifeſted in power to hold the words againſt the authority of men. The Sea or ſeate to governe according to this world and new Covenant, is the Lord Jeſus, his 12. Apoſtles, and all that are built upon them, having the ſame word and ſpirit: their converſation is love, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and humility towards others: ſo as he which is moſt poore and humble in the fleſh, is endued with moſt authority in the ſpirit of holineſſe: their faith is in immortality after this mortality, according to the Communion in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44927:14"/>of Jeſus Chriſt the head of the whole Church of true Chriſtians.</p>

               </gap>ereth the Religion, if another authority of carnall force to impoſe his word upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, he oppoſeth Jeſus in his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authority which worketh in the heart inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: if he under the name of Chriſt enforce other Chriſtians by oppreſſion to do contrary to any word, or any jot or title of the Scriptures deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the foundation of the Chriſtian Church, he is an Antichriſt, he denyeth the Father by preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to poſſeſſe the Conſcience of man which he made with his word, and he denyeth the Sonne in denying the word and the power thereof. The Converſation of ſuch, is alſo contrary to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſtians, being putt up with mortall pride, to exalt themſelves one over another, in the fleſh and pride of life. Their faith is alſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that it is fixed on mortality; wherein they rejoyce and are confident of the durable eſtate in the pleaſures of ſin. And thus the Goſpell of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt immortality, is in all things perverted under the colour of his own name, and of his own word and Ordinances to mortality, and wickedneſſe greater then paganiſme.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44927:14"/>
            <p n="2">2. It is obſerved that in proceſſe of time after the much blood of the Chriſtians had brought forth the world to bee Chriſtian, from that time the Church of Chriſt ceaſed to be viſible of the world, and the world blinded it ſelf under the name of the Church of Chriſt which cannot ſo be for <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> the Church of Chriſt conſiſteth of the people, that in all times are called out of the world to the unity of ſpirit, now the world cannot be called out of it ſelf; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true and ſpirituall Chriſtians are hidden to the world, under the feighned and carnall Chriſtians, yet the Church is as viſible in it ſelfe now as it was, <hi>viz.</hi> when Chriſtians ſuffer joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under worldly Chriſtians, for the ſame cauſe of the Word, Commandement and Faith of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality as they did in the beginning.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men deny the Catholike Faith, when they labour to comprehend it under their carnall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: For the Catholike Faith, muſt needs be granted from the name of it, to be both univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and ſpirituall: If then it is ſuch a Faith, as is to extend to all the ends of the earth, ſuch as withſtand it, or hinder the ſpreading thereof by their wiſdome and power, do deny that the Faith ſhould be univerſally obeyed and ſo Catholick.</p>

            <p n="4">4. If prayers and tears are the weapons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and authority of the true Church of Chriſt, as all grant: then fire and ſword muſt needs bee the weapons and offenſive authority, whereby the kingdom of Antichriſt is diſcovered in all places.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a horrible thing to behold the Creator without Chriſt the Word; For he teacheth with terror of death for tranſgreſſion of the Law: but he that ſeeing his eſtate to bee thus before God, and goeth to Chriſt and learneth obedience in the word, and in the death of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall in him have boldneſſe to ſtand before the throne of his gracein immortality.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A truth may be preached and yet made ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void by worldly practize, as the popiſh Chriſtians holds: That whatſoever the law ſaith, the Goſpel confirmeth; and whatſoever the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell ſaith, the ſame is agreeable to the law: That as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the giver of the old law: Chriſt is the giver of new and a more perfect law: They devide the whole law into three parts. 1. the law of Nature, the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the law of Chriſt, and that the Goſpell is revealed for no other cauſe, but to ſhew to the world more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect counſells and precepts then were in the old

Here is a deceit of ſalvation from a childe. For ſinne and righteouſneſſe have their contrary operation, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. with 6.13.20.

A Doctrine may be well diſtinguiſhed in word, and yet confounded in the worke of the power of the ſpirit made voide and deficient in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny work; thus diſtinction is made between the mortall part, and the immortall part in man: A regenerate man conſiſteth of two men, (as a man may ſay) of the old man, and of the new man, the nature of the old man is cleane contrary to the nature of the new man: as being earthly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with Satans ſeed; the nature of the new man being heavenly and bleſſed with the celeſtiall ſeed of God, in what he is an old man, he is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and an enemy to God, in what he is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, he is righteous and holy, and a friend to God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44927:17"/>the ſeede of God preſerving him from ſin; ſo that he cannot ſin as the ſeede of the Serpent: One man therefore which is regenerate, well may be called alwayes juſt, and alwayes ſinfull, juſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods ſeede, and his regeneration; ſinfull in reſpect of Sathans ſeede, and his firſt generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; betwixt theſe two men therefore there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall conflict and warre moſt deadly; Thus ſaith Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> in <hi>Fox P.</hi> 1655. This Doctrine it may be truly applyed, but with it is mixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarities, which confound this, and make it of no force; for there he bringeth in the compariſon of <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſuch <hi>David</hi> the old man is perfect in his birth, an one as was <hi>Goliah:</hi> the new man is like a little Child, ſuch an one as was like little <hi>David;</hi> for his birth is not perfect, untill the day of his generall reſurrection. The old man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more ſtrong, luſty, and ſtirring then the new man, becauſe the birth of the new man is but now begun, and the old man is perfectly borne; The fleſh and old man by reaſon of his birth that is perfect, doth often for a time prevaile againſt the new man (being but a child in compariſon) and that in ſuch ſort, as not only others; but even the Children of God themſelves, think that they be nothing elſe but old, and that the ſpirit of God is loſt and gone away, as the Sun hidden by the Cloudes, yet after appeareth againe, &amp;c. ſuch are the deceits of Antichriſtian Doctrines, that none ſhould diſcerne the Children of the Devill, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44927:17"/>count ſin, from the children of God that cannot count ſin, and therefore we have an expreſſe word to try and diſcerne them by their ſpirits, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. &amp; 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Diverſe reaſons may be ſhewed from this confuſion, of a true Doctrine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth, and confute the falſhood by it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>As firſt, If there be deadly enmity betweene the old and the new, a contrary and diſ-joyned nature in either, if once the old man get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie againe by any meanes over the new, it is to be feared, that he will make himſelfe ſure enough in the condemnation, as that he ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelfe to live by repentance, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. to 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the fleſh ſhould prevaile againſt the ſpirit, then <hi>Goliah</hi> doth overcome <hi>David,</hi> and the ſpirituall and new man in Chriſt is ſlaine, and who can ſave it: And many abſurdities will ariſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſeeing that which is borne from above after the ſpirit of Chriſt, is of the ſpirit, and that which is after the fleſh is fleſh, diſtinctly as are fleſh and ſpirit; mortall and immortall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, the leaſt part of that immortall ſpirit muſt needs be ſtronger then the ſtrongeſt felſh of the body, for it is ſtronger then all the fleſhly power of the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.2.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Againe, the new man after it hath a being in a man, is increaſed dayly in the regeneration,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44927:18"/>but the old man dyeth dayly in his generation, therefore that regenerate an which groweth dayly getteth the victory to day, is better able to overcome to morrow. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus the compariſon is made true, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> how little or young ſoever, he was well able by the power of his God to kill for ever the man of fleſh that had none but mortall defence, and that before he came ſo neer as to encounter with him, for he fought for the hope of <hi>Iſrael,.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Againe, the compariſon of the Sunne ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with black clouds, in not to this purpoſe, for we grant thus much, that they have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Sunne-ſhine, but have ſometimes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe and temptations in the fleſh, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome, the comforts returne from above: but expect man can prove that the light of the Sunne is overcome in its courſe of the contrary darkneſſe, otherwiſe then in the order of the day and night, it confirmeth that the Sonne of righteouſneſſe never ceaſeth to ſhine more or leſſe, and all times ſufficiently teſtifie to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that the Sunne giveth light through the clouds, to keep darkenes from the underſtanding, till the day be ended by death.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And where it is ſaid in concluſion that the birth is not perfected untill the generall day of his reſurrection: this abſolutly denieth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the nature of regeneration, namely, that he is regenerate and a new man, for one cannot
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44927:18"/>be a man till he be borne. Therefore the new men muſt needs have a perfect birth, before it can be a new man, and ſo before the reſurrection. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Beptiſme, this new man which is now created in body, is in his account riſen from the dead, and living together with Chriſt, <hi>Cel.</hi> 2.11.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>to</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>All which ſheweth the power and truth of the regeneration, that where divine nature doth live as doth a renewed minde, the fleſh of that man muſt needs be kept, that Satan ſhall not touch that body to overcome the divine nature, ſo as to yeeld the members of that man to the ſervice of ſinne unto death, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.16.23.</p>
            <p>By this Doctrine we may diſtinguiſh in word and deed, and know every one by their fruits, for the word and ſpirit of Chriſt is the ſame in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all that are adopted. Men are! not the children of God to day, and of the Devill to morrow, as they might be under the worldly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications, but all they which are perfect in heart, whom the Lord loves, are obedient to death, and he loves to the end.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is manifeſt that the wedding garment is to love the marriage more then all goods in the world, or then ones own life. If any be found to preſume to come to the weding without this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love, &amp; he be convinced to want it, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of his conſcience as guilty, and God doth condemne him, and execute him by himſelfe, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44927:19"/>he did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for they not having this perfect love which was required, but a heart to love his money in part, was thus executed, for he was ſilent to death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1. to 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Among the Chriſtians that are joyned to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to ſhew his death, there is in love a twofold communion, the one leſſe and farther off, the other great and neere to the Lord. The firſt is communion of goods, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. The next is communion of ſufferings, as in one body and Church of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8.13—16. <hi>with</hi> I <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>Now in this brotherhood, if any have the good of this world, and doe not communicate in love to him that hath need, it is impoſſible that hee can have that love of God to lay down his life, blood, for his brother, that will not lay downe dayly as his common food to ſuſtaine him, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16, 17. Therefore it is the judgement of the holy ſpirit, that whoſoever is falſe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon communion of goods, cannot hold the love in the holy communion of the body and blood of the Lord, and therefore the holy Spirit doth give us to underſtand, that it is better for the man that doth lye and diſſemble in the common communion, and more for the glory of God, that ſuch an one ſhould dye by the hand of the inviſible God in the firſt offence, then that he ſhould live longer

            <p n="4">4. The Lord Jeſus foreſeeing how hardly men should be drawn to acknowledge him to be the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44927:27"/>Chriſt, and being acknowledged how eaſily men would be ſeduced by falſe prophets, and falſe Chriſts to deny him: Therefore, firſt he proveth himſelf to be the Chriſt that <hi>Moſes</hi> did write of, who by miracles did confirme the truth of every jot and tittle of the Law, and the Prophets, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23.24. with 5.17.18, 19. &amp;c. whereas falſe Prophets under colour of miracles, did teach tranſgreſſion of the Law, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. &amp;c. and 17 2. &amp;c. with 18.13. &amp;c. And accordingly out Lord reacheth us to try the Preachers, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him ſhould come in his name, as under the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and Prophets of God, thus; if they call Lord, Lord, and in his name propheſie, and in his name caſt out Devills, and in his name do many miracles: yet if under pretence hereof, any of them do work lawleſneſſe, that is, do tranſgreſſe, and alſo teach men to tranſgreſſe any the leaſt of all the Commandements in the Law of God: theſe and all ſuch are rejected and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of the Lord, and judge of the world, as falſe, and deceivers of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. with 7.15.21. 22.23. whereby we ſee how fearfull a thing it is, to forſake the Law and the Prophets, for in that eſtate we are without all meanes to know Jeſus to be Chriſt in truth, without any knowledge to try deceivers; but remain as men deceived, and deceiving others, and can by no meanes come to the true knowledge of Chriſt, till we believe the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44927:27"/>46.47. which who ſo believe, and do the will of our Father which is in Heaven, and then call Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A man may propheſie of a truth, and yet apply ſpirituall things to a carnall ſence. As <hi>Caraphas</hi> fearing the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come and deſtroy them all: for Jeſus the King of the Jews ſaid, it is expedient rather that one dye, them all; whereas God intended the ſpirituall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſalvation by his death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.47. to 53. Feare enforced the Jews to do what they did.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From the oppoſition of the authority of men, againſt the authority of God in Chriſt, we may ſee the bondage under men by the Law, and the liberty of the Law in Chriſt, in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: as it is lawfull to the Nations to remain in the preſence, or to be circumciſed upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in liberty from bondage o the worldly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Act.</hi> 16 3. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 3, 4 <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25.26. It is lawfull to marry, to not to marry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 28.36.38. with 9 5. It is lawfull to eat lawfull meate, or it is lawfull to abſtain and to faſt, or ſuch like. But this liberty man be occaſion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in reſpect of the different authorities: It a man fear the authority of men, and will be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in bondage to their Prieſthood, he is fallen from the liberty of Chriſt, and hath denyed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44927:28"/>the faith in his Prieſthood, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If on the other ſide, a man fear other worldly authority, and make circumciſion in the liberty of the Goſpel to be ſin; ſuch do denye the liberty wherein Chriſt hath made them free, to uſe it for their advantage in the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.1.3.</p>
            <p>So as in this thing of Circumciſion, if one be compelled to be circumciſed, he is brought in bondage to men, and bound to obſerve the worldly elements, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. If a man ſtand faſt in the liberty, neither to be Circumciſed, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncircumciſed, in ſubjection to men, he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the truth of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.5. with 5. 1 <hi>Act.</hi> 16.3. otherwiſe, if the word be not holden in freedom of ſpirit, it will be an occaſion of evill under the bondage of men: And on the other ſide, it may be occaſion of evill, under the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſt, when it is not hold on as a thing indifferent; namely, when men juſtifie themſelves, or think themſelves the better for doing, or not doing it; for Circumciſion is nothing, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puce is nothing, but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.18.19.</p>
            <p>So if Marriage be exhibited under the worldly authorities, it may bring the parties into bondage; likewiſe, if lawfull meates be forbidden by the Doctrines of Devills, we are to maintain our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Chriſt, in aſſurance, that though we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44927:28"/>death, yet he will raiſe us again according to his prieſthood, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. &amp;c. 10. Alwayes with this reſpect in the Law of liberty, that there be no juſtification of condemnation on one ſide or other, in lawfull meates; but to judge indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he which cates is not the better by it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he the worſe which cates not. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. wherefore in all ſuch indifferent things every man is to have reſpect to his own Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to the preſent eſtate and Nation, wherein he is either Jew or Gentile, that he be without offence, but to uſe his liberty, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion to his own fleſh, but to the profit of others, in ſuch ſort, that whether any eat or drink, or what other indifferent thing ſoever they do, they may do all to the glory of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23, 32.33, 31.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Further is noted in what reſpect the Church of Chriſt, a woman, and the wife of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from the beginning ſhe hath conceived in her heart the ſeed of God, which is the Word Chriſt, and thus ſhe hath travelled with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt till her time was fulfilled, that ſhee ſhould bring forth the ſpirit and truth of Chriſt, which was when Jeſus Chriſt, being made one fleſh with the Church, ſhe by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature gave up the word, law, and truth of God perfected into her husbands hands; ſo as the carnall Church is now delivered from that law and labour which was committed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44927:29"/>of her, for ſhe hath now in Jeſus Chriſt brought forth the ſpirit of holyneſſe to God, by the death of the fleſh, and in the reſurrection of of the ſpirituall man, to the immortall life of God, her ſpirituall husband; Jeſus Chriſt then, which the Church of God having ſuffered the pain of travell to death, &amp; being riſen from the dead, and exalted to glory as Lord and Chriſt, is made the head of his Church in a more neere and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, even as a man that going to take a wife, manifeſteth the ſecrets of his hearty love unto her in way of eſpouſals, who after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, returneth againe to her in way of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and giveth his owne ſpirit, as <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.16. 17.18 — 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33 — 36. This immortall ſeed therefore being freely communicated in the love of Chriſt, is gladly received of the Church, and of none other, which travelleth in ſubjection to Chriſt her husband, to perfect that birth of the ſpiritual &amp; immortal man, of whom ſhe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immortall and ſpirituall ſeed, and thus is ſhe become bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, in love; which union in Chriſt, is confirmed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoule of man, that in their ſeverall age or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſo beloved of God in Chriſt, that as an husband he ſhould give of his immortall ſeed; ſo as every one that conceiveth it in a good heart doth know both the union, and her husband: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom every ſuch heart doth increaſe that ſeed of the new and immortall man dayly, and in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44927:30"/>groweth by the obedience and death of the life-blood, unto a lively hope through the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead. For ſuch is the love of every good heart that ſhe in her proper bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will tenderly reſpect, to preſerve that word of the living God, which ſhee hath willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in her minde and heart, ſo as no cares ſhall choake, nor reproches diſmay, but that her body ſhall bring forth to her husband that Word which abideth for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.4—22, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This word of God, in what body ſoever it come in the love and communion of ſufferings in Chriſt Jeſus, is the ſalvation of the ſame body to that immortall life in glory with Chriſt, for whereas the perſecutors that would adulterate us from our husband, their dead ſhall not live, neither ſhall their ghoſts be raiſed againe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our bodies which have dyed to bring forth the ſpirit of truth, ſhall be raiſed to immortall truth of our head Chriſt, (<hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 13—18.19.) when being ſanctified in the truth, with him we ſhall be perfected in one, with our Father, and our Lord Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.19—21. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a wonderfull wiſdome to conſider in Jeſus Chriſt, how the Lord by his mercy doth call the world to judgement: for in that he hath ſent his Sonne into the world, with mercy toward all that ſhew mercy, and in it hee executeth the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his Law on none by the Law. It is moſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44927:30"/>manifeſt, that all that out of their owne heart do judge and condemne, ſhewing no mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, doe by their owne juſtice in the Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Lord to enter into judgement with them, for their judgement without mercy. And thus we may ſee how the Law was given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and ſinne was required by peſent juſtice: but grace and truth is by Jeſus Chriſt, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſinners to ſinne no more, and they ſhall not be judged for their ſinnes paſt, and every one to ſhew mercy, and they ſhall find mercy, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.21. to 35. if not, but that men will deſpiſe the grace of God towards them, by judging and condemning their fellow-ſervants, they are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable before God, their owne meaſure ſhall be meaſured to them, they have denyed to ſhew mercy, therefore mercy ſhall be denyed to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. <hi>to</hi> 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37.38.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The cauſe of falling from the love of God is the evill of the heart, whereby men diſſembled with men; for when men retaine the nature of ſwine, and yet will be waſhed, without doubt they will returne to their filthyneſſe. Or dogges by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will turne to their kinde, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. Or evill trees cannot but bring forth evill fruit, whatſoever they ſhew at firſt: Whereas good, ſimple, and perfect of heart, that hath received the good ſeed, will bring forth fruit to perfection. When the tree is of a good nature, it cannot but bring forth good fruit, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.16, &amp;c. The
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44927:31"/>branch that is in Chriſt is fruitfull to the Father, and it is more fruitfull, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.1. &amp;c. The new man that is once borne againe from above is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed dayly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. with 4.16.</p>
            <p>Men that are imperfect, and wavering minded will looke forward, and then backward, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.62. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.8. Whereas perfect men, forgetting the things behinde, doe ſtretch forward to the things before, they preſſe hard to the marke, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13.14.15. All that are perfect in love &amp; mercy towards the Brethren, the grace of God, and his love, and mercy remaineth firme to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is great difference betweene the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance under the Law of works, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance under the Law of faith. They after the Leviticall Law were borne holy according to the carnall Commandement, and were inſtructed in the Law of God, from the breaſts, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſinned, they repented, and were juſtified by the works of the Law; and becauſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was never freed from the weakneſſe of the fleſh, they fell commonly into ſinne, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and this was the courſe of the obedient men, ſuch as of <hi>David,</hi> till they came to know the free juſtification of God by faith: whereas the true repentance after the Prieſthood of Chriſt doth clenſe the Conſcience from the guilt of all ſinnes paſt, and doth perfect them from that minde of the fleſh, ſo as ſin doth no looger raigne in their mortall body; but in this juſtification by faith
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44927:31"/>in Chriſt, they preſent themſelves to God, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the dead, and their members weapons of righteouſneſſe to God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.9—14.—<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2.—12.13.</p>

            <p n="2">2 The ſecond ſort are ſuch, as receive the ſeed in ſtony ground. Theſe doe both know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Word ſo, as with joy to doe it very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely; for as the ſtony ground doth make the ſeed to ſpring forth ſooneſt, ſo theſe take the Word quickly, with joy, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.13.5.20. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.5. but have no ſtrength of heart to hold the word conſtantly in the faith, hope, and love of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, but when the mortall Authorities come upon them, and afflict them with the Sun beames of their torments, and chaſtiſe them as a Father, for that they would forſake them, and their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall glory, to embrace a vaine baſe word (as it ſeemeth to them) without any wordly ſociety, honour, or pleaſure. And thus wordly men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended at the Word, do rage againſt theſe ſort of people that with ſuch joy received it; whoſe hearts alſo being not prepared for theſe tryals, doe faint under the burthen, and all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44927:32"/>faith, and obedience to the word is by force of the hard perſecution, diſdained to bee any longer beleeved in their heart, and as ſtony ground it is able to bring the fruit of the word to no further perfection; therefore they now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their heart to the power that oppreſſeth from without them, by which all their former light is concluded in darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third ſort are ſuch as receive the ſeed amongſt thornes: Theſe alſo are ſuch as know and believe for a time; but they nouriſh an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the word within them, namely, worldly cares, deſire of riches, and the pleaſures of this mortall life which may ſeeme to ſuſtain, and to give honour and credit to the word; but in the end it will quite chocke the faith, hope, and love to immortality, as that ſuch will fall away of themſelves, wholly to imbrace this preſent world: the reaſon is, becauſe theſe were never perfect in love, nor ſound in the faith; but having a heart and a heart, the deceits of ſin which are in the world through luſt growing naturally in the hart will ſoone exalt ſuch men in pride of knowledge to fall into the condemnation of the Devill ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly: For thus much doth the parable import to them which know it, that the ſeede which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth among thornes, doth by helpe of the thornes in ſome part of the ſeede, ſpring up to be taller and longer, yet at length the thornes take away the naturall being of the corne, ſo as it periſheth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44927:33"/>as a man whoſe breath is ſtopped: if the thornes, riches, and pleaſures of life be cut down and fall from him, he is ſeen to fall of himſelf as a tree, that being decayed at the roote, is overſwayed of the top, and the fall thereof is greater, by how much the weight of the branches is heavier: This is the eſtate of thoſe which receive the word of Chriſt with the glory of the world, &amp; pleaſures of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="4">4. The laſt ſort of men are like good ground, Theſe receive the word as the Children of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Children of light: they know &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the word, &amp; with reverence, they prepare the heart that it be gentle, perfect, and ſimple, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive it being carefull, that what they know and believe, they may hold both in profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practice, conſtantly and with increaſe: wherefore this good ground bringeth forth fruit in patience, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. The reaſon is, becauſe of the contrariety of the evill one, either in worldly authorities, or in the luſts of the fleſh, which hate the word and Goſpel of immortality; for he that receiveth the word of truth withall his heart and full reſolution to ſuffer with Chriſt the ſaver thereof, this man can never fayle: In perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the word, he hath prepared his heart to ſuffer, and ſo he continuath conſtant unto death,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44927:33"/>and he winneth, by holding the word, the Crown of an immortal life. In all other temptations which are in himſelfe, together with the world, he denyeth himſelf after the honour of this world, he hateth his own ſoule to ſatisfie it with the luſts thereof, he ſuffereth in the fleſh, and ſo ceaſeth from ſin, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1 &amp;c. patience maketh his heart ſoft to give rooting to the word, the harder the perſecution of men, the ſofter the heart is to nouriſh the immortall ſeed, and to bring forth the fruit thereof in the periſhing and death of the mortall fleſh, chuſing rather to loſe his life, then loſe the word of God, patience maketh his heart heard to reſiſt the Devill and all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and temptations: he is open hearted, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and perfect in love to the Lord, by whoſe word he holdeth the aſſurance of immortality with him; but he is cloſe ſhut to obey the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, he hateth to think of their wicked courſes in mortality. This is the eſtate of thoſe which are able to endure the try all, and to walls perfectly in the love of Chriſt: the more their oppreſſion is from without, the greater is their obedience from the heart, the more their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are, the greater is the tryall of their faith, which worketh the more patience: The more patience they poſſeſſe their ſoules with, the more perfect the work of wiſdom is, untill they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire, defective in nothing, <hi>Iam,</hi> 1.2.3, 4, 5.</p>

            <p>Of all ſorts of Chriſtians that have heard the word of Chriſt: theſe only that ſuffer as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in patience of the good word, are able to bring forth the fruit thereof unto perfection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the miſerable eſtate of the men of this age, that while they think to fly from death, they fall into it, for flying from the patience of the word of life, they run after their own thoughts to ſave their life in mortality; when they in ſo doing, lay themſelves open to all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this world, and do even feele the terrours of the ſecond and immortall death, while they are yet living, and yet are forced to run into it.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44927:34"/>according to his holy law in their mind, looking through the reſurrection of Jeſus, unto that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life in immortality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Having obſerved how ſuch as profeſſe themſelves, preachers of light, are darkened in the world by leaving the expreſſe word, and wiſdom of Chriſt, to follow mortall vanities; I am drawn to diſcover their folly, that they can no more helpe a man to go the way of immortality, then a natural blind man can direct a man in the way of a mortall life. And therefore being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo blinded with the God of this world, it is miſchievous madneſſe for them to preſume to ſpeak what they know not, thereby to deceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or elſe by their authority of blindneſſe to hinder them, which being ignorant of their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, do enquire of them the good old way; but it is ſafe for blind men to confeſle they are blind, that all that erre and have eyes, may enquire of others that do ſee: It yet thay will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Preachers of light and immortality, they muſt be diſcouraged to the falſe Preachers, that inſtead thereof, do indeed preach darkneſſe and mortality, as to deceive others of the wayes of life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I underſtand that the Chriſtians are not Miniſters of the letter, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. becauſe that were to take upon them the carnall authority of the Scribes and Phariſees, who are charged with

            <p>I Had a ſight of the love of God in man, and the ſencible underſtanding thereof was wonderfull In mine eyes. Man being by ſinne deprived the glory of God, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> wa created, is now by the evill ſpirit become ſubject to the bodie of the ſinnes of the fleſh, to ſow to the fleſh, and of the fleſh to reape mortality. And to reſtraine man from ſinne, God gave his Law, and gave power to condemne accordingly, to the chaſtiſement of the fleſh, and to death: Yet the heart of man is naturally ſo evill, that this authority in evill min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mens hands cannot reforme the minde, that ſo man ſhould yet pleaſe God in mortality. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſt mankind ſhould bee ſwallowed up in death for the ſinnes of the fleſh, the Sonne of God by whom the world and man was made, became fleſh, that in the love of God, he might teach us in the fleſh by the mediation and direction of his ſpirit manifeſted in the fleſh, the truth of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44927:35"/>in ſuffering death in the reſurrection of the fleſh, and in the full reſtoring to glory: yet fleſh and blood is weake and cannot follow him in this hard and ſtrait way. Wherefore the Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, condeſcending to mans weakneſſe, hath given his holy ſpirit into the world, which being Gods ſpirit might redeeme men from the earth in the death of Chriſt, who being departed in ſight, hath ſent his owne ſpirit to teach men, and to guid them into all truth, how they ſhould learne obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the ſinnefull fleſh, how to put off the carnall man of mortality, and to put on the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man of immortality, how to mortifie the carnall actions of the body to the holy ſpirit of Chriſt, &amp; for to perfect the myſtery of ſuffering in the fleſh, this word and ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus doth give his Chriſtian menwiſdom how to ſuffer under the evill authorities of the world to death, and ſo to paſſe on in the way of Chirſt to immortall life. And as in the courſe of nature our minde was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed wholly to live after the luſts of uncleanneſsſe, ſo being converted to God by the power of this ſpirit, which worketh in our hearts mightily, our minde is caryed wholly to live after the will of that holy ſpirit; ſo that in this way we have no more to doe, but to diſcharge our ſelves of cares and pleaſures of this world, and to be delivered from the body of death, which is after the old man; that we may be preſented in the new man to him that is now inviſible, and that onely hath immortality.</p>

            </p>
            <p>According to this judgement, all the world is made ſubject to God, and guilty of death by the Law in Chriſt Jeſus, and none can be juſtified from ſinne, and ſo freed from the guilt of death, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny works under any worldly or carnall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.—19.20.</p>
            <p>The ſpirituall things wherewith the Prince of the authority of the ayre doth invade, or bring
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44927:44"/>men to death, are declared in the Law to be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three. The firſt, is the ſnare of the hunter. The ſecond, the Peſtilence. The third, the <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teb,</hi> or deſtruction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.3—6.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſnare of the Hunter is ſinne, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whereof is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. All therefore that ſinne againſt the God of their life, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devill are ſubject to all the curſes in the Law of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſecond ſpirituall thing, that from hence doth manifeſtly invade men is, the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or plague of death, which is a ſickneſſe, call <hi>debir,</hi> a thing deſtroying. It is taken with the common ayre which is corrupted and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the crying ſinnes of the moſt people in the mother city, and into whomſoever this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned ayre entreth, it poyſoneth the life, and ſoon killeth the body, except it have iſſue out of the body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The other deadly deſtruction to the body, is called bitter deſtruction, <hi>Dent.</hi> 32.24. which as an evill ſpirit, ſeiſeth upon the body, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth torments in the joynts and ſinewes; which diſeaſe, ſome learned men call, <hi>Ophiſthotonos,</hi> a ſtrange and vehement diſeaſe in the necke, when by the ſtiffeneſſe of the nerves, the necke is ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backward to the ſhoulders, and killeth a man within foure dayes: and therefore it is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy at noone. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.6. becauſe thou maiſt ſee a ſound body thus ſuddenly tormented before
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44927:45"/>thine eyes, and thou canſt ſee nothing but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill done.</p>
            <p>Theſe three evils the Lord Chriſt inflicteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his adverſaries, for the redemption of his Iſrael from deſtruction. Wherefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> applying the ſalvation in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>to</hi> 57. with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 33.9.—14. ſetteth downe five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, (as thoſe which can read the originall text may ſee.)

            <p>From hence we come to apply this preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative againſt the plague and deſtruction; Who is the man whom the Lord will deliver? him that God hath ſeparated as Iſrael, <hi>Exod.</hi> namely, him that knoweth in his conſcience the onely true God, from all other Gods, and that he himſelfe dwelleth under his protection, &amp; delighteth under his ſhadow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.1.—14. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3. This knowledge of God is diſcerned from all falſe knowledge by that, he which hath it keepeth the the Commandements of God, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4. So as he which knoweth the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, is united to the body and Church of Chriſt, and knowes him in ſpirit from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44927:45"/>all falſe Chriſts, or devils; as a woman knowes her husband from all other men; and therefore of all that doe thus diſcerne and know God in Chriſt, he is the Saviour of their bodies, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. This man ſhall be kept in all his waies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. For ſeeing it is the truth in Chriſt, that all that are borne of God doe keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, as the evill one toucheth them not with any juſt accuſation of ſinne, as 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18. with 3.9. It muſt needs follow that God their Father will deliver them alſo from any deadly diſeaſe which is executed for ſinne. This temporary ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is applyed onely by Chriſt, and his Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; not againſt carnall wickedneſſes, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpirituall evils; namely, that theſe plagues ſhall not come without cauſe unto them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.9.

For thus is his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his friends, alſo by warrant from the Law, which ſaith unto him, and the plague ſhall not come neare in thy tabernacle, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91.10, which is not underſtood of any worldly dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as under the Law, but of the ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who with him doe beare the reproach of Chriſt in ſome kind in enmity, that doe come out of the ſinnes of the City, by not partaking with her ſinnes: theſe alſo may have faith, that they ſhall not partake of the plagues of the City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. Neither can any conclude from the Law, that all which live in and under the Law, dye of the plague, doe dye to the ſecond death; for the plague of it ſelfe is onely a bodily execution from God to the firſt death. For when both King and people doe in the feare of the true God, confeſſe and forſake their ſinne, which is the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from the anger of God, and in obedience doe give themſelves to fall into his hands, and rely upon his great mercies, in this caſe; all that dye of the plague wee leave them to the mercy of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44927:46"/>the Lord, by whoſe death the King, and all that remaine, may more earneſtly beſeech the Lord, to remit his hand, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Wherefore every one that can truly apply the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his ſhadow, Chriſt, his Law and truth, to be his ſhield and buckler, and hath in himſelfe the baptiſme of Chriſt; by vertue whereof, he hath alwayes within him the requeſt of a good conſcience calling unto God through the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.) this man hath the faith of God in him, and therefore doth not fear any evill of the day or night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. neither doth he flee as thoſe that are conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their ſins againſt God, but remaineth as ſure as <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is above, and is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the true Children of God: For the rod of wickedneſſe ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous. This is the work of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they pray in faith to be delivered from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill one, and are delivered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. whereas the faith of all that ſerve Idoll Gods is a deceit, and the prayer of the ſinner is abomination, and will work infidelity and terrours from God, as their conſciences do teſtifie, that they may repent of their ſins, and be reconciled unto the true God in truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This aſſurance is to all <hi>Jſrael</hi> in the Law, under the ſigne of the blood of the paſſeover; ſprinckled out on their upper doore poſts whereby they were aſſured that the deſtroyer

            <p>IN my ſleepe by night, I was inſtructed in the righteous judgements of our God, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the judgements of men, thus. There are diverſe States of governement in the world, and theſe all have their Religion ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall under their owne authority. If any of theſe Kingdomes doe ſend forth their ſpirituall authority to condemne and execute all within their Dominion, which (as they terme them) are Heretickes, Schiſmatickes, and Rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent religion or worſhip of God, conſtituted by their Authority: at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of this judgement, all that are guilty in their Conſciences doe flee and hide themſelves as from men, whereas all that are faithfull in that Religion, and devour in that will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, doe not ſcare but are more bold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident under the power of that God, knowing that every man ſhall be examined by name, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be Hereticke; if he be ſo found, it is examined, whether hee will repent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44927:55"/>to their will, and not one ſhall periſh without good tryall.</p>
            <p>Such is the eſtate of the Kingdome of God our Creator, in the authority of his Chriſt, thoſe of the world whoſe hearts condemne them of rebellion againſt the World, and will of Majeſtiſtie, and doe feare, and ſhift to put off his excention, whereas all that repent, and are reconciled to him in all things, and know the reaſon of his judgement, are ſafe from feare of the evill which is ſent againſt thoſe which are from their Maker. For if men be ſo juſt, as nor to condemne one that is no rebell, or that will repent: how ſhall we thinke that the executioners of the judgement of God in the plague, warre, or famine, are careleſſe to deſtroy any one without great cauſe.</p>

            <p n="2">2 I have conſidered, that they which uſe the word of the holy Scriptures, tranſlated or preached in worldly glory under morall authority, their eſtate is farre more inexecuſable, then they which never uſe that word in way of prayer, praiſe, thankeſgiving, or ſpirituall worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe doe not ſo blaſpheme God in Chriſt, as to give that honour unto man, the creature, which is due to the Creator, as the profeſſors doe.</p>
            <p n="3">3.
