            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO HER GRACE THE DUTCHESSE OF PORTSMOUTH.</head>
            <p>BEauty (Madam) has received from Nature a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo pleaſing, that Men contend not with more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for Empire over their own Sex, than ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Yours. Kings have worn Your Sexes Chains with as much pleaſure as their Crowns, and Conquerours have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Your Triumphs with as much delight as they have ſeen their own attended by Kings: A Dominion ſo abſolute, that all Your Commands are Laws. Indeed Princes who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhall be abſolute, their Subjects will force Arbitrary Power upon 'em: Nothing enſlaves like Love, Force binds our Hands, but Love captivates our Hearts. How abſolute then muſt Beauty be? No man yet ever had the will much leſs the power to rebell against it. They who ſhould ſeek to depoſe it, would begin a Civil War in their own boſoms, and lay
<pb facs="tcp:54728:3"/>
waſte and ruinate the moſt delightful Poſſeſſions of their minds. And (laſtly) ſo large, that it finds Subjects where it finds men: Its Empire extends as far as Humane Nature, and its Spoils are all that's excellent in the whole Creation. But men claim to be ſubjects of its Empire as the birth-right of Reaſon, and eſteem that (too) as one of Reaſon's great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. Beaſts are excluded that Claim; cannot be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized into that Dominion, for want of the ennoblements of Reaſon. Men are exalted to love Beauty by the ſame faculty which lifts 'em to adore Heaven; and there is a kind of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Beauty, which makes Love to be a kind of Religion: Beauty is certainly the faireſt viſible Image of Divinity in the world. The Ancients, therefore, built Temples and Altars to it, and ranked it amongst Celeſtial Powers. We Christians have much ado to abſtain from that Idolatry; however we pay it as high Honours, though under other Names. That theſe, Madam, are the Rights and Poſſeſſions of Beauty, you cannot but know; that they are therefore yours all the World knows, but you. But, Madam, wrong your Beauty in your own opinion as much as you pleaſe, you cannot injure it in others; the Sun will ſhine though you wink, and you will be fair, whether you regard it or no. And, that Beauty will have Empire, how great, may appear by the many and mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests it makes; and in a Nation too where you have ſuch numerous and conſiderable Rivals for that Dominion, ſome perhaps as powerful as any in the World, You, like the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of Beauty, gain the Golden Ball, not from humble Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb facs="tcp:54728:3"/>
but your fellow Goddeſſes. How clear a Title you have to it, I ſhall not ſay, for I ſhall not pleaſe you by it, and I ſhall diſpleaſe them: Nothing is ſo hateful to the conquered as to be upbraided with their misfortune: But certainly how mean an opinion ſoever you have, Heaven has none, of that Workmanſhip which he takes care to plant ſuch Lights of Glory round about to ſhew: And though Nature might have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you to more advantage in a greater Empire, and by brighter Lights of Fortune, yet it proves how fond ſhe was of that fair Idea which ſhe was not able to conceal. They then who admire you, ſhew but their good Manners to Nature and Providence, in commending Nature's workmanſhip, and Providence's choice of a Favourite. But I fear the many Fair Ones, over whom you tryumph, will think themſelves treated by this Diſcourſe with too much inſolence; however I am ſure they will not grutch you the few Flowers that a poor Poet brings to ſtrew in your way, eſpecially when they come from Gardens warm'd by the luſtre of your favour; and watered by Royal Bounty, which you caus'd to be ſhower'd upon it: moved to it by no Friends of mine, for I had few; by no Merits, for I had fewer; but only by your own excellent mind. How many attractives then have the following Poems to excuſe their preſſing into your preſence? They attend you not only as born in general Vaſſalage to your Beauty, but as Creatures that received life from the concurrence of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I am now engaging in another Theme more ſafe than the former, I ſhall anger neither Sex by expatiating on an
<pb facs="tcp:54728:4"/>
Excellence which will contract You no envy, Your Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Wit, that Province You may enjoy without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from multitudes of Pretenders, You need not fear lest the ambitious Great Ones of either Sex invade you in it. No (Heaven be thanked) we live in an Age wherein men are content to want it, and to let others poſſeſs as much of it as they pleaſe: We need no Laws to ſecure us in the poſſeſſion of that propriety. Witty men indeed do often quarrel with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it, becauſe they know the value of it; others think it not worth contending for: Againſt it indeed they often ſtrive, and they have reaſon, it treats 'emrudely, will have no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip no acquaintance with them, will make no court to 'em, will ſcarcely lend 'em a little ſenſe for common Converſation: This carriage I must confeſs is very provoking, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when to men of Quality. They have cauſe to be angry with it, and to revenge themſelves of it, as they often ſeek to do, by thrusting it out of their own, or any favour which might advantage it, ſetting up Faſhions, Dreſſes, or any thing in the room of it. Your Grace then muſt both know and value the Jewel well, which you will take up and wear, when it is not only flung into the dirt by others, but trod upon. And wear it ſafely you may. Wit may dreſs you in all the luſtre it has, and never endanger you a blasting from the faſcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of envious and malignant eyes. But though by aſcribing this praiſe to You I diſpleaſe not others, I fear I ſhall Your Grace, for by protecting a deſpiſed Quality You could not aim at praiſe: Beſides praiſe being one of the vaineſt pleaſures
<pb facs="tcp:54728:4"/>
of mankind, ſo excellent a mind cannot nor need not delight in it: You may find ſatisfaction enough at home, You need not go abroad for happineſs. And we who place Your Statues in our Gardens, add no glory to You, only make our own Walks delighted in by our ſelves, and frequented by others, which elſe would lye neglected by both. I fix then Your Grace's Image at this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple Gate, to render the Building ſacred, nor can the <hi>Jews</hi> be angry with ſo beautiful a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation; and in guiding them to You, they are conducted like their Anceſtors to repoſe and happineſs, in the most fair and delightful part of the World. There I ſhall leave 'em, and retire to the contemplation of it, no moderate degree of happineſs to one who is with ſo much devotion,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE world having been kind to theſe Plays, I would not be ſo ungrateful to requite any of my Judges by giving 'em offence, at leaſt if I am ſo unhappy as to do it, I would not willingly let it paſs without ſome Apologie. I have raiſed up an Hero in theſe Plays, which appears to ſome pious Criticks to be an evil Spirit, and makes 'em to have no good opinion of me for having ſuch familiarity with him. There are ſeveral things in his part, and particularly in a Scene of diſpute between him and his Miſtreſs, in the third Act in the ſecond Play, which I have been requeſted by many, and ſome very conſiderable perſons not to print. To comply with 'em I have left out ſome few things, and would willingly have done all, but that on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts I conſidered, the diſarming my Hero was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely to acknowledge him a braver man than he is, and even yield him the better of the cauſe, I therefore thought it would be fairer dealing in the behalf of Truth, which needs no tricks, to expoſe him to all his advantages, ſo make the Victory of Truth the more glorious. And, Reader, if you will pleaſe to peruſe that Scene carefully, you will find he is no ſuch formidable perſon as imagined, and is indebted for
<pb facs="tcp:54728:6"/>
his reputation more to others opinion and partiality, than his own ſtrength. He makes not one argument againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and only evades thoſe that are made for it; as any one of ordinary capacity may eaſily diſcover. Indeed his cauſe will admit of no more. I was loth then to cut off no leſs than a whole limb of a Wretch, who if he had more Hands than <hi>Briareus,</hi> had too few to fight againſt Heaven: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whatever I am imagined to have, I ſhewed him no great kindneſs in ſending him to ſtorm ſo impregnable a Tower, from whence any Child might throw him down. He might eaſier with <hi>Hercules</hi> pull up Trees by the roots, than the notion of a Deity out of the Souls of Men. A Notion ſo ingrafted in us, it ſeems a part of us: Let Men ſtrive never ſo much to get at liberty from it, any hair of their Heads will hold 'em. To conclude, if I cou'd have ſaid more for <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> it argues I have no great kindneſs for a Cauſe I have betray'd; if I ſaid all I cou'd, I hope no one will believe me of an opinion for which I have ſo little to ſay.</p>
            <p>This I think may ſuffice to recover my Reputation with theſe pious Criticks. Before I go home, I muſt viſit a Lady or two by the way, to pacifie if I can their diſpleaſure againſt this Scene alſo. They are angry not at <hi>Phraartes</hi> vigorous talk againſt Religion, but that ſo vigorous a Man ſhould talk at all; they expected on his return from a Victory, ſomething more pleaſing than a Diſpute. I confeſs they know much better than I what pleaſes their Sex; but at this preſent I was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as not to intend to pleaſe 'em. For having employ'd this and two <hi>Heroes</hi> more, for almoſt ten Acts, in nothing elſe but Love, I thought I had given 'em enough for reaſonable Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and might borrow this <hi>Hero</hi> to entertain the Men for a minute with a little reaſon, if it were but to give him ſome
<pb facs="tcp:54728:6"/>
reſpite to breath: but I find 'tis harder to give ſome Ladies enough than I thought it was. Beſides, theſe Ladies may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if they pleaſe, <hi>Phraartes</hi> makes not Love to them, but <hi>Clarona,</hi> to whom a Diſcourſe of Love was not ſo pleaſing as to them, who care to hear nothing elſe; ſhe loved to talk of Religion ſometimes, which they never do it ſeems. She would fain convert <hi>Phraartes,</hi> which they would ne'er have troubled their heads about; he on the other hand had as great a zeal for her Body, and it concerned his Love as much to gain her to his opinions, as it did her piety to gain him to hers; that this very diſpute is in purſuance of his Love, removing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the main, only, and perpetual obſtacle that lay in its way.</p>
            <p>But perhaps a man ought not to talk Reaſon in Love: I confeſs ſince Love has got the ſole poſſeſſion of the Stage, Reaſon has had little to do there; that effeminate Prince has ſoftned and emaſculated us the Vaſſals of the Stage. The Reaſon why the Off-ſprings of the Moderns are ſuch ſhort-liv'd things, is becauſe the Genii that beget 'em are ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to women; they court nothing but the Ladies Favours, with them they waſte all their ſtrength, when as the luſty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients who fed on the wholeſom Diet of good ſenſe, and uſed themſelves to the ſtrong manly exerciſes of Reaſon, have been the Fathers of vigorous Iſſue, who have lived longer than the oldeſt Patriarchs, and are like to live as long as there are men. I who am a Friend both to Love and good Senſe, endeavoured to reconcile 'em, and to bring Reaſon into favour, not with hopes to Rule; I deſired only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him ſome little Office in the Stage, but I find it made an uproar, Love would not endure ſuch an innovation, it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his ſettled Government; and Reaſon is not at all popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
<pb facs="tcp:54728:7"/>
the Ladies knew not what to make of his Converſation, and the men generally ſleep at it; that I ſee but little hopes of his preferment; which I am ſorry for, ſince what future being I ſhall enjoy, I ſhall owe ſolely to him. <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Berenice</hi> as great Gallants as they have been in <hi>France,</hi> and as good a ſhew as they have made in <hi>England,</hi> have not ſuch a ſubſtantial Fortune to maintain them for future Ages, but I am afraid will be reduced to depend on <hi>Phraartes</hi> for a livelihood. The whinings of Love, like a pretty new Tune, pleaſe for a while, but are ſoon laid aſide, and never thought of more; the ſame Notes perhaps may help to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe another, but the old Air is altered, and for ever forgotten.</p>
            <p>But leſt it ſhould be imagined by this long defence, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Plays</hi> to be correct: I acknowledg there are many faults in deſign, which I had no leiſure to mend; and many in Words and Phraſes which I had not incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I love not too much carefulneſs in ſmall things. To be exact in trifles is the buſineſs of a little <hi>Genius.</hi> They therefore who pride themſelves much in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of words and phraſeology, boaſt of knowing little; for thoſe skills appear conſiderable to none, but them who know nothing. Something I intended alſo to ſay in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of my ſelf from theft; ſome Perſons accuſed me of ſtealing the parts of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Berenice</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> Play written by Mr. <hi>Racine</hi> on the ſame ſubject; but a Gentleman having lately tranſlated that Play, and expoſed it to publick view on the Stage, has ſaved me that labour, and vindicated me better than I can my ſelf. I wou'd not be aſham'd to borrow, if my occaſions compell'd me, from
<pb facs="tcp:54728:7"/>
any rich Author: But all Foreign Coin muſt be melted down, and receive a new Stamp, if not an addition of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, before it will paſs current in <hi>England,</hi> and be judged Sterling: That borrowing or ſtealing from Mr. <hi>Racine</hi> could not have ſupplyed my occaſions; but I am not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous yet, nor have lived ſo prodigally on my ſmall ſtock of Poetry, to be put ſo ſoon to thoſe miſerable ſhifts.</p>

                  <l>A Poet lately by you ſent to Hell</l>
                  <l>Juſtly, as he acknowledg'd when he fell:</l>
                  <l>His diſcontented Spirit walks around</l>
                  <l>This Stage, where he receiv'd his mortal Wound.</l>
                  <l>Seeking the reaſon why he walks, we find</l>
                  <l>'Tis to reveal hid Treaſure left behind;</l>
                  <l>Not to build Tombs of honour to his Name,</l>
                  <l>But ranſome us his ſuff'ring friends from ſhame.</l>
                  <l>Some thought becauſe he had not on the Stage,</l>
                  <l>Ranted it oft in huffing Equipage,</l>
                  <l>Profuſely laviſh'd all his wealth away</l>
                  <l>On ſome one lov'd and perhaps jilting Play,</l>
                  <l>(As ſome unhappily have done before)</l>
                  <l>That living niggardly he died but poor;</l>
                  <l>As if that waſting were the way to gain,</l>
                  <l>A Maxime ner'e will within <hi>Ludgate</hi> reign.</l>

                  <l>We find of his, our skill indeed is ſmall,</l>
                  <l>Artiſts alone know Mettle in the Oare,</l>
                  <l>But if it Silver prove we ſtill are poor;</l>

                  <l>You may inſtead of Gold make Leather paſs,</l>
                  <l>As you have done ſometimes by Soveraign Power.</l>
                  <l>And if you do, Wit has no Emperour</l>

                  <l>Where Vertues are by Vices still out-brav'd,</l>
                  <l>And braveſt Men are oft by Slaves enſlav'd.</l>
                  <l>Never was born a Monarch yet in Wit,</l>
                  <l>And none by force that Throne cou'd ever get,</l>
                  <l>Though Uſurpation all of you deſign,</l>
                  <l>And every Senator's a <hi>Cataline.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Keep theſe great Plots among your own high Tribe,</l>
                  <l>But do not Slaves for Senators preſcribe?</l>
                  <l>Poets are Slaves, who but for your delight,</l>
                  <l>Toil in the Muſes Gardens day and night.</l>

                  <l>If ſhe above cou'd ought to pleaſe you ſhew,</l>
                  <l>You will implicitely like all below.</l>
                  <l>The Fool is hardy who to write does dare;</l>
                  <l>As ſtrong in brain as <hi>Sampſon</hi> in his hair</l>

                  <l>But what Allies to aid him he does chuſe?</l>
                  <l>Priests, Women Saints, and Pharaſaick <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>You wicked Wits all Holy things deſpiſe,</l>
                  <l>More charm in 'em then you perceive there lyes.</l>
                  <l>Have you forgot ſince Wit was fool'd by Cant?</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Hero</hi> ruin'd by the ſneaking Saint?</l>
                  <l>Saintſhip was making of a wicked face?</l>
                  <l>And ſnuffling was a certain ſign of Grace?</l>
                  <l>Since by a fine diſtinction then in vogue,</l>
                  <l>The inward Saint was only fac'd with Rogue;</l>
                  <l>And men did ſubt'ly ſplit themſelves in two,</l>
                  <l>And th'outward man did all the miſchief do?</l>
                  <l>If the good Brethren by a chance did fall,</l>
                  <l>In that deep pit of ſin you Wenching call,</l>
                  <l>'Twas but the outward Knave that was unchaſt,</l>
                  <l>And Siſters ſinn'd but downward from the waſt;</l>
                  <l>The inward Maid as chast was as before,</l>
                  <l>And th'upper parts did ſanctifie the low'r.</l>

Thus they cou'd ſin, and yet be Siſters too;</l>
                  <l>Women are Wenches ſtraight, who ſin with you.</l>
                  <l>Since thoſe falſe Phariſees did works ſo great,</l>
                  <l>Why may not true ones do a little cheat?</l>
                  <l>Pervert your likings to theſe wretched Plays,</l>
