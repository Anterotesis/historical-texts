            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Healing Queſtion propounded
and reſolved upon occaſion of the late publique
and ſeaſonable Call to Humiliation, in order to
love and union amongſt the honeſt party, and
with a deſire to apply Balſome to the wound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it become incurable.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Queſtion propounded is, What poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
doth yet remain (all things conſidered)
of reconciling and uniting the diſſenting
judgments of honeſt men within the three
Nations, who ſtill pretend to agree in the
ſpirit, juſtice, and reaſon of the ſame good cauſe; and
what are the means to effect this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be taken for granted (as on the Magiſtrates
part, from the ground inviting the people of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Wales</hi> to a ſolemn day of Faſting and Humiliation,
may not be diſpaired of) that all the diſſenting parties
agree ſtill in the ſpirit and reaſon of the ſame righteous
cauſe, the reſolution ſeems very cleer in the affirmative;
arguing not onely for a poſſibility, but a great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
hereof, nay a neceſſity daily approaching neerer
and neerer to compell it, if any or all of the diſſenting
parties intend or deſire to be ſafe from the danger of the
common enemy, who is not out of work, though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
much out of ſight and obſervation.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this are briefly theſe. Firſt the cauſe
hath ſtill the ſame goodneſs in it as ever; and is or
ought to be as much in the hearts of al good people that
have adhered to it. It is not leſſe to be valued now, then
when neither blood nor treaſure were thought too dear
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106421:2"/>
to carry it on, and hold it up from ſinking; and hath
the ſame Omnipotent God, whoſe great Name is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, as well as his peoples outward ſafety and
wellfare; Who knows alſo how to give a revival to it,
when ſecondary inſtruments and viſible means fail, or
prove deceitful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Perſons concerned and engaged in
this Cauſe, are ſtill the ſame as before; with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of being more tried, more enured to danger and
hardſhip, and more endeared to one another, by their
various and great experiences, as well of their own
hearts as their fellow-Brethrens. Theſe are the ſame
ſtill in heart and deſire after the ſame thing, which is,
that being freed out of the hands of their enemies, they
may ſerve the Lord without feare, in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
all the daies of their life.</p>
            <p>As they have had this great good finally in their aims
(if Declarations to men, and Appeals to God ſignifie
any thing) ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a requiſite to attain this, they did with
great cheerfulnes &amp; unanimity draw out themſelves to
the utmoſt, in the maintenance of a war, when all other
meanes, firſt eſſayed proved ineffectual. In the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this war, it pleaſed God (the righteous Judge,
who was appealed to in the controverſie) ſo to bleſs the
Council, and Forces of the perſons concerned and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in this cauſe, as in the end to make them abſolute
and compleat Conquerors over their common Enemy.
And by this meanes they had added unto the naturall
right which was in them before (and ſo declared by
their Repreſentatives in Parliament aſſembled) the
right of Conqueſt for the ſtrengthening of their juſt claim
to be governed by National Councils, and ſucceſſive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives
of their own election and ſetting up. This
they once thought they had been in poſſeſſion of, when
it was ratified, as it were, in the blood of the laſt King:
But of late a great interruption having happened unto
them in their former expectations, and inſtead thereof,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106421:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſomething riſing up that ſeems rather accommodated to
the private and ſelfiſh intereſt of a particular part (in
compariſon) then truly adequate to the common good
and concern of the whole Body engaged in this Cauſe:
Hence it is that this compacted body is now falling aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
into many diſſenting parts (a thing unforeſeen,
nor unhoped for by the common Enemy all along as
their laſt relief) and if theſe breaches be not timely
healed, and the offences (before they take too deep root)
removed, they will certainly work more to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of our common Enemy, then any of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
endeavours, &amp; dangerous contrivances in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
parts put altogether.</p>
            <p>A ſerious diſcuſſion, and ſober enlarging upon theſe
grounds, will quickly give an inſight into the ſtate of
the Queſtion, and naturally tend to a plain and familiar
reſolution thereof.</p>
            <p>That which is firſt to be opened, is the nature and
goodnes of the Cauſe; which had it not carried in it its
own evidence, would ſcarce have found ſo many of the
people of God adherers to it, within the Three Nations,
contributing either their counſels, their purſes, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
pains, or their affections and prayers, as a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſtrength; without which, the military force alone
would have been little available to ſubdue the common
Enemy, and reſtore to this whole body their juſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Rights in civil things, and true freedome in matters
of conſcience.</p>
            <p>The two laſt mentioned particulars, rightly ſtated,
will evidence ſufficiently the nature and goodneſſe of
this Cauſe</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, that is to ſay, the Natural right,
which the whole party of Honeſt men adhering to this
Cauſe, are by ſucceſſe of their Arms reſtored unto, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in, and may claime as their undeniable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that righteouſly cannot be taken from them, nor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106421:3"/>
they debarred from bringing into exerciſe, It lies in
this.</p>
            <p>They are to have and enjoy the freedome (by way
of dutifull compliance and condiſcention from all the
parts and members of this ſociety) to ſet up meet
perſons in the place of Supreme Judicature and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
amongſt them; whereby they may have the uſe and
benefit of the choiceſt light and wiſedome of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they are capable to call forth, for the Rule and
Government under which they will live; and through
the orderly exerciſe of ſuch meaſure of wiſedome and
counſel as the Lord in this way ſhall pleaſe to give unto
them, to ſhape and forme all ſubordinate actings and
adminiſtrations of Rule and Government, ſo as ſhall
beſt anſwer the publique welfare and ſafety of the
whole.</p>
            <p>This, in ſubſtance, is the right and freedome contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the nature and goodneſſe of the cauſe, wherein
the Honeſt party have been engaged. For in this, all the
particulars of our civill right and freedome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
conſerved in and derived from their proper
root; In which whilſt they grow, they will ever thrive,
flouriſh and increaſe: whereas on the contrary, if there
be never ſo many fair branches of liberty planted on
the root of a private and ſelfiſh intereſt, they will not
long proſper, but muſt, within a little time, wither and
degenerate into the nature of that whereinto they are
planted. And hence indeed ſprung the evil of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
which roſe in and with the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>The root and bottome upon which it ſtood, was not
publique intereſt, but the private luſt and will of the
Conqueror, who by force of armes did at firſt detein
the right and freedome which was, and is, due to the
whole body of the people: For whoſe ſafety and good,
government it ſelf is ordained by God, not for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106421:3"/>
benefit of the Rulers, as a diſtinct and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the moſt part, is not
onely preferred before the common good, but upheld in
oppoſition thereunto. And as at firſt the Conqueror did,
by violence and force, deny this freedome to the people,
which was their natural right and priviledge; ſo he,
and his Succeſſors all along, lay as bars and impediments
to the true National intereſt and publique good, in the
very National Councils and Aſſemblies themſelves;
which were conſtituted in ſuch a manner, as moſt ſerved
for the upholding of the private intereſt of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
And this being challenged by them as their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
was found by the people aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
moſt unrighteous, burdenſome, and deſtructive to
their liberty. And when they once perceived, that by
this Engine all their juſt rights were like to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
eſpecially (being backed, as it was, with the power
of the Militia, which the late King, for that purpoſe,
had aſſumed into his hands, and would not, upon the
peoples application to him in Parliament part with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of that great Councill, who were beſt to be
entruſted with the Nations ſafety) this was the ground
of the quarrell, upon a civil account, between the King
and his party, and the whole body of adherents to the
cauſe of the peoples true liberty; whereof this ſhort
touch hath been given, and ſhall ſuffice for the opening
of the firſt Branch of this Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch which remaines briefly to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
is that which alſo upon the grounds of natural
right is to be laid claim unto; but diſtinguiſhes it ſelf
from the former, as it reſpects a more heavenly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
object, wherein the freedome is to be exerciſed
and enjoyed, that is to ſay, matters of Religion, or that
concern the ſervice and worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Unto this freedome the Nations of the World have
right and title, by the purchaſe of Chriſts blood; who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106421:4"/>
by vertue of his death and reſurrection is become the
ſole Lord and Ruler in and over the conſcience; for to
this end Chriſt died, roſe and revived, that he might be
Lord both of the dead and of the living; and that every
one might give an account of himſelf in all matters of
Gods worſhip, unto God and Chriſt alone, as their own
Maſter, unto whom they ſtand or fall in judgement, and
are not in theſe things to be oppreſſed, or brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judgment-ſeats of men. For why ſhouldeſt
thou ſet at nought thy Brother in matters of his Faith
and conſcience, and herein intrude into the proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Chriſt, ſince we are all to ſtand before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat
of Chriſt, whether Governours or governed,
and by his deciſion onely are capable of being declared
with certainty, to be in the right or in the wrong?</p>
            <p>By vertue then of this Supream Law, ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the blood of Chriſt unto all men (whoſe ſouls
he challenges a propriety in, to bring under his inward
rule in the ſervice and worſhip of God) it is that all
Magiſtrates are to ſear and forbear intermedling with
giving rule or impoſing in thoſe matters They are to
content themſelves with what is plain in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
as ordained of God to be his Miniſter unto men
for good, whileſt they approve themſelves the doe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

a cleare and perfect judgement: In which caſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is to be for praiſe and protection to them. In
like manner he is to be a Miniſter of terrour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to thoſe that doe evill in matters of outward
practice, converſe, and dealings in the things of this life
between man and man, for the cauſe whereof the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures
of men are appointed and ſet up. But to exceed
theſe limits, as it is not ſafe nor warrantable for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
(in that he who is higher then the higheſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards,
and will ſhew himſelf diſpleaſed at it) ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is it good for the people, who hereby are nouriſhed
up in biting, devouring, wrathfull ſpirit one againſt
another, and are found tranſgreſſors of that Royal law
which forbids us to doe that unto another, which we
would not have them do unto us, were we in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>This freedome then is of high concern to be had and

in the Magiſtrates forbearing to put forth the power of

if it be taken in its proper ſeaſon and that this reſtraint

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be ſo well provided for,
that we ſhall have no cauſe to feare, as it may be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</p>
            <p>By this meanes a great part of the outward exerciſe
of Antichriſtian Tyranny and bondage will be plucked
up by the very roots; which till ſome ſuch courſe be
held in it, will be alwayes apt to renew and ſprout out
afreſh, under ſome new forme or refined appearances,
as by late yeares experience we have been taught. For
ſince the fall of the Biſhops and perſecuting Presbyteries,
the ſame ſpirit is apt to ariſe in the next ſort of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106421:5"/>
that can get the ear of the Magiſtrate, and pretend
to the keeping and ruling the conſcience of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.
Although this ſpirit and practice hath been all
along decried by the faithful adherents to this Cauſe,
as a moſt ſore oppreſſion, and inſufferable yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
moſt unrighteouſly kept up over the conſciences
of the people; and therefore judged by them moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be taken out of the way. And in this matter the
preſent Governors have been willing very eminently
to give their Teſtimony, in their publique Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
however in practice there is much of grievance
yet found among us, though more, in probability,
from the officiouſneſſe of ſubordinate Miniſters, then
any clear purpoſe or deſigne of the chief in power.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed what the true freedom is, in both
the Branches of it, that ſhines forth in the righteous
Cauſe, wherein the good people of theſe Nations have
ſo deeply engaged: It will not be improper in the next
place to conſider two particulars more that give ſtill
further light into the matter in queſtion; as firſt The
qualifications of the Perſons that have adhered to this
Cauſe. Secondly, the capacity wherein they have been
found from time to time carrying it on.</p>
            <p>As to their Qualification, they have in the general,
diſtinguiſhed themſelves and been made known, by a
forwardneſs to aſſiſt and own the publique welfare and
good of the Nation, for the attaining and preſerving
the juſt rights and liberties thereof, aſſerted and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
unto in the true ſtating of this Cauſe, according to
the two branches thereof already ſpoken to. They have
ſhewed themſelves, upon all occaſions, deſirers and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of true freedom, either in civils, or in ſpirituals, or
in both. To expreſs their value thereof, and faithfulnes
to the ſame, they have largely contributed, in one kind
or other what was proper to each in his place to do;
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> actions of theirs proceeding from hearts ſincerely
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106421:5"/>
affected to the cauſe, created in them aright to be
of an Incorporation and Society by themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of the good Party; having been from
the beginning unto this day publiquely and commonly
ſo acknowledged, by way of diſtinction from all Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
cloſe and open Enemies, and deceitfull Friends
or Apoſtates. Theſe, in order to the maintaining of
this Cauſe, have ſtood by the Army, in defence and
ſupport thereof, againſt all oppoſition whatever, as
thoſe that, by the growing light of theſe times, have
been taught and led forth in their experiences, to look
above and beyond the letter, forme, and outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of government, into the inward reaſon
and ſpirit thereof, herein only to fix and terminate,
to the leaving behind all empty ſhadows, that would
obtrude themſelves in the place of true freedome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the capacity wherein theſe perſons,
thus qualified, have acted, it hath been very variable,
and ſubject to great changes: ſometimes in one form,
and ſometimes in another, and very ſeldome, if ever
at all, ſo exactly, and in all points conſonant to the
rule of former Lawes and Conſtitutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to be clearly and fully juſtified by them, any
longer then the Law of Succeſſe and Conqueſt did
uphold them who had the inward warrant of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Righteouſneſſe to encourage them in ſuch
their actings.</p>
            <p>The utmoſt and laſt reſerve therefore which they have
had, in caſe all other failed, hath been their military
capacity, not only ſtrictly taken for the ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but in the largeſt ſenſe, wherein the whole party
may (with the Army, and under that military conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and conduct, which by the providence of God
they ſhall then be found in) aſſociate themſelves in the
beſt order they can, for the common defence and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the whole. As not ignorant, that when once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106421:6"/>
in this their Military poſture, in ſuch manner
as by common conſent ſhall be found requiſite for the
ſafety of the body, they are moſt irreſiſtible, abſolute,
and comprehenſive in their power; having that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſubſtance of all Government is contained, and
under the protection whereof, and ſafety that may be
maintained thereby, they can contrive and determine,
in what manner this irreſiſtible, abſolute, and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
power, unto which they are now arrived in this
their Military capacity ſhall have juſt and due limits
ſet unto it, and be drawn out in a meet and orderly
way of exerciſe, for the Commonweale and ſafety of
the whole Body, under the rule and overſight of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Judicature; unto the wiſedome of whoſe lawes
and orders, the ſword is to become moſt entirely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and ſubſervient: And this without the leaſt cauſe
of jealouſie or unſafety, either to the ſtanding Army,
or any member thereof, or unto the good people adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to this Cauſe, or any one of them; ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of both, by this mutual action of either, will be
ſo combined together in one (even in that wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were diſtinct) that all juſt cauſe of difference,
fear, animoſity emulation, jealouſie, or the like, will
be wholly aboliſhed and removed.</p>
            <p>For when once the whole body of the good people
find that the Military intereſt &amp; capacity is their own,
and that into which neceſſity at the laſt may bring the
whole Party (whereof of right a place is to be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for them) and that herein they are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſubjection or ſlavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this poſture they
are moſt properly ſoveraign, and poſſeſſe their right
of natural ſoveraignty, they will preſently ſee a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of continuing ever one with their Army raiſed and
maintained by them, for the promoting this Cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the common Enemy; who in his next attempt
will put for all with greater deſperateneſſe and rage
then ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106421:6"/>
Again, when once the ſtanding Army and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
ſhall alſo find, that by ſetting and keeping up
themſelves in a divided intereſt from the reſt of the
Body of Honeſt men, they withhold from themſelves
thoſe contributions in all voluntary and cheerful aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
by the affections and prayers, by the perſons
and purſes of the good party, to the weakening them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
thereby, as to any vigerous ſupport from them, in
the times of moſt imminent danger (whereof the late
King had an experience, that will not ſuddenly be out
of memory, when he undertook the war in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of theſe troubles, againſt the Scots, and was, in a
manner, therein deſerted by all the good party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
they will then find (if they ſtay not till it be too
late) that by eſpouſing the intereſt of the people, in
ſubmitting themſelves with their fellow adherents to
the Cauſe, under the rule and authority of their own
Supreme Judicature, they loſe not their Power or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty;
but becoming one Civil or Politique In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
with the whole party of honeſt men, they
doe therein keep the Soveraignty, as originally ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in themſelves, and part with it only but as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and repreſentation of themſelves, when it is
brought into an orderly way of exerciſe, by being put
into the hands of perſons choſen and entruſted by
themſelves to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>By this mutual and happy tranſition which may be
made between the party of Honeſt men in the Three
Nations virtually in Arms, and thoſe actually ſo now in
power at the Head of the Army, how ſuddenly would
the union of the whole Body be conſolidated, and made
ſo firm as it will not need to fear all the deſignes and
attempts of the common Enemy; eſpecially if herein
they unite themſelves in the firſt place to the Lord, as
willing to follow his providence, and obſerve his will
in the way and manner of bringing this to paſſe. In
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106421:7"/>
which caſe we ſhall not need to fear what all the gates
of hell are able to do in oppoſition thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is not then the ſtanding and being of the preſent
Army and Military forces in the three Nations, that is
lyable to exception or offence; from any diſſenting
judgements at this time amongſt the honeſt well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
party. In and with them, under God, ſtand the
welfare and outward ſafety of the whole body; and
to be enemies to them or wiſh them hurt, were to do
it to themſelves; and by trying ſuch concluſions to
play the game of the common enemy, to the utter ruine
and deſtruction, not only of the true freedome aymed
at and contended for in the late wars, but of the very
perſons themſelves that have been in any ſort active or
eminent promoters thereof.</p>
            <p>The Army conſidered as it is in the hands of an
honeſt and wiſe General, and ſober faithfull Officers,
embodied with the reſt of the party of honeſt men;
and eſpouſing ſtill the ſame cauſe, and acting in their
primitive ſimplicity, humility, and truſt, in reference
to the welfare and ſafety of the whole body, is the only
juſtifyable and moſt advantagious poſture and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that the good party at preſent can finde themſelves
in, in order to the obtaining that true freedome they
have fought for, and poſſeſſing of it in the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof upon the true Baſis and foundation, as
hath been ſhewed of right Government.</p>
            <p>That wherein the offence lies, and which cauſes ſuch
great thoughts of heart amongſt the honeſt party (if it
may be freely expreſſed, as ſure it may, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
himſelfe profeſſes he doth but deſire and wait
for conviction therein) is in ſhort this.</p>
            <p>That when the right and priviledge is returned,
nay is reſtored by Conqueſt unto the whole Body (that
forfeited not their intereſt therein) of freely diſpoſing
themſelves in ſuch a conſtitution of righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106421:7"/>
as may beſt anſwer the ends held forth in
this Cauſe; that nevertheleſſe, either through delay
they ſhould be withheld as they are, or through deſign
they ſhould come at laſt to be utterly denied the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of this their right, upon pretence that they are
not in capacity as yet to uſe it; which indeed hath
ſome truth in it, if thoſe that are now in power, and
have the command of the Arms, doe not prepare all
things requiſite thereunto, as they may, and like faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Guardians to the Commonwealth, admitted to be
in its nonage, they ought.</p>
            <p>But if the bringing of true freedome into exerciſe
amongſt men, yea, ſo refined a party of men, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible;
why hath this been concealed all this while?
and why was it not thought on before ſo much blood
was ſpilt, and treaſure ſpent? ſurely, ſuch a thing as
this was judged real and practicable, not imaginary
and notional.</p>
            <p>Beſides, why may it not ſuffice to have been thus
long delayed and withheld from the whole body, at
leaſt as to its being brought by them into exerciſe
now at laſt? ſurely the longer it is withheld, the
ſtronger jealouſies do increaſe; that it is intended to be
aſſumed and ingroſſed by a part only, to the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the reſt of the body (who in all reaſon and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ought to be equally participants with the other in
the right and benefit of the Conqueſt, for as much as
the war was managed at the expence and for the ſafety
of the whole) in a condition almoſt as much expoſed,
and ſubject to be impoſed upon, as if they had been
enemies and conquered, not in any ſenſe Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>If ever ſuch an unrighteous, unkind and deceitful
dealing with brethren ſhould happen, although it
might continue above the reach of queſtion from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
judicature, yet can we think it poſſible it ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106421:8"/>
eſcape and go unpuniſhed by the immediate hand of
the Righteous Judge of the whole World, when he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
out of his place to do right to the oppreſſed?</p>
            <p>Nay if in ſtead of favouring and promoting the
peoples common good and welfare, ſelf-intereſt and
private gain ſhould evidently appear to be the things
we have aymed at all along; if thoſe very Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
principles and Antichriſtian reliques, which God
by us hath puniſhed in our predeceſſors, ſhould again
revive, ſpring up afreſh, and ſhew themſelves lodged
alſo and retained in our boſomes; rendring us of the
number of thoſe that have forgot they were purged
from their old ſins, and declaring us to be ſuch as to
pleaſe a covetous mind, doe withhold from deſtruction
that which God hath deſigned to the curſe of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:
If all thoſe great advantages of ſerving the
Lords will and deſign in procuring and advancing his
peoples true welfare and outward ſafety, which (as
the fruit of his bleſſing upon our Armies) have ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
fallen into our hands, ſhall at laſt be
wreſted and miſ-improved to the enriching and
greatning of our ſelves: If theſe things ſhould ever
be found amongſt us (which the Lord in mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid)
ſhall we need to look any further for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
thing? will not our Conſciences ſhew us from
the light of the Word and Spirit of God, how neer a
conformity theſe actions would hold therewith?
which ſin, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. became a curſe to the Camp, and
withheld the Lord from being any more amongſt
them, or going out with their forces. And did the
action of <hi>Achan</hi> import any more then theſe two
things. Firſt, he ſaved and kept from deſtruction the
goodly Babyloniſh garment, which was devoted by
God thereunto. Secondly, he brought not in the
fruit and gain of the Conqueſt into the Lords Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
but covetouſly went about to convert it to his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106421:8"/>
own proper uſe. To doe this, is to take of the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thing, which <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. all Iſrael was ſaid to do, in
the ſin of <hi>Achan,</hi> and to have ſtollen and diſſembled
likewiſe, and put it amongſt their own ſtuffe. This
cauſed the anger of the Lord to kindle againſt Iſrael,
and made them unable to ſtand before their enemies,
but their hearts melted as water. And thus far the
Lord is concerned, if ſuch an evil as this ſhall lye hid in
the midſt of us. But to return to what we were upon
before.</p>
            <p>The matter which is in queſtion among the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
parts of the whole body of honeſt men, is not ſo
trivial and of ſuch ſmall conſequence, as ſome would
make it. 'Tis in effect, the main and whole of the
Cauſe; without which all the freedome which the
people have or can have, is in compariſon but ſhadow
and in name only, and therefore can never give that
peace and ſatisfaction to the body, which is requiſite
unto a durable and ſolid ſettlement. This is that which
makes all ſound &amp; ſafe at the root, and gives the right
ballance neceſſary to be held up between ſoveraignity
and ſubjection, in the exerciſe of all righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
applying the uſe of the ſword to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
and upholding the publike ſafety and welfare
of the whole body, in preference and if need be in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
unto any of the parts; whilſt yet by its equal
and impartial adminiſtration in reference unto each,
it doth withal maintain the whole Body in a moſt
delightfull harmony, welfare, and correſpondency.
The ſword never can nor is it to be expected ever will
doe this, while the ſoveraignity is admitted and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
any where elſe, then in the whole Body of the
people that have adhered to the cauſe, and by them be
derived unto their ſucceſſive Repreſentatives, as the
moſt equal and impartial Judicature for the effecting
hereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106421:9"/>
Where there is then a righteous and good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Government, there is firſt an orderly union
of many underſtandings together, as the publique and
common Supream Judicature or viſible Soveraignity,
ſet in a way of free and orderly exerciſe, for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
and applying the uſe of the ruling power or the
ſword, to promote the intereſt and common welfare
of the whole, without any diſturbance or annoyance,
from within or from without. And then ſecondly,
there is a like union and readineſs of will in all the
Individuals, in their private capacities, to execute and
obey (by all the power requiſite, and that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to put forth) thoſe ſoveraign Laws and Orders iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out by their own Deputies and Truſtees.</p>
            <p>A Supream Judicature thus made the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the whole, is that which we ſay, will moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
care, and moſt equally provide for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good and ſafety. Though by this it is not
denied, but that the ſupream power, when by free
conſent 'tis placed in a ſingle perſon or in ſome few
perſons, may be capable alſo to adminiſter righteous
Government; at leaſt the Body that gives this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when they need not, are to thank themſelves if it
prove otherwiſe. But when this free and natural
acceſſe unto Government, is interrupted and declined,
ſo as a liberty is taken by any particular member, or
number of them, that are to be reputed but a part in
compariſon of the whole, to aſſume and engroſſe the
office of ſoveraign rule and power, and to impoſe
themſelves as the competent publique Judge of the
ſafety and good of the whole, without their free and
due conſent; and to lay claim unto this, as thoſe that
find themſelves poſſeſſed of the ſword (and that ſo
advantagiouſly, as it cannot be recovered again out of
their hands, without more apparent danger and
damage to the whole body, then ſuch attempts are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106421:9"/>
wortth) this is that Anarchy that is the firſt riſe and
ſtep to Tyanny; and laies the grounds of manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and diſorder; expoſing the ruling power to the
next hand that on the next opportunity can lay hold
on the ſword; and ſo, by a kind of neceſſity, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
the higheſt impoſition and bondage upon the
whole Body, in compelling all the parts, though never
ſo much againſt the true publique intereſt, to ſerve and
obey, as their ſoveraigne rule and ſupream Authority,
the Arbitrary will and judgement of thoſe that bring
themſelves into rule by the power of the ſword, in the
right only of a part that ſets up it ſelfe in preference
before, or at leaſt in competition with the melfare of
the whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And if this, which is ſo eſſential to the well being
and right conſtitution of Government, were once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the diſputes about the forme would not prove
ſo dificult, nor find ſuch oppoſition, as to keep up the
bone of contention and diſunion, with much danger
to the whole. For if as the foundation of all, the
ſoveraignty be ackowledged to reſide originally in
the whole body of adherents to this Cauſe (whoſe
natural and inherent right thereunto is of a far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
date then what is obtained by ſucceſs of their
arms, and ſo cannot be abrogated even by Conqueſt it
ſelfe if that were the caſe) and then if in conſequence
hereof, a ſupream Judicature be ſet up and orderly
conſtituted, as naturally ariſing and reſulting from
the free choice and conſent of the whole Body, taken
out from among themſelves, as fleſh of their fleſh, and
bone of their bone, of the ſame publique ſpirit and
nature with themſelves, and the main be by this
means ſecured; what could be propounded afterwards,
as to the form of adminiſtration that would much
ſtick?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106421:10"/>
Would a ſtanding Council of State ſetled for life,
in reference to the ſafety of the Commonwealth, and for
the maintaining intercourſe and commerce with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
States, under the inſpection and overſight of
the Supreme Judicature, but of the ſame fundamental
conſtitution with themſelves, would this be diſliked?
admitting their orders were binding, in the intervals
of Supreme National Aſſemblies, ſo far only as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to the ſettled Lawes of the Common-wealth
the vacancy of any of which by death or otherwiſe
might be ſupplied by the vote of the major part of
themſelves. Nay would there be any juſt exception
to be taken, if (beſides both theſe) it ſhould be agreed
(as another part of the fundamental conſtitution of the
Government) to place that branch of Soveraignty
which chiefly reſpects the execution of the Lawes, in a
diſtinct office from that of the legiſlative power (and
yet ſubordinate to them and to the Lawes) capable to
be entruſted in the hands of one ſingle perſon, if need
require, or in a greater number, as the legiſlative
power ſhould think fit; and for the greater ſtrength
and honour unto this Office, that the execution of
all Lawes and Orders (that are binding) may go forth
in his, or their name; and all diſobedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
or contempt thereof, be taken as done to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Soveraignty whereof he or they bear the Image or
Repreſentation, ſubordinate to the Legiſlative Power,
and at their will to be kept up and continued in the
hands of a ſingle Perſon or more, as the experience of
the future good or evil of it ſhall require.</p>
            <p>Would ſuch an office as this, thus ſtated, carry in
it any inconſiſtency with a free State? nay, if it be
well conſidered, would it not rather be found of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
uſe to the well-being of Magiſtracy founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this righteous bottome, that ſuch a Lieftenancy of
the peoples ſoveraignty in theſe three Nations, may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106421:10"/>
alwayes reſide in ſome one or more perſons, in whoſe
adminiſtration, that which is reward and puniſhment
may ſhine forth?</p>
            <p>And if now it ſhall be objected, that (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all theſe Cautions) ſhould once the Soveraignty be
acknowledged to be in the diffuſed body of the people
(though the adherents to this Cauſe, not only as their
natural, but as their acquired right by Conqueſt)
they would ſuddenly put the uſe and exerciſe of the
Legiſlative power into ſuch hands, as would, through
their ill-qualifiedneſſe to the work ſpoil all, by male-adminiſtration
thereof, and hereby loſe the cauſe in
ſtead of upholding and mantaining it.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer unto this is, Firſt that God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath eaſed our minds much of this ſolicitude,
by the courſe he hath already taken to fit and prepare
a choice and ſelected number of the people unto this
work, that are tried and refined by their inward and
outward experiences in this great quarrell, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
changes they have paſſed through: In reſpect
whereof well qualified perſons are to be found, if due
care be but taken in the choice of them. And if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the people of the Lord ſhall be waiting upon him for
his guidance and preſence with them, we may have
grounds to hope that God (whoſe name hath all along
been called upon in the managing of this Cauſe) will
pour out ſo abundantly of his ſpirit upon his people
attending on him in righteous wayes, and will alſo ſo
move their hearts to chooſe perſons bearing his
Image into the Magiſtracy, that a more glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
may ſpring up out of this then at firſt we can
expect, to the ſetting up of the Lord himſelfe as chiefe
Judge and Lawgiver amongſt us. And unto this the
wiſedome and honeſty of the perſons now in power
May have an opportunity eminently to come into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
For in this caſe, and upon the grounds alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106421:11"/>
layed, the very perſons now in power are they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whoſe lot it would fall to ſet about this preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
work; and by their orders and directions to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the whole Body, and bring them into the meeteſt
capacity to effect the ſame. The moſt natural way for
which would ſeem to be by a General Council, or
Convention of faithful, honeſt, and diſcerning men,
choſen for that purpoſe by the free conſent of the
whole Body of adherents to this Cauſe in the ſeveral
parts of the Nations, and obſerving the time and place
of meeting appointed to them (with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
concerning their Election) by order from the
preſent Ruling Power, but conſidered as General of
the Army.</p>
            <p>Which Convention is not properly to exerciſe the
Legiſlative Power, but only to debate freely, and agree
upon the particulars, that by way of fundmental
Conſtitutions ſhall be laid and inviolably obſerved, as
the conditions upon which the whole body ſo repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
doth conſent to caſt it ſelfe into a Civil and
Politique Incorporation, and under the viſible forme
and adminiſtration of Government therein declared,
and to be by each individual member of the Body
ſubſcribed in teſtimony of his or their particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
given thereunto. Which conditions ſo agreed (and
amongſt them an Act of Oblivion for one) will be
without danger of being broken or departed from;
conſidering of what it is they are the conditions,
and the nature of the Convention wherin they are
made; which is of the people repreſented in their
higheſt ſtate of Soveraignty, as they have the ſword in
their hands unſubjected unto the rules of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but what themſelves orderly aſſembled for
that purpoſe, doe think fit to make. And the ſword
upon theſe conditions ſubjecting it ſelf to the Supreme
Judicature, thus to be ſet up; how ſuddenly might
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106421:11"/>
harmony, righteouſneſs, love, peace, and ſafety unto
the whole Body follow hereupon, as the happy fruit
of ſuch a ſettlemeut, if the Lord have yet any delight
to be amongſt us?</p>
            <p>And this once put in a way, and declared for by the
General and Army (as that which they are clearly
convinced in the ſight of God is their duty to bring
about, and which they engage accordingly to ſee
done;) How firmly and freely would this oblige the
hearts and perſons, the counſels &amp; purſes, the affections
and prayers, with all that is in the power of this whole
party to do, in way of aſſiſtance and ſtrenthning the
hands of thoſe now in power, whatever ſtraights and
difficulties they may meet with in the maintenance of
the publique ſafety and peace?</p>
            <p>This then being the ſtate of our preſent affairs and
differences, let it be acknowledged on all hands, and
let all be convinced that are concerned, that there is
not only a poſſibility, but a probability, yea a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
neceſſity of a firm union in this great Body,
the ſetting of which in joynt and tune againe, by a
ſpirit of meekneſs and feare of the Lord, is the work
of the preſent day, and will prove the onely remedy,
under God, to uphold and carry on this bleſſed cauſe
and worke of the Lord in the three Nations, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come thus far onwards in its progreſſe to its
deſired and expected end of bringing in Chriſt, the
Deſire of all Nations, as the chiefe Ruler amongſt
us.</p>
            <p>Now unto this re-uniting work let there be a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in all the diſſenting parts from the higheſt to the
loweſt, by cheerfully coming forth to one another in
a ſpirit of ſelf-denial and love in ſtead of war and
wrath, and to caſt down themſelves before the Lord,
who is the Father of all their ſpirits, in ſelf-abaſement
and humiliation, for the mutual offence they have been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106421:12"/>
in for ſome time paſt, one unto another, and great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
unto God, and reproach unto his moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
name, who expected to have been ſerved by them
with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
fire.</p>
            <p>And, as an inducement unto this, Let us aſſure our
ſelves, the meanes of effecting it will not prove ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
as other things that have been brought about in
the late war, if the minds and ſpirits of all concerned
were once well and duely prepared hereunto, by a
kindly work of ſelf-denial and ſelf-abaſement, ſet
home by the ſpirit of the Lord upon their conſciences;
which if he pleaſe, he may doe we know not how ſoon.
Nay if we ſhall behold with a diſcerning eye the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of that work which God hath been doing amongſt
us the three years laſt paſt, it would ſeem chiefly to
have been his aime, to bring his people into ſuch a frame
as this is. For in this tract of time, there hath
been (as we may ſay) a great ſilence in Heaven, as
if God were pleaſed to ſtand ſtill and be as a looker
on, to ſee what his people would be in their latter end,
and what work they would make of it, if left to their
own wiſedome and Politick contrivances. And as
God hath had the ſilent part; ſo men, and that good
men too, have had the active and buſie part, and
have like themſelves made a great ſound and noiſe,
like the ſhout of a King in a mighty Hoaſt; which
whilſt it hath been a ſound onely and no more, hath
not done much hurt as yet; but the feare and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
thereby cauſed, hath put the whole Body out of
frame, and made them apt to fall into great confuſions
and diſorder.</p>
            <p>And if there be thus ariſen a general diſſent and
diſagreement of parts (which is not, nor ought to be
accounted the leſſe conſiderable, becauſe it lies hid
and kept in under a patient ſilence) why ſhould there
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106421:12"/>
not be as general a confeſſion and acknowledgement of
what each may find themſelves overtaken in, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but judge themſelves faulty for? This kinde of
vent being much better then to have it break out
in flames of a forward and untimely wrathful ſpirit
which never works the righteouſneſſe of God. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince what hath been done amongſt us, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
have been more the effect of temptation then
the product of any malicious deſigne; and this ſort
of temptation is very common and incident to men
in power (how good ſoever they may be) to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in, and thereupon doe ſudden and unadviſed
actions, which the Lord pardons and over rules for the
beſt: evidently making appear that it is the work of
the weak and fleſhly part, which his own people car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
about with them too much unſubdued. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord thinks fit by this meanes, to ſhew them
the need of being beholding to their ſpiritual part,
to reſtore them again, and bring them into their right
temper and healthful conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And thus whilſt each diſſenting part is aggravating
upon it ſelfe faultineſſe and blame, and none excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
but all confeſſing they deſerve, in one ſort or
other, reproof, if not before men, yet to Gods ſight:
Who knowes how ſoon it may pleaſe God to come
into this broken, contrite, and ſelf denying frame
of Spirit in the good people within the three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and own them thus truly humbled and abaſed,
for his Temple and the place of his habitation and
reſt, wherein he will abide for ever? of whom it
may be ſaid God is in the Midſt of her, ſhe ſhall
not be moved; God ſhall help her and that right
early, or with his morning appearance. At which
time he will ſit ſilent no longer, but Heaven will
ſpeak again, and become active and powerful in the
ſpirits and hearts of Honeſt men, and in the works
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106421:13"/>
of his providences, when either they goe out to ſight
by Sea or by Land, or remaine in counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
at home for the publique Weale, and againe
heare the prayers of his people, and viſibly own them
is a flock of holy men, as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in her ſolemn
<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſts. <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of
Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, to doe it for them:</hi> And then
they ſhall know that I the Lord their God
am with them, and that they are my people,
and that ye my flock the flock of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
are men that have ſhewed your
ſelves weak ſinful men, and I am
your God that have declared
my ſelf an all-wiſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
God, ſaith the
Lord God.</p>

            <p>UPon the peruſal of this Diſcourſe thou wilt
quickly perceive that theſe two things are
principally aimed at in it by the Author. Firſt to
anſwer in ſome meaſure that which is called for
by thoſe in power, when they publiquely profeſſe
they deſire nothing more then conviction, and to
find out the hidden provocations which either have
or yet may bring forth the Lord againſt theſe
Nations, in the way which at preſent they are
in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To remove out of the minds and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the honeſt Partie, that ſtill agree in the
reaſon and juſtice of the good Old Cauſe, all
things of a private Nature and ſelfiſh Concern (the
tendency whereof ſerves but to foment and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
wrath and diviſions amongſt them) and in
Place thereof to ſet before them that common and
publique intereſt, which (if with ſinceritie em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced)
may be the meanes of not only procuring
a firm union amongſt them, but alſo of conſerving
them herein.</p>
            <p>In order to this, the Author hath not been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="tcp:106421:14"/>
much to declare his own Opinion, or deliver
any Poſitive Concluſions, as to diſcuſſe the buſineſs
by way of queſtion and anſwer, and thereby make
as neer a conjecture as he can, of that, wherein
the ſeveral diſſenting parts may with better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
meet together, and agree upon a ſafe and
righteous bottome, then to remaine at the diſtance
they doe, to the apparent advantage of the Common
Enemie, the approaching ruine of themſelves,
and needleſſe hazzard (if not loſſe) of the Cauſe
they have been ſo deeply engaged in. Eſpecially
conſidering that when once they ſhall be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to come forth to one another, in ſuch a
condiſcending ſelf-denying ſpirit, cleanſed from
the ſtain of hypocriſie and deceit, they may be well
aſſured that light will ſpring up amongſt them
more and more unto a perfect day; and then thoſe
things which at preſent we have next in view, will
prove as ſhadowes ready to flee away before the
morning brightneſſe of Chriſts Heavenly Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ſecond comming; through which they
will be heightened and improved to their full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie,
to the bringing in that Kingdome of his
that ſhall never be moved.</p>
            <p>And becauſe an Eſſay hath been already
made, in a private way to obtain the firſt thing,
that is to ſay, Conviction; which chiefly is in
the hand of the Lord to give; the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lies upon the Author, with reſpect to the ſecond,
<pb facs="tcp:106421:14"/>
for the expoſing of it as now it is unto Publicke
view, and therein leaving it alſo with the Lord,
for his bleſſing thereunto.</p>
