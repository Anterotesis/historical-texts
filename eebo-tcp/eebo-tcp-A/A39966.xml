            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Lord Keeper His Noble Speech
Jn Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen did ever King of this
Kingdome, ſit in white
robes ſo long yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
&amp; ſcarce any one
made to feele the ſenſible
ſtroake of the Axe, nor
blood drawne, but in pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and particular cauſes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It was a good wiſh, and I will joyne
with you in it with all my heart; that they may be
curſed and anatomized by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by all
the Kingdome, and by all ſucceeding Ages, that goe
about in the leaſt way to innovate or alter any thing
in that happy government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Commons applauding his Lordſhips expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
with a generall hymne, His Lordſhip pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a joyfull acclamation, and J doubt not, but that
<pb facs="tcp:96595:3"/>
your hearts are full: and certainly you my Lords,
and you of the houſe of Comons, will eaſily know,
that thoſe that are of that ſpirit, and that diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
will quickly reſolve all their debates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all
their actions into keales, and into Cades princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which is to ruine the Nobility, to ruine the
Gentry, to ruine and eat up one another.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you have lifted up your Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and raiſed them on five excellent pillars.</p>
            <p>That of religion, you doe well in the firſt place
to begin with; for certainly, it is that which muſt
ſeaſon all our other bleſſings: and it is that, to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
we ought to aſcribe the great happineſſe that wee
have ſo long enjoyed. In that, with great judgment
and diſcretion, you fixe your eye and your caſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reverend prelats, that aſſiſt his Majeſty on his
right hand. Certainly to them, and to their <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi>
we owe the due preſervation of the Goſpell,
in that purity and ſincerity that now we enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Let any man but looke backe, from the firſt of
Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and ſomewhat before to theſe
times, and ſee to whom we owe it moſt.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Elizha,</hi> when he had <hi>Eliaes</hi> ſpirit
doubled upon him, he tooke up his Mantle, and
there are golden Candleſticks, and there are gates of
Saphire, and Onixe, and other rich ſtones ſpoken of,
aſwell in the new Teſtament, as in the old. And God
forbid, that wee ſhould live to ſee God, that is the
God of decency, ſerved in ſuch ſort and manner, as
Plow-men come home from their ploughes.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> you ſhall not need to doubt, but that
<pb facs="tcp:96595:3"/>
his Majeſties pious example vnpreſidented by a
King (if I ſhould ſay by any man I ſhould not ſay
amiſſe) will give you for the houſe of Commons,
and all the world, cauſe to reſt confident, and moſt
aſſured of his zeale and conſtancy in the Religion
which hee profeſſeth; which nothing within, or
without the Kingdome hath ever found to move.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you looke upon the Judges and
Sages of the Law, and well you may, perſons for
gr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vity and for learning: certain<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y not exceeded in
any age. And for juſtice and integrity. I am ſure if
any of them be guilty of the leſt defect therein, they
have the leaſt reaſon reaſon to be excuſed for it, that
ever Judges in any time or age. They have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the King, they have the freedome of his
royall Election, they have received from time to
time charge and command, that they ſhould with
equity, and with indifferency diſtribute that Juſtice
committed to them: and ſo diſcharge the truſt by
God laid upon his Majeſty, and by him tranſmitted
to their diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>For Chivalry, the next pillar on which you ſet up
the Trophies of honour, the Grandees, and great
Lords of this Kingdome. You behold them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I thinke, far greater then ever their Anceſtors
were: and I doubt not, but their courage is every
way equall, and I aſſure my ſelfe, they will never
forget the famous Acts, that have left them hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all poſterity, nor doe the leaſt thing that
may deface the monumentall name and accounts of
them: or that may in the leaſt kind ſtaine their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and magnanimity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96595:4"/>
For Commerce, it is moſt certaine, Mr. Speaker,
it is the royall Mines of this Kingdome, the Eaſt &amp;
Weſt Indies of our Nation, and in that we have all
great cauſe to bleſſe God, and to give humble thanks
to his Majeſty, that he takes ſuch paines to maintain
and encourage it: that this Nation never had a more
flouriſhing time ſince the Conqueſt, then now it
hath.</p>
            <p>There remaines but unity, and as you ſay well,
without that we can never be happy: I will but
turne your ſaying, you have ſaid, <hi>Si ſumus inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,
ſumus inſuperabiles,</hi> I will but ſay it is a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
one; but it is a true one: and I will as ſoone
borrow that, <hi>Si icolldimur, frangimur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, let all the world avoid diſtruſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelfe, there will not lack out of malignant
and ill affections, there will not lacke from peſtilent
and peeviſh indeavours to make good their actions,
there will not lacke mailcious and ambitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that may diſjoynt and unknit his Majeſty and
this Houſe.</p>
            <p>And you of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> you ſee his
Majeſty hath gratiouſly invited you hither: and let
me put you in mind, that you forget not what was
ſaid unto you, which howſoever I will repeat unto
you, that <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on may the better remember.</p>
            <p>That there is nothing doth ſo much take, a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and good nature, as humble, ſweet, and cheerfull
expreſſions of affections.</p>
            <p>For your Petitions, his Majeſty hath heard them
all, and grants them all, as fully and as freely, as ever
<pb facs="tcp:96595:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himſelfe in other <hi>Parliaments</hi> did, or have any of his
predeceſſors before him done.</p>
            <p>And therefore there remaines nothing now, but
that you goe on with cheerfulneſſe, you goe on with
duty, you goe on with the expreſſions, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
the heart of ſo gracious, ſo juſt, and ſo good a
King; and that may be more then ſhowers in the
drought, and heat of Summer to refreſh and cheere
this Kingdome, and all his Majeſties Dominions,</p>
