            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough the Gentlemen who have contributed to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Collection stand in need of no Advocates to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
what they have Written: Yet the Reflections of some who
decry'd the Design, because they had no concern in it, and the
Malice of others, who gave it out for an Vn-correct and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sling
Performance, renders a defence of it wholly Necessary.
The Reader will soon be satisfied, that the Care which has
been taken in Compiling this Volume, has been more than has
hitherto been usual in Collections of this Nature, and will
agree with us, that Iustice has been done to the Great Man
they are written in Honour of. As the Gentlemen whom we
have entrusted with the Supervisal and Choice of the several
Poems, have had our Thanks, so we question not, but they will
have those of the Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>And if some Gentlemen among the many others, whose Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are not inserted, should take it amiss, we can excuse our
selves no other way, than by giving them to understand, we are
satisfied of the Iudgment of those Learned Gentlemen, who
did us the favour of making Choice of the most Valuable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
though they may perhaps call it in question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it has run Counter to theirs.</p>

                  <l>His juster Glories, let us mourn his Fate.</l>
                  <l>To sing his Praises gives but weak Relief;</l>

                  <l>Did o'er these threatning Waves in Triumph ride,</l>
                  <l>Laught at their Envy, and expos'd their Pride.</l>
                  <l>Not Age's Frost could thy brisk Spirits bind,</l>
                  <l>Or chill the active Vigour of thy Mind.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In vain did baffled Age pursue,</l>

Thy powerful Nature felt no slow Decay;</l>
                  <l>But thy (mourn'd) Night was glorious as thy Day.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Farewel bright Shade! and Triumph in the Grave;</l>
                  <l>Poets in Death their truest Glories have.</l>
                  <l>The well-plac'd Lawrel, which did once adorn</l>
                  <l>Thy aged Brow, shall thence no more be torn:</l>
                  <l>Untouch'd it shall around thy Temples spread;</l>

                     <hi>Kings</hi> Crown'd thee living; but <hi>Fate</hi> Crown'd thee dead.</l>

               <l>'Tis true that <hi>Dryden</hi>'s worth there's none so well</l>
               <l>As <hi>Dryden</hi>'s self in his own Works can tell;</l>

               <l>That as his Merits far exceed our Praise,</l>

                  <l>A long: Farewell to Poetry and <hi>YOV.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>With <hi>You</hi> the sweetness of our Muses die's:</l>
                  <l>Deep in <hi>Your</hi> Tomb the <hi>British</hi> Genius lie's:</l>
                  <l>You were our Muse's darling, ev'ry Page</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Your's</hi> she blest: Nor could the Wrongs of Age,</l>
                  <l>Weaken <hi>your</hi> Vigour, nor <hi>your</hi> Warmth asswage.</l>
                  <l>But now for <hi>You</hi> she droops, can scarce rehearse</l>
                  <l>Some wretched Numbers to attend <hi>Your</hi> Herse.</l>
                  <l>In ev'ry Strain, in ev'ry Note we hear</l>
                  <l>Sad Melancholy Sounds of black Despair.</l>
                  <l>Not such as when flush'd with Diviner Rage,</l>
                  <l>She grew a Match for <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Sacred Page:</l>
                  <l>Such, as when late, on <hi>Tyber</hi>'s Banks she stood,</l>
                  <l>And with a decent Horror dy'd the Field with Blood.</l>
                  <l>Where in each Page engaging Hero's join,</l>
                  <l>And Great <hi>Aeneas</hi> fight's in ev'ry Line.</l>

                  <l>Kind as the first approach of Amorous Fire.</l>

                  <l>Inspire soft Thoughts, and melt us into Love.</l>
                  <l>Yet there is not a Souldier in our Isle,</l>

                  <l>Each Mourner must his proper Office keep;</l>
                  <l>Their business is to Praise, and mine to Weep:</l>

                  <l>In what soft Order did his Periods Move!</l>
                  <l>Like the mild Transports of Seraphick Love:</l>
                  <l>How eas'ly into Harmony they fell,</l>

                  <l>No, 'tis that noble Heat, that sparkling Fire,</l>
                  <l>The Muses give, when they their Sons Inspire,</l>

                  <l>And spent with Grief, wore out the tedious day:</l>

                  <l>Then up thou sluggish Isle, revere <hi>his</hi> Name</l>
                  <l>Let all thy Sons my <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Worth proclaim,</l>

               <l>While Fools and Coxcombs longer Live,</l>

               <l>Oh! had his Life been lasting as his Fame,</l>

               <l>Since neither those cou'd the dead Bard revive,</l>

               <l>All Powerful Poet, cou'd I sing like thee:</l>

               <l>Mine, only mine shou'd stretch the Cheeks of Fame:</l>
               <l>While I wou'd raise a costlier <hi>Thebes</hi> than he,</l>
