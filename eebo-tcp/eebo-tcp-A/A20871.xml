            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Power, as that it can by the vehement &amp; earnest

and Ideas of it produce reall Effects; yet it hath

that it often (either by outward inspiration, or some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

and hath Shadowes of approching dangers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

and causelesse vncomfortable languishings: of which
to seeke a reason, vnlesse from the sparkling of GOD in
the Soule, or from the God-like sparkles of the Soule,
were to make Reason vnreasonable, by reasoning of things
transcending her reach.</p>
               <p>Hauing often and diuerse times, when I had giuen my
selfe to rest in the quiet solitarinesse of the Night, found
my Imagination troubled with a confused feare, no, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or horror, which interrupting Sleepe did astonish my
senses, and rowse me all appalled, and transported in a
suddaine agonie and amazednesse; of such an vnaccustomed
perturbation, not knowing, nor being able to diue into any
apparent Cause, carried away with the streame of my (then
doubting) Thoughts, I beganne to ascribe it to that secret
fore-knowledge and presaging Power of the Propheticke
Minde, and to interpret such an Agonie to be to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
as a faintnesse and vniversall wearinesse vseth to be to

Points, Mathematicians are brought to great numbers, and
huge greatnesse, after many fantasticall glances of the VVoes
of Mankinde, and those incombrances which follow vpon
Life, I was brought to thinke, and with amazement, on
the last of humaine Terrors, or (as one termed it) the last
of all dreadfull and terrible Euils, Death. For to easie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it would appeare, that the Soule, if it fore-see that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement
which it is to haue from the Body, should not
without great reason be thus ouer-grieued, and plunged in
inconsolable and vnaccustomed Sorrow: considering their
neare Vnion, long familiaritie and loue, with the great
change, Paine, Vglinesse, which are apprehended to be the
inseparable attendants of Death.</p>
               <p>They had their being together, Parts they are of one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creature, the harming of the one, is the weakning
of the working of the other; what sweete contentments
doth the Soule enjoy by the senses? They are the Gates
and VVindowes of its Knowledge, the Organes of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
If it be tedious to an excellent Player on the Lute, to
abide but a few Monthes the want of one, how much more
must the being without such noble Tooles and Engines bee
plaintfull to the Soule? And if two Pilgrimes which haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:5686:25"/>
wandred some few miles together, haue a hearts-griefe when
they are neare to part, what must the Sorrow be at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of two so louing Friends and neuer-loathing Louers
as are the Body and Soule?</p>

Successions of Linages cut short, Kingdomes left heirelesse,
and greatest States orphaned: it is not ouercome by Pride,
smoothed by Flatterie, diuerted by Time, Wisedome saue
this can preuent and helpe euery thing. By Death wee are
exiled from this faire Citty of the World, it is no more a
World vnto vs, nor we any more people into it. The ruines
of Phanes, Palaces, and other magnificent Frames, yeeld a
sad prospect to the Soule, and how should it without horrour
view the wracke of such a wonderfull Maister-piece as is the
Body?</p>
               <p>That Death naturally is torrible and to be abhorred, it can
not well and altogether be denied, it beeing a priuation of
Life, and a not-being, and euery priuation being abhorred of
Nature, and euill in it selfe, the feare of it too being ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vniversallie in all Creatures; yet I haue often thought
that euen naturally to a Minde by onely Nature resolued and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5686:26"/>
prepared, it is more terrible in Conceit than in Verity, and
at the first Glance, than when well pryed into, and that rather
by the weaknesse of our Fantasie, than by what is in it, and
that the marble colours, of Obsequies, Weeping, and funerall
Pompe (which wee our selues cast ouer it) did adde much
more Gastlinesse vnto it than otherwayes it hath. To averre
which conclusion, when I had gathered my wandring
Thoughts, I beganne thus with my Selfe.</p>
               <p>If on the great Theater of this Earth amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse
number of men, <hi>To die</hi> were onely proper to thee
and thine, then vndoubtedlie thou hadst reason to repine at

and vnto which they which bee, and so many as are to come,
are thralled (no consequent of Life being more common and
familiar) Why shouldst thou with vnprofitable, and nought
availing stubbornnesse, oppose to so vneuitable and necessarie
a Condition? this is the high-way of Mortalitie, our generall
home, behold what Millions haue trod it before thee, what
Multitudes shall after thee, with them which at that same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
runne. In so vniversall a calamitie (if Death be one)
priuate Complaints cannot bee heard, with so many royall
Palaces, it is no losse to see thy poore Caban burne. Shall
the Heauens stay their euer-rolling Wheeles (for what is the
motion of them, but the motion of a swift and euer-whirling
Wheele, which twineth forth, and againe vprolleth our life?)
and hold still time, to prolong thy miserable dayes, as if the
highest of their working were to doe homage vnto thee? Thy
death is a peece of the order of this <hi>All,</hi> a part of the Life of
this World, for while the World is the World, some Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
must dye, &amp; others take life. Eternall things are raised far
aboue this Spheare of Generation &amp; Corruption, where the
first Matter, like an euer-flowing &amp; ebbing Sea, with diuerse
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5686:26"/>
waues, but the same water, keepeth a restles and neuer-tyring
current; what is below, in the vniuersalitie of the kind, not in
it selfe doth abide, <hi>Man</hi> a long line of years hath continued,
<hi>This Man</hi> euerie hundreth is swept away. This Globe
enuironed with aire, is the sole Region of Death, the Graue
where euerie thing that taketh Life must rotte, the Stage of
Fortune and Change, onelie glorious in the vnconstancie
and varying alterations of it, which though manie seeme
yet to abide one, and being a certaine entire one, are euer
many. The neuer-agreeing bodies of the elementall Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
turne one in another, the Earth changeth her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
with the Seasons, some-times looking colde, and
naked, other times, hote and flowrie: <hi>Nay,</hi> I cannot tell
how, but euen the lowest of those celestiall bodies, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

if shee were a Mirror of our constant mutabiltie appeareth

changes, neuer seeing vs twice with that same Face, now loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
blacke, then pale and wanne, some-times againe in
the perfection and fulnesse of her beautie shining ouer vs.
Death no lesse than Life doth heere act a part, the taking
away of what is old, beeing the making a way for what
is young. They which fore-went vs did leaue a Roome
for vs, and should we grieue to doe the same to those which

and when the Lord of this Vniuerse hath shewed vs the

               <p>Is not the entring into Life weaknesse? the continuing

men? and what to bee heard, but the exclamations of
the young, complaintes of the olde, with the pittifull
cryes of sicke and pining persons? there is almost no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
worse than age.</p>
               <p>If there bee any euill in death, it would appeare to bee
that paine and torment, which we apprehend to arise from
the breaking of those strait bands which keepe the Soule
and body together; which, sith not without great strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
and motion, seemes to proue it selfe vehement and
most extreame. The senses are the onely cause of paine,
but before the last Trances of death, they are so brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that they haue no (or verie little) strength, and their
strength lessening, the strength of paine too must be lessened.
How should wee doubt, but the weaknesse of senselessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
paine, Sith we know that weakened and maimed parts
which receiue not nurishment, are a great deale lesse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
than the other partes of the bodie; And see, that old
decrepit persons leaue this world almost without paine, as
in a sleepe? If bodies of the most sound and wholesome
constitution bee these which most vehemently feele paine?
it must then follow, that they of a distemperate and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
constitution, haue least feeling of paine, and by this reason,
all weake and sicke bodies should not much feele paine,
for if they were not distempered and euill complexioned,
they would not be sicke. That the Sight, Hearing, Taste,
Smelling leaue vs without paine, and vnawares, we are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie
assured, and why should wee not thinke the
same of the Feeling? That which is capable of feeling, are
the vitall spirits, which in a man in a perfite health are spred
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5686:31"/>
and extended through the whole bodie, and hence is it
that the whole body is capable of paine: But in dying bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
we see that by pauses and degrees the partes which are
furthest remoued from the heart, become cold, and being
depriued of naturall heat, all the paine which they feele, is
that they doe feele no paine. Now, euen as ere the sicke be
aware, the vitall spirits haue with drawne themselues from
the whole extension of the bodie, to succour the heart (like
distressed Citizens which finding their walls battered down,
flye to the defence of their Cittadell) so doe they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the heart without any sensible touch: As the flame,
the oyle failing, leaueth the wicke, or as light the Aire which
it doeth inuest. As to the shrinking motions, and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of sinewes and members, which appeare to witnesse
great paine, let one represent to himselfe the strings of an
high-tuned Lut, which breaking, retire to their naturall win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
or a piece of Yce, that without any out-ward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
cracketh at a Thawe: No otherwise doe the sinewes
of the bodie, finding themselues slacke and vnbended from
the braine, and their wonted labours and motions cease,
struggle, and seeme to stirre themselues, but without either,
paine or sense. Sowning is a true pourtrait of death, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is the same, beeing a cessation from all action, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and function of sense and life: But in Sowning there
is no paine, but a silent rest, and so deepe and sound a sleepe
that the naturall is nothing in comparison of it; What
great paine then can there bee in Death, which is but a
continued Sowning, and a neuer againe returning to the
workes and dolorous felicitie of life?</p>
               <p>Now although Death were an extreame paine, sith it is
in an instant, what can it bee? why should wee feare it?
for while wee are, it commeth not, and it beeing come we
are no more. Nay, though it were most painfull, long con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuing,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5686:31"/>
and terrible, vglie why should wee feare it? Sith
feare is a foolish passion but where it may preserue; but it
can not preserue vs from Death, yea rather the feare of it,
banishing the comfortes of present contentmentes, makes
Death to aduance and approach the more neare vnto vs.
That is euer terrible which is vnknowne, so doe litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
feare to goe in the darke, and their feare is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               <p>But that (perhaps) which anguisheth thee most, is to
haue this glorious pageant of the World, remoued from
thee, in the Spring and most delicious season of thy life;
for, though to dye bee vsuall, to dye young may appeare
extraordinarie. If the present fruition of these things bee
vnprofitable and vaine, what can a long continuance of
them bee? Stranger and new Halcyon, why wouldst thou
longer nestle amidst these vnconstant and stormie waues?
Hast thou not alreddy suffred enough of this World, but
thou must yet endure more? To liue long, is it not to be
long troubled? But number thy yeares, which are now
() and thou shalt find, that where as ten haue ouer-liued
thee, thousands haue not attained this age. One yeare is
sufficient to behold all the magnificence of Nature, nay,
euen one day and night, for more is but the same brought
againe: This Sunne, that Moone, these Starres, the varying
dance of the Spring, Summer, Antumne, Winter, is that
verie same which the golden Age did see. They which
haue the longest time lent them to liue in, haue almost no
part of it at all, measuring it either by that space of time
which is past, when they were not, or by that which is to
come: Why shouldst thou then care, whether thy dayes be
manie or few, which when prolonged to the vttermost,

To dye young, is to doe that soone, and in some fewer

dayes, which once thou must doe; it is but the giuing
ouer of a Game that, after neuer so many hazardes, must be

one of <hi>Platos</hi> yeares, so soone as the last of thy dayes ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
aboue thy Horizon, thou wilt then as now, demand
longer respit, and exspect more to come: It is Hope of
long life, that maketh life seeme short. Who will behold,
and with the eyes of aduice behold, the many changes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on humane affaires, with the after-claps of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
shall neuer lament to dye young. Who knowes what
alterations and sudden disasters, in outward estate or inward
contentments, in this wildernesse of the world, might haue
befallen him who dyeth young, if hee had liued to be old?
Heauen fore-knowing imminent harmes, taketh those which
it loues to it selfe before they fall forth. Pure and (if we
may so say) Virgine Soules, carrie their bodies with no
small agonies, and delight not to remaine long in the dregs
of humane corruption, still burning with a desire to turne
backe to the place of their rest, for this world is their Inne
and not their Home. That which may fall foorth euerie
houre, cannot fall out of time. Life is a Iourney in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
way, the furthest Rest is Death, in this some goe more
heauilie burthened, than others: swift and actiue Pilgrimes
come to the end of it in the Morning, or at Noone, which
Tortoyse-paced Wretches, clogged with the fragmentarie
rubbidge of this world, scarce with great trauell crawle

mightst haue enjoyed life, but howe sooner thou mightst

can not euer so continue, but is inclined and disposed to
be reunited thereinto: What can let and hinder this desire,
but that some time it bee accomplished, and obtaining the
exspected end, rejoyne it selfe againe vnto the bodie? The
Soule separate hath a desire, because it hath a will, and
knowes it shall by this reunion receiue perfection: too,
as the matter is disposed, and inclineth to its forme when
it is without it, so would it seeme that the Forme should
be towards its matter in the absence of it. How, is not the

Soule the forme of the bodie, fith by it, it is, and is the
beginning and cause of all the actions and functions of it:
For, though in excellencie it passe euerie other forme, yet

If the abiding of the Soule from the bodie be violent, then
can it not bee euerlasting, but haue a regresse: How is not
such an estate of beeing and abiding not violent to the
Soule, if it bee naturall to it, to be in matter, and (separate)
after a strange manner, many of the powers and faculties

much justice as Man, if Hee suffer the euill and vicious, to
haue a more prosperous and happie life, than the followers

the wrong apprehension of what is vnknowne in it, are
noysome, But the Soule sustained by its Maker, resolued,
and calmlie retired in it selfe, doth find that Death (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is in a moment of Time) is but a short, nay, sweete
sigh; and is not worthie the remembrance compared
with the smallest dramme of the infinite Felicitie of this
Place. Heere is the Palace Royall of the Almighty KING,
in which the vncomprehensible comprehensiblie manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
Himselfe; in Place highest, in substance not subject
to any corruption or change, for it is aboue all motion,
and solid turneth not; in quantitie greatest, for, if one
Starre, one Spheare bee so vast, how large, how hudge in
exceeding demensions, must those bounds bee, which doe
them all containe? In quantitie most pure and orient, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
heere is all but a Sunne, or the Sunne all but a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
If to Earthlings the Foote-stoole of GOD, and that
Stage which Hee raised for a small course of Time, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
so Glorious and Magnificent; What estimation would
they make (if they could see) of His eternall Habitation
and Throne? and if these bee so wonderfull, what is the
sight of Him, for whom, and by whom all was created;
of whose Glorie to behold the thousand thousand part,
the most pure Intellegences are fullie satiate, and with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and delight rest amazed; for the Beautie of His light
and the Light of His Beautie are vncomprehensible?
Heere doth that earnest appetite of the Vnderstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it selfe, not seeking to know any more; For it seeth
before it, in the vision of the Diuine essence (a Miroi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Essence of euerie thing created, is more cleare and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
than in it selfe) all that may bee knowne or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Heere doth the Will pause it selfe, as in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5686:39"/>
of its Eternall rest, glowing with a firie affection of
that infinite and all-sufficient Good; which beeing fullie
knowne, cannnot (for the infinit motiues and causes of
loue which are in Him) but bee fullie and perfectlie
loued: As Hee is onelie true and essentiall Bountie, so
is Hee the onelie essentiall and true Beautie, deseruing
alone all loue and admiration, by which the Creatures
are onelie in so much faire and excellent, as they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of His Beautie and excelling Excellencies. Heere is a
blessed Companie, euerie one joying as much in anothers
Felicitie, as in that which is proper, because each seeth
another equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llie loued of GOD; Thus their distinct joyes
are no fewer, than the copartners of the joye: And as the
Assemblie is in number answerable to the large capacitie
of the Place, so are the joyes answerable to the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
number of the Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

mortall, confined on the Globe of Earth, who hath neuer
seene but sorrow, or interchangeablie some painted super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
pleasures, can rightlie thinke on, or bee sufficient to
conceaue the tearmelesse Delightes of this Place. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Feathers moue not on Birds, so many Birds dint
not the Aire, so manie leaues tremble not on Trees,
so manie Trees grow not in the solitarie Forests, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Waues turne not in the Ocean, and so manie graines
of Sand limit not those Waues: As this triumphant Court
hath varietie of Delights, and Ioyes exempted from all
comparison. Happinesse at once heere is fullie knowne and
fullie enjoyed, and as infinit in continuance as extent. Heere
is flourishing and neuer-fading youth without Age, Strength
without Weaknesse, Beautie neuer blasting, Knowledge
without Learning, Aboundance without Lothing, Peace
without Disturbance, Participation without Enuy, Rest
without Labour, Light without rising or setting Sunne,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5686:40"/>
Perpetuitie without moments, for Time (which is the
measure of endurance) did neuer enter in this shining E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie.
Ambition, Disdaine, Malice, difference of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
can not approach this Place, resembling those foggie
mists, which couer those Lists of sublunarie thinges. All
Pleasure paragon'd with what is heere is paine, all Mirth
mourning, all Beautie deformitie: Heere one dayes abyding,
is aboue the continuing in the most fortunate estate on
the Earth manie yeeres, and sufficient to conteruaile the
extreamest torments of Life. But, although this Blisse of
Soules bee great, and their joyes many, yet shall they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
addition, and bee more full and perfect, at that long
wished and generall meeting with their Bodies.</p>
               <p>Amongst all the wonders of the great Creator, not one
appeareth to bee more wonderfull (replyed I) than that
our Bodies should arise, hauing suffered so many changes,
and Nature denying a returne from Priuation to a Habit.</p>
               <p>Such power (said hee) beeing aboue all that the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of Man can conceaue, may well worke such
wonders; For, if Mans Vnderstanding could comprehend
all the secretes and counsells of that Eternall Majestie, it
must of necessitie bee equall vnto it. The Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not thralled to the lawes of Nature, but worketh
with them, or contrarie to them, as it pleaseth Him: What
Hee hath a will to doe, Hee hath a power to performe.
To that power which brought all this <hi>All</hi> from nought,
to bring againe in one instant any substance which euer
was into it, vnto what it was once, should not be thought
impossible; For, who can doe more, can doe lesse, and His
power is no lesse, after that which was by Him brought
forth is decayed and vanished, than it was before it was
produced; beeing neither restrained to certaine limits, or
instruments, or to any determinate &amp; definit manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:5686:40"/>
where the power is without restraint, the workead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
no other limits, than the workers will. This World
is as a Cabinet to GOD, in which the small things (how
euer to vs hidde and secret) are nothing lesse keeped, than
the great. For, as Hee was wise and powerfull to create, so
doth His Knowledge comprehend His own Creation; yea,
euery change and varietie in it, of which it is the verie
Source. Not any Atome of the scattered Dust of mankind
though daylie flowing vnder new Formes, is to Him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:
and His Knowledge doth distinguish and discerne,
what once His power shall waken and raise vp. Why may
not the Arts-master of the World, like a Molder, what he
hath framed in diuerse shapes, confound in one masse, and
then seuerally fashion them out of the same? Can the Spargi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
by his Arte restore for a space to the dry and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Rose, the naturall Purple and Blush: And can not the
Almightie raise and refine the bodie of Man, after neuer
so many alterations on the Earth? Reason her selfe finds
it more possible for infinit power to cast out from it selfe
a finit world, and restore any thing in it, though decayed
and dissolued, to what it was first; than for Man a finit
piece of reasonable miserie, to change the forme of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made to his hand: the power of GOD neuer brought
forth all that It can, for then were it bounded, and no more
infinit. That Time doth approach (O haste yee Times
away) in which the Dead shall liue, and the Liuing bee
changed, and of all actions the Guerdon is at hand; Then
shall there be an end without an end, Time shall finish, and
Place shall be altered, Motion yeelding vnto rest, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
