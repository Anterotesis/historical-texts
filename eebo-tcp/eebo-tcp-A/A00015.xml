            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

looking so their cattle finding therein, and so euery one imploid in his busines as occasion required.

Sometimes it so dazled the eyes of many of the Spectators, that they immagined it had bin some fogge or miste, comming with great swiftnes towardes them: and with such a smoke, as if Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes were all on fire: and to the view of some, it seemed as it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>But assoone as the people of those Countries, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was the violence of the Waters of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Seas, and that they began to exceede the compasse of their accustomed boundes, and making so furiously towardes them. happy were they that could make the best, and most speed away, many of them, leauing all their goods and substance, to the merciles Waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to escape away with life themselues: But so violent and swift were the outragioue waues, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued one an other, with such vehemencie, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters multiplying so much in so short a time, that in lesse then fiue houres space<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most part of those cuntreys (and especially the places which lay lowe,) were all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer flowen, and many hundreds of people both men wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children were then quite deuoured, by these outragious waters, such was the furie of the waues, of the Seas, the one of them dryuing the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes with such force and swiftnes, that it is almost incredible for any to beleeue the same, except such as tasted of the smart thereof, and such as behelde the

same, with their eyes: Nay more, the Farmers, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and Shepheards, might beholde their goodly flockes of Sheepe, swimming vpon the Waters dead, which could by no meanes be recouered.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlemen, Yeomen and others, had great losses, of cattle, as Oxen, Kine, Bullockes, Horses, Colts, Sheepe, Swine, Nay not so much as their poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about their houses, but all were ouer whelmed and drownd, by these merciles Waters: Many men that were rich in the morning when they rose out of their beds, were made poore before noone the saine day: such are the Judgements of the Almightie God, who is the geuer of all good thinges, who can and will dispose of them agayne at all times, according to his good will and pleasure, whensoeuer it shall seeme best vnto him. Many others like wise, had their habitations or dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses all carryed away in a short time, and had not a place left them, so much as to shrowde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, many that had great store of Corne and Grayne, in their Barnes and Garners in the morning had not within fiue boures space afterwardes, so much as one Grayne to make them bread withall: Neither had they so much left as a locke of Hay or Straw to seede their cattell which were left: Such was the great misery they susseyned by the fury of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Element, from which like, good Lord I beseech him of his influ e mercy and goodnes to deliuer vs all.</p>

            <p>And that which is more straunge: There are not now found onely floating vpon the Waters still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the dead Carkasses of many men women and children: But also an aboundance of all kinde of wilde Beasts, as Foxes, Hares, Connies, Rats, Moules and such like: some of them swimming one vpon an others Becke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking to haue saued themselues thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all was in vaine, such was the force of the Waters that ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pressed them.</p>

            <p>But there placing her selfe for saueguard of her life as aforesaid, hauing none other refuge to fly vnto: the Waters in such violent sort had so pursued her, that there was but a small distance of ground left vncouered with Waters, for her to abide vpon: There she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned most pittyfully lamenting the great daunger of life that she was then in, expecting euery minute of an houre, to be ouerwhelmed with those mercylesse Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But the Almighty God, who is the Creator of all good things, when he thought méete, sent his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to commaund the Waters to cease their fury: and so returne into their accustomed bonuds againe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by according to his most blessed will and pleasure she was then preserued.</p>
            <p>In the meane space, during the continuance of her abode there, diuers of her friends practised all the means they could to recouer her, but could not, the Waters were of such a déepenes about her, and Boates they had none, in all those partes to succour her, such was their want in this distresse, that many perished through the want thereof.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentleman of worth, dwelling néere vnto the place where she was, who caused a goodly Gelding to be sadled, and set a man vpon the backe of him, thinking to haue fetcht her away, but such were the déepenes of the waters, that he durst not aduenture

            <p>At last some of her friends, deuised a deuise, and tyed two broad Troughes the one to the other, (such as in those countreys they vse to salt Bacon in) and put ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two lustie strong men, who with long Powles (stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these troughes) (as if they had bin boates) made great shift to come to her, &amp;  so by this meanes, through Gods good helpe she was then saued.</p>
            <p>But now (gentle Reader) marke what befell, at this time, of the strangenes of other creatures: whom the Waters had violently oppressed: for the two men which tooke vpon them to fetch away the maide from the top of the Banke, can truely witnes the same as well as her selfe to be true, for they beheld the same with their Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Hill or Banke where the maide abode all that space<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was all so couered ouer, with wilde beastes and vermin, that came thither to séeke for succour) that she had much adoe to saue her selfe, from taking of hurt by them: and much a-doe she had to kéepe them from crée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon and about her, she was not so much in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Water on the one side: as she was troubled with these Uermin on the other side.</p>

            <p>Dogs Cats, Moules, Foxes, Hares, Conyes, yea and not so much, as Mice and Rats: but were there in abundance and that which is more straunge: The one of them neuer once offred to annoy the other: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were deadly enemies by Nature the one to an other: Yet in this daunger of life, they not once offred to expresse their naturall enuie: But in a gentle sort, they freely inioyed the libertie of life, which in mine opinion, was a most wonderfull worke in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

maide, besides the other accidentes before rehearsed and let vs returne againe to these watry miseries: The counties of <hi>Glamorgan. Carmarthen,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan,</hi> and many other places in <hi>South-wales,</hi> haue likewise borne the heauy burden, of Gods wrath herein: And many were the liues of them that were lost through this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery destruction.</p>
            <p>Many there were which fled into the toys of high trées, and there were inforced to abide some three daies, some more, and some lesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any victuals at all, there suffring much colde besides many other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and some of them in such sort, that through euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much hunger and cold, some of them fell down againe out of the Trées, and so were like to perish for want of succour. Othersame, sate in the toys of high Trees as aforesaid, beholding their wiues, children, and seruants, swimming (remediles of all succour) in the Waters.</p>
            <p>Other some sitting in the tops of Trees might behold their houses ouerflowne with the waters. some their houses caryed quite away: and no signe or token left there of them.</p>
            <p>Many of them might sée, as they stood vpon the toys of high Hilles, their cattle pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>, and could not tell how to succour them, and their Barnes, with all their store of Corne and Graine quite consumed, which was no small griefe vnto them.</p>
            <p>Many people and Cattle in diuers places of these Cuntreys, might haue beene saued in time, if that the cuntreys had beene any thing like furnished with bootes, or other prouision fit for such a sudden Accident, as this was, which as God himselfe knoweth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of them to haue fallen so suddenly vpon them.</p>
            <p>But seeing the cuntreys were so vnfurnished with Boates much harme was done, to the vtter vndooing of many thousandes.</p>
            <p>Some fled into the tops of churches and Stéeples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1310:7"/>
to saue themselues, from whence they might beholde, themselues depriued aswell of all their substance, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of al their ioys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they had before receiued in their wiues and children, beware, whole R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kes of Pease, Beanes, Dates, and other graine were seene a far of, to float vpon the Water too and fro, in the Countreys as if they had bin ships vpon the Seas.</p>
            <p>The Foundations of many Churches and houses, were in a manner decayed, and some caryed quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in <hi>Cardisse,</hi> in the county of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> there was a great part of the Church next the Water side ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, with the Water, many houses and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens there, which were neere the water side, were all ouerflowen, and much harme bone.</p>
            <p>Diuers other Churches lie hidden in the Waters, and some of them the tops are to be seene: and other some, nothing at all to be séene, but the very tops of the Steeples, and of some of them nothing at all, neyther steeple nor nothing else. Also many schooles of young schollers, in many places of those cuntreys, stood in great perplexitle, some of them aduenturing home to their parents were drowned by the way: Other some staying behinde in in Churches, did climbe vp to the tops of Steeples, where they were very neere starued to death for want of foode and fire: many by the help of boards and plankes of Wood, swam to dryland and so were preserued from vntimely Death, Many had Boates brought them, some 10 miles, some 15. some 20. where there was neuer seene any Boates before.</p>
            <p>Thus God suffred many of them to escape his yrefull wrath, in hope of their amendment of life: Some men that were riding on the high wayes were ouertaken with these mercilesse Waters, and were drowned.</p>
            <p>And againe many haue bin most strangely preserued.</p>
            <p>As for example, there was in the Countie of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a man both blind and did ride and one which

had not bin able to stand vpon his legs in ten yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he had his poore cottage broken downe by the force of the Waters, and himselfe, Bed and all caryed into the open fields, where being readie to sinke, and at the point to seeke a resting place, two fathoms deepe vnder the Waters: his hand by chaunce catcht holde of the Raster of an house swimming by the fiercenesse of the Windes, then blowing Easternely he was driuen safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Land, and so escaped.</p>
            <p>Also in an other place, there was a man Child of the age, of 5. or 6. yeares, which was kept swimming for the space of two houres, abone the Waters, by reason that his long Coates lay spread vpon the tops of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and béeing at last, at the very poynt to sinke: there came by chaunce by, (floating vpon the tops of the Waters,) a fat Weather that was dead, very full of Wooll: The poore distressed Child perceiuing this good meanes of recouerie, caught fast hold on the Wethers Wool, and likewise with the winde he was driuen to dry land, and so saued.</p>
            <p>There wes also in the County of <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> a yaung Woman, who had foure small Children, and not one of them able to helpe it selfe: And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then seeing the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Many more there were that through the handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes of God were preserued from this violent death o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The lowe Marshes and Fenny groundes, néere <hi>Barstable</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Deuon</hi> were ouerflowne, so farre out, and in such outragious sort, that the cuntrey all along to <hi>Bridge-water</hi> was greatly distre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed thereby, and much hurt there done it is a most pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull sight to beholde what numbers of fat Oxen, were there Drawned: what flockes of Shéepe, what heades of kine, haue their bin lost, and Drowned in in these outragious Waters: there is little now remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there, to be séene, but huge Waters like to the maine Ocean: The tops of Churches and Stéeples like to the tops of Rockes in the Sea.
