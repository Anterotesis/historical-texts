         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>5. Are ye offended with my Canons and Injuctions? Is
it fit that a few men whom Order and Policy hath made
inferiour to others, as the Rulers and Representatives of
the whole society, should prefer their own private Opinions

Counsels, the pious Endeavours, and solemn Sanctions
of so many, eminent for piety, prudence, integrity, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

            <p>6. Are my solemne Fasts and Feasts your grievances?

Angels; Children and expectants of happinesse,
Partakers of grace, and daily preparing for eternal Glory:
that all men who have been called, baptized and instructed
by lawful Ministers here, in the mysteries and duties of the
Gospel, may make a joynt and publick profession of the
Christian Faith, and Reformed Religion, in the name, and
as the sense of the whole Nation, grounded upon the holy
Scripture, guided also and administred by that uniforme
order, due authority, and holy Ministry for Worship and
Government which according to the mind of Christ, the
pattern of the Apostles, and the practise of all primitive
Churches, hath been lawfully established by the wisdome
and consent of all Estates in this Kingdome, for Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the Churches safety, the publick peace, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

            <p>8. Doe I not allow you a just liberty to dot such things
constantly and chearfully which are most proper and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to the nature and excellency of men? to think
what is true to do what is fit, and enjoy what is just in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to God, others and your selves? I have taken from
you no liberty but that of <hi>doing evil:</hi> you are at liberty to
enjoy all the comforts priviledges, and Ordinances which
Christ hath instituted, in an holy order, and regular way,
for private or publick good; and to hope for that reward
and crown which God the righteous Judge hath promised
those that persevere in well doing. My highest aim is, that
you may have liberty to exercise a good conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> void of
offence towards God and towards man, that they may wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
in all things live honestly.</p>
            <p>9. Are ye displeased with my Members? Alas, innocent
men, they pursue after the knowledge of, and communion
with God, in order to a rational, religious, spiritual, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perfect and unchangeable life; enjoying themselves in
the blessed enjoyment of God, the enjoyment of whom sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth
all their desires, rewards all their duties, requites all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60348:8"/>
their sufferings, compleats all their happiness; crowns and
perfects true Religion. They endeavour that <hi>on earth,</hi>
which they hope for <hi>in heaven; viz.</hi> a right knowledge and
a willing performance, which as reasonable they owe for
ever to God their Maker, Preserver, and Redeemer in
Christ. With this religious frame and temper, of which
themselves only are consciencious they prepare for a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and blessed immortality, with a sincerity of heart, and
uprightness of conversation, which hath no other Rule but
Gods Word, no other End but Gods Glory, no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
but the Constancy of this Disposition to their Lives end.
Innocent men, they look for one common Salvation they
use one common Sacrament, they professe one Faith and
Rule of Holinesse, they have one Gracious Temper, the
same inward sense of Duty and Devotion; they walk in the
same order with the Catholick Church over the face of the
earth.</p>
            <p>10. Doe you envy me my Patrimony and Maintenance,
what the Law of God allows me, what the Gospel hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
me, what the piety of elder times hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, what good Kings, Peers and people of their own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
me with, freely <hi>honouring the Lord with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
that they that served the Altar, might live by the
Altar? O why may not my children who attend the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
live by the Gospel, since they attend a Ministry as vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in its Mysteries, as clear in its Doctrine, as glorious in
its chief Minister <hi>Iesus,</hi> as painful to it's Ministers, and as
comfortable to pious and devout souls, as the Ministry of the
Law? Why are you offended that they of my children that
are taught, should communicate to them of my children <hi>that
teach in every good thing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. Do you envy my just Power and Authority, whereby
with the wisdome gravity and integrity of such men as are
invested with that power, I may chekc all abuses and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders

may recover my self to my former glory and renown, for
which I was spoken of throughout the world?</p>
            <p>12. Doe you except against the private infirmities, the

my ten thousand Ministers, it's likely some may doe
amiss. If when there were but three men in the world, one
was a Murtherer; if among <hi>Noah's</hi> sons one of the three
was disobedient; if among <hi>Iacob</hi>'s children, of two one
was prophane; if of twelve Apostles one was a Divel, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dissembled, and a third denyed his Master; if among
the Asian Angels, there is none but was to be reproved; if
among the few Primitive Preachers, there was a <hi>Demas that
loved the present world,</hi> a <hi>Diotrephes that loved the pre-eminence:</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60348:9"/>
among my so many thousand Clergy; it's not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but that some may fall short of the severe exactnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in all Ministers, who ought to be patterns in good
works.</p>
            <p>Oh my Clergy are not Angels, but men subject to the

just to forgive them their sins, and to cleanse them from all
unrighteousness.</hi> Be Perfection the glory of other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
the glory of mine is Sincerity. <q>Without all
peradventure, the most holy and all-seeing God, who
walketh in the midst of the Golden Candlesticks, whose
pure eyes are most intent upon the Ministers of the Church,
hath found iniquity in his servants the Bishops, and other
Ministers, both as to their persons and professions; all
things being open and naked to him with whom we have
to do.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. He observes how many consecrated and set apart to

sanctified the Name of the Lord God, their God, in their
Hearts and Lives in their Doctrines and Duties.</p>
            <p>2. The great Searcher of hearts knoweth how rashly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his Ministers undertake, how carelesly they manage
that great and terrible work, under which Angels may

things!</hi> how vulgarl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how unexemplarily they walk unworthy of the favour
and indulgence shewed them, to the amazement of their
High-calling, the dishonor of their Profession, to the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Dignity and Plenty, the endangering of their
Peace and Safety.</p>
            <p>3. He that is about our paths, and about our dwellings,
hath observed how unprep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and vainly, without any power of godliness, Life of
Religion, some performe the work of God, the great work
of Eternal concernment to our own and other mens souls.</p>
            <p>4. He whose eyes see, whose eye-lids try the children of
men, hath looked down from heaven, and observed the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of some mens holy things; their dead and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
instead of a living and acceptable serviee: he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of that supine negligence which hath sunk some
mens Ministrations below the just majesty, solidity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Gospel-dispensations; others by an affected height
and depth for want of plain instruction and charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending,
amuse the poor people, who know not what they
say, nor whereof they do affirm.</p>
            <p>5. He that will reprove, and set mens sins in order before
them, hath taken notice of some mens remiss compliance,
and others exact rigours, (according to their private tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
judgements and passions) whereby they swerved too
much from that just charity, discretion, legality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
which my Canons intented, and my constitution,
health and peace required; especially in the peevish touchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of these times, when so many subtle and envious ones
lie in wait to destroy me.</p>
            <p>Yet my Church-mens exorbitancies are not my constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
their failings are not my frame, their infirmities are
not my nature; their fall is no more mine who disallows it,
then the Angels fall may be the Heavens that forbid it:
their weaknesses are humane my authority is divine: that
charity which thinketh no evil, will not lay upon me those
enormities which I forbid by a Law, which I restraine by
Discipline, which I mourn for in mine Humiliation, and
discountenance in those great patterns that shew a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way. These sinnes (O the Christian world!) are
transgressions of my Law, affronts to my Authority the baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
of my Canons and Injunctions. O that my Apologie
were written, yea, printed in a book, for the satisfaction of
the world, <hi>that the good that I would do, that I cannot do?
and the evil that I would not doe that I do! I find a law of
my members against the law of my mind:</hi> So that it's no more
I, but the sins and the finners that dwell in me.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>ies; by a
Christian prudence defeated the attemps of Schismaticks,
by an exemplary humility and piety turned the hearts of
enemies, and by a miracle of Restauration silenced the
mouths of all men; you my Sons, opened the mouth of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
strengthned the cry of reproach, raised the clamours
of the envious. Oh, if an enemy had done this, I could
with the same Christian courage I have suffered these twenty
years, have born it; but it's you of my own bosome, family
and profession: O you, my Clergy, whom I expected more

this fiery furnace, might shine brighter then ever you did
with the love of Christ and of me his Church, both as to the
care of those private charges and publik inspections, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to you in excellent order, and by due authority: and
I expected that neither pride nor envy, pomp nor populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
neither covetousnesse nor ambition, should distract the

the reproach of an incensed people against my Order

Whosoever of you, notwithstanding the miracles both of

prefer, I need not care whom I may fear: if I carefully chuse
my Ministers I need not offensively suspend them: if I took
care whom I ordained, I might without any noise put an

popularly do they endeavour to preach? what dangerous
intimations do they make? how untowardly do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm?
how ackwardly doe they use my Ceremonies? and
read my Liturgy? When I consider the general approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and submission to my Government and Discipline before
the Wars, by all the Clergy and Layty of these Kingdomes;
and withal, remember how contrary to true Learning and
honest Integrity, as if they understood not what they did,
or that they did con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rashly complyed with, until they had examined all Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

With that caution was the Jewish Proselyte received to the
Synagogue? with what care ought a Christian be brought
to the Pulpit? Do they serve God in this complyance, or do
they serve the time? If they serve God, he was the same as
yesterday, so to day, and for ever. Do they serve the times?

then did you declare it superstitious, Popish, and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

unlawful? why do you practise it now? Was it against your

to see men build up in a day, that which they have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these twenty years. It's intolerable to see men keep their
places by Conformity, which they gained by Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
when they turned out honest men by crying down
my Government and Worship, now they keep them out by
compliance with my Government and Worship. Alas, to
see men Presbyterian in the beginning of the War, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent

we stop? Where we are now, we know; where we shall be

three thousand at one Sermon, it's nothing now that his

Well, I have but two Wishes; the first is, That
all who have gone astray may be reclaimed to the way of

—who can neglect the most successful errour, and own

which are uncertain. Is it the Kings Majesties favour they

God, if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the

Shall a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me, even this whole

after him: and when Naaman saw him running after him,
he lighted down from the charriot to meet him, and said, Is

when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,

            <p>2. And is the Church grown so contemptible, that it may
be bought and sold for money? Is Preferment rather a prize

spend their daies in serious studie, and their life in weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

the honour of the Church, and your own comfort: let it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60348:23"/>
be your shame that you make any advantage of your Livings
to the dishonour of God the danger of the Church, and the
ruine of souls. Oh ye ingenious Ministers, content your
selves rather that you deserve Preferment, then endeavour
to enjoy them in this vile, unworthie and dangerous
way: never stoop to these low terms: be rather buried in
an honest privacie, then appear with a publick infamie. <hi>Non
si nunc &amp; olim sic erit.</hi> Oh sacred and august Authoritie of
King and Parliament, own your former Laws; vindicate
your Authoritie; meet, meet this threatning mischief; set
a watch upon Patrons and their Stewards; frown upon the

about town, and set up as it were an Office for abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Take heed, Oh ye Patrons, how you lay the Childes

            <p>The Livings of such as are in the Ministry, are not in

but either for the Lease or present money. Such merchants
are broken into the Church of God, a great deal more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

might be able to preach the Word to them in season and out
of season and to fulfil his ministry, séek their own, and not
that which is Iesus Christs; they serve not Iesus Christ,
but their belly: and this is done not in one County, in one
place, but throughout all England. Oh mercifull God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to another world, with doleful complaints against you,
whom you never knew; whether any in Hell do not cry out

before the Judgement-seat of God, excusing themselves
with your faults, though you lay it not to heart; alleadging,
that they saw no more Religion in the world then Interest

looked not after, cursing the day that ever you were born,
that ever you were sent into the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there should be
so many Wretches that lived only to damn men. If it be a
Charge you desire, why doe you not attend unto that flock
over which the holy Ghost made you overseers? Why doe
you not in that calling wherein you are called abide with
God? Is it possible for you to serve two Cures? you will
hold to the one, and despise or neglect the other: and is it
possible for you to be saved? Lord, what if you gained the
world at the rate of undoing souls? Do you consider that
the bread you eat is the price of souls? How can you eat
with comfort, and think. Oh some of my charge may be now
going to Eternity, and I prepared them not? How can you
sleep securely, and think, Some of my charge may awake to

not? How can you die peaceably and think, <hi>Where shall we

Oh where are ye, O immortal souls? with God,
or for ever departed from the pefence of the Lord! Oh did
you ever read that of St. <hi>Bernard, Qui non unus sed plures

me once againe by these courses decaying, if you pity not
poor souls by this means perishing, Oh pity your selves, and
have mercy upon your own souls: Alas, that men should
be educated chargeably, should study diligently, should be
ordained solemnlie to delude souls, to mock God, to deceive
the world, and undo men, for two, or three or four hundreds
pounds yearlie, during a short life! that you should appear
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60348:27"/>
in a Pulpit (if yet you doe appear in a Pulpit) for a little
Maintenance! that you should appear very solemnly every
Sunday, onely to put a trick upon God and men! I hope
better things of you, and things that accompany salvation,
though thus I speak. <q>In the Primitive times every <hi>Church</hi>
of so many souls as are of your Parishes, had many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
whereof the ablest speakers did most in publick, and
the rest did the more of the less publick work, (which some
mistake for ruling Elders) but now one of you takes the
care of many Churches.</q> The Popish times, I mean years
632. could divide <hi>England</hi> into Parishes, for the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of the cure of souls: our times unite those Parishes
again, for the better maintenance of pride and vanity. Is
it for this that we are reformed? is it for this we are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants?
then each Parish had their Ministers to pray with
them ferventlie, to teach them faithfullie, to comfort them
seasonablie, to converse with them usefullie, to relieve them
charitablie, to direct them carefullie. Ah! <hi>in quae nos reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamur
tempora!</hi> Now, now my people are neglected, my
buildings are ruined, my hospitalitie is lost, my authoritie
is shrunk and faln, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is thought
to be nothing else but the interest of a few crafty Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ordering all things to their best advantage.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Envy</hi> may know, and <hi>Prejudice</hi> it self may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I am a Church made up of godly and religious men:
Princes, Nobles, Gentry, Bishops, Ministers and People, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an Orthodox Doctrine, a Primitive Government, a
pure and orderly Worship, a severe Discipline, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Communion in Word and Sacrament; who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
these extravagancies by wholsome Laws, checked them
by severe Canons, and disallowed them by fair and just
means imaginable. In the darkest and most superstitious
times, I ordered, <hi>That no Monks,</hi> i.e. <hi>idle persons, should take
Livings of Bishops, or appropriate the Revenues of them to
themselves; but that the Priests serving in those Cures, and the
Churches, might be provided with necessaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you know why Monks were pulled down in <hi>H.</hi> 8. time?
Lay it to heart, I beseech you; for many look for your fall too.</p>
            <p>1. They were accused for engrossing Wealth and trade; and
do you hear what the world saith of you? 2. They were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60348:28"/>
for impoverishing Parish-Priests by decrying Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as ministring matter of Schisms and Disputes, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
their own performances of Prayer and Devotion:
by which, and other Artifices, they undermined the poor
Priests, and procured that many Churches presentative, with
their Glebes and Tythes, were appropriated to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
leaving but a poor pittance for the <hi>Parish-Vicar.</hi> This
was the occasion of the first Impropriations; I pray God your
carelesness doth not occasion another.</p>
            <p>Oh remember <hi>Robert Whigifts,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Wellow's</hi>
speech, who was wont to say, <hi>That they and their Religion
could not long continue, because</hi> (said he) <hi>I have read the whole
Scripture over and over, and never found that Monasteries</hi> (and
I may adde Pluralities) <hi>were founded by God: for</hi> (said the
honest Abbot) <hi>every planting which my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you remember that Lay-parliament in King <hi>H.</hi> 8. his
time? wherein the Nobles and Commons assembled signified
to the King, That the Temporal profession of Abbots, Priors,
&amp;c. vainly spent, would suffice to finde 150 Earls, 1500
Knights, 6200 Esquires, 100 Hospitals? Doe you remember
those Mock-parliaments that often considered how many
1000 men your Tythes (ill bestowed upon you, as they
thought) would maintain? You were once undone,—
now are you made whole: I beseech you, my Sons, sinne no
more, left a worse thing come unto you.</p>

their own belly, and seek to be rich, and eat up the people of
God as if they were bread! They cannot say they have a
desire to sée the face of their flock, and that their heart is

                  </gap>,
and to live soverly, righteously and godly in this present
world. It were happy if all such were removed out of the
Church of God: they destroy the souls, and lead them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
by their negligence. What account shall they give
unto God for the souls of their Brethren? Where shall they
stand? or what will they say when he shall bid them make a
strait account? This is the practise of Satan, he useth all
means to snare us, and withdraw us from that blessed hope:
sometimes he letteth the encrease of the Gospel, by raising
up tumults, and disquieting the Church of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

We have indeed some Prophets, some Apostles, some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
some Pastors, some Doctors: but no Curates. Your
Commission (O my Sons) is,</hi> Go ye, and teach all Nations; <hi>not</hi>
Go ye, <hi>or send</hi> your Curates <hi>to teach all Nations. Hath your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
libertie to bring whom he will to your service, while he
takes his pleasure; and have you libertie to bring whom you
will to Gods service, while you take your pleasure? Oh Sirs,
the Scriptures run thus:</hi> Son of Man, I have made thee a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word of my mouth,
and give them warning from me. When I say unto the wicked,
Thou shalt surely die, &amp; thou givest him not warning nor speakest
to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life: the same
wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at
thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniqvity,
but thou hast delivered thy soul. Again when a righteous man
doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquitie, and I lay
a stumbling b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not
given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousnesse
which he hath done shall not be remembered, but his blood will I
require at thine hand. Nevertheless, If thou warn the righteous
that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin; he shall surely live
because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. I charge
thee therefore before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall
judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
Preach the Word be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. For the time
will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their
own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching
ears. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60348:31"/>
shall be turned into fables: But watch thou in all things endure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions

<hi>If you would be saved onely by Curates, then serve God

them, Thus saith the Lord God unto the shepherds, Wo be to the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of Israel, that do feed themselves: should not the shepherds
feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye cloath you with the wool ye
kill them that are fed: but you feed not the floch. The diseased
have ye not strengthned, neither have ye healed that which was
sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have
ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye
sought that which was lost: but with force and with cruelty have
ye ruled them. And they were scattered, because there is no shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:
and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they
were scattered. My sheep wandred through all the mountains, and
upon every high hill, yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face
of the earth, and none did search or seek after them. Therefore ye
shepherds hear the word of the Lord: As I live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith the Lord God,
surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to
every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did
my shepherd search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves,
and fed not my flock: Therefore O ye shepherds, hear the word of
the Lord, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am against the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to
cease from feeding the flock, neither shall the shepherds feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
any more, for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that
they may not be meat for them.</p>
            <p>2. Are Curates Ministers, or are they not? if not, why do you
employ them? if they are, why do they not live upon that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
that God hath allowed Ministers? You could not endure
rationally in these late times to hear of Stipends, yet now your
Brethren must be content with Allowances: and besides, if they
are Ministers, then either they have cure of souls, or not: if they
have cure of souls, why do they not attend their own charge? if
they have no cure of souls, how can they exercise any Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
act, seeing they have none to exercise it upon? no people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obliged to attend any but their own Minister: yea, all people
being bound to attend onely their own Minister. If you will

—One people can have but one Minister at a time.</p>
            <p>3. Do you who are non-resident expect tythes by mans Law
onlie or by Gods? Nor by mans Law onlie; for you have said,
and must say against the Anabaptist, That they are of Divine

            <p>4. Cannot the State keep Curates as well as you? If this be
all, may not the Commonwealth allow Salaries and Stipends as
well as you, and so remove the <hi>burthen of tythe?</hi> O Sirs, you
know not what to do; when the King, Lords and Commons
observe how much tythe goeth to maintain your pride, vanitie
and follie, and how little to maintain the service of God, they
say, what need this waste? why do we throw away so much of
the Publick Revenue, as amounts to two million and a halfe,
whereas half a million may maintain men to read prayers, and
do all the duties of Ministers? A Gentleman hath a Parsonage of
200 <hi>l.</hi> a year in his gift; Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith he shall I part with so much
of my Estate? cannot I give 20 or 30 <hi>l.</hi> to a Curate as well as
a Clergie-man? You will tell him, <hi>Sir, you Rob God.</hi> He will
say, no more then you: you know God onlie hath tythes when
they are employed in his service; and I shall allow so much and
more to Gods service then you do. Obj. <hi>Why should you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Lay-man, meddle with tythes, which belongs to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
Answ.</hi> I do not meddle with any which belongs to Gods
service, but with what is abused to mans wantonness. Obj. <hi>I
am a Clergy-man. Answ.</hi> So are Thousands more; yet none
hath right to tythe, but he that performs the dutie enjoined
them that receive tythe: tythe is not so much the maintenance
of Ministers persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as their wages for their work: but a little
of the tythe may suffice him who does the work, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
from what you allow; and reallie I do not know by what
Law of God or man a Clergie-man may turn his tythe to private
advantage, any more then a Lay-man. O Sirs, if you neglect
your Calling when you have maintenance, what will you do if
you had none? Oh you that condemne Sacriledge, do you live
by it? You that say a man should not rob the Church, do you
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60348:32"/>
rob it? You that preach and write against taking away Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
maintenance, doe you take away Ministers maintenance?
Is it for this the Nation upheld tythes against all oppositions, to
have a few Readers and Curates? What, have we saved them
from the Factious, to be swallowed up by the Covetous! Oh
you are men born to undoe your selves, to ruine your calling,
and to tempt a greedie world to take awaie all your mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Do you read Historie? (Alas, I am afraid that a spirit

their tythe from them;—the whole kingdome cryed,</hi> No Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
no Maintenance:—<hi>Yea, the poor people burned the
tythes, being loath the unworthy Ministers should have any benefit
by them, though loath themselves to meddle with them.</hi>—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it was agreed among the <hi>Thanes,</hi> that there should be no
maintenance given to Persons, but to Churches, which might
allow them to such persons as did them service; and that none
should live by Church-allowance, but they that did Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties.

the juggle of the Non-residents (in holding tythes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of the Ministrie for nothing, and in receiving a

were in Orders) was so apparent, that the whole maintenance
