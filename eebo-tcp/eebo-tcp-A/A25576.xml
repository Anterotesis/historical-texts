            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACTS of Mercy deſcend with Power, and come well Recommended from the Crown, to be Received with the higheſt Gratitude by the People: but Acts of Juſtice are our Laſting Securities; And tho' we are Aptto pitty the Afflicted, yet Publick Crimes require Publick and Real, Expiations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50105:5"/>
Such as I am, from Obſervation and Good Wiſhes, pretend to diſcern Safety, and the Kingdom in a State of Recovery, paſt danger of Relapſe; but Juſtice muſt be Vindicated. There are Meaſures, in proper Seaſon, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Confirming All, leaſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeem Precarious and, Deſperate Perſons, having Screwed up the Preparatories for our Ruin to the height, may diſcourage, very Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Subjects, if, inſtead of Effectual Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they ſhall be Able to Word Us into their Impunity.</p>
            <p>In good Earneſt, my Lord, nothing urges a Senſible Man more to ſpeak his Mind Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than while his Purſe is draining, or Blood letting out in the Reſcue of his Fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (and the more remote they are, the more at Heart it is with him) to find the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Country, and their Peace, at Home, in Plenty, and Eaſe, ſcarce Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but Remaining in Preferment, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Acquiſitions of Rapine; Ready, perhaps, for more upon the firſt Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in the mean time, under the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Illuſtrious, Spotleſs, Friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Smile and Diſdain, laughing in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50105:5"/>
their Sleeves, at the Worſhippers of Truth, and deſpiſing the Companions of Honeſty.</p>
            <p>I am ſo much a <hi>Roman,</hi> as to ſhed a Tear for an Acquaintance in Miſery, but cannot forget who Condemned a Son. When I hear it ſaid, Spare him for his Parts? My Reply is, Puniſh him the more, and not make that which Explains his Condemnation, the Reaſon of his Indemnity, I can no more Excuſe an Ill Man, for his good Parts, than, I would be ſuppoſed to write againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in anſwering the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> or to Arraign the Profeſſion of the Law, from whence ſo many of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, are Deſcended, in ſaying, there have been Wicked Judges, and as Bad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.</p>
            <p>The Text that informs me, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was Neighbour to the Traveller, tells me, likewiſe, who was not. He is my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who pours Oyl into my Wounds, and my Friend, that lets me retain the Image of God, in the Freedom of a Man. Wit, and Parts,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50105:6"/>
are of full Age at Five and Twenty, and muſt form into Judgment, with Reference to ſome Fundamental of Principle, by Thirty, otherwiſe, it is an Eſcape, if He runs not into Depravation, and a narrow One, if the publick Juſtice of his Country do's not at one time, or other, overtake his Extraordinary Actions.</p>
            <p>I am, therefore, <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> enough to hope for Juſtice, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> enough to deſire it in Mercy, yet ſo Exerted, That ſhe may ſhew her Head, in this glorious Revolution, and call to Account, thoſe Unfaithful Servants who Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up her Keys, &amp; Notorious Offenders, that broke in upon her Adminiſtration, Purſuing her Aſſertors to deſtruction, if the ſame God, who many Thouſand Years ago brought the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had not Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Us in her Low Eſtate, and Excited this Heroick Prince to Aſſiſt the Reſtoring our Paths, in the Eſtabliſhment of our Religion and Laws; Secure for Ages: Unleſs Divided, through Prejudice, and Trifling Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſtead of joining, as one Arm, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Common Adverſaries Abroad, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the whole, We part into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50105:6"/>
Faction, and Labour among our ſelves; Or, Frighted into a Stupidity at the Very Sight of our Eſcape, we become Unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to our own Advantages; Or rather, Degenerated by a Vicious Age, we have loſt our Courage, and our Prieſts their Zeal.</p>
            <p>If the Markets of Fortune do not take up our Thoughts, the Fields of Honour are Open to all our Virtues; The Deſolation in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> calls for our Sharpeſt Reſentment, and the Outrage of <hi>France</hi> is a Scene Worthy our Gallantry. Things, like Men, have their Climacterick, they may out live, but they ſhall Languiſh; Periods, alſo, are ſet, the Harveſt of Impiety may be Ripe for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger, and the Viſible Concurrence of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Means is a Sign the Decree is gone out.</p>
            <p>The Authorities are too many to be Repeated, and diſcourſed upon in the Compaſs of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but they are Known and Satisfactory to All, whoſe Intereſt, affection, or long habit of maxim controuls not the Uſe of their Judgment; And too ſtrong to be confuted in a Day, when the moſt Noble Part of Liberty, the Dictates of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50105:7"/>
Reaſon are allowed, Vouching to Us, That Kings by a General Derogation from the Laws, they are Truſted to Support, may Diſtreſs Themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is not Impoſſible, but Liberty Regained in One Quarter of the World, may ſound Charmingly into Another, and Wiſdom Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt Bigotry to an Empty Name. Conſtitution of Government, and Ancient Laws may gain a Preference before the Will or Empire, and Conſiderate People groaning under Heavy Burthens, if a Friendly Hand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to Eaſe then Shoulders may incline to throw them down, and hearken after a clear Poſſeſſion of Religion, and Property with Old Age, under their own Vines and Fig-Trees, rather than Fatigue in Slavery, to be Driven up and down, as Chaff, by the Breath of Luſt, and Training up their Children, from Generation to Generation, to Pall Untimely Sacrifices to the Wild Efforts of Ambition.</p>
            <p>Nor is any Prince, ſo far above the Reach of Fate, but if the Happy and Wiſe Reſtorer prove Comprehenſive to Fix Nations upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50105:7"/>
their Reſpective Solid Intereſts, Uniting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, as in the Body of Man, ſo to Ballance, and from thence to Work up one mighty Compound in the Bodies of State, but the Nurſery of the Cardinal may happen to End in Convincing the Oppreſſor.</p>
            <p>The Time I parted with to Undreſs the Commiſſioner in my Laſt, my Lord was to come the Better at the Adviſer in This, and tho' I might reduce the Hiſtorian to another Character with Eaſe, yet taking no Pleaſure in Accuſation, I will conſider ſome Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs in the beginning of your Second, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing me to your Notions of Councel at the Latter End, and refer all the Reſt to Thoſe, who more Concern'd in the Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may if they think Fit, find a more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Way of Anſwer.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Upon what Terms the Powerful Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> admitted your Perſon, accepted and recommended your Plea, is ſtrange to none, who have the Honour to know that Lord, the Strength of his Unqueſtionable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave Way to the Object of his Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; But if his Lordſhip had vouchſafed me leave to Publiſh ſuch a Plea, a Thought would have come in my Head, that he put me upon my Country, and the moſt I could hope from his Indulgence was, that if they found me Guilty of Ignorance, he would not Trouble himſelf to Charge me with more Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than my Preſent Circumſtances required, and from that Minute ſhould have determined with what regard to move towards his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a Second; For tho' Eaſy to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the very Note of Greatneſs, and from the Conſideration of Infirmity, the worſt of Men ſink gently with them, nor is Diſdain to be ſeen in their Countenances without a Line of Charity; Yet, on the other ſide, my Lord, the Uncorrect Looſeneſs of Argument Profanes Honour, and Care is to be taken by Men of Talent, leaſt the Dignity of the Patronage, leſſen in the Preſumption of the Client; Not,

            <p>A Meen between both, agreeable to the Caſe, with reſpect to the Perſon, Soft but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Maſculine, is far better Written to a Lord, than, <hi>It was my chance, I know not How to have a ſhare,</hi> &amp;c.

For if any but the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> himſelf ſhould tell me, He

had added to the number of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning Biſhops, if he had underſtood the Queſtion; I would anſwer it with a Smile. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> had the ſame Organs diſpoſing, and Methods of Advice, to inform his Judgment, as the other Biſhops had; If, to ſay no worſe, his Courage to Adhere had been the ſame: and to add theſe words, <hi>As well as I did afterwards upon their Trial,</hi> is Ignorance repeated, Ignorance upon Ignorance, to the laſt Minute.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops maintained their Poſt with Honourable, but not, Unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, Conſtancy, and the Impudence of the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> was no Diminution to the Credit of their Fortitude; The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtood as Firm to Them, the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Their Commitment was alſo, in it ſelf, a Warrant for Correcting that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond, and a Paſs for their Religion to Travel.

            <p>I hope, their Lordſhips will prove Firm to Us, and their Biſhopricks now, as in a chearful Allegiance, No longer Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Enjoyment with Unaccountable Reſerves, nor make Us ſuch Cruel Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns as to ſuffer the Profound Reſpect we have for Them, to Object againſt the Security of Our Selves.

many Bad Cauſes, Or the many Labours of one Bad Cauſe, if Great, or Learned, in the Eyes of the People, is a Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Creature; for the Powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Private Advantage with ſuch an Example, draws in the Numbers; The Firſt is neither True, nor of Reputation to Any Cauſe, and the Laſt makes a Good One Suſpicious, unleſs ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Act of Purgation aſſures him, and much more is required, than Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Looſe from Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the laſt Minute, when they were Ready to part by Conſent, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators behind the Curtain, only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them, like Generals, to draw up ſeemingly to Face the whole Body of the Clergy, to ſecure an Orderly Retreat in the Shape of Adjournment, with no more intent to meet again the Fourth of <hi>December,</hi> than, they deſigned to Eſtabliſh Liberty of Conſcience by a Religious <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or than, they were ſo vain as to think, tho' the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters accepted a Liberty of Worſhip, they

would ever conſent to Repeal the Teſts, or were able to Compaſs it Effectually for them, if they were ſo Ill inclined: but, as, I have ſaid in my Firſt, to Amuſe Us by Forms of Juſtice, till they were in a Poſture, to follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpoſing of our Principal Nobility, to put all the Reſt under Military Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation by the Aſſiſtance of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>'Tis Pleaſant to ſay, <hi>the Conſtant Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Wiſe Times has ſhewed, that Civil Diſſentions,</hi> and Quarrels are beſt Ended by <hi>the Largeſt Acts of Indemnity:</hi> And 'tis as Eaſy to prove the Contrary, and to ſhew that all wiſe Governments, from <hi>Sparta,</hi> down to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Miſtreſs of the World, were Supported by the Strict Execution of Impartial Juſtice, That Tyranny took poſſeſſion of her, at laſt, and has ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed more, by Flattering the wicked, than ſtrength; That Civil Diſſentions will never Extinguiſh, where there is matter of Faction, while ſome are too

Great, and others too wiſe for the Laws of their Country—'Tis a very little while ſince, in the late Kings Reign, Pardons flew about like Wild Fire; and the Act of Oblivion, my Lord, after the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, will ſhew you, that ſome of All ſorts were Excepted.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Nature in England is ſoon Apt to have Compaſſion</hi> upon <hi>the Afflicted,</hi> but he that ſays, ſcarce <hi>any thing can be more</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Party that is <hi>Uppermoſt, than</hi> to put <hi>Engliſh-men upon pitying thoſe that ſuffer under</hi> it, Articles with a Sword in his Hand, and Threatens while he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Certainly, it can neither become the Honour, nor Conſiſt with the ſafety of any Revolution, to let ſuch Language paſs, where Good Nature is Demanded: And tho' I preſume to join in this part of your Advice, my Lord, that the Revolution may be mild in the Event, yet not for the ſame Reaſons of being Bloodleſs in the whole Courſe of it, or believing there was much danger of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50105:32"/>
Bloodſhed, but Principally, to oblige the Merciful Diſpoſition of the King, whoſe Goodneſs recommended the Act, and, then to try, if. Marks of Reproach, with Confuſion of Face, may not ſtrike deeper, and more laſting Impreſſions into the Minds of the People, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from Villanous Attempts for the Future, than Sanguinary Diſpatches, the Work of a Minute, Forgot in an Hour.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Will ſay no more, My Lord, but this, that after great and unexpected Changes, That hath been always found the firmeſt ſettlement of any State or Government where the Prevailing Party hath look'd but very little backward, and very much forward; where Private Animoſity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge have wiſely given way to the greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Publick Pardon and Indulgence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perhaps, towards the beginning of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, a warm Impetuous Spirit may have its Uſe; But to Compoſe Things after ſudden Commotions, to Calm Men's Minds for the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſettle Affairs in a ſecure and Laſting Peace, moſt Certainly a gentle, generous, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Temper is the beſt.</hi>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Private Animoſity, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge are not to be imagined in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Aſſemblies of a Kingdom; My Lord, 'tis a great Overſight, or a higher Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50105:33"/>
to Mention them: The Impetuous Spirit of Reformation, is not Engliſh, Unleſs Affection paſs for a Crime; and Indifference a Virtue. To Compoſe Things after Sudden Commotions, to Calm Men's minds, for the preſent, a Generous, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured, Charitable Temper is Beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Sudden, hot-headed Tumult ought to be Quickly Appeaſed, and no more thought of; But when Conſpiracies have been of long Standing, Obſtinate, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt the Laws of a Nation, by Inches, the Growth of Many Years, the Intriegue of Ages to Ripen and Effect, they bear no likeneſs to Sudden Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; Nor can Affairs be Settled in a ſecure, and Laſting Peace upon any ſuch Revolution, without Deliberate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, Steddy Reſolutions, and Bold Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>The Firmeſt Settlement of any State, or Government after Great Changes, is, when the Prevailing Party goes to the Root of the Evil, as well in the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50105:34"/>
as the Deſign. The Sureſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Compoſing Things within, and Preventing Temptations to Berray from Abroad, is to let all Mankind ſee, no Injuries from thence ſhall paſs Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, becauſe no Offenders at Home can Eſcape without Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>If Miniſters of State were brought to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that, according to our Laws, they gave their advice at their Peril, Kings would be well ſerv'd, and Subjects live Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: Favourites would not only Examine Themſelves, before they Entred upon thoſe Important Truſts, but ſeriouſly Conſider how to Carry Themſelves when Engag'd; Nor would they Ever Attempt to accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Honours and Fortunes by gratifying the Unreaſonable Deſire of their Maſter, if, they were, Once, well Satisfied beyond words, That the Powers of the Prince were not Strong enough to protect Them, while they live, nor Death it ſelf to ſecure the Plunder to their Poſterity.</p>

Thus, my Lord, you ſee, ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording to the Premiſe of my Firſt, I am no Dealer in the Art of Language, Nor Accuſer, I do aſſure your Lordſhip, but a plain, Ordinary Man, a Reverencer of Publick Honeſty, Impartial Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Naked Truth. The Deareſt Friend I have, cannot charge me with an Approach to Flattery, nor my greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Juſtly yet, with any Act of Private Animoſity, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: Love for my Country raiſes me to <hi>Warmth,</hi> but no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Spirit.</p>
            <p>When I find a Man Acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Intereſt before, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in Adviſing her, out of his Station, now, I cannot help being Jealous and Satisfied, in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50105:35"/>
my own Breaſt, the Notions laid down are Diſagreeable to her Safety in General, however they may be taken for granted with reference to his Particular, am ſo much an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> as not to let them paſs for Unanſwerable Maxims and Standing Rules, without Oppoſition, of which the World is to Judge between Us.</p>
            <p>Perſons are not my Courtship, but Things my Induſtry, I Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Great, pay Reſpect to the Deſerving, and Share with the Really Afflicted; But, he that lays hold of Ignorance in ſo many Remarkable Tranſactions of his Life can be no ſure Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer; Nor, in my Humble Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought your Lordship to have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50105:35"/>
Pleaded ſo Liberally, for all the Criminals in the Kingdom, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you thought your ſelf the laſt Man upon Earth to be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
