            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vineyard, where they ſhall ever finde, never want worke: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which dare be idle and loyter heere, are worthy to be caſt out. The
Apoſtle compares the Church of God to a <hi>building,</hi> Ep. 2. 20. the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whereof hath ever beene ſuch a great eye-ſore to all ungodly men,
that their mouthes of wickedneſſe have ſtill extended themſelves wide
againſt it, crying of it, as they of Jeruſalem, Pſa. 137. 7. <hi>Raſe it, raſe it;</hi>
and their hands of violence lifted up, to <hi>downe with it, downe with it, even
to the foundation thereof.</hi> The caſe being thus, he is not worthy to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed

            <p>And if ever Diſtractions, Diſſentions, Diviſions, threatned the wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Church and State (as they alwayes doe) the Church of God in
this Kingdome, at this time, is in very much danger; wherein a generall
liberty is taken, in matters which concerne Religion, by people (of
what ſpirit I know not) to doe what they pleaſe, not what they ſhould.
Our malady we ſee, and cannot chuſe but complaine of; and if there be
not a ſpeedy cure thought on to apply unto our hurt, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>For my ſelfe being lately called to that publicke place where this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:113828:3"/>
was delivered, I thought it my duty to fall upon ſome ſubject that
might have relation to our preſent times and diſtempers. In which
you may pleaſe cleerely to behold the <hi>neceſſity of Government, as well in
Church as State,</hi> Then, <hi>how generally it is diſaffected, and by whom: eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the heavieſt of all burthens: who therefore doe what they can to throw it off:</hi>
which meditations, as they then paſſed through the eares (as I feare) of
many who then heard them: (for this I am ſure of, that abundance of
this ſpirituall ſeed every where miſcarries) ſo they now moſt humbly
deſire leave to take the boldnes, that through Yours, they may paſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of others, that may conſider them at leyſure and upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>
               <hi>Vox audita perit, litera ſcripta manet.</hi> That which we only hear may
eaſily ſlip from us; when as that we read, &amp; may read againe, in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
may ſtick by us. And the Lord in mercy make this thus ſucceſſeful.</p>
            <p>For ſurely there were never any people under heaven that enjoyed
and wanted more inſtruction then we doe: when we ſeriouſly conſider
how that Almighty God hath laid wide open before us the Books of his
<hi>revealed will,</hi> of his <hi>mercies,</hi> of his <hi>judgements:</hi> yet though we have been
taught abundantly by precepts, we have not <hi>learned:</hi> been preſt upon

               </hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
the body of this Kingdome was exceedingly corrupted, when it
could not live, unleſſe it <hi>bled,</hi> as it hath abundantly done, and yet the
cure is not <hi>perfect,</hi> nor ever ſhalbe, till Reformation make up that <hi>breach,</hi>
which ungodlineſſe hath <hi>troden downe.</hi> Now there is no Reformation
to be hoped for, without Religion: and no life, no power of Religion,
without Government, to <hi>order</hi> it, <hi>guard</hi> it, <hi>encourage</hi> it. Which Church-Government,
that Great Councell (of whom your very worthy Selves
are a part) have reſolved ſpeedily to eſtabliſh. The City of London are
ready to taſte, and like, and entertaine it. We in the Country do excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
want it, and the preſent want of that moſt deſired iſſue of your
great labours, is ready to fill us with as much impatiency, as poore Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel

            <p>
               <q>Now the Lord ſend it, and ſettle it throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and make all thoſe that ſhalbe called, to act in this great work,
like Joſhua, who when he was appointed to be a Leader and a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

<pb facs="tcp:113828:3"/>
in the increaſe of his Church, may be ever before their eies, ever in
their aime. And the Lord make us who are Miniſters of the Word, in
a ſpeciall maner to apply our ſelves unto all thoſe, with whom wee
ſhall have to deale in all <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>meekeneſſe,</hi> and <hi>tenderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
that ſo good and ſo great a worke, be not quite mar'd by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
indiſcreet or careleſſe handling. And the Lord give us argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to perſwade thoſe that have long continued in blindneſſe, and
conſequently have beene ignorant of the neceſſary truths of God,
now to encline their eares unto wiſdome, and to apply their hearts
unto underſtanding, Pr. 2. 2. that they may be while they are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of helpe, entreated to ſuffer God through Jeſus Chriſt, to ſave
their ſoules: and let God ariſe and have mercy in building up his Sion
amongſt us, that after our Eclipſe, he may appeare unto us in glory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was never yet any good and great worke carried on
without much oppoſition. From which, if that worke of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
ſo ſeriouſly and long debated by You, had beene exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I ſhould have joyned with thoſe that had moſt queſtioned it. But
now <hi>a great and effectuall dore is opened unto you;</hi> God having ſo bleſſed
the way you have reſolved to goe, that he hath given it a free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the hearts of many of his people; <hi>And you have many adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries;</hi>
and it cannot be otherwiſe, ſo long as there are ſuch a number
amongſt us, who are like bad Wares, which are for Darke ſhops, or
like unto Bleare-eyes, that cannot endure the Light.</p>
            <p>Moſt worthy Sirs, I dare not flatter you, and I ſhall not, if I tell you
that it hath been ever my thoughts, as the thoughts of very many more,
who have beſt meanes to know you, that you have done your parts in
this great worke. The advantage of whoſe prayers, you ſhall never
want to carry you on, in it, through it: and then whatſoever the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
be, you may waſh your Hands. The Lord who only can, moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
aſſiſt, and abundantly recompence the unwearied paines of you
All. I have this only to adde, in relation to your particular Selves, that
if my deare and tender reſpects unto you, cannot, your pardon may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ver ſince the world hath been planted with two different Seedes, all
the words and actions of men have been expoſed unto ſeverall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
as this following Sermon expected, and found; (which
occaſioned this preface) at which if they who tooke moſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
could but know, how tender I am of thinking amiſſe, much
more, of ſaying or doing any thing that may juſtly grieve the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of any who truely feare God: He would enter into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether I in reprooving, or he in meriting juſt reproofe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
moſt blame.</p>
            <p>It would trouble any one who hath not quite loſt himſelfe, to conſider how theſe
preſent times have diſtracted a very great number amongſt us by variety of opinions:
Many of which though they agree in the maine, (when a great number goe very much
further and doe not) ſo quarrell and contend about the liſt and fringe of Chriſts gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if they meant to rend in peeces that ſeameleſſe coate which muſt cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.
Alas Chriſt hath ſuffered abundantly for us already; why then deale we ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
with him, as to teare open his wounds afreſh by ſad oppoſitions, as if he were now
to be divided twixt Paul, and Apollo, and Cephas, which thing the Apoſtle reproves
and complaines of, 1 Cor. 1. 12. amongſt whom, ſome were taken with St. Pauls mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
ſome with Apollo, ſome with Cephas, admiring one of them to the prejudice of
the reſt. And there were ſome that ſaid <hi>I am of Chriſt.</hi> And what were theſe? But peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of ſeverall factions in the Church of Corinth, the laſt of which (though we may pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
them all) were of the very ſelfe ſame minde, that many amongſt us; are growne
ſuch <hi>perfectiſts,</hi> that they eſteeme themſelves above all ordinances, and therefore ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
neglect them: So depending (as they ſay) upon Chriſt, that they care not for any
Preacher in the world, they regard them not, they refuſe to heare, or pray with them,
eſpecially if they be orthodox, or rightly principled.</p>
            <p>God hath ſent forth abundance of light and truth, Pſal. 43. 3. Truth ſufficient to
eſtabliſh, annd light ſufficient to guide us; and it would be very ſad, if an over curious
ſearch after new light, ſhould put us out of the way, the old way, the good way, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 6. 16.
and ſo make us to hazard the loſſe of old truth.</p>
            <p>Alas, what would we have? What doe we expect? A new Chriſt, a new Paſſion, a
new Reſurrection: What would we be? Members of a glorious Church that hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing, Ephe. 5. 27. we muſt wait for that hereafter;
Why in the meane time doe ſo many ſad quarrells, ſharpe contentions ariſe amongſt us?
When we have, ſaid and done what we can Knowing, Beleeving, Doing, or Faith, &amp; Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
well ſtudied that they may be known, include in them a Chriſtians whole duty here.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſſe a number ſhall one day finde, (if ever they returne againe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
themſelves moſt miſerably deluded, that have hoped to finde, ſome other, ſome
nearer, and more ſafe and certaine way to Heaven, then that by which all the holy men
of God have paſſed, then that, which hath been pointed out unto us, by the lives of the
Saints, and enlightned for us by the flames of the Martyrs. Yet it is moſt notoriouſly
manifeſt, that there are too too many amongſt us, that preſcribe a ſhorter paſſage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:113828:4"/>
then any of thoſe worthies have ſound, by removing all thoſe blocks and rubs which
the Law of God caſts in a Chriſtians way thither, to make it more difficult: Which
Doctrine if it were as true as it is plauſible, he were worthy to periſh without party, that
would not cloſe with it: But this I am ſure of, that not any one of thoſe holy men of
God mentioned in the ſacred ſtory before the comming of Chriſt, nor any ſince, whoſe
praiſes are in the Goſpel, have made it appeare unto the world that there is any ſuch way
to be diſcovered: That bleſſed Apoſtle himſelfe, who was ſuch a choſen veſſell, who
had ſuch abundance of Revelations, 2 Cor. 12 7. was never acquainted with this; if
he had, certainely he would never have complained ſo much, ſo often of the Law which
gives ſuch a <hi>ſtrength to ſin</hi> and ſuch a <hi>ſting to death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15 56 He would never have
ſo complained of <hi>that body of ſin, of that body of Death which was in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore Reader, let me entreate thee now before thou leave me, to have the
patience ſeriouſly to conſider of, theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, and in a ſpeciall manner to take heede of ſpirituall Pride, that great ſin which
banes thouſands, by ſad and ſeverall miſtakes, in entertaining a floating knowledge,
for true wiſdome; a diſtempered heate, for true Zeale; Conceits and conceivings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Religion, to be true Religion indeede. Oh how doth this Pride ſwell, bladder,
puffe up thouſands like empty veſſells, to make a great ſound; Putting low and baſe
eſteemes upon others; Like the people of China, who boaſt that themſelves only have
two eyes; when all the people in the world beſide, have but one. Know thou, that the
moſt excellent Chriſtian in the world is moſt humble; And that a good man is firſt
in another mans, laſt in his owne commendation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, know that there is a naturall aptneſſe, and propenſity in all, to ſet up Idols
in their <hi>hearts and heads,</hi> Ezek. 14. Where they are hardly diſcovered, and whence not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
remooved, which they doe not only love, but dote on, and therefore they hug, and
dandle thoſe deformed iſſues of their owne braines, as women doe the Children of their
bodies, and eſteem, what ever others thinke of them, as the Crow their Bird moſt
faire, <hi>Woe unto them</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>that call evill good, and good evill; that put darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for light, and light for darkeneſſe, and woe unto them that are wiſe in their owne eyes &amp;c.</hi>
Iſaiah 5. 20. 21. becauſe wiſedome preſumed on, and drawne from the broken ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of a mans owne braine, is in the reputation of God, and hath as great an woe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it in that Chapter, as the ſins of <hi>Covetouſneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> or <hi>Drunkenneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, take this for granted before hand, that there is very much deceit in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
if not, our bleſſed Saviour had ſpared that precept in the ſeventh Chapter of Iohn
v. 24 <hi>not to judge of things according to appearance, but to judge righteous judgement.</hi> Becauſe
many things that appeare, are not what they appeare to be: Becauſe Satan that he may
the more certainely deceive, <hi>can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 14.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, in all thy undertakings before thou conclude of any thing, order thy actions,
and thy reſolutions by thoſe words in the nineteenth of Judges the laſt verſe, firſt, <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
ſecondly, <hi>take advice,</hi> thirdly, <hi>ſpeake thy minde,</hi> or reſolve what to doe: Or as that
Scripture is rendred in the former tranſlation 1 <hi>conſider, 2 conſult, 3 give ſentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, ſeriouſly conſider of the thing in queſtion; for Inconſideration, and Prejudice
were never made for competent Judges. Conſider of things whether they be true or falſe.
Now for the triall of truth; Antiquity muſt ground, and bottome it: The un-erring
word of God muſt balance and trie it: And the lives and practiſes of all the holy men
<pb facs="tcp:113828:5"/>
of God, whom God hath propoſed to us for examples muſt ratifie and confirme it, and
this ſcrutinie muſt be moſt impartially carried.</p>
            <p>Firſt, truth is grounded upon Antiquity; it was from the beginning, for there are no
new Divine truths, <hi>quod verrum antiquum, quod falſum recens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the word of God muſt ballance and trie it, and therefore trie before thou
truſt. Beleeve not every ſpirit, but trie the ſpirits whether they be of God, 1 Ioh. 4.
1. Repaire to the Law and Teſtimonie &amp;c. Iſaiah 8. 20 Prove all things, hold faſt that
which is good, 1 Theſ. 5. 21. Loane not to thine owne underſtanding, Pro. 3. 5. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
how that others who labour to get the knowledge, the right interpretation of
Gods revealed will declared in his word; Firſt, from God by prayer; Secondly, from
men by conference; Thirdly, from Bookes by reading; And are further able to reade
the holy Scriptures in that language wherein they were firſt written, may be able (to
ſpeake no more) to give the ſenſe of a Scripture as well as thou, that canſt but, or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcarce reade it in the Engliſh. For thy further and better inſtruction therefore:</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſult not with men only of thine owne opinion, but with others alſo: for
if we will ſee things aright, we muſt ſometimes make uſe of other mens eyes, as well as
of our owne; for in our owne there may be ſome defect, and we know that pore-blind,
and blood-ſhot, and ſquint-eyes cannot ſee well, the laſt looking over, or beſides the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and the other two cannot well diſcerne things as they are.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, when thou haſt wiſely conſidered, and carefully conſulted, then reſolve:
And that thou maieſt ſo doe, to the quiet and comfort both of thy ſelfe and others, know
that the wiſedome which is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, Jam. 3. 17. and
therefore follow peace and holineſſe, Heb. 12. 14. Never think thou art too good, too
upright, too holy, too religious, ever in the right uſe of all good meanes, ſeeke, labour,
ſtrive, ſtudy, covet to be better, for this is a juſtifiable covetouſneſſe, 1 Cor. 12. 21. and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
peace too, every one ſtriving to exceed one another in love, for this is a godly emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Thus have I inſerted ſomething by way of Preface before theſe following meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
if this, or they ſhall prove any way uſefull, I have my reward: if otherwiſe, my very
hearty deſires to caſt in my mite, by offering ſome word in ſeaſon amongſt thoſe many
(by much more worthy) that have made themſelves publicke, ſhall be my comfort.</p>

25. <hi>that God by the mouth of his ſervant David ſaid; why
doe the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?
&amp;c.</hi> And this Pſalme was pen'd by David (as is moſt
probably conceived) after his victory over the
Philiſtines, who gathered themſelves againſt him,
when the people had made him King in the roome of Saul.</p>
            <p>And now that we may make as much of this Pſalme our owne this
day as may help us to the cleerer underſtanding of this text, I beſeech
you take notice, that the three firſt verſes in it, are a narration of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of many wicked men againſt the Kingdome of David as the
Type, and againſt Chriſt too, as the Antitype, or perſon typified in this
Pſalme.</p>
            <p>The carriages, projects, attempts of theſe wicked unruly men, who
would caſt off ſubjection; are expreſt here in the firſt verſe by way of
interrogation, <hi>why doe the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?
&amp;c?</hi> the Prophet admiring their folly, in going about that, which was
impoſſible for them to effect, <hi>why doe they rage?</hi> Or come tumultuouſly

to what purpoſe is all this? when God who can, will maintaine Davids

a lie,</hi> as it is Pſal. 7. 14. for Chriſt ſhall confound them, he ſhall firſt <hi>ſcorne</hi>
and <hi>laugh</hi> at their attempts v. 4. (God ſpeaking there after the manner
of men) for God will make them to know how that they which reckon
without him, muſt reckon againe. <hi>He will ſpeake to them in wrath, vexe
them in diſpleaſure,</hi> as it is verſe 5. or he will handle them roughly (for ſo
tis in the originall) <hi>breaking them in peeces like a potters veſſell verſe 9.</hi> their

an earthen veſſell, once broken, never to be repaired. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this their <hi>aſſociating</hi> and <hi>leaguing</hi> together, their <hi>animating</hi> and <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging</hi>

which as they are ſpoken here, I would have looked upon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,

which there are two words which need ſome explication, and they are
<hi>bands</hi> and <hi>cords</hi> which here ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>

            <p>The words in this text containe in them a <hi>reſolution,</hi> and the thing <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on,</hi> which you may conſider together in this following paraphraſe.
<hi>Let us breake their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us,</hi> thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
one another in their rebellious attempts, as if they had ſaid,
<hi>neither the Lord nor his Anointed ſhall raigne over us,</hi> and howſoever they
thinke to impoſe upon us their <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> that with theſe,
as with ſtrong <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>cords,</hi> they may fetter us; yet <hi>let us,</hi> which is

the thing they reſolve on, beſtirre our ſelves, and play the men; let us
ſhake off the yoke of ſuch ſervitude, and wholy reject their government,
<hi>for who are Lords over us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This text is rich and full, and may fitly be compared unto Ezekiels
<hi>roule,</hi> mentioned in the 2 Chap. of his Propheſies, ver. 10. <hi>that was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
within and without,</hi> that which is written without, or that which this
Scripture by neceſſary conſequence firſt holds forth unto us, is this, that.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>Good Lawes are as bands, and cords for diſcipline, to keepe people in
obedience.</hi> Secondly that which lies <hi>within</hi> the text, is firſt for the generall
this; that, Obſ. 2 <hi>Rebellious ſpirits affect nothing ſo much as lawleſſe
liberty, to do what they pleaſe without controll.</hi> Hence it is that they here
conſult of breaking theſe bands. For being reſtrained,</p>
            <p>Obſ 3. <hi>Theſe ſpirits thinke themſelves in bondage, or as Priſoners in bands
when they are required to yeeld obedience unto equall and juſt Lawes.</hi> Therfore
they would caſt away theſe cords, that they may not reſtrain them. And
laſtly that theſe rebellious ſpirits may be looſe at liberty, to do what they
pleaſe, not what they ſhould. And that they may effect their deſires in this</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. 4.</hi> Rebellious ſpirits animate, and hearten, and ſtir up, and encourage
one another, in this ungodly enterprize, to caſt off all ſubjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us breake their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> Thus
for the ground-worke of this Mornings exerciſe, have I preſented unto
you, what this Text holds forth to me. The obſervations, as I conceive,
are proper, naturall, pertinent, and perſpicuous from this Scripture.
And my diſcourſe ſhall be plaine to; So that if any be come hither this
day, for the vanity and froth of wit; (as I know how that theſe queſie
times peſter every great Congregation, with ſome ſuch hearers) if any
be come to this place at this time, as pamperd bellies uſe to go to feaſts,
where nothing can pleaſe the wanton palat, but ſome odde ſawce, or
new invention: I am not provided for the entertainement of ſuch. But
for you, beloved, that are come hither to <hi>heare,</hi> that you may <hi>learne,
learne,</hi> that you may <hi>know, know</hi> that you may <hi>beleeve</hi> and <hi>do; Beleeve and
doe, that you may live.</hi> Favour me ſo much, as to afford me your moſt
diligent attention, while by Gods moſt gracious aſſiſtance, I ſhall take
a further view of the particulars I have obſerved; And firſt of the firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer. 1.</hi> Good Lawes are as bands and cords for diſcipline, to keepe people
in obedience.</p>
            <p>Good Lawes are the <hi>nerves and ſinewes</hi> of Common-wealths, which
hold altogether; the want whereof, like to great <hi>depopulations,</hi> lay all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113828:7"/>
things common. They are as <hi>mounds</hi> unto vineyards, as <hi>bounds</hi> to Seas;
or as <hi>walls and bulworks</hi> unto frontier towns, to keep all in ſafety. Hence
it is, that Princes and Magiſtrates, in relation to their places, which
are to defend the people in all their juſt rights, are called <hi>the ſhields of
the Earth.</hi> The want of whom, he that reads the third Chapter of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiahs
Propheſies, may finde in that which followed, when God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take away <hi>the mighty man, and the Iudge, and the Prophet, and the
Prudent, and the Ancient,</hi> &amp;c. But what was the conſequence of this?
The Text tells us, v. 5. <hi>The people ſhould be oppreſſed every one by another,
every one by his neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. For what were thoſe elſe, whom God
there threatned to remove, but the very <hi>ſtayes</hi> and <hi>ſtrengths</hi> of Jeruſalem
and Judah? and ſo of all Cities, and Nations, of all publike and politike
Bodies whereſoever. And he which runnes, may further read, how
that this people of Iſrael, as they enjoyed many comfortable, ſo they
were acquainted to with many ſad and diſmall times. And if ye ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
conſider their ſtory, ye ſhall finde that it was never worſe with
them, then when <hi>there was no King in Iſrael, but every one did that which
was right in his owne eyes,</hi> Jud. 17. And however it may be true, that the
government of man over man, came firſt from ſin, (as I finde it excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
obſerved) Firſt, becauſe God gave ſoveraignty unto Adam over
<hi>fiſhes,</hi> and <hi>birds,</hi> and <hi>beaſts,</hi> not over reaſonable creatures made to his
owne likeneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the firſt righteous men we read of, were <hi>ſhepheards</hi>
and <hi>heardſmen,</hi> over beaſts, not <hi>Kings</hi> over Nations. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe the name of <hi>Servant,</hi> or underling, was never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in Scripture, till Noah denounced it againſt his accurſed ſonne,
<hi>Curſed be Canaan, a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren,</hi> Gen. 9.
25. Yet the nature of mankinde ſtanding as it doth, corrupted ſo farre,
that without the head of Authority, we could not live, nor converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
God therefore in infinite wiſedome, hath appointed this <hi>means</hi>
for the ſuppreſſing of thoſe many, and thoſe intollerable injuries and
violences, which otherwiſe we ſhould be ſubject unto. And therfore</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon. 1.</hi> Firſt, for order ſake, there muſt be government; a ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and an inferiority, a command and a ſubjection, a maſtery and a
Dominion in every order of men ſpecially deſigned. The body Politike
is very fitly compared unto a naturall body; which muſt not be all <hi>head,</hi>
or <hi>hand,</hi> or <hi>foot,</hi> but diſtinguiſhed into ſuperior and inferior parts, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

the middeſt of the body, as a <hi>King</hi> upon his Throne, and according to
the dictates of the heart, the tongue ſpeakes, the eyes looke, the feete
move, the hands ſtir, &amp;c. Now a body Politike may moſt fitly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to this Naturall body, wherein there are parts, as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes, more and leſſe honourable, 1. Cor. 12. yet all tending to the
mutuall <hi>decency, ſervice,</hi> and <hi>ſuccour</hi> of the fame body. The Aegyptians
made an <hi>Eie</hi> and a <hi>Scepter,</hi> the Embleme, by which they figured their
government: a Scepter for Juriſdiction and power; an Eie for watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and diſcretion. And certainely a Kingdome without order and
government, is like the body of that fayned Giant Polyphemus, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an eie,</hi> or rather like a <hi>body</hi> without an <hi>head:</hi> or, (which moſt fitly
reſembles it) like that <hi>confuſed Chaos</hi> before the Creation, where heighth
and depth, light and darkeneſſe were mingled together. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therefore when heaven and earth were firſt made, God eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſuperiority and rule, in other creatures after their kinde, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in man. So Gen. 1. 16. <hi>God made two great lights, the greater to
rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night: he made the ſtarres alſo.
And one ſtarre to differ from another in glory,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. 41. And preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, when he had created man, he inveſted him immediately with
<hi>imperiall authority to ſubduethe earth and to rule in it,</hi> v. 28. And to what
other end is it called the <hi>hoſt of Heaven,</hi> Gen. 2. 1. but to ſhew, how
that Metaphor is taken from an <hi>Army,</hi> where there muſt be ſuperiority
and ſubordination, command and obedience, without both which, it
cannot ſubſiſt? For if the ſpirit and ſoule of obedience be taken away,
what can follow but <hi>Ataxie</hi> and <hi>Confuſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon 2.</hi> Secondly, there muſt be Government, and Diſcipline, <hi>for
neceſſities ſake,</hi> to curbe and reſtraine all tumultuous and heady ſpirits, all
offenſive and diſordered perſons, whether in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
The Lawes of God were firſt written in the <hi>fleſhy tables of mans
heart;</hi> but <hi>ſin</hi> did either blot or wear them out thence. Then the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God thought fit to write them upon <hi>tables of ſtone,</hi> that they
might be <hi>laſting, durable permanent.</hi> But theſe Lawes of God thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and commended, and commanded unto man, where ſlighted, and
neglected, and forſaken by him, and therefore <hi>Irenaus</hi> well obſerves in
his firſt booke againſt hereſies, that therefore God appointed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and men to rule in them, becauſe man forſaking God, did wax
feirce, lawleſſe, maſterleſſe, and being not ſufficiently awed by <hi>the feare
of the Lord,</hi> God therefore put upon them the <hi>feare of man,</hi> that fearing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113828:8"/>
humane Lawes, they ſhould not devoure, deſtroy, conſume one another
as the <hi>fiſhes</hi> of the Sea, and the <hi>beaſts</hi> of the wilderneſſe, and the <hi>fowles</hi>
of the aire doe. And for this reaſon there is an abſolute neceſſity of
<hi>Lawes,</hi> to curbe, and reſtraine, and to keepe people under obedience:
for were it not for theſe our <hi>beds</hi> would not be ſuffered to lie under us;
our <hi>meate</hi> would be pulled out of our mouths, our <hi>clothes</hi> would be torne
off our backes; <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> would deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Now for application, this being ſo, as it muſt needs be granted
to be truth, What juſt cauſe have all people, who live under <hi>good Lawes</hi> to
bleſſe God for them. To one who asked the queſtion why the City <hi>Sparta</hi>
had no wals, twas anſwered, that the Citizens had good <hi>weapons</hi> in their
hands, <hi>unanimity</hi> in their hearts, and to both theſe <hi>good Lawes</hi> to order
them. We want no weapons, and theſe ſad times, have made almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one amongſt us a man of war. And would to God that we had juſt
cauſe to boaſt of <hi>unity,</hi> and mutuall agreement amongſt our ſelves. But
for good <hi>Lawes,</hi> certainly we of this Nation, have as great cauſe to be
thankfull, as any people under the Cope of Heaven, ever had. And oh
that we had as juſt cauſe to prayſe God for their due <hi>execution</hi> likewiſe!
But alas we have not. Oh <hi>juſtice!</hi> how faintly doeſt thou draw thy
breath, while thou ſuffereſt ſo many <hi>deſperate ſinners,</hi> and ſo many <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſeducing Schiſmaticks,</hi> to march boldly by thee, and not bidſt them
ſtand? Alas how doth the whole Land <hi>ſtinke</hi> of that beaſtly ſin of <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,</hi>
that ſin which robs a man of himſelfe, and leaves a <hi>beaſt</hi> in the
skin of a <hi>man.</hi> That ſin which is like the <hi>ſerpent</hi> that <hi>ſtings two waies,</hi> for
it kills the <hi>body,</hi> and ſlaies the <hi>ſoule</hi> too, yet how doe thoſe <hi>Tents</hi> of
wickedneſſe, thoſe <hi>Thrones</hi> wherein Satan dwells, thoſe unneceſſary
tipling houſes, which ſo multiply Tranſgreſſors, and tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, increaſe amongſt us? How doe <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> ſtrive
for the upper end of the table? How doth the very <hi>breath</hi> of moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſwearers, and blaſphemers even <hi>poyſon</hi> the very aire of the Kingdome
wherein we live? And how doth the <hi>ſtone out of the Wall, and the Beame in
the Chamber, cry out aloud againſt oppreſſion?</hi> And how hath the <hi>Error of
Religion</hi> made many amongſt us ſo <hi>wanton,</hi> that they know not what <hi>to
have,</hi> nor what <hi>to hold?</hi> Surely as the Prophet Iſaiah complaines Iſai. 24.
20. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the earth</hi> (of this earth whereon we live) <hi>lies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
upon it.</hi> And now O juſtice how doeſt thou degenerate from thy ſelfe,
while thou ſuffereſt thy <hi>ſword</hi> for want of drawing to <hi>ruſt,</hi> or elſe for
<hi>feare,</hi> or for ſome other <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie reſpects to be <hi>lock't</hi> up in the ſcabbard?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113828:8"/>
I am not come hither to declame againſt the adminiſtration of juſtice
in this <hi>honorable City</hi> (this City ſo renowned for exemplary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the world over) though I muſt tell you that if I knew any juſt cauſe
to invite me hereunto, I ſhould not ſpare. But this I am ſure of, that
there is <hi>an intollerable,</hi> an unanſwerable <hi>fault</hi> ſome where, when ſo much
<hi>wickedneſſe</hi> goes unpuniſhed, when ſo many <hi>errors, ſchiſmes, hereſies,</hi> ſome
of which deſtroy, as the reſt doe blaſt the profeſſion of Religion, are <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
amongſt us,</hi> though we have lifted up our <hi>hands</hi> unto the moſt high
<hi>God</hi> in a ſolemne League and Covenant to the contrarie. Or if they
meet with any rebuke from ſome, it is but ſuch a one, as that too-too much
indulgent Ely (who brought up his ſonnes to bring downe his houſe)
gave his ſonnes 1 Sam. 2. 23. ſaying why doe you ſo, or ſuch things?
A ſtrange thing in Ely to puniſh the <hi>Thefts, Rapines, Sacriledge, Adulters,
Inceſts of his ſonnes</hi> with <hi>why doe you ſo?</hi> what was this but to <hi>ſhave</hi> that
head which deſerved to be <hi>cut off?</hi> Doubtles (as I find it excellently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to my hand) it is with <hi>ſins</hi> in the ſoule as with <hi>humors</hi> in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
a weake doſe doth but ſtir, and anger, and more dangerouſly diſperſe
them, not purge them out. So that tis certenly a great violation of juſtice,
not to proportion the puniſhment to the offence. To <hi>whip</hi> a man for
murther, or to puniſh the <hi>purſe</hi> for Adultery or Inceſt, to burne treaſon
in the hand; or to award the <hi>Stocks</hi> for Burglarie is to patronize evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of avenging it. Of the two extremes rigor is more ſafe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique-weale,
becauſe the over puniſhing of one offence keepes many
from committing the ſame.</p>
            <p>Elies ſonnes did thus wickedly while they acted a part in Religion.
And are not there ſome amongſt us, who under ſpecious pretences to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi>
perſiſt in courſes that undoubtedly in concluſion if God prevent
it not, will <hi>undermine</hi> roote out <hi>Religion</hi> from amongſt us? <hi>Religion</hi> I ſay
then which nothing ſhould be mor deare unto us, yet this is knowne,
and ſuffered, and if it receive any cheeck from ſome, it it ſuch a one, as
doth rather encourage, then daunt offenders, <hi>ubi nunc Lex Anglica? dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis?</hi>
Oh yee Lawes of England what doe yee? where are yee? are yee
aſleepe?</p>
            <p>I told you even now what great cauſe we of this Nation have to bleſſe
God for good Lawes, and ſuffer me to acquaint you in the next place,
how dearly in many reſpects a number in this Kingdome have miſſed
theſe laſt few yeares while deſtruction hath been amongſt us, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which otherwiſe might have been enjoyed, by the execution of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113828:9"/>
thoſe good Lawes, if their current had not been more or leſſe obſtructed.
I cannot deny but that while the <hi>ſword of war</hi> is in a Land it cannot chuſe
but marvellouſly <hi>claſh</hi> with the <hi>ſword</hi> of <hi>juſtice;</hi> and many things will be
done, and cannot be avoided while it continues under ſuch a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in regard the ſword hath beene in the hands of many of ſuch
ill principled hearts: I ſpeake not of all, for there be many whom God
hath ſtirred up perſonally to appeare in this his great worke, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
all honour, as well for their Piety as Valour; but of ſome, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
refuſe and dregges of Mankinde, in whom that old Proverbe is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<hi>Armatis Divum nullus Pudor:</hi> That they feare neither God nor
Man, as you may obſerve in their moſt debauched lives, in doing what
they pleaſe, and in their Helliſh language too, whoſe mouths are full of
curſing and bitterneſſe, which they belch out, ſetting their mouthes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
againſt Heaven; for they ſeldome take that Sacred dreadfull Name
of GOD, into their moſt deſperate prophane lippes, but when they
blaſpheme that Name, which ſhould not be once mentioned, but with
awfull Reverence: or when they deſire God to damne, to refuſe them.
Now by the way, let me adde this, that if God ſhould ratifie that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
which they deſire (miſerable wretches as they are) againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on earth, and ſay <hi>ex ore tuo,</hi> from thine owne mouth will I now
condemne thee; Oh! how ſadly miſerable would their condition be?
<hi>Nemo miſerius miſero, non miſerante ſeipſum:</hi> Who can be more miſerable
then thoſe, which will not be mercifull unto themſelves? Yet beſides all
theſe, give me leave to ſpeake it, though it be a very ſad, a very horrible
truth, that divers things have beene done (or if not, very many in this
Kingdome deſerve to be puniſhed for crying and complayning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
juſt cauſe) by ſome others of thoſe, who have moſt ſhamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
that truſt repoſed in them by our moſt deſervedly honored Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that needed not, that ought not, that ſhould not have been done.
Things which no language can excuſe; things, which ſcarce any act of
oppreſſion in former times can parallell. <hi>Very horrible things have beene
committed in the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—pudet haec opprobria nobis,</l>

            </q>
            <p>The conſideration whereof ſhould put colour in our faces, and cover
us with ſhame, if we be not paſt, beyond a bluſh, when wee conſider
that many griping evills might have been, and have not beene preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or becauſe boldly acted, have not beene moſt ſeverely, moſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113828:9"/>
puniſhed. And therefore it is high time for us, who are the
Lords Remembrancers, to ſpeake by the pound and talent, to reprove
in words of weight, for the gentle ſpirit of Eli is not ſufficient to amend
children that are paſt grace; and therefore we muſt crie aloud, ſpeake
out, ſpeake home, ſpeak all, though we lived in times that would ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
us in thoſe <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>cords</hi> in my Text, for our plaine and impartiall
dealing. Now that things have beene ſo, we may ſit downe and ſadly
complaine: but why they have beene ſo, we need not much to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when we conſider the next particular in this Text: that,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ. 2.</hi> Rebellious spirits affect nothing ſo much as Lawleſſe liberty, to
doe what they pleaſe, without controll.</p>
            <p>Rebellious ſpirits, who are they? Such as caſt off <hi>ſubjection, ſuch as
breake the yoke, burſt the bands, as the Prophet ſpeakes,</hi> Ier. 5. 5. The yoke,
the bands, which ſhould reſtraine, regulate, order them, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they affect nothing ſo much as Lawleſſe liberty. <hi>Lawleſſe liberty,</hi>
and what is that? When men doe what they pleaſe, not what they
ſhould; notwithſtanding all reſtraint of Lawes and government to the
contrary. This too, too much belov'd liberty, without doubt is marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
affected by the corrupt nature of man. Tis a ſin of a very ancient
growth, for it tooke its firſt riſe from the very firſt tranſgreſſion. In
the garden of Eden, amongſt thoſe many plants which God made, ſome
for ornament, and ſome for uſe, ſome for ſight, and ſome for ſent, and
ſome for taſte: not farre from the goodlieſt trees of Life and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
grew the bitter root of diſobedience: I call it ſo, becauſe the
forbidden fruit grew on that tree, of which our firſt Parents tooke and
taſted, though they were commanded not ſo much as to touch it, Gen.
3. 3. The taſte whereof did not only infect themſelves thorowout, but
the corrupt nutriment thereof, did alſo convert it ſelfe into the whole
body of their ſucceeding linage. Mee thinkes there is very much in that
firſt ſtory of Diſobedience, to illuſtrate this point: when our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in their eſtate of Holineſſe, who had power in them to <hi>Obey,</hi> as
well as <hi>Diſobey,</hi> and God had told them that of every tree in the garden
they might freely eat, the tree of Knowledge only forbidden, Gen. 2.
16. 17. And though there was no compariſon betwixt the Maker, and
the murtherer of Mankinde, the Father of Truth and the father of lies,
betwixt a God and a divell: and the one had forbidden but one tree,
and had fenced it (as it were) with a double hedge of a double death,
<hi>temporall, eternall;</hi> yet when the Serpent came to the woman, with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113828:10"/>
meere contradiction to the voyce of God, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 3.
4. how credulous and forward was ſhee to entertaine his ſuggeſtion?
Our firſt Parents tooke their fall by their owne wilfull Diſobedience,
and we fell in them, Ro. 5. 19. Their Perſons infected their Nature, but
our nature ever ſince infects our perſons. <hi>Ne mali fiant times, naſcuntur:</hi>
We are borne bad, as well as become ſo; our ſin ſticking more cloſe to
our nature, then our skin doth to our fleſh. And it is no marvell now,
if our nature ſo marvellouſly corrupted, be ready to break every branch
of the tree of Good, which God commands, and of the tree of Evill,
which God forbids; this ſinfull corruption being like a violent ſtream,
which the longer and further it runnes from the fountaine, runnes with
the greater violence. After the flood when the people began to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
they grew heady, exorbitant, violent, unruly, little leſſe then mad,
for they went about an impoſſible worke, <hi>to build a towre whoſe top might
reach to heaven,</hi> Gen. 11. And God there ſayth of them, v. 6. <hi>that they
would be reſtrayned in nothing they imagined to doe:</hi> that is, if they were let
alone: therefore Almighty God cauſed their tumultuous action, then
begun in Pride, to end in Confuſion. In whoſe example that rebellious
ſpirit which is in every one by nature, is drawne out to the very life.
And doubtleſſe, were it not for theſe <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>cords</hi> in my Text, and
for thoſe <hi>hookes</hi> and <hi>bitts</hi> which God hath put in the jawes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
of men, they would be more unruly, more untamed, then all the
creatures of the world beſide. <hi>Man being eſtranged from the wombe, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

            <p>There is a pertinent ſtory to this purpoſe, which <hi>Valerius</hi> (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)

when he was commanded, not to goe forth <hi>the gates of that
City,</hi> that place which before was his <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> now by reaſon of that

hath armed from above, and enabled, and ſet apart, and ſent cut in his
ſervice. Or theſe which before we named are like thoſe <hi>mockers</hi> of the
true Prophets (for they want no <hi>ſlighting</hi> nor <hi>reviling</hi> tearmes for them)
thoſe mockers mentioned Jer. 23. 25. who call the people together and
tell them <hi>they have dreamed, they have dreamed</hi> when they deliver dreames
indeed. Now as <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit was ſtirred up at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo ſhould the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of all godly, honeſt, and Orthodox Miniſters and people be now
ſtirred up in England, when we doe further conſider how that all thoſe
ancient and damnable <hi>hereſies,</hi> recorded by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which
we hoped had been long ſince buried in forgetfullneſſe, are rack't up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
out of their corruption, and <hi>preached</hi> by ſome, and <hi>applauded</hi> by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and <hi>defended</hi> by more. And no marvel, for they are a people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
(to give a breife character of them that ſhall doe them no wrong)
of <hi>proud, uneven, unquiet, untractable, unpeaceable, uncharitable ſpirits</hi>
differing and diſſenting much amongſt themſelves, carried away head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
by the violence of their owne <hi>wills,</hi> which they improperly and by
miſconceiving <hi>call their conſciences,</hi> whoſe wills are very much too hard
for their underſtandings, which makes them ſo wedded to their owne
conceivings, that you may aſſoone remove Rocks from their places, as
theſe from their concluſions, and therefore nor fit to be diſputed withall;
being like <hi>mil-horſes,</hi> in the evening juſt there, where they began their
morning circuit: having <hi>two generall all replies</hi> for all objections, as if you
proove a thing plainely by Scripture, their uſuall anſwere is, that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
this or that Scripture ſo, but they conceive of it otherwiſe, or you
apprehend ſo or ſo of ſuch a queſtion in diſpute, but they think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Like <hi>Petilian the Rayler</hi> who when <hi>Auſtin</hi> had confuted him, from
the Authority of all the Ancient Fathers, anſwered, <hi>Omnes Patres ſic, ego
autem non sic</hi> if all the Fathers thinke ſo, i'le thinke otherwiſe. So that as
<hi>Lactantius wrote</hi> of ſome Idolaters in his time, that they <hi>feigned</hi> what they
pleaſed, &amp; then <hi>feared</hi> what they feigned: So theſe <hi>conceit</hi> what they like,
and then beleeve themſelves bound to juſtifie their wild <hi>conceivings,</hi>
which hath cauſed ſuch a multitude of ſtrange opinions amongſt us, that
we of this Nation are in very great likelihood to come into the <hi>proverb,</hi>
that if a man cannot find his Religion in <hi>Poland,</hi> nor <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> let him

In the ſecond place, oh the boldneſſe and liberty of the Preſſe, if wee
conſider thoſe odious Pamphlets it often <hi>ſquieſeth out.</hi> There was a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
of ancient date, but, yet in memory, which did beare the name of
<hi>Martin-mar-prelate.</hi> And we had a Pampleter of late who named that
moſt deformed iſſue of his idle and crazed braine, <hi>Martin mar-prieſt,</hi>
And we have had a <hi>Martin-mar-Prince</hi> too, as any one might lately
obſerve, who could have the patience to reade, that greateſt pretender
to wit, amongſt all our penniworths, now happily ſilenced as I hope,
who in his moſt odious, and ſcurrilous Pamplets would often force in
ſome occaſion, <hi>to trample upon Majeſtie.</hi> And we have a <hi>Martin-mar-people</hi>
to, he, I meane, whatſoever he be, who was the Author of that (I
know not what bad enough to call it) intituled by that moſt deſperate
Incendiary, the Authour, A Remonſtrance of many thouſands, which
he afterward calls, <hi>Your Sovereigne Lord the People:</hi> which damnable
and ſeditious Pamphlet alone, hath enough in it, (if God did not reſtrain
the fury and madneſſe of the multitude) to ſet the whole Kingdome on
fire. As if the ſpirit of <hi>Nero</hi> had poſſeſt the breaſts of ſome amongſt us:
encouraging them to fire the Kingdome, as he did the City of Rome,
and then to make themſelves mirth before the flames. And to theſe,
what a number have we had beſide, who in ſeverall printed papers, have
endeavoured to convey unto the people (who want a ſpirit of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
many moſt dangerous, lying, and ſeducing doctrines, to pervert
and undoe the ſimple. But Lions will teare, and Serpents will ſting, and
Dogges will barke and bite, and venemous plants will poyſon, let us
ſay what we can or pleaſe, to the contrary. But as David ſometimes
asked in the like caſe, Pſ. 120. 3. ſo will I. <hi>What ſhall be given, or what
ſhall be done unto thee, thou falſe tongue?</hi> The Prophet anſwers himſelfe in
the 64. Pſalme, that <hi>their tongues which they whet and ſharpen like ſwords,
ſhall fall upon themſelves. A fooles mouth is his deſtruction,</hi> ſaith Salomon,
Pr. 18. 7. And if any of theirs we have named, bee ſo in concluſion,
(which Repentance forbid) they may thanke themſelves. In the mean
time; Let us not marvell at any thing Lawleſſe Libertines either ſay or

equall and juſt Lawes.</p>
            <p>Therefore they will breake thoſe Bands that reſtraine them, caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thoſe cords that hamper them. They will breake them, if they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113828:12"/>
can, their will ſhall not be wanting to doe it; ſo that if they cannot
break them at once, they will unfold their linkes and twiſtings, (for ſo

ſo that, as I ſayd, if they cannot breake them at once, they will ravell
and untwiſt them, and ſo breake them by degrees. Thus violating the
civill ſanctions of man, and the equall, righteous, juſt commands of
God. The ordinances of man which contradict not the Lawes of God,
to which we are commanded to yeeld obedience; for ſo the Apoſtle
exhorts, 1. Pet. 2. 13. 14. <hi>Submit your ſelves unto every ordinance of man
for the Lords ſake, &amp;c.</hi> And the equall, righteous, juſt commands of God,
to which is required ſincere, conſtant, and univerſall obedience; <hi>I ſhall
not be aſhamed while I have respect unto all thy commandements,</hi> ſaith David,
Pſ. 119. 6. as if he had ſayd, I ſhall be aſhamed, or I ſhall come to ſhame,
if I have not.</p>
            <p>The glory of any Church or State, is Gods preſence in it; for when
God is gone, all is gone, the glory is gone, quite departed. The holy
Ordinances of God manifeſt his preſence, eſpecially where the word
and Sacraments are with all faithfulneſſe offered, and with all thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
received, ſubmitted to, and improved by the people to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
advantages. This purity of worſhip puts an inward beauty upon
the Church which <hi>is all glorious within;</hi> as adminiſtration of good Laws
by government, to keep all in ſafety and order, a luſtre and glory which
is outward upon it. Now there is nothing more manifeſts the truth of
Religion, and the excellency of a government, then the generall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
they both meet withall in the world. Theſe rebellious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
ſpirits we have named, are ſufficient to prove this, if we enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
no further. But we will adde ſomething more, where firſt let mee
remember you of a paſſage you have often heard, Act. 28. 22. where the
blinde Iewes call the true profeſſors of the doctrine of Salvation, a Sect
that were <hi>every where ſpoken againſt:</hi> An hundred falſe Religions
may live together in peace, but againſt the truth, the whole world hath
been ſtirred up, becauſe that alone beats downe the Empire of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
Many lies may concurre and agree together, but never can falſhood
agree with truth.</p>
            <p>In Rome at this day all Religions are tolerated but the true, under
the ſhadow of the Popes owne chaire. And it was wont to be an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proverbe in that City, <hi>That is muſt needs be good which Nero perſecuted;</hi>
he was ſuch a cruell bloody monſter, a very prodigie of mankinde: ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113828:12"/>
it may be more truly ſayd of thoſe moſt holy commands of God, that
they muſt needs be good, becauſe the Divell and all wicked men ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
oppoſe them; So, of Government, (for it is a very great convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to me) that the Church government reſolved on to be eſtabliſhed
in this Kingdome, and now eſtabliſhing, (and the Lord ſpeedily ſettle
it), is a good government, that hath very much of God in it: Many cleere
footſteps for it in the word of God, which other wayes now contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for have not; and is the government which God would have, which
God will ſet up and maintaine; becauſe it is ſo much ſlandered, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
reſiſted, by a number amongſt us, who would be left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
who becauſe, they have now too too long gone looſe, cannot
endure to thinke of being ſtrait laced. This I am ſure is true in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that the longer it is before a colt be backt, the more unwillingly
by farre, at the firſt, doth he endure his Rider: and the longer it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Bullocke comes to the yoake, the more hardly is he brought to it,
and the more at firſt he ſtruggles and ſtrives with it. And doubtleſſe,
the longer a people goe under reines let looſe, the harder will it be by
farre to curbe and reſtraine them. <hi>The law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>was not
made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſſe and diſobedient, for the ungodly
and ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 9. for the lawleſſe and diſobedient, ſayth the
Apoſtle, and becauſe it curbes and reſtrains them, therefore they eſteem
themſelves in bondage, or as priſoners in bonds, being required to yield
obedience unto it. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon 1</hi> This is the principall reaſon why all rebellious ſpirits think
thus, becauſe good Lawes meet, and croſſe, and contradict, and oppoſe
them in their evill wayes, in their unjuſtifiable courſes, becauſe they
meet them and reprove them, <hi>and ſet in order before them, the things that
they have done,</hi> as it is Pſ. 50. 21. In every commiſſion of evill, in every
omiſſion of good, in every, even the leaſt fayling in duty whatſoever:
they ſhake the ſecure man out of his ſeat: they diſturbe the filthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

all ſhameles proſtitutes, who ſell their ſoules with their

Apes ſometimes doe with their little-ones, they kill them with kindnes:

               </gap>, how weake they were, and
what in impotent power they ſerved, when they could neither reſene
themſelves, nor yet be delivered from the incurſions of frogs, lice, and
flies. There is a very memorable ſtory, which I dare affirme for truth,
that many yeares ſince, I brought from the Eaſterne <hi>India,</hi> where I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the Court of the Great <hi>Mogol,</hi> for more then two yeares. The
ſtory is this: There was a great Cavalier and Nobleman of that Court,
that was much in credit with that King; and that he might keepe that
favour, eſteemed it, the higheſt point of Religion to flatter the King,
which made him a great neglecter and contemner of God. Upon a
time this wretched man ſitting in dalliance with one of his women, ſhe
pluckt an hayre from his breaſt, his nipple, in wantonneſſe, I conceive
without the leaſt thought of doing him hurt; the little wound, that ſmall
and unexpected inſtrument of death made, preſently began to foſter, and
in ſhort time after, become a Cancer incurable. When the poore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113828:15"/>
wretch ſaw that he muſt needs die, he uttered theſe words, which are
very well worth the recording and remembring: Who would not have
thought, (ſayd he) but that I, who was bred a Soldier, ſhould have died
in the face of mine enemy, either by a ſword, or a lance, or an arrow,
or a bullet, or the like inſtrument of death, but now too late I am forced
to confeſſe, that there is a great God above, whoſe Majeſty I have ever
deſpiſed, who needs no bigger a Lance, then an Haire to kill an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt.</p>
            <p>Oh, let us further collect out of thoſe many menaces and threatnings
denounced againſt this ſin in the booke of God, what their end is like to
be, <hi>that obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſnes, that obey not the Goſpel
of God.</hi> And what in concluſion this ſinne is like to coſt, and when we
haue caſt up our whole reckoning, we may borrow thoſe words to put
at the foot of our accompt, which Abner ſpake to Ioab, 2. Sam. 2. 26.
<hi>bitterneſſe in the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, let the reſiſters of lawfull authority, that will not ſubmit
unto Gods deputed lawfull ſubſtitutes heere on earth, read the ſtory of
Corah and his Company, Iud. 16. <hi>ſwallowed up quicke by the earth:</hi> the earth
opening its mouth wide againſt them, that had ſo opened their mouthes
wide againſt Moſes. And let them looke over the ſtory of Zimri, 1. Kin.
16. <hi>who ſlew the King his maſter,</hi> and then ſate upon his Throne; but hee
enjoyed his ſo ill-purchaſed honour but a little while. <hi>The triumphing
of the wicked,</hi> ſayth Iob, <hi>is ſhort,</hi> Iob. 20. 5. So this wretched man found
it: for when he had reigned not ſeven yeares, nor ſeven months, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
weekes, but ſeven dayes: as in the Roman ſtory there is mention
made of one Caninius, who when after much adoe hoe had obtayned
the Conſulſhip, he then enjoyed it but ſeven howres: So when this
wicked Zimri had reigned but ſeven dayes, he ſet on fire his uſurped
Palace, and burnt himſelfe in the flame. And looke upon Abſolon, <hi>who
roſe up againſt the King his father,</hi> againſt the loynes from which he fell,
and ſee how he ſped afterward, 2. Sam. 18. And looke upon Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel
who was guilty of the ſame crime, and ſee what became of him,
2. Sam. 17. In one word, let me remember all (who caſt off ſubjection,
who doe their utmoſt endeavour to breake or throw off thoſe <hi>bands</hi>
and <hi>cords</hi> heere,) <hi>of everlaſting chaines under darkeneſſe,</hi> which will ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

off ſubjection. Let us breake their bonds aſunder, and caſt away
their cords from us.</p>
            <p>In that wicked cariage of the ſonnes of Iacob towards their brother
Ioſeph, you may cleerely ſee this truth. In the 37. of Geneſis, Ioſeph
Dreames, and tells thoſe his night-viſions unto his brethren: they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them and ſay, v. 8. <hi>Shalt thou indeed reigne over us? ſhalt thou have
dominion over us?</hi> Thou one of the yongeſt ſonnes of our father? Shalt
thou? and for this they hated him, ſayth the Text. Ioſeph went foorth
to ſeeke brethren, in the 14<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. but he found murtherers: for as ſoone
as ever they perceive him comming towards them, they ſay one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
v. 19. <hi>Behold this dreamer commeth, come now, let us ſtay him.</hi> So
ſoone as ever they ſee their brother; all their eyes, and tongues, and
hearts, and hands are againſt him, and they preſently forget themſelves,
not only to be brethren, but men; for they take their brother, and they
caſt him into an uncomfortable pit (as if they meant to bury him alive)
and then <hi>ſit downe to eat bread,</hi> v. 25. with the lamentations of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their eares, nor once remembring by their owne hunger, what
it was for their brother (as he might have done) to famiſh for want of
food. And what was the reaſon of this their moſt unnaturall, and more
then bruitiſh cariage towards their brother? you had it before, their
great feare of being afterward in ſubjection to him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Philiſtines <hi>animate, and hearten and encourage</hi> one another,
1. Sam. 4. 9. ſaying, <hi>be ſtrong and quit your ſelves like men, ô ye Philiſtins,</hi>
that ye be not ſervants unto the Hebrewes.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures are full of expreſſions to this purpoſe, ſo that if wee
needed further teſtimony for the confirming of ſo cleer a truth; I could
invite you to looke into the 83. Pſalme, from the beginning of the 2. to
the 9. verſe, where you ſhall finde a number of people of ſuch unruly
ſpirits, as this obſervation in my Text takes notice of, <hi>conſulting with, or
conſent,</hi> or with one heart, leaguing themſelves together, and <hi>making
confederacies,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Edom, and the Iſhmaelites, Moab and the Hagarens,
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, the Philiſtines, with the inhabitants
of Tyre, &amp;c. But what to doe? <hi>To take crafty counſell againſt the people
of God, to conſult againſt his hidden ones,</hi> v. 3. And who are theſe hidden
ones? Gods deare children, whom God hides and will protect. Hee
hides them as men hide Jewels, and other pretious things, keeping
them in the ſafeſt places where they may be ſecured. But, however, firſt
they conſult together againſt them, and then they ſpeake out their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113828:16"/>
thoughts, v. 4. ſaying. <hi>Come let us cut them off from being a Nation.</hi> And
certainly, there were no living for any good man in the world, if the
Divell and his curſed inſtruments, could do but halfe ſo much miſchiefe
as they would. God holds forth his people as lights to the world; theſe
wicked ones in ſtead of walking by their light, doe their uttermoſt to
extinguiſh it. God ſets them forth as examples to the world, by which
theſe men might learne to order their converſation right: But they are
ſo farre from being guided, governed, ruled by them, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deny them their being, then make them their example. <hi>Come ſay
they, let us cut them off:</hi> Eſteeming them unworthy of any place in the
world, for whoſe ſake the world was firſt made, and for whoſe ſake
it hath beene ever ſince continued; for were it not for thoſe few Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
that are intermingled with theſe many wicked on the earth, the
world could not ſtand. All wicked and ungodly men in the world ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their lives, their liberties, all the good things they doe enjoy heere,
unto theſe few, whom they ſcorne, oppoſe, and perſecute.</p>
            <p>Now what may be the reaſon why tumultuous, heady-minded mem,
doe thus combine and animate one another in a ſpirit of oppoſition, to
caſt off ſubjection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon 1.</hi> Firſt, becauſe all wicked rebellious ſpirits are led by the
ſame evill Principall, to caſt off obedience, and therfore keepe and flock
together, as beaſts of the ſame herd, or, as birds of the ſame feather do:
And they act together likewiſe, like companions in miſchiefe, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in evill. And therefore the Prophet Michah compares them to
Briars, Mich. 1. 4. and the Prophet Nahum to Thornes, Nah. 1. 10. fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and claſpt, and twiſted, and interwoven one within another, to doe
miſchiefe. Hence that monſtrouſly wicked Abimelech, who knew not
how to obey as he ought to have done: and therefore drew the bloud
of ſeventy of his Brethren to make way for his uſurped government, is
compared to a Bramble, Jud 9. 14. A right Bramble he was indeed,
who grew in the baſe hedge-row of a concubine: A Bramble that
ſcratcht and drew bloud to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon 2.</hi> Secondly, becauſe all wicked men who throw off ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are guided by the ſame ſpirit, the ſpirit of the Divell, who <hi>rules,</hi>
ſayth the Apoſtle, <hi>in the children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2. And ever ſince
the Divell and wicked men received their doome, to be chayned for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heerafter under darkneſſe; they cannot endure to think of Bands or
Cords, or any other thing beſide, that may reſtraine them.</p>

               <hi>Vſe.</hi> Now to make uſe of this; and firſt let me tell you for <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
from that which ſprings from the bitter root of ſtubborneſſe, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and refractorineſſe in this Text; this honey, this ſweet, may be
extracted. As, if it be ſo that wicked men can thus animate, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and encourage one another in the wayes of evill; every one heere
aſſembled may now prevent me &amp; ſay, that what we have hence obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

How many Separatiſts goe on violently, in an unwarrantable

of heaven, who rideth upon the Cherubims, could not overtake them.
What <hi>ſtone</hi> doe theſe leave unturned, what <hi>thing</hi> doe they leave unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted?
<hi>per mare, per terras, per ſaxa, per ignes:</hi> as Chriſt ſpake of the
Phariſees, Mat. 23. 15. <hi>Compaſſing ſea and land to make Proſelites,</hi> or ſome
of their owne profeſſion. The Idolaters at Epheſus, as if they had been
the ſonnes of Noiſe and Tumults, cry up their baggage Diana, <hi>for the

meant with their loud outcries, to hold up her honour, and to blow up
all oppoſition againſt her with her very breath.</p>
            <p>And thus the Idolatrous Preiſts of Baal cried long <hi>from morning till

will conſume them. But the morall of Micah his ſpeech is good, for the
loſſe of God is the loſſe of all things, who never forſakes us till he be firſt
forſaken by us; ſo the enjoying of a ſweet communion with God, is the
enjoyment of every good thing beſide, but this by the way. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

which they will not willingly caſt away upon their Idols, which cauſed

<hi>Daughters</hi> of their <hi>Ear-rings to make a molten Image,</hi> Exod. 32. they thinke
nothing too much, too hard to doe, to endure for them, and therefore they
did not ſticke to <hi>ſacrifice their Children unto them:</hi> what tedious pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doe ſome Papiſts trudge barefoot, and how doe they afflict their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with whippings, watchings, faſtings? And I have obſerved this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Heathens that they impoſe many ſharpe and voluntary penances
upon themſelves, far above all thoſe: the Romaniſts boaſt of as ſome of
them will put maſſy fetters of iron upon their leggs, and then as faſt as
they are able, goe hundreds of miles barefoot, upon the ground (very hot
and parching in thoſe Climes) to viſite the Sepulchers of their deluding
Saints. Others will voluntarily faſt till nature be almoſt quite decaied, &amp;
there be ſome who ſequeſter themſelves from the world, and live remote
upon the tops of Hills, the reſidue of their lives, ſometimes many yeares:
after which retirement, they never ſuffer the razor to come againe upon
their heads, and they let their nailes grow <hi>like birds claws,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he was driven from the ſociety of men,
Dan. 4. 33. and further theſe Votaries being thus retired will ſterve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then ſtirre from their Cells, and therefore they are releeved by ſome
that live neereſt to them. Thouſands there be in thoſe parts that will
rather choſe to dye like the Mother and her ſeven Sons mentioned in
the 2 Mac. and 7. Chap. then <hi>eate</hi> or <hi>drinke</hi> any thing their Law forbids
them: Such meate and drinke as their Law allowes them, they take on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſatisfie nature, not appetite; hating gluttony, and eſteeming drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
as indeed it is, a ſecond madneſſe, and therefore uſe but one
word in their language for a <hi>drunkard</hi> and a <hi>madman.</hi> The <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
what occaſion ſoever they have either by pleaſure or profit to divert
them, will pray five times every day. And the Phariſee could tell us Lu.

            </p>
            <p>Now let us put all this together, and then let us hold up our heads if
we can for bluſhing, and heare our owne ſhame, receive our juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe,

that is in wicked men, their teaching, animating, ſtirring up one
another, in whom there is <hi>unitar, contra unitatem,</hi> conſpiracy, agreement
in error, in evill; and ſo little unity, agreement amongſt us for truth.
How dare we in matters of God, ſo flag and faint, and diſſent as we doe,
<hi>ferventiſſimi in terrenis, in coeleſtibus frigidiſſimi:</hi> ſhewing nothing but
heate and earneſtneſſe in earthly, nothing leſſe? in heavenly things! Shall
Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, Phariſees, Papiſts, Turkes, Infidels, Idolaters
of all kinds, ſolicite bad cauſes with ſuch earneſtnes; and we, the cauſe of
God, ſo faintly? They were wont to ſay of cowards in Rome, that there
was nothing Roman in them; and may it not be as fitly applied unto
many of us who profeſſe our ſelves Chriſtians? There is not that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in us which may bring comfort to us; if there were, we ſhould be
more remiſſe in our owne quarrels, more fierce and forward in the cauſe

the Religion we profeſſe by profeſſing of it! What a ſad thing is it to
conſider, that a Phariſee ſhould be chaſt, and a Chriſtian filthy: That an
Heathen ſhould be temperate, ſober; and a Chriſtian drunken: That a

               </gap>anding themſelves? Is the Son of God neere
his betraying? And ſleepeſt thou, Peter? And, is there an ayming at the
head of Authority now, an endeavour by ſome to lay all even and levell?
Is there a ſtriking at Religion, in an endeavour after liberty therein?
which liberty threatens us, which liberty hath already extreamly hurt us;
<q>
                  <l>—ſaevior armis,</l>
                  <l>Libertas nocuit;—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which liberty if it be permitted, continued, will undoubtedly undoe
us: And ſhall any diſciple of Chriſt, that hath beene taught of him, bee
now ſo ſleepy, ſlothfull, ſluggiſh, as if the matter in hand concerned
him not? Let us not beleeve that any would be ever contented to die
for Chriſt, that will not ſpeake for him: that they would ever bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to affoord Chriſt their blood, who will not doe ſo much as lend
him their breath.</p>
            <p>Now for a corollary or concluſion. It was an excellent commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
that Quintilian ſometime gave of Veſpaſian the Emperour, that
he was <hi>patientiſſimus veri,</hi> moſt patient in hearing truth: Let his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
be, ours. The life of Preaching is application, and the life of
Application, is the applying of truths unto our particular ſelves. And
therefore that we may be now yet more particular, in bringing home
the truths we have heard, into our ſeverall boſomes:</p>
            <p>Firſt, do rebellious ſpirits caſt off the Yoke? aime at nothing ſo much
as deſtructive liberty? Let us be exhorted to ſubmit unto it, to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
unto all the holy, equall, righteous, juſt commands of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, and ſay with the Apoſtle, howſoever they may ſeeme croſſe
and contradictory unto us; <hi>that the Law is holy, and the commandement is
holy, and juſt, and good,</hi> Rom. 7. 12. And let us write this truth amongſt
thoſe things we would moſt remember, that Jeſus Chriſt never was, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wilbe a Saviour to any, unto whom he is not a Lord. Further, Let us
<hi>ſubmit our ſelves unto every ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake, &amp;c.</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was urged from that in the 1. Pet. 2. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, is there ſuch an unity, an agreeing, a love, a liking amongſt
many we have named to compaſſe their evill ends; Let us take up heere
in the firſt place a further ſad, and a very juſt complaint, of the diſ-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
miſ-agreement, cenſoriouſneſſe, uncharitableneſſe, raſh judging and
condemning, that ſo ſwells up the breaſts of many amongſt us, who
profeſſe themſelves Chriſtians, yet they want charity for them, for
whom Chriſt had blood; who, becauſe we cannot aſſent unto them in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:113828:18"/>
all their miſ-grounded opinions, therefore they caſt us off, away, as filthy
ragges. Oh love I thou duty and ornament of Chriſtians, thou glory
of Saints, thou delight of God, where art thou? how art thou gone?
how art thou departed from us? where ſhall we ſeeke thee? where
ſhall we finde thee? Surely in owne hearts, or elſe woe be to us.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, though difference in opinion hath ſo baniſhed love
from many amongſt us, that they cannot afford us a good word; yet we
may not deale with them as they deale with us: but learne to know,
that if love be of God, as S. John ſpeakes, 1. Jo. 4. 7. <hi>And every one that
loveth is borne of God, and knoweth God: ſo he that loves not, knoweth not God,</hi>
as it followeth in the next verſe. <hi>And if love be the fulfilling of the Law,
as the Apoſtle tels us,</hi> Ro. 13. 10. If the whole Law be abridged in that
duty of love; then the want of love muſt needs be the violating, the
breaking of all the commandements of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us learne hence, what the Prophet David exhorts us to
in a like caſe, Pſ. 109. 28. <hi>Though they curſe, yet bleſſe we.</hi> And though
they hate, yet love we. Let us love their perſons, and any thing beſide
we ſee of God that is lovely in them, whatſoever they may thinke of us,
though we may not, we muſt not, by any meanes cloſe with them in
their opinions. In all our demeanour towards them, carrying our ſelves
as Joſhua did to Achan, Joſh. 7. who retayned the affections of a Father,
while he was executing the office of a Judge.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, let us be exhorted to make much of that moſt excellent grace
of the ſpirit, Love: love to God, love to one another. Lets make much
of love: for tis love which conveyes all mercies to us. Let us lay hold
on it, as the Patriarchs did apprehend the promiſes, moſt elegantly ſet
out by the Apoſtle, Heb. 11. 13. by a Metaphor of ſaluting, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>They ſaluted them, they kiſſed them, they hug'd them, they embraced them.</hi> So
let us doe this grace, that findes ſuch little, ſuch cold entertainment
from many, from moſt. This grace of love, which God himſelfe ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
that he calls himſelfe by the name of Love, 1. Ioh. 4. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Fellow after charity,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 4. 1. The originall
word is very emphaticall: for it ſignifies to purſue, or follow a thing
eagerly; it implies in it a ſingular love to the thing we follow, which
makes us take any paines about it; to follow a thing as having it in
chaſe, the Metaphor being taken from Hunters, who will not leave
what they purſue, till they have taken it. Thus muſt we follow after
love and charity, that we may Have it, and Harbour it, and Exerciſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113828:19"/>
And laſtly, let us labour after unity, as firſt unity and agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves. Secondly, unity in the profeſſion of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
we profeſſe, as unity in doctrine, and unity in diſcipline, which
would marvellouſly unite our hearts together. <hi>There is but one Lord, one
Faith, oxe Baptiſme, one God and Father of all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Eph. 4. 5.
6. All in unity. And God is the God of order, <hi>not the Author of Confuſion,</hi>
1. Cor. 14. 33. The body of a Church or State is then ſtrongeſt, when
the multitude of believers have but one heart, and one ſoul amongſt them
all. As he that obſerves the cariage of the Primitive Chriſtians, ſhall
finde this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>one conſent, one heart, one mind,</hi>
in the 4 firſt Chapters of the Acts, often applied unto them. Which unity
in the truth of Religion, is the firmeſt band twixt man and man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the very <hi>knot</hi> and <hi>tie</hi> of all communion and conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
On the contrary, as diviſion of tongues in the eleventh of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
hindred the building up of Babel, then: ſo diviſion of hearts hinders
the ſetling and building up of the Church now. And as Plankes and
Timbers joyned together make a ſhip, but disjoyned, ſhipwracke: and
as connexion of ſtones and timber make an houſe; diſſipation, a ruine:
ſo, unity and agreement of Chriſtians build up a Church, as diſſenſion
puls it downe. And as they ſay of Bees, that when there is a ſtirre and
ſtrife amongſt them, it is a ſigne that their King is about to remove and
leave the hive; ſo ſtrife, ſchiſme, diſſenſion in Religion, to the hazard
of it, is a ſigne that God either hath, or is about to leave a people. One
of the maine ſcandals the Iewes take from the carriage of Chriſtians,
is their diſſention and diſagreeing one with another: which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
to proceed from want of unity of truth in the foundation of
Chriſtian Religion, by which they are ſtartled and ſcared from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
And ſome Papiſts have ſayd of us, (and I would there were no
truth in it) what one Preacheth in the morning, another contradicts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they, where the husband is a Calviniſt, the wife a Lutheran, the ſervant

            <p>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in the upper Germany, as Sleidan reports, framed an
imagination to themſelves, that by the will of God, the Ancient Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
muſt be quite rooted out from the earth. And ſaid (and happily
they beleeved it too) that they had ſpeech with God, who enjoyned
them to kill all the wicked in the Land, and to conſtitute a new World
conſiſting only of the innocent: What <hi>ſlaughter</hi> and <hi>havock</hi> this cauſed,
what profuſion of bloud betwixt the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Commons, Germany</hi> then

And if this hath been the fruite of ſuch dangerous deſtroying waies,
let any one be judge that hath not loſt his underſtanding, whether it be
fit, for every Subject in a Realme, (for if it be granted to ſome, it would
be in juſtice to deny it unto others) to be priviledged in his houſe; to have
a <hi>God</hi> to himſelfe, a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to himſelfe, a <hi>worſhip</hi> to himſelfe, as <hi>Micah had

            <p>But what may be done in this caſe, may ſome one ſay? The minds of

their minds, <hi>advice</hi> may doe more then threatning, and faith commeth

that a man ſhould not ſuffer for a meere default in his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but if
the fault be in his <hi>will,</hi> it alters the caſe, and without doubt a number
even now among us miſtake their <hi>will</hi> for their <hi>conſcience,</hi> which may
eaſily be done, for they lodge both in the ſame <hi>ſoule,</hi> &amp; therfore they may
be eaſily taken one for the other: Now as the rectified good will of

being the juſt cauſe of all his ſuffering, <hi>Clavis ſapientiae frequens interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>
queſtioning is the Key of knowledge, he that never askes, cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

When people are become ſuch <hi>ſcepticks,</hi> that they will queſtion every

which ſtrengthen themſelves in error or ſchiſme, &amp; diffuſe them amongſt

or to be kept in the pocket, but to <hi>let in</hi> ſome, and to <hi>lockout</hi> others

            <p>I beſeech you let me not be miſtaken, in that I have now delivered,
<hi>inſector vitia, non homines:</hi> I know it is a very great act of injuſtice, to
be angry at the offender and not at the offence, I aſſure you therefore
tis mens faults not their perſons which here ſtirres me up to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
I ſhall ever deſire to be moſt tender of thoſe in whom I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
any impreſſions of God. And I know it had been better for me that
I had never been, then that I ſhould live, <hi>to condemne the generation of the
righteous.</hi> And for my part, my witneſſes are in Heaven and in my
owne breaſt, that ſo farre as I can know my heart, I doe not wiſh
to live a minute longer, then I ſhall unfainedly deſire <hi>to honour
thoſe that truely honour God.</hi> And ever ſince it hath pleaſed God to reveale
himſelfe in any meaſure to me; I could love Religion in <hi>ruſſet,</hi> in <hi>raggs,</hi>
as well as in the gayeſt dreſſe: And ſhall labour, by Gods grace, while
I live, to give moſt <hi>reſpect,</hi> where I finde moſt <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> But when the
<hi>error</hi> of Religion turnes mens <hi>braines,</hi> and ſo makes them to <hi>fight</hi> againſt
the truth of it; I cannot chuſe but complaine: I know that <hi>Zeale</hi> is good,
excellent good, and hath its due deſerved commendation both of God
and man, and curſed be they that goes about to extinguiſh that holy fire,
that Zeale which is well grounded, well ordered; grounded upon <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and carried on with <hi>diſcretion.</hi> But I know that there is as much
difference twixt <hi>Zeale,</hi> and <hi>Zeale,</hi> as there is betwixt <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi>
and therefore to be carried on violently either by a miſ-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or a miſ-governed Zeale, may be <hi>curſus celerrimus,</hi> but <hi>praeter viam,</hi>
a ſwift violent motion, but quite out of the way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, are thoſe rebellious ſpirits we have named ſo reſolved in
their waies, that they leave no meanes un-attempted to bring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to paſſe (as before we obſerved;) O let us now labour to be as <hi>wiſe,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:113828:21"/>
as <hi>active</hi> in our generation as they can be in theirs. And Oh that we had
been ſo, Oh that we would be ſo. Twas Jehu's queſtion 2 Ki. 9. 32. <hi>who
is on my ſide who?</hi> It may be now the Lords; When the <hi>mouth</hi> of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
is opened ſo wide, when the <hi>miſts</hi> of error thicken ſo much;
and when the <hi>wings</hi> of ſchiſme ſpread ſo far over us; and there is not
that endeavour which ought to be, which might be, to <hi>diſpell</hi> thoſe miſts,
to <hi>clip</hi> thoſe wings, and to <hi>ſtop</hi> that mouth: <hi>qui non vetat peccare cum poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,
jubet,</hi> we are guilty of every ſin, which we might, and doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
If we had wrought wiſely, as we might, as we ſhould have done;
we ſhould have dealt with <hi>Schiſmes</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> while they were gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
on us, (which, becauſe we did not, have done us already ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
miſcheife) as wiſe men doe with <hi>Snakes, Vipers,</hi> venemous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they ſtay not till they have <hi>ſtung</hi> or <hi>bit</hi> them, but they cruſh and
kill them before-hand, that they may neither bite nor ſting. It is a ſad
thing to dally and foole with dangers, eſpecially thoſe which are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
till by our connivence they ſtrike through the life of our Religion.
It was therefore very good counſell which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſometimes gave
unto the <hi>Athenians</hi> that they ſhould not <hi>expect</hi> till evill came, but <hi>prevent</hi>
it: we ſhould be wary before the wound, and meet with diſeaſes that
we would not have take hold on us: Be apprehenſive before-hand of
danger, taking all <hi>evills</hi> that they may not much hurt us, at the very <hi>firſt
bound,</hi> that our <hi>providence</hi> in this caſe may prevent our too late <hi>Repentance.</hi>
Yee know how that it is much eaſier to quench a <hi>fire-brand</hi> then a great
<hi>fire;</hi> and to put out a great fire on the <hi>hearth,</hi> then that which is far leſſe
in the top of a <hi>chimney.</hi> And the Lord rouſe us up out of that <hi>ſpirit of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
into which we are fallen,</hi> that we may not be like the Smiths dog, whom
neither the hammers above him, nor the ſparkes of fire falling round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, can awake. And</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let us all reſolve to be as active for God as any other in the
world can be againſt him. They ſay in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that the foundation of
naturall life is feeling; ſo no feeling, no life; and ſo the want of ſpirituall
feeling argues a want of ſpirituall life: in which reſpect that may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
unto many, what St. Paul ſpeakes of the wanton widow mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
1 Tim. 5. 6. <hi>that they are dead while they live;</hi> being ſo un-apprehenſive,
ſo un-affected, ſo inſenſible of what may trench upon God and his cauſe.
Tis an obſervation in nature that the more quick and nimble the ſenſe
of <hi>feeling</hi> is in a man, the better is his naturall <hi>conſtitution:</hi> So our ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
our ſenſibleneſſe of Gods honour or diſhonour, above all other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113828:21"/>
things, expreſſe the goodneſſe of our ſpirituall temper. And doubtleſſe it
is now high time for <hi>all that feare the Lord, to speake often one to another
as they did</hi> Mal. 3. 16. To ſtirre up one another unto a godly jealouſie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Gods whole cauſe, his worſhip, his Church, his Children.</p>
            <p>It was a brave reſolution of <hi>Tully</hi> when he was <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
he uttered in his firſt Oration againſt <hi>Catiline, Intelliges me acrius vigilare

can be malicious for the ruine thereof.</p>
            <p>Tis an high commendation that Moſes gives to <hi>Levi</hi> Deut. 33. 9. <hi>who
ſaid of his Father, and Mother I have not ſeene them,</hi> neither did he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               </gap> is a word vſed in the 13 of Luke the 24. which hath very
much in it, for it implies thus much, that when we deale either <hi>with God,</hi> or
<hi>for God,</hi> we muſt ſtrive as <hi>wreſtlers</hi> doe for maſtery, or, as <hi>Combitants</hi> doe

pangs of death upon him: <hi>Pro aris &amp; focis</hi> was the ancient proverbe;

Leſſon taught from which ſtory is exceeding good: That we muſt <hi>firſt,

him that teſtimony, Numb. 12. 3. which made him not to regard, in not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

places, yet when God was diſhonored; he ſhewed himſelfe to be a
man of another ſpirit, in vindicating His cauſe, as you may reade at large
in the 32. of Exod. And thus our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> (of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was a
type) how moſt contemptuouſly was he vſed while he was upon earth;
as we reade in his ſtory: and, how willingly did he give his <hi>cheeke</hi> to the

reviled, he held his <hi>hands,</hi> yea and he held his <hi>tongue</hi> too, for <hi>he reviled not
