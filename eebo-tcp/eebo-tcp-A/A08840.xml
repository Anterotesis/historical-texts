         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this cause they treated mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with their neighbors named <hi>Gargarians</hi> (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayeth) with condition, that vpon certaine times of the yeare, their husbands shold assemble together in some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, and vse them for certaine dayes vntill they were with childe: which being done and knowen, they shoulde returne home againe to their owne houses. If they brought forth daughters, they norished and trained them vp in armes, and other manlyke exercises, and to ride great horsse. They taught them to run at base, &amp; to follow the chace. If they were deliuered of males, they sent them to their fathers. And if by chaunce they kept any backe, they murdred them, or else brake their armes and leggs in suche wyse as they had no power to beare weapons, and serued for nothing else but to spin, twist, and to doe other feminine labour.

Repairing towards the tent where the women were with certaine armed men, he sent word before, that he was coming to them with message from the king. But when such as stode at the tent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When <hi>Leonatus</hi> was entred the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion, the Mother and wife of <hi>Darius</hi> fell downe at his fÃ©ete, intreating him that before they were slain, he wold suffer them to burie <hi>Darius,</hi> according to the order and maner of his countrey, after the performance of which obsequies, they were content (they sayd) willingly to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death. <hi>Leonatus</hi> assured them, that both <hi>Darius</hi> was aliue, and that there was no harme towardes them, but shoulde remaine in the same state they were in before. When <hi>Sisigambis</hi> heard those wordes, she suffered hir selfe to bÃ©e lifted vp from the grounde, and to receyue some comfort. The next day, <hi>Alexander</hi> with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence buried the bodies of suche of his owne men as coulde be founde, and willed the same to be done to the noble men of the <hi>Persians,</hi> giuing licence to <hi>Darius</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to burie so many as she liste, after the custome of hir countrey.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hauing deliuered al <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; created King, kept a princely court, wherin were many magnificent facts and vertuous dÃ©edes exercised and done, and he himself most noble in all his affaires, besides the titles, which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily wanne in many bloudie battels, was estÃ©emed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the east part of the worlde, to be the most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and magnanimous prince that in any age euer raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In feastes and bankets he was an other <hi>Lucullus,</hi> royally intertaining strangers that repaired to his court. This king had in his court, a <hi>Senescall</hi> or stewarde, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> whose office was, that when the king made any pompous or publike feast, to mount vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a white Courser, with a Mace of golde in his hand, and to ride before the Esquiers &amp; Sewers for the Kings owne mouthe, and those that bare the Kings meate in vessell of golde, couered with fine naperie, wrought and purled with most beautiful workmanship of silk &amp; golde. This office of <hi>Senescall</hi> was highly estemed, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wont to be giuen to one of the chiefest Barons of the Realme. Wherfore this <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> besides that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10750:23"/>
was of moste noble Lignage and incomparable riches, was the most curteous and liberall knight that frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Court, whose immoderate expence was such, as leauing the mean, wherin al vertue consisteth, by reason of his outrage which many times he vsed, he fell into the vice of prodigalitie. Whereby he sÃ©emed not only in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dÃ©edes to compare with the King, but also conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to excÃ©ede and surpasse him. One day the King for his disport and recreation called for the Chesseborde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to kÃ©epe him companie. Which game in those days amongs the <hi>Persians</hi> was in greate vse and estimation, in such wise as a cunning gamster at that pastime was no lesse commended and honored, than among vs in these dayes an excellent Drator, or famous learned man. Yea and the very same game in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon vse in the Courte, and noble mens houses of oure tune, no doubt very commendable and mete to be practised by all states &amp; degrÃ©es. The King and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> being set down at a table in the great hall of the Palace, one right against an other, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>panied with a great number of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages and Gentlemen looking vpon them, and marking their play with great silence, they began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countre one an other with the Chessemen. <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> whether it was that he played better than the king, or whether the king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:10750:24"/>
driuen to his shiftes. The <hi>Senescall</hi> espying the Kings demeanour, and sÃ©eing the honest shamefastnesse of the King, woulde not suffer hym to receiue suche foile, but made a draught by mouing his Knight backe, to open a way for the King to passe, as not onely he deliuered him from the daunger of the Mate; but also loste one of his Rocks for lack of taking hÃ©ede: whervpon the game re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted equall. The King (who knew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good nature &amp; noble minde of his seruant, by experience of the same in other causes) faining that he had ouersÃ©ene the taking of his Rock, <q>gaue ouer the game, and rising vp, sayd: No more <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> the game is yours, and I confesse my selfe ouercome.</q> The King thought that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> did not the same so much for curtesie, as to binde his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne lorde and king by benefite to recompence his subiectes like behauior, which he did not very well like, and therfore would play no more. Notwithstanding the King neither by signe or dede, ne yet in talk, shewed any token of displeasure for that curtesie done. Nowbeit the King would that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in semblable act, should abstaine to shew him selfe curteous or liberall, except it were to his inferiours and equals, bicause it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenient for a seruaunt to contende with his maister in those qualities.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10750:24"/>
beholde, they roused a wilde beast, whiche with greate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> leapte ouer the nettes, and ranne away with much spÃ©ede. The King sÃ©eing that straunge beast, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to pursue him to death: And making a signe to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his noble men which he desired to kepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, he gaue the raine and spurre to his horse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the chace, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was one of those noble men that pursued the game. It chaunced that day that the King rode vpon a horsse, that was the swiftest in his stable, which he estemed better than a thousand other, as well for his velocitie, as for his readynesse in factes of armes. Thus followyng with bridle at will, the flying rather than running beast, they were diuided far from their companie, and by reason of the Kings spÃ©edinesse, none was able to followe him but <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and behind him one of his seruants vpon a good horsse, which alwayes he vsed in hunting inatters, which horsse was counted the best in al the Court. And thus folowing the chace with galloping spede, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> at length es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied that the horsse of his soueraigne lorde had loste his shooes before, and that the stones had surbated his hoofs, wherevpon the King was driuen either to giue ouer the chace, or else to marre his horsse. But there was none of these two necessities but would haue greatly displeased the King, that did not perceiue his horsse to be vnshodde. The <hi>Senescall</hi> did no sooner espie the same, but sodainely dismounted from his own, caused his man to deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a hammer and nailes (which for such like chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he always caried about him) and tooke of two shooes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  </gap> of his good horsse, to set vpon the Kings, not caring for his own, rather than the King should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe his pleasure. Wherfore hallowing the King which was earnestly bent vpon the chace, tolde him of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherin his horsse was for lack of shooes. The Kyng
<pb facs="tcp:10750:25"/>
hearing that, lighted from his horsse, &amp; sÃ©eing two shooes in <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> mans hande, thinking that <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> had brought them with him, or that they wer the shooes whiche fell from his owne, taried still vntill his horsse was shodde. But when he sawe the notable horsse of his <hi>Senescall</hi> vnshodde before, then he thoughte that to be the curtesie of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> &amp; so did let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter passe, studying by like meanes to requite him with Curtesie, whiche forced him selfe to surmounte in the same. And when his horsse was shod, he gaue the same to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in rewarde. And so the king chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lose his pleasure of hunting, than to suffer hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by his man to bÃ©e excelled in Curtesie, well noting the stoutnesse of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> mynde, which sÃ©emed to haue a will to contende with his Prince in factes renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and liberall. The <hi>Senescall</hi> thoughte it not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to refuse the gift of his liege Lorde, but accepted the same with like good will as before he shodde his horsse, still expecting occasion howe he might surpasse his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in curtesse, and so to binde him to requite the same. They had not taried there lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g, but many of those which came after had ouertaken them. And then the King got vp vpon a spare horsse, and returned to the citie with all his companie.</p>

But fully minded that the honor of the triumph should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Kings sonne, he welded the staffe within his rest, and when he was readie to encountre (bicause it was he that should come agaynst him) he let fall his launce out of his handes, and sayd: <q>Farewel this curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of mine, sith it is no better estemed</q>.

And to say the trouth, such was his exceding curtesie, as fewe may be founde to imitate the same. WÃ©e daily sÃ©e that many be liberall of Fortunes goodes, inuesting some with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, some with apparell, golde and siluer, Iewels, and other things of great value. We sÃ©e also noble men, bountifull to their seruants, not onely of those mouable things, but also of Castels, Landes, and Cities. What shall we speake of them, which will not sticke to sheade their owne bloud, and many times to spende their life to do their frendes good? Of these and such like examples, all Records be full. But a man that contemneth same &amp; glorie, or is of his owne bonor liberall, is neuer founde. The victorious Captain after the bloody battaile, giueth the spoile of his enimies to his souldiers, rewardeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> with prisoners, departeth vnto them the whole pray, but the glorie and honour of the battaile he reserueth vnto him selfe.

The King was displeased with these noble dÃ©edes and curtesie of his <hi>Senescall,</hi> bicause he thoughte it not mÃ©ete or decent, that a subiecte and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt should compare with his lorde and maister: and therefore did not beare him that chÃ©erefull countenance which he was wonte to doe. And in the ende, purposed

               <p>There was an ancient and approued custome in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> that the kings yerely did solemnize an Anniuersarie of their Coronation, with great feast and triumph, vpon which day all the Barons of the kingdome were bound to repaire to the Courte, where the King by the space of viii. dayes with sumptuous bankets and other sortes of feastes kepte open house.

that I neuer went about, or else did thinke in minde, to excÃ©ede or compare with your infinite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible bountie, but indeuored by all possible meanes, to let your grace perceiue, and the whole worlde to know, that there is nothing in the worlde which I regarde so much, or estÃ©eme so deare, as your good grace and fauour. And mightie <hi>Ioua</hi> graunte that I doe neuer fall into so great errour to presume for to contende with the greatnesse of your mind: which fond desire if my beastly minde should apprehend, I might be likened to the man that goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to berieue and take away the clerenesse of the Sun, or brightnesse of the splendant starres. But euer I did thinke it to be my bounden duetie not onely of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes goods which by your princely meanes I do inioy, to be a distributer and large giuer, but also bounde for the profite and aduauncement of your regal crowne and dignitie, and defence of your most noble person, of mine owne life and bloude to be both liberall and prodigall. And where your maiestie thinketh that I haue laboured to compare in curteous dÃ©ede or other liberall behauior, no dÃ©ede that euer I did, or fact, was euer enterprised by me for other respect, but for to get &amp; continue your more ample fauour, and dayly to increase your loue: for that it is the seruants part with all his force and might to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire the grace and fauor of his soueraine lord: Howbeit (most noble Prince) before this time I did neuer beleue, nor heard your grace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fesse, that magnanimitie, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and curtesie, wer vertues worthie of blame &amp; corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as your maiestie hath very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The King had a daughter of the age of. xxi. yeares, a very faire and comely Lady (according as hir royall edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and princely bringing vp required) whome as yet he had not matched in mariage, meanyng to bestowe hir vpon some King or greate Monarch, with a dowrie of ten hundred thousand Crownes, bisides the princely and great costlye apparell and Iewells, which hir owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lying vppon hir death bedde did bequeathe hir.</p>
               <p>The King then purposing to excell <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by couplyng hym with his daughter; to make hym his sonue in lawe: Which to a Ladie of royall Linage, appeareth some debacing of hir noble bloud, to bÃ©e mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a man of inferiour birth.

And so soone as he was entred the Palace, he repaired to do his reuerence vnto the king, of whome he was welcomed with glad and ioyfull entertainement. And after they had a while debated of diuers matters, the King sayde vnto him: <q>

May it please you to vnderstand (most excellent Prince) that the honor of a vertuous man doth not consist in the office, which he presently hath, but rather in the merites whiche he had before: In such wise, as it is the office that honoreth the partie, &amp; to the officer there resteth but a painful charge. By meanes wherof, when I remember that I was your gouerner from your youth, and instructed your vertuous minde in letters, I can not choose but very much reioyce, so well for your soueraigne vertue, as for your maiesties good fortune, deming it to be a great happinesse vnto me, that in my tyme <hi>Rome</hi> had hym to bÃ©e their soueraigne lorde, whome I had in times past to be my scholler.

For as he that gouerneth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>men wealth ought to lyue in feare of all men, euen so muche more in feare of him selfe: in so much as he may commit greater errour, by doing that which his owne luste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunbeth,

All thys I haue written (my Maister <hi>Plutarch</hi>) to aduertise you, that from henceforth I desire nothyng else at your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but to bÃ©e holpen with your aduise in mine affaires, and to tell me of my committed faultes.

When children lose a good father, &amp; subiects a good prince, eyther they muste dye wyth them, or else by teares they thinke to raise them vp againe, for so much as good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be in a common wealth so rare, as the <hi>Phoenix in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> My lord <hi>Nerua</hi> brought me out of <hi>Spayne</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> nourished me vp in youth, caused me to be trained in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp; adopted me for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men, but the death of a good Prince ought to be extremely mourned. For if a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon person die, there is but one dead, but if a good Prince die, together with him dieth a whole realme. I speake this (O ye Fathers) for the rare vertues abounding in mine vncle <hi>Nerua:</hi> For if the Gods were disposed to sell vs the liues of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alreadie departed, it were but a small ransome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dÃ©eme
<pb facs="tcp:10750:96"/>

                        </gap> may be sufficient to buie the life of a vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>? Truly there woulde be a great masse of money giuen by the <hi>Assyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s</hi> to redeme the life of <hi>Belus,</hi> by the <hi>Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s</hi> for <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by the <hi>Troians</hi> for <hi>Hector,</hi> by the <hi>Greekes</hi> for <hi>Alexander,</hi> by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> by the Romanes for <hi>Augustus,</hi> and by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for <hi>Annibal.</hi> But as you knowe the Gods haue made all thyngs mortall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reserued onely themselues to bÃ©e immortall. Howe eminent and passing the vertue of the good is, and what priu ledge the godly haue, it may easily bÃ©e knowne: for so much, as honour is caried euen to the very graues os the deade, but so it is not to the greate Palaces of the wicked. The good and vertuous man, without sighte or knowledge we loue, serue, and aunswer for him: where the wicked wÃ©e can not beleue that which he sayeth, and lesse accepte in good parte the thyng whiche hÃ©e doeth for vs. Touchyng the election of the Empire, it was done by <hi>Nerua,</hi> it was demaunded by the people, approued by you, and accepted by me. Wherefore I praye the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morall Goddes that it may bÃ©e lyked of their godheades. For to small purpose auayleth the election of Princes, if the Gods doe not confirme it: and therefore a man may knowe hym whiche is chosen by the Gods, or elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, for the one shall decline and fall, the other vpholden and preserned. The choyse of man sodaynely exalted doeth decline and fall, but that whiche is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Gods, although it be tossed to and fro with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall windes, &amp; receiueth great aduersitie, and boweth a little, yet he shal be neuer sene to fal. Ye know right wel (most honorable Fathers) that I neuer demaunded the Empire of <hi>Nerua</hi> my Soueraigne Lorde, although hÃ©e brought me vp and was his nephew, hauing hearde and well remembryng of my Maister <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that honour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10750:96"/>
ought rather to be deserued than procured. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I will not denie that ioyfull I was when my lorde <hi>Nerua</hi> sent me the ensigne of that greate and high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but I will also confesse that hauing begon to tast the trauailes and cares which that Imperiall state bringeth, I did repent more than a thousande times for taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the same. For Empire and gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t is of such qualitie, that although the honour bÃ©e great, yet the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour sustaineth very great paine and miserable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. O how greatly doeth he bynde himselfe, which by gouernement byndeth other? for if it be iuste, they call it cruell, if it bÃ©e pitiefull, it is contemned, if liberall, it is estÃ©emed prodigall, if he kÃ©epe or gather togyther, hÃ©e is counted couetous, if he be peaccable and quiet, they deme him for a coward, if he be coragious, he is reputed a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reller, if graue, they will say he is proude, if he be easie to be spoken to, he is thought to be light or simple, if solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they will estÃ©eme him to be an hypocrite, and if he be ioyfull, they will terme hym dissolute: In suche wise as they will be contented, and vse more better termes to all others what soeuer, than towards him, which gouerneth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mon wealth. For to suche a one they recken the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels whiche he eateth, they measure his pases, they note his wordes, they take hÃ©ede to his companies, and iudge of his workes (many tymes wrongfully,) they examine and murmure of his pastymes, and attempte to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his thoughtes. Consyder then the trauailes whiche bÃ©e in Gouernement, and the Enuie whyche many times they beare vnto him that ruleth. We may saye, that there is no state more sure than to be in that which is furthest off from Enuie. And if a man can not but with greate paine gouerne the wife which he hath chosen, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>ãâã</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:10750:97"/>
in one house: how is it possible that he can still conserue in peace a whole common wealth? I pray you tell me, in whom shall a poore Prince repose his trust? sith that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he is most slaundered by them whome he fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth best? Princes and great lords can not eate without a garde, can not slÃ©epe without a watche, can not speake without espiall, nor walke without some safetie, in suche wise as they beyng lordes of all, they bÃ©e as it were, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of their owne people. And if we will beholde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearely, and consider the seruitude of Princes, and the libertie of subiects, we shall finde that he whiche hath most to doe in the realme, or beareth greatest swinge, is most subiect to thraldom: In somuch as if Princes haue authoritie to giue libertie, they haue no meanes to be frÃ©e them selues. The Gods haue created vs so frÃ©e, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man desireth to haue his libertie so much at will, that a man be he neuer so familiar a friend, or so neare of kin, we had rather haue him to be our subiect, than our lorde and maister. One man alone commaundeth all, and yet it semeth to him but little. Ought we then to maruell, if many be wearie to obey one? We loue and estÃ©eme our selues so much, as I neuer sawe any which of his owne good will woulde be subiect, ne yet against his will was made a lorde, which we sÃ©e to bÃ©e very true. For the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells and warres that bÃ©e amongs men, are not so much for obedience sake, as to rule and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunde. I say more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that in drinking, eating, clothing, speaking, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, al men be of diuers qualities: but to procure liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they bÃ©e all conformable. I haue spoken all this (O Fathers conscript) vpon occasion of mine owne Empire, which I haue taken with good will, albeit afterwardes I was sorie for that great charge. For the waltering seas and troublesome gouernement be two things agrÃ©eable to beholde, and daungerous to proue. Notwithstanding

Ther is nothing (answered <hi>Lamia</hi>) wherwith a woman is more grieued, and maketh hir more sad, than to be called yll fauored, or that she hath no good grace, or to vnderstand that she is dissolute of life. This ladie Lamia, was of iudgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and subtill, although yll ymployed in hir: &amp; therby made all the world in loue with hir: and drew all men to hir through hir faire spÃ©ech. Now before she lost the heart of king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> she haunted of long time the Uniuersities of <hi>Athenes,</hi> where she gained great store of money, and brought to destruction many yong men. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Demetrius</hi> saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> hauing presented vnto him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When the king <hi>Demetrius</hi> would assure any thing by oth, he swore not by his Gods, ne yet by his predecessors, but in this sort: As I may be still in the grace of my lady <hi>Lamia,</hi> and as hir life &amp; mine may ende together, so true is this which I say &amp; doe, in this &amp; this sort. One yere &amp; two monethes before the death of king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> his frend <hi>Lamia</hi> died, who sorowed so much hir death, as for the absence &amp; death of hir, he caused the Philosophers of <hi>Athenes</hi> to entre disputation: Whether the teares and sorow, which he shed and and toke, were more to be este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than the riches which he spent in hir obsequies &amp; funerall pompes.

Upon a day a yong man of <hi>Corinth</hi> demaunding of hir, what hÃ©e should say to a woman whome hÃ©e long tyme had loued, and made so great sute, that therby he was like to fall into dispaire. Thou shalt say (sayd <hi>Lais</hi>) vnto hir, that sith she will not graunt thy request, yet at least wise it might please hir to suffer thÃ©e to bÃ©e hir seruant, and that she would take in good parte the seruice that thou shalt doe vnto hir. Which request if she doe graunt, then hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the ende of thy attempt, bycause that we women bÃ©e of such nature, as opening the mouth to gyue some myld and pleasant answere to the amorous person, it is to bÃ©e thought that we haue gyuen our heart vnto the firste suter. An other daye in the presence of <hi>Lais,</hi> one praised the Philosophers of <hi>Athenes,</hi> saying that they were very honest personages, and of greate skyll and knowledge.

This amorous <hi>Flora</hi> wold neuer abandon hir person, but wyth gentlemen of great house, or of great dignitie and riches. For she was wont to say, that a woman of passing beauty should bÃ©e so much estemed as she doth esteme and sette by hir selfe. <hi>Lais</hi> and <hi>Flora</hi> were of contrary maners &amp; conditions. For <hi>Lais</hi> would first bÃ©e paide, before she yelded the vse of hir bodie: but <hi>Flora</hi> without any semblance of desire eyther of golde or siluer was contented to bÃ©e ruled by those with whom she committed the facte. Wherof vpon a day being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the question, she answered: I gyue my body
<pb facs="tcp:10750:108"/>
to Princes and noble Barons, that they may deale with me like gentlemen. For I sweare vnto you by the Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi> that neuer man gaue me so little, but that I had more than I loked for, and the double of that which I could demaund. This amorous lady <hi>Flora</hi> was wont many tymes to saye, that a wise woman (or more aptlie to terme hir a subtill wench) ought not to demaund reward of hir louer for the acceptable pleasure which she doth hym, but rather for the loue which she beareth him, bicause that all things in the world haue a certain price, except loue, which cannot bÃ©e paide or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced but with loue. All the Ambassadors of the worlde, which had accesse into <hi>Italie,</hi> made so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the beauty and generositie of <hi>Flora,</hi> as they dyd of the Romane common wealth, bycause it semed to bÃ©e a monstrous thinge to sÃ©e the riches of hir house, hir trayue, hir beautie, the princes &amp; great lordes by whom she was required, and the presents and giftes that were gyuen vnto hir. This amorous <hi>Flora</hi> had a continuall regard to the noble house wherof she came, touching the magnificence and state of hir seruice. For albeit that she was but a common woman, yet she was serued &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a great ladie. That day wherin she rode about the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> she gaue occasion to bÃ©e spoken of a whole month after, one inquiring of an other what gret Roman lords they were that kept hir company: Whose men they were that waighted vpon hir: And whose liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ware? What ladies they were that rode in hir traine: the brauery of hir apparell: hir great beautie &amp; port, and the wordes spoken by the amorous gentlemen in that troupe were not vnremembred.

&amp; peace thorowout <hi>Europa.</hi> Now after the death of this good Emperour <hi>Odenatus,</hi> the Armies chose one of his two sonnes to be Emperour of the <hi>Orient:</hi> But for that hÃ©e was yong, they chose <hi>Zenobia</hi> to bÃ©e Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of hir sonne, and gouerner ouer the said <hi>Orient</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Who sÃ©eing that vpon the decease of <hi>Odenatus</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the East Cuntries began to reuolt, she determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to open hir Treasure, reassemble hir men of warre, and in hir owne person to march into the fielde: where she did such notable enterprises, as shÃ©e appalled hir eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and made the whole worlde to wonder. About the age of. xxxv. yeares <hi>Zenobia</hi> was widow, being the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> of hir children, Regent of an Empire, and Captain general of the armie. In which weighty charge she vsed hir selfe so wiselie and well, as she acquired no lesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name in <hi>Asia,</hi> than QuÃ©ene Semiramis did in <hi>India. Zenobia</hi> was constant in that which she toke in hande, true in wordes, liberall, myide, &amp; seuere where she ought to be, discrete, graue, and secrete in hir enterprises, albeit she was ambicious. For, not content with hir title of Gouernesse or Regent, she wrote and caused hir selfe to bÃ©e called Empresse, she loued not to ride vpon a Mule, or in a littor, but greatlie estemed to haue greate horse in hir stable, and to learne to handle and ryde them. When <hi>Zenobia</hi> went forth of hir Tent to sÃ©e the order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of hir Campe, she continually did put on hir Armure, and was well guarded with a bande of men, so that of a woman, she cared but onely for the name, and in the facts of Armes she craued the title of valiant. The Captains of hir Armie, neuer gaue battell, or made as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, they neuer skyrmished or did other enterprise of warre, but she was present in hir owne person, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to shewe hir selfe more hardie than any of all

the troupe, a thing almost incredible in that weake and feble kynde. The sayde noble QuÃ©ene was of stature, bigge and well proporcioned, hir eyes black and quicke, hir forehedde large, hir stomake and breastes fayre &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, hir face white and ruddy, a litle mouth, hir tÃ©eth so white, as they semed like a rancke of white pearles, but aboue all things she was of such excellent spirit and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as she was feared for hir stoutnesse, &amp; beloued for hir beautie. And although <hi>Zenobia</hi> was indued with so great beautie, liberalitie, riches, &amp; puissance, yet she was neuer stayned with the blemishe of vnchaste life, or with other banitie: and as hir husband <hi>Odenatus</hi> was wont to say, that after she felt hir selfe with childe, she neuer suffred him to come nere hir, (such was hir great chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) saying that women ought to marie rather for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than for pleasure. She was also excellently well learned in the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> tong. She did neuer eate but one meale a day. Hir talke was verie litle and rare. The meate which she vsed for hir repaste, was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hanch of a wilde Bore, or else the syde of a dÃ©ere. She could drinke no wine, nor abyde the scent thereof. But she was so curious in good and perfect waters, as she would gyue so great a price for that, as is ordinarilie gyuen for wyne: bÃ©e it neuer so excellent. So sone as the Kings of <hi>Egipte</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Greekes,</hi> were aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of the death of Odenatus, they sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Zenobia,</hi> as well to visite and comforte hir, as to bÃ©e hir confederats and frendes.

The king perceuing that loue, told his daughter, that she had placed hir mynde in place so straunge, as hÃ©e had thought hir wisdome wold haue more warely forsÃ©en, and better wayed hir estate &amp; birth, as come of a princely race, and would haue demed such loue, farre vnworthie hir degrÃ©e: requiring hir with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly words, to withdraw hir settled mynde &amp; to ioyne with him in choise of husbande, for that he had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worldly heire but hir, and tolde hir howe he meant highly to bestowe hir vpon such a personage, as a moste happie life she should leade, so long as the destenies were disposed to weaue the webbe of hir predestined life: And therefore was resolued to espouse hir vnto that noble Gentleman <hi>Philon.

preparation to depart out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in the sayd iorney. Reporte was made by a Knight whiche knewe the sayd Marquize, that in all the worlde there was not the like maried couple, as the Marquize and his wyfe were, as well bicause the Marquize had the fame to bÃ©e an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gentleman, as also for that his wyfe amonges all the troupe of Ladies, that liued in the world that time, was the fairest and most vertuous: which words so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the French Kings head, as sodainely (neuer sÃ©eing hir in all his life) he began to loue hir.

And as he had deuised, he began his enterprise: who sending al his power before, toke his iorney with a meane train of Gentlemen: and being within a days iourney of the Ladies house, he sente hir worde that the next daye hÃ©e would visite hir at dinner.

And so much the more his desire was kindled, as she passed the estimation bruted of hir. And after that the King had withdrawen him selfe into the chamber ordeined and made ready for him, as appertained to a Prince so greate, &amp; that dinner time was come, the Kyng &amp; Madame the Marchionisse sat together at one boorde, and other according to their degrÃ©es were placed at seueral tables. The King serued with many dishes and excellent wines, beholding some times the ladie Marchionisse, conceiued greate delight and pleasure.

Then they entred into a faire chamber, and sitting downe before a great fire, he sayd vnto hir these words: Madame, I humbly besÃ©eche you, if the loue whiche I haue borne you of longtime, and yet do beare, deserue some recompence, that it please you to tel me vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cause whiche hath made you to come hither thus

Thou art come hyther with desire to haue my life, wherefore sÃ©eing that thou diddest craue it, I forthwith did meane to giue it, that thou alone mightest not be the man that shoulde departe from hence wythout atchieuing thy request: and to bring to passe that thou myghtest haue the same, I gaue thÃ©e the best Counsell I coulde, aswell for bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of my life, as for enioying of thine owne.

And they sate not long after that the table was taken away, but master <hi>Thorello</hi> supposing them to be weary, caused them to be lodged in gorgeous &amp; costly beds: and he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise within a while after went to bed.

The Gentlewoman which bitterly wept, answered: I know not deare husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d how I shal be able to beare the sorow wherein you leaue me, if you goe away. But if my life be more strong and sharpe, than sorow it self: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you liue or die, or what so euer come of you, I will liue and die the wife of master <hi>Thorello,</hi> and the onely spouse of his remembrance. Whereunto master <hi>Thorel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> sayd: SwÃ©ete wife, I am more than assured that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching your selfe, it will proue as you doe promise. But you be a yong woman, faire, and well allied, and your vertue is great and wel knowne throughout the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: by reason wherof I doubt not, but that many great personages &amp; Gentlemen (if any suspition be conceiued of my death) wyll make requestes to your brethren and kinred, from whose pursute (although you be not dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,) you can not defend your selfe, and it behoueth that of force, you please their will, which is the onely reason that moueth me to demaund that terme, and no longer time. The Gentlewoman sayd: I will doe what I can for fulfilling of my promise. And albeit in end that I shal be constrained to doe otherwise, be assured that I will obey you in the charge which now you haue giuen me: I humbly thanke almightye God, for that he neuer brought vs into these termes before this tyme. Their

talke ended, the Gentlewoman wÃ©eping, embraced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Thorello,</hi> and drawing a ring from hir finger, she gaue it him, saying: If it chaunce that I die before I sÃ©e you, remember me when you shall beholde the same.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He receiuing the ring, got vp vpon his horsse, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue, went on his voyage, and arriued at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoua,</hi> he shipped him selfe in a Galley, and toke his way, whereunto winde and weather so fauoured, as within fewe dayes he landed at <hi>Acres,</hi> and ioyned with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of the Christians: wherein began a great morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and Plague, during which infection (what so euer was the cause) eyther by the industrie or fortune of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine,</hi> the rest of the Christians that escaped were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most taken and surprised by hym, without any fighte or blowe stricken. All which were imprysoned in many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deuided into diuers places, amongs which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners master <hi>Thorello</hi> was one, who was caried priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Alexandria</hi> where being not knowne, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be knowne, forced of necessitie, gaue himselfe to the kÃ©eping of Hawkes, a qualitie wherein he had very good skill, whereby in the end he grewe to the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the <hi>Souldan,</hi> who for that occasion (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that time) tooke him out of prison, and retained him for his Fawconer.

<pb facs="tcp:10750:149"/>
Which was the effect of his letter: very earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring one of the ambassadoures of his acquaintance to doe so much for him as safely to deliuer those letters to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hands of the Abbot of <hi>S.

his wife was maried againe, for sorow wherof he fel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such melancholy, as he had no lust to eate or drinke, and laying him downe vpon his bed, determined to die: which so soone as <hi>Saladine,</hi> (who greatly loued him) did vnderstand, he came to visite him, and after that he had (through instant request) known the occasion of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse and disease, he blamed him very muche for that he did no sooner disclose vnto him his conceipt. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prayed him to be of good chÃ©ere, assuring him if he would, so to prouide, as he should be at <hi>Pauie,</hi> iust at the terme which he had assigned to his wife: and declared vnto him the order how. Master <hi>Thorello</hi> geuing credit to the woords of <hi>Saladine,</hi> and hauing many times heard say, that it was possible, and that the like had bene many times done, began to comfort him selfe, and to vse the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

Whereunto the Necromancer answered, that it should be done, but that it behoued for the better doing thereof, that he should be cast into a slÃ©epe. And when <hi>Saladine</hi> had giuen order therunto, he returned to master <hi>Thorello,</hi> and finding him fully purposed to be at <hi>Pauie</hi> if it were possible at the terme which he had assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; or if not, to die: sayd thus vnto him.</p>

And when the Abbot and the Monkes saw that he made suche hast away, they were abashed, and asked the cause why he ran so fast? The Sexten tolde them the matter.

               <p>Master <hi>Thorello</hi> opened his eyes, and plainely knew by looking round about him, that he was in the place where he demaunded to be of <hi>Saladine</hi> whereof he was very gladde, and rising vp, and viewing particularlye, what he had about him, albeit he knew before the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of <hi>Saladine,</hi> now he thought it greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstoode the same, than before.

For he was master <hi>Thorello</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uewe. The Abbot hearing that, was dryuen into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feare, bicause hÃ©e was accompted to be deade dyuerse moneths before: but afterwards by diuerse arguments, assured that he was master <hi>Thorello,</hi> and so often called by hys name (making a signe of the Crosse) he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

For the mariage, and all the preparation necessary for the feast, is ready.</q> Master <hi>Thorello</hi> rising out of the rich bed, and reioysing with the Abbot &amp; all his Monks, prayed euery of them not to speake one word of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home, vntill he had done what he was disposed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards placing all his rich Iewels in suretie and sauegard, he discoursed vnto his vncle what had chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto him, till that time. The Abbot ioyful for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, gaue thankes to God. Then master <hi>Thorello</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded of his vncle, what he was that was betrouthed to hys wife. The Abbot tolde him. To whome master <hi>Thorello</hi> sayd: <q>Before my returne be knowne, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to sÃ©e what countenance my wife wil make at the mariage. And therefore, albeit that the religious doe not vse to repaire to such feasses, yet I pray you for my sake take paine to goe thither.</q> The Abbot answered that he wold willingly doe so. And so soone as it was day, he sent woord to the bridegrome, that he, and a frend of his, wold be at the mariage: wherunto the gentleman answered that he was very glad thereof. When dinner time was come, master <hi>Thorello</hi> in the habite and apparel wherin he was, went with the Lord Abbot to the wedding din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where euery of them that saw him, did maruellously beholde him, but no man knew him, bicause the Abbot answered them that inquired, that he was a Sarazene, sent Ambassador from the Souldan to the French king. Master <hi>Thorello</hi> was then placed at a table which was right ouer against his wife, whome he beheld with great

pleasure and delight, and perceiued very wel by hir face that she was not well content with that mariage. She likewise beheld him sometimes, not for any knowledge she had of him, for his great beard and straunge attire: the firme credite and generall opinion also that he was dead, chiefly hindred that. But when master <hi>Thorello</hi> thought time to proue whether she had any remembrance of him, be secretely conueyed into his hand, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ring which she gaue him at his departure, and called a litle boy that wayted vpon hir, and sayd vnto him: <q>Goe tell the bride in my behalfe, that the custome of my countrey is, that when any Straunger (as I am here) is hydden by any newe maried woman (as she is now,) for a token of his welcome, she sendeth vnto him the cup wherein she drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth full of wine, wherof after the stranger hath dronke what pleaseth him, he couereth the cup againe, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the same to the bryde, who drinketh the rest that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</q> The page did his message vnto the bride, who like a wise Gentlewoman well brought vp, thinking he had ben some great personage, to declare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, commaunded a standing cup all gilt, standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hir, to be washed cleane, &amp; to be filled full of wine, &amp; caried to the Gentleman, which accordingly was done.

And for that the manner of his countrey might bÃ©e accomplished, when the cup was deliuered vnto hir, she vncouered the same, &amp; pledging the rest of the wine, beheld the ring, &amp; without speaking any woord, well viewed the same, and knowing that it was the very ring which she had giuen to master <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rello,</hi>

This yong Gentleman very much frequenting the Church, and sÃ©eing the beautie of QuÃ©ene Anne to excell all the reast of the Ladies, adorned and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Princely behauioure and QuÃ©ene like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, not foresÃ©eing (when he beheld hir) the nature of loue which once being possessed, neuer leaueth the pacient till it hath infebled his state, like the qualitie of poyson, distilling through the vaines, euen to the heart.

I thought moreouer it to be very vnsÃ©emely for me to direct my minde vpon a wight so honorable, and of so great estate. But who can raine the bridle, or prescribe lawes to loue? What is he that in loue hath frÃ©e will and choyse? Truely I beleue no man, bicause loue the more it doth sÃ©eme to accord in pleasure and delight, the further from the marke he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his bolte, hauing no respect to degrÃ©e or state. Haue not many excellent and worthy personages, yea Dukes, Emperours and Kings, bene inflamed wyth the loue of Ladies, and women of base and vile degrÃ©e? Haue not most honorable dames, and women of greatest renoume despised the honor of their states, abandoned the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds, and neglected the loue of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the ardent loue that they haue borne to men of inferiour sort? All Histories be full of examples of that purpose. The memories of our auncestors be yet in fresh remembraunce, whereof if they were ignorant vnto you that be of great experience, I could adnouche assured te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. Yet thus much I say vnto you, that it sÃ©eme no new thing for a man to be ouercome by his owne affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is not the Nobilitie of hir state, or for that she is a QuÃ©ene, it is not the consideration of one parte or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that moued me first hereunto. But loue it is, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10750:159"/>
is of greater force than we our selues be of, which many tymes maketh that to sÃ©eme lawfull, which altogether is tymes, and by subduing reason maketh the great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate and lorde tributarie to his wil &amp; pleasure, whose force is farre greater than the lawes of Nature.

Yea and if it were not for feare of eternall damnation, and the losse of my poore afflicted soule (which God forbid) mine owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before this time had ended my desires. I am therfore determined (sith that I can attaine to no successe of loue, and that god doth suffer me to be inspired with that most honourable and curteous Ladie, beyond al order and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) to content my selfe with the sight of those hir faire &amp; glistring eyes, farre excelling y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sparcling glimpse of the Diamonde or Saphire, and to serue loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hir, so long as life doth last within this fÃ©eble corps.

And therfore swelling wyth despite, &amp; rapt with furie to sÃ©e themselues so defamed by one of their bloud, they purposed by all meanes whatsoeuer it cost them, to know the lucky louer that had so wel tilled the Duchesse their sisters field. Thus desirous to remoue that shame from before their eyes, and to be reuenged of a wrong so notable, they sent espial round about, and scoutes to <hi>Naples,</hi> to view and spy the behauior &amp; talk of the Duchesse, to settle some certaine iudgement of him, whych stealingly was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their brother in law.

Yea, &amp; although <hi>Bologna</hi> was a wise and prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t personage,
<pb facs="tcp:10750:197"/>
fearing to be surprised vpon the fact, or that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the Chamber corrupted with Money, or forced by feare, shold pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce any matter to his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance or disauantage, determined to absent himself from <hi>Naples,</hi> yet not so sodainly but that hee made the Duchesse his faithfull Ladie &amp; companion priuie of his intent.

You sÃ©e the solempne watch and garde which the seruaunts of the Lords your brothers do within your house, &amp; the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion which they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceiued by reason of your seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d childbed, &amp; by what meanes they labor truely to know how your affaires procÃ©ede, and things do passe.

for a time, for I am assured that when I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they will neuer soile their hands, or imbrue their, sweards in your bloud.

               <p>This good Ladie hearing hir husbands discourse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what to doe, wept bitterly, as wel for grief to lose his presence, as for that she felt hir self with child the third time. The sighes and teares, the sobbes and heauie lookes, which she threwe forth vpon hir sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husband, gaue sufficient witnesse of hir paine and grief. And if none had heard hir, I thinke hir playntes woulde haue well expressed hir inwarde smarte of minde. But like a wise Ladie, sÃ©eing the alleaged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of hir husband, licensed him, although against hir minde, not without vtterance of these few words, before hÃ©e went out of hir Chamber: <q>Deare husband, if I were so well assured of the affection of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as I am of my maides fidelitie, I would entreat

you not to leaue me alone: specially in the case I am, being with childe. But knowing that to be iust &amp; true which you haue sayd, I am content to force my wil for a certaine time, that hereafter we may liue at rest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ioyning our selues in the companie of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and familie, voide of those troubles, which great Courts ordinarily beare within the compasse of their Palaces. Of one thing I must intreat you, that so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> as you can by trustie messenger, you send me woord &amp; intelligence of your health and state, bicause the same shal bryng vnto me greater pleasure &amp; contentation, than the welfare of mine owne: and bicause also, vpon such occurrentes as shall chaunce, I may prouyde for mine owne affaires, the suretie of my self, and of our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.</q> In saying so, she embraced him very amorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he kissed hir wyth so great sorrow and grief of heart, as the soule thought in that extasie out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take hir flight, sorowful beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d mesure so to leue hir whome he loued, for the great curtesies and honor which he had receiued at hir hands. In the end, fearing that the <hi>Aragon</hi> espials wold come and perceiue them in those priuities, <hi>Bologna</hi> tooke his leaue, and bad hys Ladie and spouse Farewell.</p>
               <p>And thus was the second Acte of this Tragicall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, to sÃ©e a fugitife husband secretely to mary, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hir, vpon whom he ought not so much as to loke but with feare and reuerence. Beholde here (O ye foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish louers) a Glasse of your lightnesse, and ye women, the course of your fonde behauior. It behoueth not the wise sodainly to execute their first motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>s and desires of their heart, for so much as they may be assured that pleasure is pursued so neare with a repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce so sharp to be suffred, and hard to be digested, as their voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ausnesse shall vtterly discontent them. True it is, that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10750:198"/>
mariages be done in Heauen, and performed in earth, but that saying may not be applied to fooles, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themselues by carnall desires, whose scope is but pleasure, &amp; the reward many times equal to their follie. Shall I be of opinion that a housholde seruaunt ought to sollicite, nay rather suborne the daughter of his Lord without punishment, or that a vile and abiect person dare to mount vpon a Princes bed? No no, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie requireth order in all, and eche wight ought to be matched according to their qualitie, without making a pastime of it to couer our follies, &amp; know not of what force loue and desteny be, except the same be resisted. A goodly thing it is to loue, but where reason loseth his place, loue is without his effect, and the sequele rage &amp; madnesse. Leaue we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> discourse of those which beleue that they be constrained to folowe the force of their minde, and may easily subdue themselues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of vertue and honesty, like one that thrusteth his head into a sack, and thinks he can not get out, such people do please themselues in their losse, and think all well that is noisom to their health, daily folowing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

This Ladie sÃ©eing hir Louer noussed in hir lust, dandled him with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande trumperies, and made hym holde the Mule,

               <p>Whiles this Loue continued in all pleasure and like contentation of either parts: Fortune that was ready to mounte the stage, and shew in sight that hir mobilitie was no more stable than a womans will: (For vnder such habite and sere Painters and Poets describe hir) made <hi>Ardizzino</hi> suspecte what desire she had of chaunge: and within a while after, sawe himself so farre misliked of his Ladie, as though he had neuer bene acquainted. The cause of that recoile was, for that the Countesse was not contented with one kinde of fare, and whose eyes were more gredie than hir stomake able to digest, and aboue all desired chaunge, not sÃ©eking meanes to finde him that was worthy to be beloued and intertained of so great a Ladie, as she estÃ©emed hir selfe to be, and as such women of their owne opinion thinke themselues, who counterfaicte more grauitie and reputation than they doe, whome nature and vertue for their maiestie and holinesse of life make Noble and praise worthie. That desire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued hir nothing at all: for a certaine time after that <hi>Ardizzino</hi> possessed the forte of this faire Countesse, there came to <hi>Pauia,</hi> one <hi>Roberto Sanseuerino</hi> Earle of <hi>Gaiazzo,</hi> a yong faire and valiant Gentleman, whose Countrey lieth on this side the Mountaines, and very familiar with the Earle of <hi>Massino.</hi>

And bicause almost euery day semblable examples be sÃ©ene, I will leaue of this discourse, to take mÃ©e to a matter, not farre more pleasant than this, although founded vpon better grounde, and stablished vpon loue, the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set of lawfull mariage, the successe wherof, chaunced to murderous end, and yet the same intended by ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the beloued: As you shall be iudge by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of reding of the historie ensuing. Beare with me good Ladies (for of you alone I craue this pardon) for introducing the whoorish life of this Countesse, and hir bloodie enterprise: bicause I know right well, that recitall of murders and bloodie facts werieth the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of those that loue to liue at rest, and wish for faire weather after the troublesome stormes of ragyng seas, no lesse than the pilote and wise Mariner, hauing long time endured and cut the perillous straicts of the Ocean sea. And albeit the corruption of our nature be so great, as folies delite vs more than ernest matters full of reason and wisedome, yet I thinke not that our mindes be so peruerted and diuided from frouthe, but sometimes we care and sÃ©eke to speake more grauely than the countrey Hynde, or more sobrely than they, whose liues do beare the marke of infamie, and be to euery wight notorious for the only name of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

               <p>In the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> (whiche for riches and faire women excelleth al other within the region of <hi>Italie</hi>) in the time that <hi>Francesco Foscari,</hi> a very wise Prince, did gouerne the state, there were two yong gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, the one called <hi>Girolamo Bembo,</hi> and the other <hi>Anselmo Barbadico,</hi> betwene whome as many times chaunceth amongs other, grew such great hatred and cruel hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as eche of them by secrete and al possible means deuised to do other shame and displeasure, which kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to such out rage, as it was thought impossible to be pacified.

But before he went, sÃ©eing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Torches were but short, and could not last past. ij. or. iij. houres, he lighted two other, and set them in the others place, for that it shoulde sÃ©eme to his friends, if any chaunced to come, what care and worship he bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> him.

There are before vs two complaints, the effect whereof in my iudgement is not throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ceiued in the opinions of diuers. <hi>Anselmo Barbadico</hi> and <hi>Girolamo Bembo,</hi> betwene whome there hath bene euer continuall hatred, left vnto them as a man may say euen by fathers enheritance, both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in either of their chambers, were apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner naked by our Sergeants, and without torments, or for feare to be racked vpon the onely interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our ministers, they haue voluntarily confessed that before their houses they killed <hi>Aloisio</hi> our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew. And albeit that our sayd Nephew yet liueth, &amp; was not striken by them or any other as shold apeare, yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:10750:273"/>
What shall be sayd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to the matter, doth it not sÃ©eme doubtfull? Our Nephew againe hath declared, that in going about to robbe the house of Mistresse <hi>Gismonda Mora,</hi> whome he ment to haue slaine, he fell downe to the ground from the toppe of a window, wherefore by reason so many robberies haue bene discouered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie, it may be presumed that he was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Moreouer when he was founde lying vpon the ground, he had neither ladder nor weapon, whereupon may be thought that the fact was otherwise done, than hitherto is confessed. And bicause amongs morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce is the chiefest and worthy of greatest commendation, and that iustice not righteously exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is iniustice &amp; wrong, it is mÃ©ete and conuenient for vs in these strange accidents, rather to vse tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce than the rigor of iustice. And that it may appere that I do not speake these words without good ground, mark what I shal say vnto you. These two most mortal eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fesse that which is impossible to be true, for that our Nephew (as is before declared) is a liue, and his wounde was not made by sworde, as hÃ©e himself hath confessed. Nowe who can tell or say the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that shame for being taken in their seuerall Chambers, and the dishonesty of bothe their wiues, hathe caused them to despise life, and to desire death? We shall finde if the matter be diligently inquired and searched, that it will fall out otherwise than is already supposed by common opinion. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of examinations, vnlikelihoode of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and the impossibility of the cause, rendreth the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10750:273"/>
matter doubtful. Wherfore it is very nÃ©edful dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine these attempts, and thereof to vse more aduised consideration. On the other side, our Nephew accuseth himself to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and which is more, that he ment to kill mistresse <hi>Mora</hi> when he brake into hir house. Under this grasse my Lords as I suppose, some other Serpent lieth hidden, that is not yet thought of. The Gentleman ye know before this time was neuer defamed of such outrage, ne suspected of the least offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>se that may be obiected. Besides that, all ye doe knowe, (thanks therefore be giuen to almightie God) that he is a man of great richesse and possessions, and hath no nÃ©ede to robbe. For what necessitie should driue him to robbe a widowe, that hath of his owne liberally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon the succour of widowes? Were there none else of substance in the Citie for him to giue attempt, but to a widowe a comfortlesse creature, contented with quiet life to liue amongs hir family within the boundes of hir owne house? What if hir richesse, Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and plate be great, hath not Aloisio of his owne to redouble the same? But truely this Robberie was done after some other manner than he hath confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. To vs then my Lords it appertaineth, if it so stande with your pleasures, to make further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie of the same, promising vnto you vppon oure Faith, that we shal imploy our whole diligence in the true examination of this matter, and hope to bring the same to such good ende, as none shall haue cause to blame vs, the finall sentence whereof shall be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to your iudgement.</q> This graue request and wise talke of the Duke pleased greatly the Lords of the Councel, who referred not only the examination, but also the finall sentence vnto him.</p>

               <p>Wherupon the wise Prince being fully enformed of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chaunce happened to his Nephewe, attended only to make search, if he could vnderstand the occasion why <hi>Bembo</hi> and <hi>Barbadico</hi> so folishly had accused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>selues of that which they neuer did.

and comfort. And when the day of execution came they did their friends and parents to vnderstand that their conceiued opinion was vntrue, &amp; prayed them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare their disdaine and malice, till the truth should be throughly manifested, assuring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end their owne innocencie and the guiltlesse crime of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands should openly be reuealed to the worlde. In the meane time they made request vnto their friends, that one of the Lordes called <hi>Auogadori</hi> might be admitted to vnderstand their case, the rest to be referred to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, wherein they had no nÃ©ede either of Proctor or Aduocate. This request sÃ©emed very straunge to their friends, dÃ©eming their case to be shameful and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Neuerthelesse dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tly they accomplished their request, &amp; vnderstanding that the Councel of the <hi>Dieci</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mitted the mater wholy to the Duke, they inade a supplication vnto him in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. iij.

The day being come, all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lords assembled, desirous to sÃ©e to what issue this matter would grow.

Arriued at the pallace, ascending the marble staires or steps of the same, they were brought into the great hall, where the Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the matter to bÃ©e heard.

               <p>
                  <q>Most excellent Prince, and ye right honorable lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, perceiuing how my deare husband vncomely and very dishonestly doth vse himselfe against mÃ©e in this noble companie, I do thinke maister <hi>Girolamo Bembo</hi> to be affected with like rage &amp; minde against this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman mistresse <hi>Lucie</hi> his wife, although more te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

Wherfore by youre gracious pardon and licence (moste honourable) in the behalfe of mistresse Lucie and my selfe, for our defense I purpose to declare the effect of my mind although my purpose be cleane altered from that I had thought to say, beyng now iustly prouoked by the vnkinde beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of him, whome I doe loue better than my selfe, which had he bene silent and not so rashly runne to the ouerthrow of me and my good name, I wold haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiled and onely touched that, which shoulde haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the purgation and sauegard of them both, which was the onely intent &amp; meaning of vs, by making our, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ble supplication to your maiesties. Neuerthelesse, so
<pb facs="tcp:10750:277"/>
so farre as my fÃ©eble force shall stretch, I will assay to do both the one and the other, although it be not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to our kinde in publike place to declame, or yet to open such bold attempts, but that necessitie of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and oportunitie of time and place, dothe bolden vs to enter into these termes, wherof we craue a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d pardons for our vnkindely dealings, and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>der double thanks to your honors, for admitting vs to speake. Be it knowne therfore vnto you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our husbandes against duetie of loue, lawes of mariage, and against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, do make their heauie complaints, which by &amp; by I wil make plaine and euident. I am right well assured, that their extreme rage &amp; bitter heartes sorow do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cÃ©ede of. y. occasions: The one, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murder wherof they haue falsly accused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> selues: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other of iealosy, which grieuously doth gnawe their hearts, thinking vs to be vile &amp; abhominable wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, bicause they were surprised in eche others cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ber. Concerning the murder, if they haue soiled their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds therin, it appertaineth vnto you my lords to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>der their desert. But how can y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same be layd to our charge, for somuch as they (if it wer done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same without our knowlege, our help &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sel? And truly I sÃ©e no cause why any of vs ought to be burdened with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> outrage, and much lesse cause haue they to lay the same to our charge. For mÃ©ete it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that doth any vnlawful act, or is accessarie to the same, shold suffer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> due penaltie &amp; seuere chastisement accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as the sacred lawes do prescribe, as an example for other to abstein from wicked facts. But herof what nÃ©ede I to dispute, wherin the blind may sÃ©e to be none offense, bicause (thanks be to God) Maister <hi>Aloisio</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, which declareth the fond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fession of our vngitle husbands, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trary to trouth? And if so be our hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ds in dede had done such an abhominable enterprise,

reason and duetie had moued vs to sorowe and lament them, bicause they be borne of noble blood, and be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of this noble citie, which like a pure virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolably doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>serue hir laws &amp; customs. Great cause I say, had we to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t them, if like homicides &amp; murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers they had spotted their noble blood with such fowle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But bicause I may not consume words in vain, to stay you by my long discourse from matters of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce, I humbly besÃ©ech you (right excellent prince) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>maunde them to tel what thing it is, which so bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly doth torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t them. Then the Duke caused one of the noble men assistant there, to demaund of them the question: who answered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the chiefest occasion was, bicause they knew their wiues to be harlots, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they supposed to be very honest: &amp; for somuch as they knew them to be such, they conceiued sorow and grief, which with suche extremitie did gripe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heart, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to sustain y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great infamy, ashamed to be sene of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> wer induced through desire of deth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did.

And you master <hi>Girolamo,</hi> what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>strained you to forsake your wiues bed to come to my husbands, wher no man euer had, or at this present hath to do but him self? were not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shetes of the one so white, so fine, neat &amp; swÃ©et as the other? I am (moste noble Prince) sorie to declare my husbands folie, and ashamed that he should forsake my bed to go to an other, that did accompt my selfe so wel worthy to entertaine hym in myne owne, as the best wife in <hi>Venice,</hi> and now through his abuse, I abstaine to shewe my selfe amongs the beautiful and noble da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of this Citie.

Moreouer I know no cause why men should haue more libertie to doe euil than we women haue: albeit through the weakenesse and cowardise of our sexe, ye men will doe what ye lift. But ye be now no Lordes, nor we seruaunts, and husbands we do you cal, bicause the holy lawes of Matrimony (which was the first Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament giuen by God to men after the creation of the world) doe require equall faith, and so well is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band bound to the wife as she vnto him. Goe to then &amp; make your complaint: the next Asse or beast ye mÃ©ete, take hir to be your wife. Why doe ye not know that the balance of Iustice is equall, and wayeth downe no more of one side than of other? But let vs nowe leaue of to reason of this matter, and come to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for which we be come hither.

But hering my father (of worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie) many times to tel y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your maiestie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of your youth disdained not to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> your hert to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amorous flames of loue, &amp; being assured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is none but that doth loue litle or much, I do not doubt but for the words which I shal speake, to obtain both pitie and pardon. To come then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter: God I thank him of his goodnesse, hath not permitted me to be one of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sort of women, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like hipocrites do mumble their <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> to saincts, appering outwardly to be deuout &amp; holy and in fruite do bring forth deuils, and all kindes of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, specially ingratitude, whiche is a vice that dothe suck &amp; drie vp the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tain of godly pietie. Life is deare to me (as naturally it is to all) next which I estÃ©eme mine honor, that peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ture is to be preferred before life, bicause without honor life is of no reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.

For which tender affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> shold I shew my self vnkind

and froward? God forbid. And to be plaine with your honors, he is more deare &amp; acceptable vnto me, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> balles of mine owne eyes, being the derest things that appertaine to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> furniture of the body of man, without which no earthly thing can be gladsom and ioyfull to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sense and fÃ©eling. Last of all, his amorous and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate demonstration of his loue towards me, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him self to be careful of mine honor, rather more willing to bestow his owne, than to suffer the same to be touched with the left suspicion of dishonestie, I can not choose, but so faithfully imbrace, as I am readie to guage my life for his sake, rather than his finger shold ake for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> offense. And where hath there ben euer fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d such liberalitie in any louer? What is he that hath ben euer so prodigall, to employ his life, the moste speciall pledge in this worlde, rather than he would suffer his beloued to incurre dishonoure? Many histories haue I red, and Chronicles of our time, and yet I haue founde fewe or none comparable vnto thys Gentleman, the like of whom be so rare and seldome as white crowes or swannes of color blacke.

And albeit that he might a thousand wayes haue saued himself without the imprisonment &amp; aduersitie which he hath sustained: neuerthelesse after he had said, being then past reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce through the fal, that he fel downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> my window, &amp; perceiued how much that confession would preiudice and hurt my good name, and spotte the known honestie of the same, of his good wil chose to die rather than to speake any words that might brÃ©ede yll

opinion of me, or the least thing of the worlde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might ingendre infamie &amp; slaunder. And therefore not able to cal back the words he had spoken of the fal, nor by any meanes could coloure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, he thought to saue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good name of another by his own hurt. If he then thus redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; liberally hath protruded his life to manifest da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger for my benefit &amp; sauegard, preferring min honor aboue the care of himself, shall not I abandon all that I haue, yea &amp; therwithall hazard mine honor for his saluation? But what? Shal I disdaine bountifully to imploy my self &amp; al the endeuor of my friends for his deliuery? No no (my Lords) if I had a thousand liues, &amp; so many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors at my commaundement, I wold giue them al for his relief and comfort, yea if it were possible for me to recouer a fresh. x. C. M. liues, I wold so frankly bestow them all, as euer I desired to liue, that I might enioy mine own <hi>Aloisio.</hi> But I am sory, and euer shalbe sory, for that it is not lawful for me to do more for him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which my smal power and possibilitie is able. For if he shold die, truly my life could not endure: if he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of life, what plesure should I haue to liue in this world after him? wherby (most honorable &amp; righteous iudge,) I beleue before the honest, not to lose any one iote of mine honor, bicause I being (as you may sÃ©e) &amp; yong woman &amp; a widow desirous to mary againe, it is lawful for me to loue and to be beloued for none other intent (whereof God is the only iudge) but to attaine a husband according to my degrÃ©e. But if I should lose my reputation and honor, why should not I aduenture the same for him, that hath not spared his owne for my sake? Nowe to come to the effect of the matter, I doe say with all duetifull reuerence, that it is an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation altogither false and vntrue, that euer master A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loisio came to my house as a ThÃ©efe against my will.

For what nede he to be a thefe, or what would he doe with my goodes, that is a lorde and owner of. xx. times so muche as I haue? Alas good Gentleman, I dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and guage my life, that he neuer thoughte, much lesse dyd any robberie or thing vnlawfull, wherewith iustly he may be charged. But he repaired to my house with my consent, as a louing and affectionate louer, the circumstance whereof, if it be duely marked, must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the same to be of trouthe infallible. For if I had not giuen him licence to come, how was it possible for him to conuey his ladder so high, that was made but of ropes, and to fasten the same to the iaume of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if none within did helpe hym. Againe, how could the window of the chamber be open at that time of the night, which is still kept shut, if it had not bene by my consent. But I with the helpe of my mayde threwe downe to him a litle rope, whervnto he tied his ladder and drew the same vp, and making it so fast, as it could not vndo, and then made a signe for maister <hi>Aloisio</hi> to come vp. But as bothe our ill fortune wold haue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could catch any hold of him, to mine inestimable grief and hearts sorrowe he fell downe to the ground. Wherfore (my lordes) I besÃ©eche your honours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the confession wherein he hath made him selfe to be a thefe. And you maister <hi>Aloisio</hi> declare the trouth as it was, sith I am not ashamed in this honorable as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie to tel the same. Behold the letters (my lords) whiche so many times he wrote vnto me, wherein hÃ©e made sute to come to my speach, and continually in the same doth call me wife. Behold the ladder, which till nowe, did still remaine in my chamber. Beholde my maide, which in all mine affaires, is as it were myne owne hande and helper.</q> Master <hi>Aloisio</hi> being here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon demaunded of the Lords of the articles, which she

in hir tale had recited, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fessed them all to be true: who at the same instant was discharged. The Duke great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended them both, hir for hir stoute audacitie, in defense of an innocent Gentleman, and him for his honor and modestie, sÃ©eking to preserue the fame and good reporte of the Gentlewoman. Whiche done, the Counsell disassembled and brake vp. And the friendes of bothe the parties accompanied them home to the house of mistresse <hi>Gismonda,</hi> where to the greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and pleasure of al men, they were solemnely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in sumptuous and honorable wise, and maister A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loisio with his wyfe liued in greate prosperitie long time after.

But this Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tlewoman was so seuere in following the rigorous and constrained maners of our auncients, that impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it was, to sÃ©e hir abrode, except it were when she went to Mattens or other deuine seruice. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman sÃ©emed to haue studied the diuinitie of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> which paint <hi>Venus</hi> holding a key before hir mouth, &amp; setting hir foote vpon a <hi>Tortus,</hi> signifying vnto
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10750:285"/>
vs therby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> duety of a chast woman, whose tong ought to be locked, that she speake not but in time and place, and hir fÃ©ete not straying or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>dering, but to kÃ©epe hir self within the limits of hir owne house, except it be to serue God, and sometimes to render our bounden duty to them which haue brought vs into light. Moreouer <hi>Zilia</hi> was so religious (I wil not say superstitious) and rigorous to obserue customs, as she made it very squei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish and straunge to kisse Gentlemen that met hir, a ciuilitie which of long time hath bene obserued, and yet remaineth in the most part of the world, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen doe welcome straungers and guestes into their houses with an honest and chaste kisse. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the institution and profession of this widow had wiped away and deferred this poynt of hir youthe: whither it were for that she estÃ©emed hir self so faire, as all men were vnworthy to touche the vtter partes of so rare and precious a vessell, or that hir great and inimitable chastitie made hir so strange, to refuse that which hir duetie and honor would haue permitted hir to graunt. There chaunced about this time that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Countrey called Sir <hi>Philiberto</hi> of <hi>Virle,</hi> estÃ©emed to be one of the most valiant Gentlemen in those partes, repaired vpon an holy day to <hi>Montcall,</hi> (whose house was not very farre off the Towne) and being at diuine seruice, in place of occupying his sense and minde in heauenly things, and attending the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woords of a Preacher, which that day declared the woorde of God vnto the people, hÃ©e gaue himselfe to contemplate the excellent beautie of <hi>Zilia,</hi> who hadde put off for a while hir mourning vaile, that she might the better beholde the good father that preached, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a little aire, bicause the day was extreame hotte. The Gentleman at the first blushe, when hÃ©e sawe
<pb facs="tcp:10750:286"/>
that swÃ©ete temptation before his eyes, thought hym selfe rapt aboue the third heauen, and not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his looke, he fed hymselfe with the venome which by litle and litle, so seased vpon the soundest partes of his minde, as afterwards bÃ©eing liuely rooted in heart, the Gentleman was in daunger still to remaine there for a guage, without any hope of ease or comforte, as more amply this folowyng discourse, shall giue you to vnderstande. Thus all the mornyng hÃ©e behelde the Gentlewoman, who made no more accompt of them, that with great admiration did beholde hir, than they themselues did of their life, by committing the same to the hands of a woman so cruell. This Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come home to his lodging, enquired what faire wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that was, of what calling, and of what behauior, but he heard tell of more truely, than he would of good will haue knowne or desired to haue ben in hir, whom he did presently choose to be the onely mistresse of his moste secrete thoughts. Now vnderstanding wel the stubburne nature and vnciuile maner of that widow, hÃ©e coulde not tell what parte to take, nor to what Sainct to vow his deuotion, to make sute vnto hir he thought it time lost, to be hir seruant, it was not in his power, hauing already inguaged his libertie into the handes of hir, which once holdyng captiue the hearts of men, will not infraunchise them so soone as thoughte and will desire. Wherefore bayting hymselfe wyth hope, and tickled with loue, hÃ©e determined what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced, to loue hir, and to assay if by long seruice he coulde lenifie that harde hearte, and make tender that unpliant will, to haue pitie vpon the paine which she saw him to endure, &amp; to recompense his laborsome trauels, which he thought were vertuously imployed for gayning of hir good grace. And vpon this settled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10750:286"/>
he retired againe to <hi>Virle</hi> (so was his house named) where disposing his things in order, he retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to <hi>Montcall</hi> to make his long resiance there, to put in readinesse his furniture, and to welde his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie with suche industrie, as in the ende he mighte make a reasonable breach to force and take the place: For surprisyng whereof, he hazarded great dangers, the rather, that he hym selfe might first be taken. And where hys assaultes and pollicies could not preuaile, he mynded to content him selfe with the pleasure and passetyme that hÃ©e myght receiue in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thyng so fayre, and the ordinarie sight of an image so excellent. The memorie of whome rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased hys paine than yelded comfort, dyd rather mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister corrosiue poyson, than gyue remedie of ease, a cause more of cruel and sodaine death, than of prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged life. <hi>Philiberto</hi> then being become a citizen of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tcall,</hi> vsed to frequent the Churche more than hÃ©e was wont to doe, or his deuotion serued hym, and that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not able elsewhere to enioy the presence of his Sainct, but in places and temples of deuotion: whiche no doubt was a very holie and woorthie disposition, but yet not mÃ©ete or requisite to obserue suche holy places for those intentes, whiche oughte not to be prophaned in thyngs so fonde and foolishe, and actes so contrary to the institution and mynde of those, which in tymes paste were the fyrst founders and erectours of temples. <hi>Signior Philiberto</hi> then moued with that religious superstition, made no conscience at all to speake vnto hir within the Churche. And true it is, when she wente out of the same, he (moued with a certaine familiar curtesie, naturall to eche Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good bryngyng vp) many tymes conducted hir home to hir owne house, not able for all that (what so

In dÃ©ede I confesse my self to be a woman, and you men do say that womens hearts be faint I fÃ©eble: but to be plaine with you, the contrary is in me, my heart is so stoute and ambitious, as paraduenture not mÃ©ete and consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t to power and abilitie, although we women will finde no lacke if our hearts haue pith and strength inough to beare it out.

And it must nÃ©edes rise and redounde to your gaine and preferment, for that I heare you say the Kings maiestie doeth alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye knowe you.

To be short, there was nothing that so much molested the Knight, as the doubt he had of his wife, for that she was a very fine and faire yong Gentlewoman: And therefore he still deuised and imagined what assurance be might finde of hir behauior in his absence. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in this imagination, not long after it came to passe that the Knight being in company of diuers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and talking of sundry matters, a tale was told what chaunced to a gentleman of the Countrey which had obtained the fauoure and good will of a woman, by meanes of an olde man called <hi>Pollacco,</hi> which had the name to be a famous enchaunter and Physitian, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Cutiano</hi> a Citie of <hi>Boeme,</hi> where plenty of siluer Mines and other mettals is. The knight whose Castle was not farre from <hi>Cutiano,</hi> had occasion to repaire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Citie, and according to his desire found out <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacco,</hi> which was a very olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and talking with him of diuers things, perceiued him to be of great skill. In end he entreated him, that for so much as he had done pleasure to many for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This <hi>Pollacco</hi> which was a very cunning enchaunter as you haue hard, sayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: <q>Sir you demaund a very strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ge matter, such as where with neuer hitherto I haue bene acquainted, ne yet searched the depthe of those hidden secretes, a thing not commonly sued for, ne yet practised by me.

And for that purpose she willed him to looke in such a corner of the Chamber, and he shoulde finde certaine spindles of thrÃ©ede, and an instrument to winde his yarne vpon. Wherefore (quod she) apply your self thereunto, and lose no time.

               <p>This song made the company to muse, who commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the trim inuention of the Knight, and aboue al Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neura praised him more than before, &amp; could not so well refraine hir lokes from him, &amp; he with countre change rendring like againe, but that the two widowes their mothers conceiued great hÃ©ede therof, reioysing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to sÃ©e the same, desirous in time to couple them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For at that present they deferred the same, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration they were both very yong. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding it had bene better that the same coniunction had bene made, before fortune had turned the whÃ©ele of hir vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablenesse. And truely delay and prolongation of time sometimes bringeth such and so great missehaps, that one hundred times men cursse their fortune, and little aduise in foresight of their infortunate chaunces that commonly do come to passe. As it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced to these wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, one of them thinking to loose hir sonne by the vaine behauior of the others daughter, who without y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> helpe of God, or care vnto his will, disparaged hir ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and prepared a poyson so daungerous for hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers age, that the foode therof prepared the way to the good Ladies graue. Nowe whiles this loue in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner increased, and that desire of these two Louers, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forth ordinarily in fire and flames more violent, <hi>Dom Diego</hi> all chaunged and transformed into a newe man, receiued no delite, but in the sight of his <hi>Gineura.</hi> And she thought that there could be no greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or more to be wished for, than to haue a friend so perfect, and so wel accomplished with all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the ornament and full furniture of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This was the occasion that the yong Knight let
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:10750:336"/>
no wÃ©eke to passe without visiting his mistresse twice or thrice at the least, and she did vnto him the greatest curtesie and best entertainment, that vertue could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a maiden to doe, who is the diligent treasurer and carefull tutor of hir honor. And this she did by conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t of hir mother. In like manne, rhonestie doth not permit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chaste maidens should vse long talke, or immoderate spÃ©eche, with the first that be suters vnto them: &amp; much lesse sÃ©emely it is for them to be ouer squeimishe nice, with that man which sÃ©eketh (by way of marriage) to winne power and title of the body, which in very dede, is or ought to be the moitie of their soule. Such was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> desires of these two Louers, which notwithstanding was impÃ©eched by meanes, as hereafter you shal heare. For during the rebounding ioy of these faire couple of loyall louers, it chaunced that the daughter of a noble man of the Countrey, named <hi>Ferrando de la Serre,</hi> which was faire, comely, wise, and of very good behauior, by kÃ©eping daily company with <hi>Gineura,</hi> fel extrÃ©emely in loue with <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> and assayed by all meanes to do him to vnderstand what the puissance was of hir loue, which willingly she meant to bestowe vpon him, if it wold please him to honor hir so much, as to loue hir w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> rather possessed of another, had lost with his libertie his wits, and minde to marke the affection of this Gentlewoman of whome he made no accompt. The Maiden neuerthelesse ceased not to loue him, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> al possible wayes to make him hir owne. And knowing how much <hi>Dom Diego</hi> loued Hawking, she bought a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

to the good grace of his Mistresse, and to assure hir selfe of his faithfull seruice, and that for hir sake he would kepe the hauk so tenderly as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> balles of his eyes. This Hauk was the cause of the ill fortune that afterwards chaunced to this pore louer. For going many times to sÃ©e <hi>Gineura</hi> with the Hauke on his fist, &amp; bearing with him the tokens of the goodnesse of his Hauke, it escaped his mouthe to say, that the same was one of the things that in all the world he loued best. Truely this worde was taken at the first bound contrary to his meaning, wherwith the matter so fell out, as afterwards by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire he was like to lose his life. Certaine dayes after, as in the absence of the Knight, talke rose of his vertue and honest conditions, one prainsing his prowesse &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunce, another his great beautie and curtesy, another passing further, extolling the sincere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>cy which appeared in him touching matters of loue, one enuious person named <hi>Gracian</hi> spake his minde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in this wise: <q>I wil not deny but that <hi>Dom Diego</hi> is one of the most excellent, honest and brauest Knightes of <hi>Catheloigne,</hi> but in matters of Loue he sÃ©emeth to me so waltering and inconstant, as in euery place where he commeth, by and by he falleth in loue, and maketh as though he were sick, and wold die for the same. <hi>Gineu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> maruelliing at those woords, sayd vnto him: I pray you my friende to vse better talke of the Lorde <hi>Dom Diego.</hi> For I do thinke the loue which the Knight doth beare to a Gentlewoman of this Countrey, is so firme and assured, that none other can remoue the same out of the siege of his minde: Lo how you be deceiued gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman (quod <hi>Gracian,</hi>) for vnder coloure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> seruice, he and such as he is doe abuse the simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of yong Gentlewomen.</q> And to proue my saying
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:10750:337"/>
true, I am assured that he is extremely enamored with the daughter of <hi>Dom Ferrando de la Serre,</hi> of whome he receiued an Hauke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he loueth aboue all other things. <hi>Gineura</hi> remembring the words which certaine dayes before <hi>Dom Diego</hi> spake touching his Hauke, began to suspect and beleue that which master <hi>Gracian</hi> alleaged, and not able to support the choler, which colde iealosie bred in hir stomake, went into hir Chamber full of so great grief and heauinesse, as she was many times like to kill hir self. In the end, hoping to be reuenged of the wrong which she beleued to receiue of <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to endure hir fortune paciently. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time she conceiued in hir minde a despite and hatred so great and extreame against the pore. Gentleman that thought little hÃ©ereof, as the former loue was nothing in respect of the reuenge by death, which she then desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon him. Who the next day after his wonted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner came to sÃ©e hir, hauing (to his great damage) the Hauke on his fiste, which was the cause of all that iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse. Nowe as the Knight was in talke with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sÃ©eing that his beloued came not at all (according to hir custome) to salute him and bid him welcome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired how she did. One that loued him more than the rest, sayd vnto him: <q>Syr, so soone as she knewe of your comming, immediately she withdrew hir selfe into hir Chamber.</q> He that was wise and well trained vp, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled what he thought, imagining that it was for some little fantasie, whereunto women willingly be subiecte. And therefore when he thought time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, he tooke leaue of the widowe, and as hÃ©e was going downe the staires of the great Chamber, he met one of the maides of <hi>Gineura,</hi> whome he prayed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to hir mistresse.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10750:338"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gineura</hi> during all this time toke no rest, deuising how she might cutte of cleane hir loue entertained in <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> after she knew that he caried the Hawke on his fist: which was the only cause that did put hir into that frensie. And therefore thinking hir selfe both despised and mocked of hir Knight, &amp; that he had done it in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of hir, she entred into so great rage and choler, as she was like to fall mad. She being then in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of minde, behold hir Gentlewoman came vnto hir, and did the Knights message. Who hearing the simple name of hir supposed enimy, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to sigh so strangely, as a man wold haue thought hir soule presently wold haue departed hir body. Afterwards when she had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished hir raging fit which stayed hir speach, she gan very tenderly to wÃ©epe, saying: <q>Ah traitor &amp; vnfaithful louer, is this the recompense of the honest and firme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which I haue borne thÃ©e, so wickedly to deceiue me vnder the colour of so faint and detestable a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? Ah rashe and arrant ThÃ©ese, is it I vpon whome thou oughtest to vende thy wicked trumperies? Doste thou thinke that I am no better worthe, but that thou prodigally shouldest wast mine honor to bear y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spoiles thereof to hir, that is in nothing comparable vnto me? Wherin haue I deserued this discurtesie, if not by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thÃ©e more than thy beautie &amp; fained loue deserue? Diddest thou dare to aduenture vpon me, hauing thy conscience wounded with suche an abhominable and deadly treason? Durst thou to offer thy mouth to kisse my hand, by the mouth of another, to whome thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest before dedicated thy lying lips in thine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per person? I praise God that it pleased him to let me sÃ©e before any other worse chaunce hath happened, the poyson by thÃ©e prepared for the ruine of my life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Ha foole, hope not to take me in thy trap, nor yet
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:10750:338"/>
to deceiue me through thy sugred and deceitful words. For I sweare by the almighty God, that so long as I shall liue, I wil accompt thÃ©e none other, but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most cruel and mortal enimy that I haue in this world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then to accomplish the rest of hir careful minde, she wrote a letter to giue hir farewell to hir olde friend <hi>Dom Diego.</hi> And for that purpose instructed hir Page with this lesson, that when the Knight should come, he should be ready before hir lodging and say vnto him in the behalfe of hir, that before he passed any further, he should reade the letter, and not to faile to doe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The Page which was malicious, and ill affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> knowing the appointed day of his comming, waited for him a quarter of a mile from the Castle, where he had not long taried, but beholde the innocent louer came, against whome the Page went, bearing about him more hurtfull &amp; noisome weapons, than all the ThÃ©eues and robbers had in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Catheloigne.</hi> In this manner presenting his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse letters, he sayde vnto him: <q>My Lord, Madame <hi>Gineura</hi> my mistresse hath sent me vnto you, &amp; bicause she knoweth how fearfull you be to displease hir, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you not faile to reade this letter before you passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, and there withall accomplishe the effecte of the same. The Knight abashed with that sodaine mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, answered the Page: God forbid my friend (quod be) that I shold disobey hir by any meanes, vnto whom I haue giuen a full authoritie and puissance ouer mine affections.</q> So receiuing the letters, he kissed them thre or foure times, and opening them, found that he hoped not for, and red that which he thought not off.

And in this sort the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle woman long time fed him with delayes.

Yet will I not praise, but rather accuse aboue all faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men, those that be so fondly iealous, as eche thing troubleth their minde, and be afraide of the flies very shadowe that buzze about their faces.

Now of this contempt which the wife beareth to hir husband, doe rise very many times notorious slaunders, and suche as are accompanyed with passing cruelties: wherein the husband ought to moderate his heat and calme his choler, and soberly to chastise the fault, for so muche as excessiue wrath and anger, doe Eclipse in man the light of reason, and suche rages doe make them to be semblable vnto brute and reasonlesse beastes: MÃ©ete it is to be angrie for things done co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trary to right &amp; equitie, but te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>perance and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie is necessary in all occurrentes, be they with vs, or against vs. But if to resist anger in those matters, it be harde and difficulte, it is also to be thought that the greater impossibilitie there is in the operation and effecte of any good thing, the greater is the glory that banquisheth the affection and mastereth the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde which is not so impossible to gouerne, and subdue to reason, as many doe estÃ©eme.</p>

It chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ced that the eldest oftentimes repairing from <hi>Foligno</hi> to <hi>Nocera,</hi> and lodging still in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castell, behelde with a little too much wanton eye, the wife of his lieuetenaunt which was placed there with a good number of dead payes, to guard the forte, &amp; kepe vnder the Citizens, if by chaunce (as it happeneth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the newe erection of estates) they attempted some newe enterprise against their soueraigne Lords. Now this Gentlewoman was faire, and of better grace sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly delighting to be loked vpon: which occasioned the Lord <hi>Nicholas,</hi> by perceiuing the wantonnesse and good will of the mistresse of the Castell, not to refuse so good occasion, determining to prosecute the enioying of hir, that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bird after which he hunted, whose beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and good grace had dÃ©epely wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ded his mind: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if he forgotte his duetie, I leaue for all men of good iudgement to consider.

And if so be his sayde Lieuetenaunt had bene accused of felony, misprision, or Treason (yet to speake the trouth) he might haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the charge of his Castel vnto an other, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to suborne his wife to follie.

To be short, this blinded louer yelding no resistance to loue, and the foolish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which altereth the iudgementes of the wisest, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred his fansie to roue so farre vnto his appetites, as on a day when the Lieuetenaunt was walked abrode into the Castell, to viewe the Souldioures and deade payes (to pleasure him that sought the meanes of his displeasure) he spake to the Gentlewoman his wife in this manner: <q>Gentlewoman, you being wise and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as eche man knoweth, needefull it is not to vse long or Rethorical Orations, for so much as you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further supply of talke doe clearely perceiue by my lookes, sighes and earnest viewes, the loue that I bear you, which without comparison nippeth my heart so neare as none can fÃ©ele the parching paines, that the same poore portion of me doeth suffer.

He was the wylde Bore whom he meant to strike, hÃ©e was the praie of his vnsaciable and cruell appetite. If the fault had ben generall of all thrÃ©e togethers, he had had some reason to make them passe the bracke of one equall fortune, and to tangle them within one net, both to preuent therby (as he thought) his further hurt, and to chastise their leude behauiour. For many times (as lamentable experience teacheth) Noble men for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect of their nobilitie, make no conscence to doe wrong to the honor of them, whose reputation and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie they oughte so well to regarde as their owne.

All the race of the <hi>Tarquines</hi> for like fact were banished <hi>Rome,</hi> for the onely brute whereof, the husband of the faire rauished wife, was constrained to auoide the place of his natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Paris</hi> alone violated the body of <hi>Menelaus</hi> the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demouian</hi> King, but for reuenge of the rauished <hi>Greeke,</hi> not onely the glorie and richesse of stately <hi>Troy,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the most part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europa,</hi> was ouerturned and defaced, if credit may be giuen to the records of the auncient. So in this fact of the Lieutenant, the Lorde <hi>Nicholas</hi> alone, had polluted his bed, but the reuenge of the cruell man extended further, and his furie raged so farre, as the guiltlesse were in great daunger to beare the penance, which shall be well perceiued by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that foloweth. The Captaine then hauing sente his message, and being sure of his intent (no lesse than if he already had the brethren within his hold, vpon the point to couple them together with hys wife, to sende them all in pilgrimage to visite the faithfull sorte, that blason their loues in an other worlde, with <hi>Dido, Phyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and suche like, that more for dispaire than loue, bÃ©e passed the straictes of death) caused to be called before him in a secrete place, all the souldiers of the Fort, and such as with whome he was sure to preuaile, to whom not without sheading forth some teares, and she wyng heauie countenance, he spake in this maner:</p>

It is of the Wife that I speake, who being the moytie of hir husbande, ye ought not to muse if I say, that the honour of the one is the rest of the other, and the one infamous and wicked, the other fÃ©eleth the troubles of such mischief, and the wife being carelesse of hir honor, the husbands reputation is defiled, and is not worthie of praise, if he suffer such shame vnreuenged: I must (Companions &amp; good friends) here discouer that which my heart would faine kepe secrete, if it were possible,

But when he considered that the Lords alone, should lodge withinthe Fort, he was of good chÃ©ere againe, and stayed vpon his first intent.

Stay here a while (ye gentlemen) ye I say, that pursue the secrete stelths of loue, neuer put any great trust in Fortune, whiche seldome kepeth hir promise with you.

But the King which had bene daintely sed, and did not well tast and like that kinde of meat, demaunded if his hunger could not be supplied with a little flesh, for that his stomake was anoyed with the only sauoure of the Eeles. The pore man, (as ye haue somwhat perceiued by the former discourse,) was a plesaunt fellowe, and delighted rather to prouoke laughter, than to prepare more dainty meat, said vnto the King: <q>It is no maruel though our Kings doe furnishe themselues with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, to serue them in their warres, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bringing vp and litle force in fine courtiers. We, albeit the raine doth fal vpon our heads, and the winde assaile euery part of our bodies all durtie and wet, doe not care either for fire or bed, we fede vpon any kinde of meat that is set before vs, without sÃ©eking sause for increasing of our appetite: and we (behold) are nÃºmble, healthy, lusty, and neuer sicke, nor our mouth out of taste, where ye doe fÃ©ele suche distemperaunce of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, as pitie it is to sÃ©e, &amp; more adoe there is to bring the same into his right order and taste, than to ordaine and dresse a supper for a whole armie.</q> The King who laughed (with displayed throte,) hearing his hoste so merily disposed, could haue bene contented to haue heard him still, had not his appetite prouoked him and the time of the night very late. <q>Wherfore he said vnto him. I doe agrÃ©e to what you alleage, but performe I pray thÃ©e my request, &amp; then we will satisfie our selues with further talke.

But I haue a little Kidde which as yet is not weaned, the same wil I cause to be made ready, for I thinke it cannot be better bestowed.</q> The supper by reason of the hostes curtesie, was passed forth in a thousande pleasant passetimes, which the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherman of purpose vttered to recreate his guest, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sawe him to delight in those deuises. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ende of supper, he sayd vnto the King: Now sir, how like you this banket? <q>It is not so sumptuous as those be that be ordinarily made at our Princes court, yet I thinke that you shall slÃ©epe with no lesse appetite than you haue eaten with a good stomacke, as appereth by the few words you haue vttered in the time of your repast. But whervnto booteth it to employ time, or dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for eating, in expense of talke, which serueth not but to passe the time, and to shorten the day?
