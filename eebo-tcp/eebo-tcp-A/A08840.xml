            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The newes of their deathe knowen to their wiues dwelling in their countrey, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue great heauinesse and dolor extreme.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage, and determined to reuenge the death of their husbandes, by putting their handes to weapons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they did exercise themselues very ofte.

This being done, the women toke the gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Countrey, inhabiting at the beginning along the Riuer of <hi>Thermodon,</hi> where their husbands wer stain.

and the other <hi>Lampedo.</hi> Those two louyngly deuided the armie and men of warre in two parts, either of them defending (with great hardinesse) the Lands which they had conquered: and to make them selues more dreadfull (such was the credite and vanitie of men that time) they fained themselues to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daughters of <hi>Mars.</hi> Afterward these miraculous wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing after this maner in peace &amp; iustice, considered that by succession of time, for wante of daughters that might succéede, warres, and time, wold extinguishe their race. For this cause they treated mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with their neighbors named <hi>Gargarians</hi> (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayeth) with condition, that vpon certaine times of the yeare, their husbands shold assemble together in some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place, and vse them for certaine dayes vntill they were with childe: which being done and knowen, they shoulde returne home againe to their owne houses. If they brought forth daughters, they norished and trained them vp in armes, and other manlyke exercises, and to ride great horsse. They taught them to run at base, &amp; to follow the chace. If they were deliuered of males, they sent them to their fathers. And if by chaunce they kept any backe, they murdred them, or else brake their armes and leggs in suche wyse as they had no power to beare weapons, and serued for nothing else but to spin, twist, and to doe other feminine labour. And for as much as these <hi>Amazones</hi> defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded themselues so valiantly in the warres with Bowe and Arrowes, and perceiued, that their breasts did verie much impech the vse of that wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and other exercises of armes, they seared vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righte breastes of their yong daughters, for which cause they were named <hi>Amazones,</hi> which signifieth in the Gréeke tong, without breasts, although that some other do giue vnto that name an other Etimologie.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman hauing deliuered al <hi>Persia,</hi> &amp; created King, kept a princely court, wherin were many magnificent facts and vertuous déedes exercised and done, and he himself most noble in all his affaires, besides the titles, which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily wanne in many bloudie battels, was estéemed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the east part of the worlde, to be the most libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and magnanimous prince that in any age euer raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. In feastes and bankets he was an other <hi>Lucullus,</hi> royally intertaining strangers that repaired to his court. This king had in his court, a <hi>Senescall</hi> or stewarde, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> whose office was, that when the king made any pompous or publike feast, to mount vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a white Courser, with a Mace of golde in his hand, and to ride before the Esquiers &amp; Sewers for the Kings owne mouthe, and those that bare the Kings meate in vessell of golde, couered with fine naperie, wrought and purled with most beautiful workmanship of silk &amp; golde. This office of <hi>Senescall</hi> was highly estemed, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wont to be giuen to one of the chiefest Barons of the Realme. Wherfore this <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> besides that he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10750:23"/>
was of moste noble Lignage and incomparable riches, was the most curteous and liberall knight that frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Court, whose immoderate expence was such, as leauing the mean, wherin al vertue consisteth, by reason of his outrage which many times he vsed, he fell into the vice of prodigalitie. Whereby he séemed not only in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous déedes to compare with the King, but also conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to excéede and surpasse him. One day the King for his disport and recreation called for the Chesseborde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to kéepe him companie. Which game in those days amongs the <hi>Persians</hi> was in greate vse and estimation, in such wise as a cunning gamster at that pastime was no lesse commended and honored, than among vs in these dayes an excellent Drator, or famous learned man. Yea and the very same game in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vse in the Courte, and noble mens houses of oure tune, no doubt very commendable and mete to be practised by all states &amp; degrées. The King and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> being set down at a table in the great hall of the Palace, one right against an other, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with a great number of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages and Gentlemen looking vpon them, and marking their play with great silence, they began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countre one an other with the Chessemen. <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> whether it was that he played better than the king, or whether the king <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:10750:24"/>
driuen to his shiftes. The <hi>Senescall</hi> espying the Kings demeanour, and séeing the honest shamefastnesse of the King, woulde not suffer hym to receiue suche foile, but made a draught by mouing his Knight backe, to open a way for the King to passe, as not onely he deliuered him from the daunger of the Mate; but also loste one of his Rocks for lack of taking héede: whervpon the game re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted equall. The King (who knew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good nature &amp; noble minde of his seruant, by experience of the same in other causes) faining that he had ouerséene the taking of his Rock, <q>gaue ouer the game, and rising vp, sayd: No more <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> the game is yours, and I confesse my selfe ouercome.</q> The King thought that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> did not the same so much for curtesie, as to binde his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne lorde and king by benefite to recompence his subiectes like behauior, which he did not very well like, and therfore would play no more. Notwithstanding the King neither by signe or dede, ne yet in talk, shewed any token of displeasure for that curtesie done. Nowbeit the King would that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in semblable act, should abstaine to shew him selfe curteous or liberall, except it were to his inferiours and equals, bicause it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenient for a seruaunt to contende with his maister in those qualities.</p>

When they were come to the place, the King commaunded a woode to be beset about with nettes and toiles, and appointed eche man where he should stande in most conuenient place, and he him selfe attended with the doggs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10750:24"/>
beholde, they roused a wilde beast, whiche with greate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> leapte ouer the nettes, and ranne away with much spéede. The King séeing that straunge beast, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to pursue him to death: And making a signe to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his noble men which he desired to kepe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, he gaue the raine and spurre to his horse, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the chace, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was one of those noble men that pursued the game. It chaunced that day that the King rode vpon a horsse, that was the swiftest in his stable, which he estemed better than a thousand other, as well for his velocitie, as for his readynesse in factes of armes. Thus followyng with bridle at will, the flying rather than running beast, they were diuided far from their companie, and by reason of the Kings spéedinesse, none was able to followe him but <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and behind him one of his seruants vpon a good horsse, which alwayes he vsed in hunting inatters, which horsse was counted the best in al the Court. And thus folowing the chace with galloping spede, <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> at length es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied that the horsse of his soueraigne lorde had loste his shooes before, and that the stones had surbated his hoofs, wherevpon the King was driuen either to giue ouer the chace, or else to marre his horsse. But there was none of these two necessities but would haue greatly displeased the King, that did not perceiue his horsse to be vnshodde. The <hi>Senescall</hi> did no sooner espie the same, but sodainely dismounted from his own, caused his man to deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a hammer and nailes (which for such like chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he always caried about him) and tooke of two shooes from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Wherfore hallowing the King which was earnestly bent vpon the chace, tolde him of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherin his horsse was for lack of shooes. The Kyng
<pb facs="tcp:10750:25"/>
hearing that, lighted from his horsse, &amp; séeing two shooes in <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> mans hande, thinking that <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> had brought them with him, or that they wer the shooes whiche fell from his owne, taried still vntill his horsse was shodde. But when he sawe the notable horsse of his <hi>Senescall</hi> vnshodde before, then he thoughte that to be the curtesie of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> &amp; so did let the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter passe, studying by like meanes to requite him with Curtesie, whiche forced him selfe to surmounte in the same. And when his horsse was shod, he gaue the same to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in rewarde. And so the king chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lose his pleasure of hunting, than to suffer hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by his man to bée excelled in Curtesie, well noting the stoutnesse of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> mynde, which séemed to haue a will to contende with his Prince in factes renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and liberall. The <hi>Senescall</hi> thoughte it not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to refuse the gift of his liege Lorde, but accepted the same with like good will as before he shodde his horsse, still expecting occasion howe he might surpasse his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in curtesse, and so to binde him to requite the same. They had not taried there lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but many of those which came after had ouertaken them. And then the King got vp vpon a spare horsse, and returned to the citie with all his companie.</p>

And yet he thoughte vnkindenesse in the King, that he would not accept his gentle déedes in better parte. But fully minded that the honor of the triumph should be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Kings sonne, he welded the staffe within his rest, and when he was readie to encountre (bicause it was he that should come agaynst him) he let fall his launce out of his handes, and sayd: <q>Farewel this curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of mine, sith it is no better estemed</q>. The kings sonne gaue a gentle counterbuffe vpon the Placard of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nescall,</hi> &amp; brake his staffe in many pieces, which was the x. course.

And to say the trouth, such was his exceding curtesie, as fewe may be founde to imitate the same. Wée daily sée that many be liberall of Fortunes goodes, inuesting some with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, some with apparell, golde and siluer, Iewels, and other things of great value.

What shall we speake of them, which will not sticke to sheade their owne bloud, and many times to spende their life to do their frendes good? Of these and such like examples, all Records be full. But a man that contemneth same &amp; glorie, or is of his owne bonor liberall, is neuer founde. The victorious Captain after the bloody battaile, giueth the spoile of his enimies to his souldiers, rewardeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with prisoners, departeth vnto them the whole pray, but the glorie and honour of the battaile he reserueth vnto him selfe.

The King was displeased with these noble déedes and curtesie of his <hi>Senescall,</hi> bicause he thoughte it not méete or decent, that a subiecte and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt should compare with his lorde and maister: and therefore did not beare him that chéerefull countenance which he was wonte to doe.

That you be not a louer of your own desires, I speake it not withoute cause. For there is no worse gouernement than that which is ruled by selfewill and priuate opinion. For as he that gouerneth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men wealth ought to lyue in feare of all men, euen so muche more in feare of him selfe: in so much as he may commit greater errour, by doing that which his owne luste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunbeth,

Assure you sir, that you can not hurt yourself, and much lesse preiudice vs your subiects, if you do correct your self before you chastise others, estéemyng that to bée a ryght good gouernement, to be prodigal in works, and spare of spéech.

He that is without credite, ought to assay to procute credite. Hée that is without honour, ought to séeke honour. But the vertuous man hath no nede of noblenesse, ne he himself, ne yet any other person can berieue hym of due honour. Thou knowest wel <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the yere past, the office

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men, but the death of a good Prince ought to be extremely mourned. For if a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon person die, there is but one dead, but if a good Prince die, together with him dieth a whole realme. I speake this (O ye Fathers) for the rare vertues abounding in mine vncle <hi>Nerua:</hi> For if the Gods were disposed to sell vs the liues of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alreadie departed, it were but a small ransome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déeme
<pb facs="tcp:10750:96"/>

                        </gap> may be sufficient to buie the life of a vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Truly there woulde be a great masse of money giuen by the <hi>Assyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> to redeme the life of <hi>Belus,</hi> by the <hi>Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> for <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by the <hi>Troians</hi> for <hi>Hector,</hi> by the <hi>Greekes</hi> for <hi>Alexander,</hi> by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> by the Romanes for <hi>Augustus,</hi> and by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for <hi>Annibal.</hi> But as you knowe the Gods haue made all thyngs mortall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reserued onely themselues to bée immortall. Howe eminent and passing the vertue of the good is, and what priu ledge the godly haue, it may easily bée knowne: for so much, as honour is caried euen to the very graues os the deade, but so it is not to the greate Palaces of the wicked. The good and vertuous man, without sighte or knowledge we loue, serue, and aunswer for him: where the wicked wée can not beleue that which he sayeth, and lesse accepte in good parte the thyng whiche hée doeth for vs. Touchyng the election of the Empire, it was done by <hi>Nerua,</hi> it was demaunded by the people, approued by you, and accepted by me. Wherefore I praye the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morall Goddes that it may bée lyked of their godheades. For to small purpose auayleth the election of Princes, if the Gods doe not confirme it: and therefore a man may knowe hym whiche is chosen by the Gods, or elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men, for the one shall decline and fall, the other vpholden and preserned. The choyse of man sodaynely exalted doeth decline and fall, but that whiche is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Gods, although it be tossed to and fro with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall windes, &amp; receiueth great aduersitie, and boweth a little, yet he shal be neuer sene to fal. Ye know right wel (most honorable Fathers) that I neuer demaunded the Empire of <hi>Nerua</hi> my Soueraigne Lorde, although hée brought me vp and was his nephew, hauing hearde and well remembryng of my Maister <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that honour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10750:96"/>
ought rather to be deserued than procured. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I will not denie that ioyfull I was when my lorde <hi>Nerua</hi> sent me the ensigne of that greate and high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but I will also confesse that hauing begon to tast the trauailes and cares which that Imperiall state bringeth, I did repent more than a thousande times for taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the same. For Empire and gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is of such qualitie, that although the honour bée great, yet the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour sustaineth very great paine and miserable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. O how greatly doeth he bynde himselfe, which by gouernement byndeth other? for if it be iuste, they call it cruell, if it bée pitiefull, it is contemned, if liberall, it is estéemed prodigall, if he kéepe or gather togyther, hée is counted couetous, if he be peaccable and quiet, they deme him for a coward, if he be coragious, he is reputed a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reller, if graue, they will say he is proude, if he be easie to be spoken to, he is thought to be light or simple, if solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they will estéeme him to be an hypocrite, and if he be ioyfull, they will terme hym dissolute: In suche wise as they will be contented, and vse more better termes to all others what soeuer, than towards him, which gouerneth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. For to suche a one they recken the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels whiche he eateth, they measure his pases, they note his wordes, they take héede to his companies, and iudge of his workes (many tymes wrongfully,) they examine and murmure of his pastymes, and attempte to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his thoughtes. Consyder then the trauailes whiche bée in Gouernement, and the Enuie whyche many times they beare vnto him that ruleth. We may saye, that there is no state more sure than to be in that which is furthest off from Enuie. And if a man can not but with greate paine gouerne the wife which he hath chosen, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:10750:97"/>
in one house: how is it possible that he can still conserue in peace a whole common wealth? I pray you tell me, in whom shall a poore Prince repose his trust? sith that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he is most slaundered by them whome he fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth best? Princes and great lords can not eate without a garde, can not sléepe without a watche, can not speake without espiall, nor walke without some safetie, in suche wise as they beyng lordes of all, they bée as it were, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of their owne people. And if we will beholde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearely, and consider the seruitude of Princes, and the libertie of subiects, we shall finde that he whiche hath most to doe in the realme, or beareth greatest swinge, is most subiect to thraldom: In somuch as if Princes haue authoritie to giue libertie, they haue no meanes to be frée them selues. The Gods haue created vs so frée, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man desireth to haue his libertie so much at will, that a man be he neuer so familiar a friend, or so neare of kin, we had rather haue him to be our subiect, than our lorde and maister. One man alone commaundeth all, and yet it semeth to him but little. Ought we then to maruell, if many be wearie to obey one? We loue and estéeme our selues so much, as I neuer sawe any which of his owne good will woulde be subiect, ne yet against his will was made a lorde, which we sée to bée very true. For the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells and warres that bée amongs men, are not so much for obedience sake, as to rule and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde. I say more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that in drinking, eating, clothing, speaking, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, al men be of diuers qualities: but to procure liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they bée all conformable. I haue spoken all this (O Fathers conscript) vpon occasion of mine owne Empire, which I haue taken with good will, albeit afterwardes I was sorie for that great charge. For the waltering seas and troublesome gouernement be two things agréeable to beholde, and daungerous to proue. Notwithstanding

For I say vnto you, that a wise man is more auaileable in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a common welth, than a man of ouermuch

skill and experience. The forme then which ye shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in matters of iudgement, shal be thus: That in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile processe you kepe the law, and in criminall causes to moderate the same, bicause hainous, cruel, and rigorous lawes be rather made to amase and feare, than to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and kept. When you giue any sentence, ye ought to consider the age of the offenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when, how, wherfore, with whome, in whose presence, in what time, and how long ago, for somuch as euery of these things may either excuse or condenme: whiche you ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Moreouer (most excellent Prince) sith you wrote vnto vs the maner and order what we ought to do: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is that we write to you againe what you ought to foresée. And sith you haue told vs, and taught vs to obey you, mete it is that we may know what your pleasure is to commaunde. For that (it maye come to passe) that as you haue ben brought vp in <hi>Spayn,</hi> and of long time ben absent from <hi>Rome,</hi> through following the warres, that not knowing the lawes wherevnto we are sworne, and the customes whiche wée haue in <hi>Rome,</hi> Ye commaunde some thing that may redound to our damage and to your dishonor. And therefore we accompte it reason that your Maiestie bée aduertised hereof, and the same preuented, for so much as Princes oftentimes be negligent of many things, not for that they will not foresée the same, but rather for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of one that dare tel them what they ought to doe. And therfore wée humbly beséech your most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent maiestie, to extende and shewe forth your wisedome and prudence, for that the <hi>Romanes</hi> heartes ben drawen and made pliant rather by fauourable diligence, than by prouoked force. Touchyng the vertue, Iustice, may it please you, to remembre the same. For your olde vncle <hi>Nerua</hi> was wont to say, that a prince for all his magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie, valiance, and felicitie, if he do not vse and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

We will not also omitte to say vnto you (most famous Prince) that you must haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience to suffer the importunate, &amp; to dissemble with the offenders.

Ther is nothing (answered <hi>Lamia</hi>) wherwith a woman is more grieued, and maketh hir more sad, than to be called yll fauored, or that she hath no good grace, or to vnderstand that she is dissolute of life. This ladie Lamia, was of iudgement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and subtill, although yll ymployed in hir: &amp; therby made all the world in loue with hir: and drew all men to hir through hir faire spéech. Now before she lost the heart of king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> she haunted of long time the Uniuersities of <hi>Athenes,</hi> where she gained great store of money, and brought to destruction many yong men. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Demetrius</hi> saith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> hauing presented vnto him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When the king <hi>Demetrius</hi> would assure any thing by oth, he swore not by his Gods, ne yet by his predecessors, but in this sort: As I may be still in the grace of my lady <hi>Lamia,</hi> and as hir life &amp; mine may ende together, so true is this which I say &amp; doe, in this &amp; this sort. One yere &amp; two monethes before the death of king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> his frend <hi>Lamia</hi> died, who sorowed so much hir death, as for the absence &amp; death of hir, he caused the Philosophers of <hi>Athenes</hi> to entre disputation: Whether the teares and sorow, which he shed and and toke, were more to be este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, than the riches which he spent in hir obsequies &amp; funerall pompes.

Upon a day a yong man of <hi>Corinth</hi> demaunding of hir, what hée should say to a woman whome hée long tyme had loued, and made so great sute, that therby he was like to fall into dispaire. Thou shalt say (sayd <hi>Lais</hi>) vnto hir, that sith she will not graunt thy request, yet at least wise it might please hir to suffer thée to bée hir seruant, and that she would take in good parte the seruice that thou shalt doe vnto hir. Which request if she doe graunt, then hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the ende of thy attempt, bycause that we women bée of such nature, as opening the mouth to gyue some myld and pleasant answere to the amorous person, it is to bée thought that we haue gyuen our heart vnto the firste suter. An other daye in the presence of <hi>Lais,</hi> one praised the Philosophers of <hi>Athenes,</hi> saying that they were very honest personages, and of greate skyll and knowledge. Whereunto <hi>Lais</hi> aunswered: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what greate knowledge they haue, nor what sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they studie, ne yet what bookes your Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doe reade, bycause that I being a woman and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was at <hi>Athenes,</hi> I sée them repaire hither, and of Philosophers béecome amorous persons.

This amorous <hi>Flora</hi> wold neuer abandon hir person, but wyth gentlemen of great house, or of great dignitie and riches.

to Princes and noble Barons, that they may deale with me like gentlemen. For I sweare vnto you by the Goddesse <hi>Venus,</hi> that neuer man gaue me so little, but that I had more than I loked for, and the double of that which I could demaund. This amorous lady <hi>Flora</hi> was wont many tymes to saye, that a wise woman (or more aptlie to terme hir a subtill wench) ought not to demaund reward of hir louer for the acceptable pleasure which she doth hym, but rather for the loue which she beareth him, bicause that all things in the world haue a certain price, except loue, which cannot bée paide or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced but with loue. All the Ambassadors of the worlde, which had accesse into <hi>Italie,</hi> made so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the beauty and generositie of <hi>Flora,</hi> as they dyd of the Romane common wealth, bycause it semed to bée a monstrous thinge to sée the riches of hir house, hir trayue, hir beautie, the princes &amp; great lordes by whom she was required, and the presents and giftes that were gyuen vnto hir. This amorous <hi>Flora</hi> had a continuall regard to the noble house wherof she came, touching the magnificence and state of hir seruice. For albeit that she was but a common woman, yet she was serued &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a great ladie. That day wherin she rode about the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> she gaue occasion to bée spoken of a whole month after, one inquiring of an other what gret Roman lords they were that kept hir company: Whose men they were that waighted vpon hir: And whose liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ware?

&amp; peace thorowout <hi>Europa.</hi> Now after the death of this good Emperour <hi>Odenatus,</hi> the Armies chose one of his two sonnes to be Emperour of the <hi>Orient:</hi> But for that hée was yong, they chose <hi>Zenobia</hi> to bée Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of hir sonne, and gouerner ouer the said <hi>Orient</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Who séeing that vpon the decease of <hi>Odenatus</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the East Cuntries began to reuolt, she determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to open hir Treasure, reassemble hir men of warre, and in hir owne person to march into the fielde: where she did such notable enterprises, as shée appalled hir eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and made the whole worlde to wonder. About the age of. xxxv. yeares <hi>Zenobia</hi> was widow, being the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> of hir children, Regent of an Empire, and Captain general of the armie. In which weighty charge she vsed hir selfe so wiselie and well, as she acquired no lesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name in <hi>Asia,</hi> than Quéene Semiramis did in <hi>India. Zenobia</hi> was constant in that which she toke in hande, true in wordes, liberall, myide, &amp; seuere where she ought to be, discrete, graue, and secrete in hir enterprises, albeit she was ambicious. For, not content with hir title of Gouernesse or Regent, she wrote and caused hir selfe to bée called Empresse, she loued not to ride vpon a Mule, or in a littor, but greatlie estemed to haue greate horse in hir stable, and to learne to handle and ryde them. When <hi>Zenobia</hi> went forth of hir Tent to sée the order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of hir Campe, she continually did put on hir Armure, and was well guarded with a bande of men, so that of a woman, she cared but onely for the name, and in the facts of Armes she craued the title of valiant. The Captains of hir Armie, neuer gaue battell, or made as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, they neuer skyrmished or did other enterprise of warre, but she was present in hir owne person, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to shewe hir selfe more hardie than any of all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10750:112"/>
the troupe, a thing almost incredible in that weake and feble kynde. The sayde noble Quéene was of stature, bigge and well proporcioned, hir eyes black and quicke, hir forehedde large, hir stomake and breastes fayre &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, hir face white and ruddy, a litle mouth, hir téeth so white, as they semed like a rancke of white pearles, but aboue all things she was of such excellent spirit and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as she was feared for hir stoutnesse, &amp; beloued for hir beautie. And although <hi>Zenobia</hi> was indued with so great beautie, liberalitie, riches, &amp; puissance, yet she was neuer stayned with the blemishe of vnchaste life, or with other banitie: and as hir husband <hi>Odenatus</hi> was wont to say, that after she felt hir selfe with childe, she neuer suffred him to come nere hir, (such was hir great chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) saying that women ought to marie rather for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than for pleasure. She was also excellently well learned in the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> tong. She did neuer eate but one meale a day. Hir talke was verie litle and rare. The meate which she vsed for hir repaste, was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hanch of a wilde Bore, or else the syde of a déere. She could drinke no wine, nor abyde the scent thereof. But she was so curious in good and perfect waters, as she would gyue so great a price for that, as is ordinarilie gyuen for wyne: bée it neuer so excellent. So sone as the Kings of <hi>Egipte</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the <hi>Greekes,</hi> were aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of the death of Odenatus, they sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Zenobia,</hi> as well to visite and comforte hir, as to bée hir confederats and frendes.

The king perceuing that loue, told his daughter, that she had placed hir mynde in place so straunge, as hée had thought hir wisdome wold haue more warely forséen, and better wayed hir estate &amp; birth, as come of a princely race, and would haue demed such loue, farre vnworthie hir degrée: requiring hir with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly words, to withdraw hir settled mynde &amp; to ioyne with him in choise of husbande, for that he had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worldly heire but hir, and tolde hir howe he meant highly to bestowe hir vpon such a personage, as a moste happie life she should leade, so long as the destenies were disposed to weaue the webbe of hir predestined life: And therefore was resolued to espouse hir vnto that noble Gentleman <hi>Philon.

Then the Kyng, by the aduise of his Counsell, was persuaded, that by force of hys proclamation, his daughter should be giuen to <hi>Acharisto</hi> in mariage, and his Kingdome for a dowrie, bicause hée had offered his owne head, accordyng to the effecte of the same.

Howe thinke you faire Ladies, was not thys a faire rewarde for the loue, the trauailes and sorrowes susteined for this ingrate and villainous man, by that royal ladie, to saue his life, and to take him to husband?

This King by louing hir whome he neuer saw, fared like the man that in his sléepe dreamed that hée had in holde, the thing furthest from him. For the King neuer saw hir, before he heard hir praised, and when he hearde hir praised, for purpose to winne hir, he trauailed out of his way, so sure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy hir, as if he had neuer séene hir.

And as it chaunced, vpon a day greate talke was had in the court of King <hi>Philip</hi> surnamed <hi>Luscus,</hi> (bicause he was poreblinde) who likewise was making
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10750:127"/>
preparation to depart out of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in the sayd iorney. Reporte was made by a Knight whiche knewe the sayd Marquize, that in all the worlde there was not the like maried couple, as the Marquize and his wyfe were, as well bicause the Marquize had the fame to bée an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gentleman, as also for that his wyfe amonges all the troupe of Ladies, that liued in the world that time, was the fairest and most vertuous: which words so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the French Kings head, as sodainely (neuer séeing hir in all his life) he began to loue hir. And for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose determined to imbarke him selfe at <hi>Genoua,</hi> that by trauailing that way by lande, he might haue good occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to sée the Marchionisse, thinking that hir husbande being absent, he might easily obtein that he desired. And as he had deuised, he began his enterprise: who sending al his power before, toke his iorney with a meane train of Gentlemen: and being within a days iourney of the Ladies house, he sente hir worde that the next daye hée would visite hir at dinner. The sage and discrete Ladie ioyfully answered the Messanger, that she would acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt his comming for a greate and singular pleasure, &amp; sayde that his grace shuld be most heartily welcom. Afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des she maruelled why such a King as he was, would in hir husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds absence, come to hir house. And in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maruel &amp; consideration she was no whit deceiued, coniecturyng that, the fame of hir beautie was the cause of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Neuerthelesse, like a wise Lady and honest Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, she determined to do him honor, &amp; caused the worshipful of hir countrey such as remained behinde, to be asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, for aduise in all things that were necessarie for his intertainement: but the feast &amp; varietie of meats that should be serued, she alone toke vpon hir to dispose and order. Wherfore spedily sending about, and making prouision for al the hennes that might be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the countrey, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded hir cookes, of those hennes without other thing what so euer, to prepare diuers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices. The Kyng failed not the next day to come accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as he had sent worde, and was with great honor receiued of the lady: and in beholding hir, she semed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him (bisides his imagination comprehended by the former wordes of the Knight) to be farre more faire, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and vertuous, than hée thought, attributing vnto hir, singular praise and commendation. And so much the more his desire was kindled, as she passed the estimation bruted of hir. And after that the King had withdrawen him selfe into the chamber ordeined and made ready for him, as appertained to a Prince so greate, &amp; that dinner time was come, the Kyng &amp; Madame the Marchionisse sat together at one boorde, and other according to their degrées were placed at seueral tables. The King serued with many dishes and excellent wines, beholding some times the ladie Marchionisse, conceiued greate delight and pleasure. But viewing the seruice and meates (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though dressed in diuers sortes) to be but hennes, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wonder, specially knowing the soile wherin they were to be so rich &amp; plentiful, as by litle trauaile, great abundance of foule &amp; veneson might haue ben prouided, and thought that she had indifferent leisure to chase and hunt, after that he had sent hir word of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he woulde not take occasion to enter into talke of those wants of better chere (hir hennes only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) who looking vpon hir, with mery countenance he said vnto hir:<q> Madame wer al these hennes bred in this countrey without a cock?</q> The Marchionisse which full wel vnderstode the cause of his demaund, thinking that God had sent hir an apt time for answere as she desired, boldly answered the King:<q> No and it please your grace, but of women, albeit in honour and apparell there is

The Gentlewoman sayd: I will doe what I can for fulfilling of my promise. And albeit in end that I shal be constrained to doe otherwise, be assured that I will obey you in the charge which now you haue giuen me: I humbly thanke almightye God, for that he neuer brought vs into these termes before this tyme.

               <p>He receiuing the ring, got vp vpon his horsse, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue, went on his voyage, and arriued at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoua,</hi> he shipped him selfe in a Galley, and toke his way, whereunto winde and weather so fauoured, as within fewe dayes he landed at <hi>Acres,</hi> and ioyned with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of the Christians: wherein began a great morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and Plague, during which infection (what so euer was the cause) eyther by the industrie or fortune of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine,</hi> the rest of the Christians that escaped were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most taken and surprised by hym, without any fighte or blowe stricken.

Now there was in the camp of the Christians the day wherein they were taken by <hi>Saladine,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Prouince,</hi> which died and was buried, called master <hi>Thorello de Dignes,</hi> a man of great estimation: wherby (master <hi>Thorello</hi> of Istria, knowne throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole army for his nobility and prowesse) euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that heard tell that master <hi>Thorello</hi> was dead, beleued that it was master <hi>Thorello de Istria,</hi> and not he de <hi>Dignes,</hi> &amp; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his taking, the truth whether of them was deade, was vnknown.

Which thing after she had many times refused, in very great anguishe and dolor, finally being constrained thereunto, she must néedes folow the mindes of hir parents. But yet vpon condition, that the nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als shold not be celebrate vntill such time as she had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed hir promise made to master <hi>Thorello.</hi> Whilest the affaires of this Gentlewoman were in those termes at <hi>Pauie</hi> and the time of hir appoyntment within eight dayes approched, it chaunced that master <hi>Thorello</hi> vpon a day espied a man in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (which he had séene before, in the company of the Ambassadors of <hi>Genoua,</hi>) going into the galley that was bound with them to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua:</hi> wherefore causing him to be called, he demaunded what voyage they had made, and asked him when they arriued at <hi>Genoua?</hi> To whome he sayd: Syr the Galley made a: very ill voyage as I heard say in <hi>Creta,</hi> where I remained behinde them, for being néere the coast of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia,</hi> there arose a maruellous tempest, which droue the galley vpon the shoare of <hi>Barbarie,</hi> and not one of them within borde escaped, amongs whome two of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were likewise drowned.

Whereunto the Necromancer answered, that it should be done, but that it behoued for the better doing thereof, that he should be cast into a sléepe.

               <p>Master <hi>Thorello</hi> opened his eyes, and plainely knew by looking round about him, that he was in the place where he demaunded to be of <hi>Saladine</hi> whereof he was very gladde, and rising vp, and viewing particularlye, what he had about him, albeit he knew before the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of <hi>Saladine,</hi> now he thought it greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstoode the same, than before.

Then he tooke hym by the hand, and sayd vnto him as foloweth.</p>

For the mariage, and all the preparation necessary for the feast, is ready.</q> Master <hi>Thorello</hi> rising out of the rich bed, and reioysing with the Abbot &amp; all his Monks, prayed euery of them not to speake one word of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home, vntill he had done what he was disposed.</p>
               <p>Afterwards placing all his rich Iewels in suretie and sauegard, he discoursed vnto his vncle what had chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vnto him, till that time.

And therefore, albeit that the religious doe not vse to repaire to such feasses, yet I pray you for my sake take paine to goe thither.</q> The Abbot answered that he wold willingly doe so. And so soone as it was day, he sent woord to the bridegrome, that he, and a frend of his, wold be at the mariage: wherunto the gentleman answered that he was very glad thereof. When dinner time was come, master <hi>Thorello</hi> in the habite and apparel wherin he was, went with the Lord Abbot to the wedding din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where euery of them that saw him, did maruellously beholde him, but no man knew him, bicause the Abbot answered them that inquired, that he was a Sarazene, sent Ambassador from the Souldan to the French king. Master <hi>Thorello</hi> was then placed at a table which was right ouer against his wife, whome he beheld with great

pleasure and delight, and perceiued very wel by hir face that she was not well content with that mariage. She likewise beheld him sometimes, not for any knowledge she had of him, for his great beard and straunge attire: the firme credite and generall opinion also that he was dead, chiefly hindred that.

wold not reiect and giue him ouer, or with scornes and floutes contemne the amorous gentleman: and that long loue might gaine some deserued guerdon, she neuer left him vntill she had preferred him to a Noble office in Spayne.

seruice accustomably celebrated there. Which vse they daily obserued with their Ladies and Gentlewomen, and other Lordes and Gentlemen of the Court. In which Church was made and erected a high place in manner of a Closet gorgeously wrought, and in roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner apparelled of such amplitude as it was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receyue the whole traine and companie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant vpon the Persons of the two Quéenes. Nowe it came to passe that a Gentleman of <hi>Cromona</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie</hi> called <hi>Philippo di Nicuoli,</hi> which in those dayes by reason of the recouerie of the Duchie of <hi>Milane,</hi> by the Frenche, departed <hi>Lombardie,</hi> and went to <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurge,</hi> and was Secretarie to <hi>Signor Andrea Borgo,</hi> bicause hée was well learned, and coulde wryte very faire, and therewithall a proper and very handsome man. This yong Gentleman very much frequenting the Church, and séeing the beautie of Quéene Anne to excell all the reast of the Ladies, adorned and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Princely behauioure and Quéene like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, not foreséeing (when he beheld hir) the nature of loue which once being possessed, neuer leaueth the pacient till it hath infebled his state, like the qualitie of poyson, distilling through the vaines, euen to the heart. Which louing venim this Gentleman did drinke with the lookes of his eyes, to satisfy and content his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired minde by viewing and intentife considering hir wonderfull beautie, that rapt beyonde measure, he was miserably intangled wyth the snares of blinde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull loue, wherewith he was so cruelly inflamed, that hée was like to sorte out of the boundes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and wytte.

I thought moreouer it to be very vnséemely for me to direct my minde vpon a wight so honorable, and of so great estate. But who can raine the bridle, or prescribe lawes to loue? What is he that in loue hath frée will and choyse? Truely I beleue no man, bicause loue the more it doth séeme to accord in pleasure and delight, the further from the marke he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his bolte, hauing no respect to degrée or state. Haue not many excellent and worthy personages, yea Dukes, Emperours and Kings, bene inflamed wyth the loue of Ladies, and women of base and vile degrée? Haue not most honorable dames, and women of greatest renoume despised the honor of their states, abandoned the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and neglected the loue of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the ardent loue that they haue borne to men of inferiour sort? All Histories be full of examples of that purpose. The memories of our auncestors be yet in fresh remembraunce, whereof if they were ignorant vnto you that be of great experience, I could adnouche assured te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. Yet thus much I say vnto you, that it séeme no new thing for a man to be ouercome by his owne affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is not the Nobilitie of hir state, or for that she is a Quéene, it is not the consideration of one parte or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that moued me first hereunto. But loue it is, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10750:159"/>
is of greater force than we our selues be of, which many tymes maketh that to séeme lawfull, which altogether is tymes, and by subduing reason maketh the great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate and lorde tributarie to his wil &amp; pleasure, whose force is farre greater than the lawes of Nature.

Yea and if it were not for feare of eternall damnation, and the losse of my poore afflicted soule (which God forbid) mine owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before this time had ended my desires. I am therfore determined (sith that I can attaine to no successe of loue, and that god doth suffer me to be inspired with that most honourable and curteous Ladie, beyond al order and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) to content my selfe with the sight of those hir faire &amp; glistring eyes, farre excelling y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sparcling glimpse of the Diamonde or Saphire, and to serue loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hir, so long as life doth last within this féeble corps.

trusty friend: I do not deny madame, but of long time you did perceiue my follie and presumption, by addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my minde so high, as to the <hi>Aragon</hi> bloud, and to such a Princesse as you be. And who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beguile the eye of a Louer, specially of hir, whose Paragon for good minde, wisedom &amp; gentlenesse is not? And I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse to you bisides, that I haue most euidently perceiued how certain loue hath lodged in your gracious heart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you bare me greater affection, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you did to any other within the compasse of your familie. But what? Great Ladies hearts be fraught w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> secretes &amp; conceits of other effects, than the minds of simple wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which caused me to hope for none other guerdon of my loyal &amp; faithfull affection, than death, &amp; the same very short, Sith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> litle hope accompanied with great, nay rather extreme passion, is not able to giue sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t force, both to suffer &amp; to stablish my heart with constancie. Now for so much as of your motion, grace, curtesie &amp; libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie the same is offred, &amp; that it pleaseth you to accept me for yours, I hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly beseche you to dispose of me not as husband, but of one which is, &amp; shalbe your seruaunt for euer, &amp; such as is more ready to obey, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. It resteth now Madame, to consider how, &amp; in what wise our affairs are to be directed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> things being in assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, you may so liue without peril and brute of slaunderous tongues, as your good fame &amp; honest port may continue without spot or blemish.</q>

But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pain in the end was greater than the pleasure, and had ben better for them bothe, yea and also for the third, that they had shewed them selues so wyse in the déede, as discrete in keping silence of that which was done. For albeit their mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was secrete, and therby politikely gouerned them selues in their stelthes and robberies of loue, and that <hi>Bologna</hi> more oft held the state of the steward of the house by day, than of Lord of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and by night sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that place, yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, the thing was perceiued which they desired to be closely kept. And as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to till and culture a fertile ground, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same must yelde some frute, euen so the Duchesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many pleasures (being ripe and plentiful) became with child, which at the first astonned the maried cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: neuerthelesse the same so well was prouided for, as the first childbedde was kept secrete, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not that the brute was noised through <hi>Naples,</hi> but that the sound flew further off.

And therfore swelling wyth despite, &amp; rapt with furie to sée themselues so defamed by one of their bloud, they purposed by all meanes whatsoeuer it cost them, to know the lucky louer that had so wel tilled the Duchesse their sisters field. Thus desirous to remoue that shame from before their eyes, and to be reuenged of a wrong so notable, they sent espial round about, and scoutes to <hi>Naples,</hi> to view and spy the behauior &amp; talk of the Duchesse, to settle some certaine iudgement of him, whych stealingly was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their brother in law. The Duchesse Court being in thys trouble, shée dyd continually perceiue in hir house, hir brothers men to mark hir countenance, and to note those that came thither to visite hir, &amp; to whom she vsed greatest familiaritie, bicause it is impossible but that the fire, although it be raked vnder the ashes, must giue some heat. And albeit the two louers vsed eche others companie, without shewing any signe of their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they purposed to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their estate for a time, by yelding truce to their pleasures. Yea, &amp; although <hi>Bologna</hi> was a wise and prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t personage,
<pb facs="tcp:10750:197"/>
fearing to be surprised vpon the fact, or that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the Chamber corrupted with Money, or forced by feare, shold pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce any matter to his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance or disauantage, determined to absent himself from <hi>Naples,</hi> yet not so sodainly but that hee made the Duchesse his faithfull Ladie &amp; companion priuie of his intent. And as they were secretely in their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, hee vsed these or such like woords: <q>Madame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the right good intent and vnstained conscience, is free from fault, yet the iudgement of men hath further relation to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exterior apparance, than to vertues force and innocencie it self, as ignorant of the secrets of the thought: and so in things that be wel done, we must of necessitie fall into the sentence of those, whom beastly affection rauisheth more, than ruled reason. You sée the solempne watch and garde which the seruaunts of the Lords your brothers do within your house, &amp; the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion which they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by reason of your seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d childbed, &amp; by what meanes they labor truely to know how your affaires procéede, and things do passe. I feare not death where your seruice may be aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, but if herein the maiden of your cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber be not secrete, if she be corrupted, and if she kepe not close that which she ought to do, it is not ignorant to you that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> losse of my life, and shall die suspected to be a whoremonger &amp; varlet, euen I, (I say) shall incurre that perill, which am your true and lawfull husband. Thys separation chaunceth not by Iustice or desert, sith the cause is too righteous for vs: but rather your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will procure my death, when I shall thinke the same in greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. If I had to do but with one or two, I wold not change the place, ne march one step from <hi>Naples,</hi> but be assured, that a great band, and the same wel armed will set vpon me. I pray you madame suffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

for a time, for I am assured that when I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they will neuer soile their hands, or imbrue their, sweards in your bloud. If I doubted any thing at al of, perill touching your owne person, I had rather a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hundred times die in your companie, than liue to sée you no more. But out of doubt I am, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the things were discouered, &amp; they knew you to be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with childe by me, you should be safe, where I shold sustaine the penaunce of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fact, committed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out fault or sinne.

But I meane not to doe or conclude any thing without your aduise. And if this intent doe not like you, giue me councell Madame, what I were best to doe, that both in life and death you may knowe your faithfull seruaunt and louing husband is ready to obey and please you.</q>

               <p>This good Ladie hearing hir husbands discourse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what to doe, wept bitterly, as wel for grief to lose his presence, as for that she felt hir self with child the third time. The sighes and teares, the sobbes and heauie lookes, which she threwe forth vpon hir sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husband, gaue sufficient witnesse of hir paine and grief. And if none had heard hir, I thinke hir playntes woulde haue well expressed hir inwarde smarte of minde. But like a wise Ladie, séeing the alleaged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of hir husband, licensed him, although against hir minde, not without vtterance of these few words, before hée went out of hir Chamber: <q>Deare husband, if I were so well assured of the affection of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as I am of my maides fidelitie, I would entreat
<pb facs="tcp:10750:198"/>
you not to leaue me alone: specially in the case I am, being with childe. But knowing that to be iust &amp; true which you haue sayd, I am content to force my wil for a certaine time, that hereafter we may liue at rest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ioyning our selues in the companie of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and familie, voide of those troubles, which great Courts ordinarily beare within the compasse of their Palaces. Of one thing I must intreat you, that so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you can by trustie messenger, you send me woord &amp; intelligence of your health and state, bicause the same shal bryng vnto me greater pleasure &amp; contentation, than the welfare of mine owne: and bicause also, vpon such occurrentes as shall chaunce, I may prouyde for mine owne affaires, the suretie of my self, and of our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</q> In saying so, she embraced him very amorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he kissed hir wyth so great sorrow and grief of heart, as the soule thought in that extasie out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take hir flight, sorowful beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mesure so to leue hir whome he loued, for the great curtesies and honor which he had receiued at hir hands. In the end, fearing that the <hi>Aragon</hi> espials wold come and perceiue them in those priuities, <hi>Bologna</hi> tooke his leaue, and bad hys Ladie and spouse Farewell.</p>
               <p>And thus was the second Acte of this Tragicall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, to sée a fugitife husband secretely to mary, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hir, vpon whom he ought not so much as to loke but with feare and reuerence. Beholde here (O ye foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish louers) a Glasse of your lightnesse, and ye women, the course of your fonde behauior. It behoueth not the wise sodainly to execute their first motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and desires of their heart, for so much as they may be assured that pleasure is pursued so neare with a repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce so sharp to be suffred, and hard to be digested, as their voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ausnesse shall vtterly discontent them. True it is, that

mariages be done in Heauen, and performed in earth, but that saying may not be applied to fooles, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne themselues by carnall desires, whose scope is but pleasure, &amp; the reward many times equal to their follie. Shall I be of opinion that a housholde seruaunt ought to sollicite, nay rather suborne the daughter of his Lord without punishment, or that a vile and abiect person dare to mount vpon a Princes bed? No no, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie requireth order in all, and eche wight ought to be matched according to their qualitie, without making a pastime of it to couer our follies, &amp; know not of what force loue and desteny be, except the same be resisted. A goodly thing it is to loue, but where reason loseth his place, loue is without his effect, and the sequele rage &amp; madnesse. Leaue we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> discourse of those which beleue that they be constrained to folowe the force of their minde, and may easily subdue themselues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of vertue and honesty, like one that thrusteth his head into a sack, and thinks he can not get out, such people do please themselues in their losse, and think all well that is noisom to their health, daily folowing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Whiles this Loue continued in all pleasure and like contentation of either parts: Fortune that was ready to mounte the stage, and shew in sight that hir mobilitie was no more stable than a womans will: (For vnder such habite and sere Painters and Poets describe hir) made <hi>Ardizzino</hi> suspecte what desire she had of chaunge: and within a while after, sawe himself so farre misliked of his Ladie, as though he had neuer bene acquainted. The cause of that recoile was, for that the Countesse was not contented with one kinde of fare, and whose eyes were more gredie than hir stomake able to digest, and aboue all desired chaunge, not séeking meanes to finde him that was worthy to be beloued and intertained of so great a Ladie, as she estéemed hir selfe to be, and as such women of their owne opinion thinke themselues, who counterfaicte more grauitie and reputation than they doe, whome nature and vertue for their maiestie and holinesse of life make Noble and praise worthie. That desire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued hir nothing at all: for a certaine time after that <hi>Ardizzino</hi> possessed the forte of this faire Countesse, there came to <hi>Pauia,</hi> one <hi>Roberto Sanseuerino</hi> Earle of <hi>Gaiazzo,</hi> a yong faire and valiant Gentleman, whose Countrey lieth on this side the Mountaines, and very familiar with the Earle of <hi>Massino.</hi>

And therfore so gentlely as she could, gaue ouer hir <hi>Ardizzino,</hi> with whome she vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refused to speake, and shunned his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie when she saw him, and by shutting the gates against him, the Noble man was not able to forbeare from throwing forth some words of choler, wherby she tooke occasion both to expell him, and also to beare him such displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as then she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired his death, as afterwards you shall perceiue. This great hatred was the cause that she being fallen in Loue as you haue heard with the Counte of <hi>Gaiazzo,</hi> shewed vnto him all signe of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and séeing that hée made no great sute vnto hir, she wrote vnto him in this manner.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10750:233"/>
endureth no longer, than they sucke from their pursses and bodies any profit or pleasure. And bicause almost euery day semblable examples be séene, I will leaue of this discourse, to take mée to a matter, not farre more pleasant than this, although founded vpon better grounde, and stablished vpon loue, the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set of lawfull mariage, the successe wherof, chaunced to murderous end, and yet the same intended by ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the beloued: As you shall be iudge by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of reding of the historie ensuing. Beare with me good Ladies (for of you alone I craue this pardon) for introducing the whoorish life of this Countesse, and hir bloodie enterprise: bicause I know right well, that recitall of murders and bloodie facts werieth the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of those that loue to liue at rest, and wish for faire weather after the troublesome stormes of ragyng seas, no lesse than the pilote and wise Mariner, hauing long time endured and cut the perillous straicts of the Ocean sea. And albeit the corruption of our nature be so great, as folies delite vs more than ernest matters full of reason and wisedome, yet I thinke not that our mindes be so peruerted and diuided from frouthe, but sometimes we care and séeke to speake more grauely than the countrey Hynde, or more sobrely than they, whose liues do beare the marke of infamie, and be to euery wight notorious for the only name of their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Suffiseth vs that an historie, bée it neuer so full of sporte and pleasure, do bring with it instruction of our lyfe, and amendement of our maners. And wée ought not to be so curious or scrupulous, to reiect mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and pleasaunt deuises that be voide of harmefull talke, or without such glée as may hinder the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of youth procliue and redie to choose that is naught and corrupte. The very bookes of holy Scriptures do

describe vnto vs persons that be vicious &amp; so detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as nothyng more, whose factes vnto the symple may séeme vnséemely, vpon the leaste recitall of the same. And shal we therfore reiect the reading, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue those holy bookes? God forbid, but with diligence to beware, that we do not resemble those that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred there for example, for somuch as spéedily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinne, ensueth grieuous and as sodaine punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

For bisides that <hi>Thibault</hi> was the chief of his companie, he was also borne of one of the Noblest houses within the Citie, which caused the potestate to assemble his Soldiers with diligence for the apprehension and imprisonment of <hi>Rhomeo,</hi> who séeing yl fortune at hand, in secrete wise conueyed him self to Frier <hi>Laurence,</hi> at the Friers <hi>Franciscanes.</hi> And the Frier vnderstanding of his <unclear>facte</unclear>, kept him in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine secrete place of his Couent, vntil Fortune did otherwise prouide for his safe going abrode.

Moreouer when he was founde lying vpon the ground, he had neither ladder nor weapon, whereupon may be thought that the fact was otherwise done, than hitherto is confessed. And bicause amongs morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is the chiefest and worthy of greatest commendation, and that iustice not righteously exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is iniustice &amp; wrong, it is méete and conuenient for vs in these strange accidents, rather to vse tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce than the rigor of iustice. And that it may appere that I do not speake these words without good ground, mark what I shal say vnto you. These two most mortal eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that which is impossible to be true, for that our Nephew (as is before declared) is a liue, and his wounde was not made by sworde, as hée himself hath confessed. Nowe who can tell or say the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that shame for being taken in their seuerall Chambers, and the dishonesty of bothe their wiues, hathe caused them to despise life, and to desire death? We shall finde if the matter be diligently inquired and searched, that it will fall out otherwise than is already supposed by common opinion. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of examinations, vnlikelihoode of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and the impossibility of the cause, rendreth the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10750:273"/>
matter doubtful. Wherfore it is very néedful dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine these attempts, and thereof to vse more aduised consideration. On the other side, our Nephew accuseth himself to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Under this grasse my Lords as I suppose, some other Serpent lieth hidden, that is not yet thought of. The Gentleman ye know before this time was neuer defamed of such outrage, ne suspected of the least offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se that may be obiected. Besides that, all ye doe knowe, (thanks therefore be giuen to almightie God) that he is a man of great richesse and possessions, and hath no néede to robbe. For what necessitie should driue him to robbe a widowe, that hath of his owne liberally to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow vpon the succour of widowes? Were there none else of substance in the Citie for him to giue attempt, but to a widowe a comfortlesse creature, contented with quiet life to liue amongs hir family within the boundes of hir owne house? What if hir richesse, Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and plate be great, hath not Aloisio of his owne to redouble the same? But truely this Robberie was done after some other manner than he hath confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. To vs then my Lords it appertaineth, if it so stande with your pleasures, to make further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie of the same, promising vnto you vppon oure Faith, that we shal imploy our whole diligence in the true examination of this matter, and hope to bring the same to such good ende, as none shall haue cause to blame vs, the finall sentence whereof shall be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to your iudgement.</q> This graue request and wise talke of the Duke pleased greatly the Lords of the Councel, who referred not only the examination, but also the finall sentence vnto him.</p>

For which tender affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold I shew my self vnkind

And to be plaine with your honors, he is more deare &amp; acceptable vnto me, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> balles of mine owne eyes, being the derest things that appertaine to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> furniture of the body of man, without which no earthly thing can be gladsom and ioyfull to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sense and féeling. Last of all, his amorous and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate demonstration of his loue towards me, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him self to be careful of mine honor, rather more willing to bestow his owne, than to suffer the same to be touched with the left suspicion of dishonestie, I can not choose, but so faithfully imbrace, as I am readie to guage my life for his sake, rather than his finger shold ake for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> offense. And where hath there ben euer fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such liberalitie in any louer? What is he that hath ben euer so prodigall, to employ his life, the moste speciall pledge in this worlde, rather than he would suffer his beloued to incurre dishonoure?

opinion of me, or the least thing of the worlde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might ingendre infamie &amp; slaunder. And therefore not able to cal back the words he had spoken of the fal, nor by any meanes could coloure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, he thought to saue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good name of another by his own hurt. If he then thus redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; liberally hath protruded his life to manifest da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for my benefit &amp; sauegard, preferring min honor aboue the care of himself, shall not I abandon all that I haue, yea &amp; therwithall hazard mine honor for his saluation?

For if he shold die, truly my life could not endure: if he were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of life, what plesure should I haue to liue in this world after him? wherby (most honorable &amp; righteous iudge,) I beleue before the honest, not to lose any one iote of mine honor, bicause I being (as you may sée) &amp; yong woman &amp; a widow desirous to mary againe, it is lawful for me to loue and to be beloued for none other intent (whereof God is the only iudge) but to attaine a husband according to my degrée. But if I should lose my reputation and honor, why should not I aduenture the same for him, that hath not spared his owne for my sake? Nowe to come to the effect of the matter, I doe say with all duetifull reuerence, that it is an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation altogither false and vntrue, that euer master A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loisio came to my house as a Théefe against my will.

For what nede he to be a thefe, or what would he doe with my goodes, that is a lorde and owner of. xx. times so muche as I haue? Alas good Gentleman, I dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and guage my life, that he neuer thoughte, much lesse dyd any robberie or thing vnlawfull, wherewith iustly he may be charged. But he repaired to my house with my consent, as a louing and affectionate louer, the circumstance whereof, if it be duely marked, must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the same to be of trouthe infallible. For if I had not giuen him licence to come, how was it possible for him to conuey his ladder so high, that was made but of ropes, and to fasten the same to the iaume of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, if none within did helpe hym. Againe, how could the window of the chamber be open at that time of the night, which is still kept shut, if it had not bene by my consent.

But as bothe our ill fortune wold haue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could catch any hold of him, to mine inestimable grief and hearts sorrowe he fell downe to the ground.

In this towne there dwelt a Gentlewoman a widowe called <hi>Zilia,</hi> beautifull amongs the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faire Gentlewomen of the countrey, which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (besides the other happie &amp; heuenly influences) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be specially fauoured, for hauing the most fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and curteous Gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aboue any other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of <hi>Europa.</hi> Notwithstanding this faire <hi>Zilia,</hi> degenerating fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature of hir climate, was so haggarde and cruell, as it might haue ben thoughte. she had bene rather nourished and brought vp amidde the most desert mountains of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> than in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and rich champayn countrey, watered and moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Eridanus,</hi> the father of riuers, at this day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Pau,</hi> the largenesse whereof doth make men to maruel, and the fertilitie allureth euery man to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to inhabite vpon the same. This faire rebellious widow, albeit that she was not aboue. xxiiij. or. xxv. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of age, yet protested neuer more to be subiecte to man, by mariage, or otherwise, thinking hir self wel able to liue in single life: A minde truly very holy and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable, if the pricks of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flesh do obey the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and adhortations of the spirite, but where youth, pleasure, and multitude of suters do addresse their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour against that chastitie (lightly enterprised) the Apostles counsell ought to be followed, who willeth yong widowes to marie in Christ, to auoide the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the flesh, and to flée offensiue slaunder and dishonor before men. Now mistresse <hi>Zilia</hi> (hir husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being dead) only bent hir selfe to enrich hir house, and to amplifie the possession of a litle infant which she had by hir late departed husbande. After whose death she became so couetous, as hauing remoued, and almoste cut off quite the wonted port she vsed in hir husbandes
<pb facs="tcp:10750:285"/>
dayes, imployed hir maids in houshold affairs, thinking nothing to be well done y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> passed not through hir owne handes. A thing truely more praise worthy, than to sée a sorte of effeminate, fine, and daintie fingred dames, which thinke their honor diminished if they holde but their nose ouer their housholde matters, where theyr hande and diligence were more requisite, for so much as the mistresse of the house is not placed the chiefe to heare only the reasons of them that labor, but therunto to put hir hands, for hir present eye séemeth to giue a certaine perfection to the worke which the seruauntes do by hir commaundement. Which caused the historians in times past, to describe vnto the posterity a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman called <hi>Lucretia,</hi> not babbling amongs yong folish girles, or running to feastes and Maigames, or Masking in the night, without any regard of the honor and dignitie of hir race and house, but in hir Chamber sowing, spinning, and carding, amids the troupe of hir maiden seruants: wherin our mistresse <hi>Zilia</hi> passed the most parte of hir time, spending no minute of the day, without some honest exercise, which she did for that she liked not to be séen at feasts and bankets, or to be gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp and downe the streats, wandring to gardeins or places of pleasure, although to suche places youth sometimes may haue honest repaire to refreshe their wearied bodies with some vertuous recreation, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reioyce the heauinesse of the minde. But this Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlewoman was so seuere in following the rigorous and constrained maners of our auncients, that impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it was, to sée hir abrode, except it were when she went to Mattens or other deuine seruice. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman séemed to haue studied the diuinitie of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> which paint <hi>Venus</hi> holding a key before hir mouth, &amp; setting hir foote vpon a <hi>Tortus,</hi> signifying vnto

Moreouer <hi>Zilia</hi> was so religious (I wil not say superstitious) and rigorous to obserue customs, as she made it very squei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish and straunge to kisse Gentlemen that met hir, a ciuilitie which of long time hath bene obserued, and yet remaineth in the most part of the world, that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen doe welcome straungers and guestes into their houses with an honest and chaste kisse. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the institution and profession of this widow had wiped away and deferred this poynt of hir youthe: whither it were for that she estéemed hir self so faire, as all men were vnworthy to touche the vtter partes of so rare and precious a vessell, or that hir great and inimitable chastitie made hir so strange, to refuse that which hir duetie and honor would haue permitted hir to graunt. There chaunced about this time that a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Countrey called Sir <hi>Philiberto</hi> of <hi>Virle,</hi> estéemed to be one of the most valiant Gentlemen in those partes, repaired vpon an holy day to <hi>Montcall,</hi> (whose house was not very farre off the Towne) and being at diuine seruice, in place of occupying his sense and minde in heauenly things, and attending the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woords of a Preacher, which that day declared the woorde of God vnto the people, hée gaue himselfe to contemplate the excellent beautie of <hi>Zilia,</hi> who hadde put off for a while hir mourning vaile, that she might the better beholde the good father that preached, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a little aire, bicause the day was extreame hotte. The Gentleman at the first blushe, when hée sawe
<pb facs="tcp:10750:286"/>
that swéete temptation before his eyes, thought hym selfe rapt aboue the third heauen, and not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his looke, he fed hymselfe with the venome which by litle and litle, so seased vpon the soundest partes of his minde, as afterwards béeing liuely rooted in heart, the Gentleman was in daunger still to remaine there for a guage, without any hope of ease or comforte, as more amply this folowyng discourse, shall giue you to vnderstande. Thus all the mornyng hée behelde the Gentlewoman, who made no more accompt of them, that with great admiration did beholde hir, than they themselues did of their life, by committing the same to the hands of a woman so cruell. This Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come home to his lodging, enquired what faire wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that was, of what calling, and of what behauior, but he heard tell of more truely, than he would of good will haue knowne or desired to haue ben in hir, whom he did presently choose to be the onely mistresse of his moste secrete thoughts. Now vnderstanding wel the stubburne nature and vnciuile maner of that widow, hée coulde not tell what parte to take, nor to what Sainct to vow his deuotion, to make sute vnto hir he thought it time lost, to be hir seruant, it was not in his power, hauing already inguaged his libertie into the handes of hir, which once holdyng captiue the hearts of men, will not infraunchise them so soone as thoughte and will desire. Wherefore bayting hymselfe wyth hope, and tickled with loue, hée determined what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, to loue hir, and to assay if by long seruice he coulde lenifie that harde hearte, and make tender that unpliant will, to haue pitie vpon the paine which she saw him to endure, &amp; to recompense his laborsome trauels, which he thought were vertuously imployed for gayning of hir good grace. And vpon this settled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10750:286"/>
he retired againe to <hi>Virle</hi> (so was his house named) where disposing his things in order, he retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to <hi>Montcall</hi> to make his long resiance there, to put in readinesse his furniture, and to welde his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie with suche industrie, as in the ende he mighte make a reasonable breach to force and take the place: For surprisyng whereof, he hazarded great dangers, the rather, that he hym selfe might first be taken. And where hys assaultes and pollicies could not preuaile, he mynded to content him selfe with the pleasure and passetyme that hée myght receiue in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a thyng so fayre, and the ordinarie sight of an image so excellent. The memorie of whome rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased hys paine than yelded comfort, dyd rather mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister corrosiue poyson, than gyue remedie of ease, a cause more of cruel and sodaine death, than of prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged life. <hi>Philiberto</hi> then being become a citizen of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tcall,</hi> vsed to frequent the Churche more than hée was wont to doe, or his deuotion serued hym, and that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not able elsewhere to enioy the presence of his Sainct, but in places and temples of deuotion: whiche no doubt was a very holie and woorthie disposition, but yet not méete or requisite to obserue suche holy places for those intentes, whiche oughte not to be prophaned in thyngs so fonde and foolishe, and actes so contrary to the institution and mynde of those, which in tymes paste were the fyrst founders and erectours of temples. <hi>Signior Philiberto</hi> then moued with that religious superstition, made no conscience at all to speake vnto hir within the Churche. And true it is, when she wente out of the same, he (moued with a certaine familiar curtesie, naturall to eche Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good bryngyng vp) many tymes conducted hir home to hir owne house, not able for all that (what so

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I determined to set a good face vpon the matter, and to make so much of our painted sheath as I could. In déede I confesse my self to be a woman, and you men do say that womens hearts be faint I féeble: but to be plaine with you, the contrary is in me, my heart is so stoute and ambitious, as paraduenture not méete and consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to power and abilitie, although we women will finde no lacke if our hearts haue pith and strength inough to beare it out.

And it must néedes rise and redounde to your gaine and preferment, for that I heare you say the Kings maiestie doeth alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye knowe you.

To be short, there was nothing that so much molested the Knight, as the doubt he had of his wife, for that she was a very fine and faire yong Gentlewoman: And therefore he still deuised and imagined what assurance be might finde of hir behauior in his absence. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in this imagination, not long after it came to passe that the Knight being in company of diuers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and talking of sundry matters, a tale was told what chaunced to a gentleman of the Countrey which had obtained the fauoure and good will of a woman, by meanes of an olde man called <hi>Pollacco,</hi> which had the name to be a famous enchaunter and Physitian, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Cutiano</hi> a Citie of <hi>Boeme,</hi> where plenty of siluer Mines and other mettals is.

And discoursing vpon diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Lady shewed hir self a pleasant and familiar Gentlewoman, which made the Baron to thinke that in short time he shold win the price for which he came. Notwithstanding, at the first brunt he would not by any meanes descend to any particularitie of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but his words ran general, which were, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tel of the fame of hir beautie, good grace and come, linesse, by hauing occasion to repaire into <hi>Boeme</hi> to doe certaine his affaires, he thought it labor well spent to ride some portion of his iourney, though it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the way, to digresse to doe reuerence vnto hir, whome fame aduaunced aboue the skies: and thus pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his first visitation, he returned againe to his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. The Ladie when the Baron was gone from hir Castle, was rapte into a rage, greatly offended that those two <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lordes so presumptuously had bended them selues like common Théeues to wander and roue the Countreys, not onely to robbe and spoile hir of hir honoure, but also to bring hir in displeasure of hir husbande, and thereby into the daunger and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of deathe. By reason of which rage (not without cause conceiued) she caused an other Chamber to be made ready, next wal to the other Baron that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come suche a Notable spinster. And vpon the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the Lord <hi>Vladislao,</hi> she receiued him with no lesse good entertainment than before, and when night came, caused him to be lodged in hir owne house in the Chamber prepared as before, where hée slept not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry soundly all that night, through the continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunee of his Ladies beautie.

wherin he was more deceiued than before, for thinking to take the way home to his Castle, wandred still fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from the same.

The Ladie ioyfull to entertaine a Gentleman so excellent and famous, one of hir next neighbors, went forwarde to bid him welcome, which she did with so great curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie as the Knight sayd vnto hir: <q>Madame I thinke that fortune hath done me this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>This song made the company to muse, who commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the trim inuention of the Knight, and aboue al Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neura praised him more than before, &amp; could not so well refraine hir lokes from him, &amp; he with countre change rendring like againe, but that the two widowes their mothers conceiued great héede therof, reioysing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to sée the same, desirous in time to couple them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For at that present they deferred the same, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration they were both very yong. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it had bene better that the same coniunction had bene made, before fortune had turned the whéele of hir vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablenesse. And truely delay and prolongation of time sometimes bringeth such and so great missehaps, that one hundred times men cursse their fortune, and little aduise in foresight of their infortunate chaunces that commonly do come to passe. As it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to these wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, one of them thinking to loose hir sonne by the vaine behauior of the others daughter, who without y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> helpe of God, or care vnto his will, disparaged hir ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and prepared a poyson so daungerous for hir mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers age, that the foode therof prepared the way to the good Ladies graue. Nowe whiles this loue in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner increased, and that desire of these two Louers, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forth ordinarily in fire and flames more violent, <hi>Dom Diego</hi> all chaunged and transformed into a newe man, receiued no delite, but in the sight of his <hi>Gineura.</hi> And she thought that there could be no greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or more to be wished for, than to haue a friend so perfect, and so wel accomplished with all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the ornament and full furniture of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This was the occasion that the yong Knight let
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:10750:336"/>
no wéeke to passe without visiting his mistresse twice or thrice at the least, and she did vnto him the greatest curtesie and best entertainment, that vertue could suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a maiden to doe, who is the diligent treasurer and carefull tutor of hir honor. And this she did by conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hir mother. In like manne, rhonestie doth not permit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chaste maidens should vse long talke, or immoderate spéeche, with the first that be suters vnto them: &amp; much lesse séemely it is for them to be ouer squeimishe nice, with that man which séeketh (by way of marriage) to winne power and title of the body, which in very dede, is or ought to be the moitie of their soule. Such was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> desires of these two Louers, which notwithstanding was impéeched by meanes, as hereafter you shal heare. For during the rebounding ioy of these faire couple of loyall louers, it chaunced that the daughter of a noble man of the Countrey, named <hi>Ferrando de la Serre,</hi> which was faire, comely, wise, and of very good behauior, by kéeping daily company with <hi>Gineura,</hi> fel extréemely in loue with <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> and assayed by all meanes to do him to vnderstand what the puissance was of hir loue, which willingly she meant to bestowe vpon him, if it wold please him to honor hir so much, as to loue hir w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rather possessed of another, had lost with his libertie his wits, and minde to marke the affection of this Gentlewoman of whome he made no accompt. The Maiden neuerthelesse ceased not to loue him, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> al possible wayes to make him hir owne. And knowing how much <hi>Dom Diego</hi> loued Hawking, she bought a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:10750:337"/>
to the good grace of his Mistresse, and to assure hir selfe of his faithfull seruice, and that for hir sake he would kepe the hauk so tenderly as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> balles of his eyes. This Hauk was the cause of the ill fortune that afterwards chaunced to this pore louer. For going many times to sée <hi>Gineura</hi> with the Hauke on his fist, &amp; bearing with him the tokens of the goodnesse of his Hauke, it escaped his mouthe to say, that the same was one of the things that in all the world he loued best. Truely this worde was taken at the first bound contrary to his meaning, wherwith the matter so fell out, as afterwards by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire he was like to lose his life. Certaine dayes after, as in the absence of the Knight, talke rose of his vertue and honest conditions, one prainsing his prowesse &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunce, another his great beautie and curtesy, another passing further, extolling the sincere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:10750:337"/>
true, I am assured that he is extremely enamored with the daughter of <hi>Dom Ferrando de la Serre,</hi> of whome he receiued an Hauke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he loueth aboue all other things. <hi>Gineura</hi> remembring the words which certaine dayes before <hi>Dom Diego</hi> spake touching his Hauke, began to suspect and beleue that which master <hi>Gracian</hi> alleaged, and not able to support the choler, which colde iealosie bred in hir stomake, went into hir Chamber full of so great grief and heauinesse, as she was many times like to kill hir self. In the end, hoping to be reuenged of the wrong which she beleued to receiue of <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to endure hir fortune paciently. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time she conceiued in hir minde a despite and hatred so great and extreame against the pore. Gentleman that thought little héereof, as the former loue was nothing in respect of the reuenge by death, which she then desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon him. Who the next day after his wonted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner came to sée hir, hauing (to his great damage) the Hauke on his fiste, which was the cause of all that iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse. Nowe as the Knight was in talke with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, séeing that his beloued came not at all (according to hir custome) to salute him and bid him welcome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired how she did. One that loued him more than the rest, sayd vnto him: <q>Syr, so soone as she knewe of your comming, immediately she withdrew hir selfe into hir Chamber.</q> He that was wise and well trained vp, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled what he thought, imagining that it was for some little fantasie, whereunto women willingly be subiecte. And therefore when he thought time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, he tooke leaue of the widowe, and as hée was going downe the staires of the great Chamber, he met one of the maides of <hi>Gineura,</hi> whome he prayed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to hir mistresse.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10750:338"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gineura</hi> during all this time toke no rest, deuising how she might cutte of cleane hir loue entertained in <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> after she knew that he caried the Hawke on his fist: which was the only cause that did put hir into that frensie. And therefore thinking hir selfe both despised and mocked of hir Knight, &amp; that he had done it in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite of hir, she entred into so great rage and choler, as she was like to fall mad. She being then in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of minde, behold hir Gentlewoman came vnto hir, and did the Knights message. Who hearing the simple name of hir supposed enimy, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sigh so strangely, as a man wold haue thought hir soule presently wold haue departed hir body. Afterwards when she had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished hir raging fit which stayed hir speach, she gan very tenderly to wéepe, saying: <q>Ah traitor &amp; vnfaithful louer, is this the recompense of the honest and firme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which I haue borne thée, so wickedly to deceiue me vnder the colour of so faint and detestable a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? Ah rashe and arrant Théese, is it I vpon whome thou oughtest to vende thy wicked trumperies? Doste thou thinke that I am no better worthe, but that thou prodigally shouldest wast mine honor to bear y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spoiles thereof to hir, that is in nothing comparable vnto me? Wherin haue I deserued this discurtesie, if not by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thée more than thy beautie &amp; fained loue deserue? Diddest thou dare to aduenture vpon me, hauing thy conscience wounded with suche an abhominable and deadly treason? Durst thou to offer thy mouth to kisse my hand, by the mouth of another, to whome thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest before dedicated thy lying lips in thine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per person? I praise God that it pleased him to let me sée before any other worse chaunce hath happened, the poyson by thée prepared for the ruine of my life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Ha foole, hope not to take me in thy trap, nor yet
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:10750:338"/>
to deceiue me through thy sugred and deceitful words. For I sweare by the almighty God, that so long as I shall liue, I wil accompt thée none other, but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most cruel and mortal enimy that I haue in this world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then to accomplish the rest of hir careful minde, she wrote a letter to giue hir farewell to hir olde friend <hi>Dom Diego.</hi> And for that purpose instructed hir Page with this lesson, that when the Knight should come, he should be ready before hir lodging and say vnto him in the behalfe of hir, that before he passed any further, he should reade the letter, and not to faile to doe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. The Page which was malicious, and ill affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Dom Diego,</hi> knowing the appointed day of his comming, waited for him a quarter of a mile from the Castle, where he had not long taried, but beholde the innocent louer came, against whome the Page went, bearing about him more hurtfull &amp; noisome weapons, than all the Théeues and robbers had in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Catheloigne.</hi> In this manner presenting his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse letters, he sayde vnto him: <q>My Lord, Madame <hi>Gineura</hi> my mistresse hath sent me vnto you, &amp; bicause she knoweth how fearfull you be to displease hir, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you not faile to reade this letter before you passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further, and there withall accomplishe the effecte of the same. The Knight abashed with that sodaine mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, answered the Page: God forbid my friend (quod be) that I shold disobey hir by any meanes, vnto whom I haue giuen a full authoritie and puissance ouer mine affections.</q> So receiuing the letters, he kissed them thre or foure times, and opening them, found that he hoped not for, and red that which he thought not off.

to take in yl part his intreatie and hard imprisonment, for that he durst doe none other, the State of the Citie hauing so enioyned him. May not eche wight now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde how that the euents of loue be diuers from other passions of minde? How coulde <hi>Salimbene haue</hi> so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably deliuered <hi>Montanine,</hi> the hatred beyng so long time rooted betwéene the two houses, if some greate occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hath no name in Loue, had not altred his nature, and extinguished his affection? It is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to succour them whome we neuer saw before, sith nature moueth vs to doe well to them that be like our selues. But faith surmounteth there, where the very naturall inclination féeleth it selfe constrained, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that to be broken, which obstinately was purposed to be kept in minde. The graces, gentlenesse, beautie, mild behauior and allurement of <hi>Angelica,</hi> had greater force ouer <hi>Salimbene,</hi> than the humilitie of hir brother, although hée had knéeled a hundred times before hym. But what heart is so brute, but may be made tractable and mylde, by the contemplation of a thing so rare, as the excellent beautie of that <hi>Siena</hi> maiden, and woulde not humble it selse to acquire the good graces of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a damsel? I wil neuer accuse man for being in loue with a faire and vertuous woman, nor estéeme hym a slaue, which painefully serueth a sobre maiden, whose heart is fraught with honest affections, and mind with desire tending to good ende.

The Scholler as plainly hée had applied his booke, and earnestly herkned his readings, so he simply meant to be a faithfull louer and deuoute requirant to this ioily dame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had vowed
<pb facs="tcp:10750:391"/>
hir deuotion &amp; promised pilgrimage to an other saint. The scholer vpon the first view of the widowes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring lookes, forgetting <hi>Ouides</hi> lessons of loues guiles, pursued his conceipt to the vttermost. The scholer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remembred how many valiaunt, wise and learned men, wanton wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had seduced and deceiued. He had forgot howe <hi>Catullus</hi> was beguiled by <hi>Lesbia, Tibullus</hi> by <hi>Delia, Propertius</hi> by <hi>Cynthia, Naso</hi> by <hi>Corinna, Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> by <hi>Lamia, Timotheus</hi> by <hi>Phryne, Philippe</hi> by a <hi>Greeke</hi> mayden, <hi>Alexander</hi> by <hi>Thais, Hannibal</hi> by <hi>Campania, Caesar</hi> by <hi>Cleopatra, Pompeius</hi> by <hi>Flora, Pericles</hi> by <hi>Aspa ga, Psammiticus</hi> the king of <hi>Aegipt</hi> by <hi>Rhodope,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other very famous by women of that stampe. He had not ben well trained in holy writ, or heard of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Dalida,</hi> or of <hi>Salamons</hi> concubines, but like a plaine dealing man, beleued what she promised, folowed what she bad him, wayted whiles she mocked him, attended till she laughed him to scorne. And yet for all these ioily pastimes inuented by this widowe, to deceiue the poore Scholer, the scaped not frée from his Logike rules, nor safe from his philosophie. He was forced to turne ouer <hi>Aristotle;</hi> to reuolue his <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and to gather hys wittes about him, to requite this louing peate, that had so charitably delt with him.

The scholler in his shirt bedecked with his demissaries. The widow so naked as hir graundmother Eue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vesture to shroud hir. The widow by magike Arte what so euer it cost, wold faine haue recouered hir lost louer. The Scholler well espying his aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage when he was asked councel, so incharmed hir with his Sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes, as he made hir to mount a tower, to cursse the time that euer she knew him or hir louer. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> widow not well beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in causes of schole, was whipt with the rod, wherwith she scourged other. Alas good woman, had she knowne that olde malice had not bene forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, she would not haue trusted, &amp; lesse committed hir self to the circle of his enchauntments. If women wist what dealings are w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men of great reading, they wold amongs one hundred other, not deale with one of the meanest of those that be bookish.

For he neuer left the pore féeble soule, for all hir curteous woords and gentle sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, vntil the skin of hir flesh was parched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scalding sunne beames. And not contented with that, delt his almose also to hir maide, by sending hir to help hir mistresse, where also she brake hir legge. Yet <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenio</hi> was more pitifull ouer the thrée Nimphes &amp; faire Goddesses of <hi>Bologna,</hi> whose History you may read in the xlix. Nouell of my former Tome. He fared not so roughly with those, as <hi>Rinieri</hi> did with this, that sought but to gain what she had lost. Wel, how so euer it was, and what differencie betwene either of them, this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie ensuing, more amply shall giue to vnderstand.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10750:392"/>
               <p>Not long sithens, there was in <hi>Florence,</hi> a yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of worshipfull parentage, faire and comely of personage, of courage stout, and abounding in goods of fortune (called <hi>Helena,</hi>) who being a Widow, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to mary again, bicause she was in loue with a yong man that was not voide of natures goodly gifts, whom for hir owne toothe, aboue other she had special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen. In whome (setting aside all other care) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times (by meanes of one of hir maids which she tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted best) she had great pleasure and delite. It chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced about the same time that a yong Gentleman of that Citie called <hi>Rinieri,</hi> hauing a great time studied at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> retourned to <hi>Florence,</hi> not to sell his Science by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, as many doe, but to know the reasons of things, and the causes of the same, which is a maruellous good exercise for a Gentleman. And being there honoured &amp; greatly estemed of all men, aswell for his curteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauioure, as also for his knowledge, he liued like a good Citizen. But as it is commonly séene, they which haue best vnderstanding and knowledge in things, are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest tangled in Loue: euen so it happened to this <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri,</hi> who repairing one day for his passetime to a feast, this Madame <hi>Helena</hi> clothed all in blacke, (after the manner of widowes) was there also, and séemed in his eyes so beautiful and wel fauored, as any woman that euer he sawe; and thought that he might be accompted happy, to whome God did she we so much fauoure, as to suffer him to be cleped betwene hir armes: &amp; beholding hir diuers times, and knowing that the greatest and dearest things can not be gotten without laboure, he determined to vse all his endeuoure and care in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of hir, that thereby he might obtaine hir loue, and so enioy hir. The yong Gentlewoman not very bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, conceiuing greater opinion of hir selfe, than was
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:10750:392"/>
néedefull, not casting hir eyes towards the ground, but rolling them artificially on euery side, and by and by perceiuing much gazing to be vpon hir, espied <hi>Rinieri</hi> earnestly beholding hir, and sayd smiling to hir selfe: <q>I thinke that I haue not this day lost my time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, for if I be not deceiued, I shall catch a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon by the nose.</q> And beginning certaine times sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly to loke vpon him, she forced hir selfe so much as she could, to séeme effectuously to beholde him: and on the other parte thinking, that the more pleasant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous she shewed hir self to be, the more hir beautie should be estéemed, chiefly of him whome specially she was disposed to loue. The wise Scholler giuing ouer his Philosophie, bent all his endeuor hereunto, &amp; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be hir seruaunt, learned where she dwelt, and began to passe before hir house vnder pretense of some other occasion: wherat the Gentlewoman reioysed for the causes beforesaide, faining an earnest desire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde him. Wherfore the Scholler hauing found a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meane to be acquainted with hir maide, discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his loue: praying hir to deale so w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hir mistresse, as he might haue hir fauor. The maide promised him very willingly, and incontinently reported the same to hir mistresse, who with the greatest scoffes in the world, gaue eare therunto &amp; sayd: <q>Séest thou not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence this goodfellow is come, to lose al his knowledge &amp; doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath brought vs from <hi>Paris.</hi> Now let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise therefore how he may be handled for going about to séeke that, which he is not like to obtain. Thou shalt say vnto him, when he speaketh to thée againe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I loue him better than he loueth me, but that it behoueth me to saue mine honoure, and to kéepe my good name and estimation amongs other women. Which thing, if he be so wise (as he séemeth) he ought to esteme &amp; regarde.</q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10750:393"/>
Ah poore Wench, she knoweth not well, what it is to mingle huswiuery with learning, or to intermeddle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staues with bokes. Now the maid when she had found the Scholler, told him as hir mistresse had commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scholler was so glad, as he with greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor procéeded in his enterprise, and began to write letters to the Gentlewoman, which were not refused, although he could receiue no answeres y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pleased him, but such as were done ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly. And in this sort the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle woman long time fed him with delayes. In the end she discouered all this newe loue vnto hir friend, who was attached with such an aking disease in his head, as the same was fraught with the reume of ialosie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she to she we hir selfe to be suspected without cause (very careful for the Scholler) se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hir maid to tel him, that she had no conuenient time to doe the thing that shold please him, sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he was first assured of hir loue, but hoped the next Christmasse hollydayes to be at his commaundement: wherefore if he would vouchsafe to rome the night following the first holyday, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of hir house, she wold wait there for his comming. The Scholler the best conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, failed not at the time appointed, to goe to the Gentlewomans house: where being placed by the maid in a base court, and shut fast within the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But the cause is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one of hir brethren is come to visite hir this Euening, and hath made a long discourse of talke vnto hir, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes bad himself to supper, and as yet is not depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but I thinke he wil not tary long, and then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately she will come. In the meane time she prayeth thée to take a litle paine. The scholler beléeuing this to be true, sayd vnto hir: Require your Mistresse to take no care for me till hir leasure may serue: howbeit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat hir to make so much hast as she can.</q> The maid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to bed, and the dame of the house sayd then vnto hir frend? Now sir, what say you to this: <q>Do you thinke that if I loued him as you mistrust, that I would suffer him to tarry beneath in the colde to coole himselfe?</q> And hauing sayd so, she went to bed with hir friend, who then was partly satisfied, and all the night they continued in great pleasure and solace, laughing &amp; mocking the miserable Scholler that walked vp and downe the court to chafe himself, not knowing where to sit, or which way to auoide the colde, and curssed the long tarying of his mistresse brother, hoping at euery noise he heard, that she had come to open the dore to let

And at that instant the maide came thither, who so soone as she was entred the Toure, not able to forbeare hir voice, beating hir handes, she began to cry: <q>Alas swéete mistresse where be you? she hearing the voice of hir maide answered so well as she coulde: Ah (swéete wenche) I am héere aboue, crie no more, but bring me hither my clothes.</q>

The laborer after much talk &amp; request to his mistres, to be of good chéere, when she was risen vp, caried hir down vpon his neck, for that she was not able to goe so farre, as out of the Toure.

The name of the eldest of these thrée Lordes, was <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the second <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the yongest <hi>Conrade,</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle personages, wise and welbeloued so wel of the Noble men their neighbors, as also of the Cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that were vnder their obeysaunce, who in the end shewed greater loyaltie towards them, than those that had sworne their faith, and had giuen pledges for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof, as ye shall perceiue by reading that which foloweth. It chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that the eldest oftentimes repairing from <hi>Foligno</hi> to <hi>Nocera,</hi> and lodging still in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Castell, behelde with a little too much wanton eye, the wife of his lieuetenaunt which was placed there with a good number of dead payes, to guard the forte, &amp; kepe vnder the Citizens, if by chaunce (as it happeneth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the newe erection of estates) they attempted some newe enterprise against their soueraigne Lords. Now this Gentlewoman was faire, and of better grace sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly delighting to be loked vpon: which occasioned the Lord <hi>Nicholas,</hi> by perceiuing the wantonnesse and good will of the mistresse of the Castell, not to refuse so good occasion, determining to prosecute the enioying of hir, that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bird after which he hunted, whose beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and good grace had déepely wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his mind: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if he forgotte his duetie, I leaue for all men of good iudgement to consider. For me thinke that this yong Lord ought rather singularly to loue and cherishe his Lieuetenaunt that faithfully and trustily had kept his Castell and Forte, than to prepare against him so trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous an attempt and ambushe. And if so be his sayde Lieuetenaunt had bene accused of felony, misprision, or Treason (yet to speake the trouth) he might haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the charge of his Castel vnto an other, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suborne his wife to follie. And ought likewise to haue considered that the Lieuetenaunt by putting his
<pb facs="tcp:10750:414"/>
trust in him, had iust cause to complaine for rauishing his honoure from him in the person of his wife, whome be ought to haue loued without any affection to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frindge the holy lawe of amitie, the breaking whereof dissolueth the duetie of eche seruaunt towardes his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord and maister. To be short, this blinded louer yelding no resistance to loue, and the foolish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit which altereth the iudgementes of the wisest, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred his fansie to roue so farre vnto his appetites, as on a day when the Lieuetenaunt was walked abrode into the Castell, to viewe the Souldioures and deade payes (to pleasure him that sought the meanes of his displeasure) he spake to the Gentlewoman his wife in this manner: <q>Gentlewoman, you being wise and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as eche man knoweth, needefull it is not to vse long or Rethorical Orations, for so much as you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further supply of talke doe clearely perceiue by my lookes, sighes and earnest viewes, the loue that I bear you, which without comparison nippeth my heart so neare as none can féele the parching paines, that the same poore portion of me doeth suffer. Wherefore hauing no great leisure to let you further vnderstand my minde, it may please you to shewe me so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure as I may be receiued for him, who hauing the better right of your good grace, may there withall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy that secrete acquaintaunce, which suche a one as I am deserueth: of whome ye shall haue better experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if you please to accept him for your owne.</q> This mistresse Lieuetenaunt which compted hir selfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie to be beloued of hir Lord, and who tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in that aduenture, albeit that she desired to lette him know the good will that she bare vnto him, yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled the matter a little, by answearing him in this

He was the wylde Bore whom he meant to strike, hée was the praie of his vnsaciable and cruell appetite. If the fault had ben generall of all thrée togethers, he had had some reason to make them passe the bracke of one equall fortune, and to tangle them within one net, both to preuent therby (as he thought) his further hurt, and to chastise their leude behauiour.

man durst not once come neare for his corage &amp; stately trappour, with one thing he was abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly refreshed, and that the most néedeful thing which was fire, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was no spare, no more then there was of fishe. But the King which had bene daintely sed, and did not well tast and like that kinde of meat, demaunded if his hunger could not be supplied with a little flesh, for that his stomake was anoyed with the only sauoure of the Eeles. The pore man, (as ye haue somwhat perceiued by the former discourse,) was a plesaunt fellowe, and delighted rather to prouoke laughter, than to prepare more dainty meat, said vnto the King: <q>It is no maruel though our Kings doe furnishe themselues with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, to serue them in their warres, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bringing vp and litle force in fine courtiers. We, albeit the raine doth fal vpon our heads, and the winde assaile euery part of our bodies all durtie and wet, doe not care either for fire or bed, we fede vpon any kinde of meat that is set before vs, without séeking sause for increasing of our appetite: and we (behold) are númble, healthy, lusty, and neuer sicke, nor our mouth out of taste, where ye doe féele suche distemperaunce of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, as pitie it is to sée, &amp; more adoe there is to bring the same into his right order and taste, than to ordaine and dresse a supper for a whole armie.</q> The King who laughed (with displayed throte,) hearing his hoste so merily disposed, could haue bene contented to haue heard him still, had not his appetite prouoked him and the time of the night very late. <q>Wherfore he said vnto him. I doe agrée to what you alleage, but performe I pray thée my request, &amp; then we will satisfie our selues with further talke. Well sir (replied the Kings hoste,) I sée well that a hungry belly hathe no lust to heare a mery song, whereof were you not so egre and sharpe

But I haue a little Kidde which as yet is not weaned, the same wil I cause to be made ready, for I thinke it cannot be better bestowed.</q> The supper by reason of the hostes curtesie, was passed forth in a thousande pleasant passetimes, which the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherman of purpose vttered to recreate his guest, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sawe him to delight in those deuises. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ende of supper, he sayd vnto the King: Now sir, how like you this banket? <q>It is not so sumptuous as those be that be ordinarily made at our Princes court, yet I thinke that you shall sléepe with no lesse appetite than you haue eaten with a good stomacke, as appereth by the few words you haue vttered in the time of your repast. But whervnto booteth it to employ time, or dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for eating, in expense of talke, which serueth not but to passe the time, and to shorten the day? And mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ought rather to be taken for sustentation of nature than for prouocation or motion of this féeble and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie fleshe?
