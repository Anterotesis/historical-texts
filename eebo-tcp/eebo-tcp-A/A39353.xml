         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Even thoſe, who <hi>habitually</hi> love the Lord their <hi>God</hi> with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, when they exert any <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> that is not <hi>Formally,</hi> nor <hi>Virtually</hi> the Love of <hi>God,</hi> they are <hi>Dead,</hi> and they <hi>abide in Death,</hi> 'till they are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd</hi>

by Repentance, 'till the Courſe of their Souls be turn'd by an <hi>Act</hi> of Holy Love. Thus a great Number of thoſe that are truly <hi>Godly,</hi> that live the <hi>Rational, Divine</hi> Life, by reaſon of their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Backſlidings</hi> may ſay of themſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in reſpect of his temporal Calamities, that they are in Death oft. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11, 23.</p>
                  <p>The beſt <hi>Life Rational,</hi> or <hi>Senſitive,</hi> which moſt men Live, as to this preſent World, differs little or nothing more from <hi>Death,</hi> than a <hi>Shadow</hi> from <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> I conceive the Pen-men of the Holy Ghoſt have ſo often compar'd the Life of Man to a Shadow, not only in reſpect of his Vaniſhing, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable Condition, but alſo of that Deficiency of <hi>Light;</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> which All of us in this Mortal Body are Subject unto. But that little Portion of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) which <hi>He that hath the Son is</hi> Partaker of even here upon Earth, is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more worth than the whole World, and as for his <hi>Senſible</hi> Death, or <hi>Diſſatisfactions,</hi> which he ſuffers at preſent, they continually work together for his Good, they are no other than the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> working upon him, to fit, and prepare him for an Eternal Life of Soul and Body in Heaven. This Notion of Life and Death, which I have endeavour'd to Expreſs unto you, we may eaſily Demonſtrate to be moſt ſuitable to the Senſe, and Import of ſeveral Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. <hi>She that liveth in Pleaſure is Dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6. What can be more plain than this, that the Apoſtle attributes <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> in divers Reſpects, to the ſame Perſon, at the ſame Time? and whereto are thoſe Reſpects but to the

What can be meant by the Dead in this place but thoſe that embrace this preſent World, and ſo Deſpiſe the glorious Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Of whom, ſayes St. <hi>John, In Him was Life and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> You know, all <hi>ſinſul Actions</hi> are in the Holy Scriptures call'd <hi>dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

laſting Death. Indeed we are here to underſtand chiefly and principally Everlaſting Death, thoſe horrible <hi>Gnawings of the Worm that ſhall never Dye,</hi> the <hi>Burnings of the Fire that ſhall never be Quenched:</hi> But that All Trouble is <hi>the Wages of Sin,</hi> who can deny that conſiders what he ſayes? In what we have already deliver'd, it is implyed, that <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or a Pure, and Heavenly temper of Mind, is <hi>Life,</hi> which we ſhall ſhew expreſly; and then ſhall proceed by Gods aſſiſtance, to declare unto you what it is to <hi>have the SON.</hi> In teſtimony of this Truth, we ſhall produce but one Text of Scripture, that one being ſo plainly and unqueſtionably A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to what has been ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 6. <hi>To be Carnally Minded is Death, but to be Spiritually Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Life, and Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former words of this Verſe are a further Proof of what we have ſpoken of Death, <hi>To be Carnally Minded is Death;</hi> But, <hi>to be Spiritually Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is Life and Peace.</hi> And what is it to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Minded, but to have our Minds ſet upon GOD, who calls himſelf a SPIRIT, and the <hi>Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> as the <hi>Principal Object</hi> of All our Thoughts and Inclinations? But here it may be Objected, that <hi>Life</hi> is the Reward of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> or <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> the <hi>Wages of Sin:</hi> How then is <hi>Godlineſs Life</hi> it ſelf, and <hi>Sin Death?</hi> To this I Anſwer, Firſt, that whatſoever is properly <hi>Life</hi> of the Body in this preſent World, is Really Diſtinct from <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> and the Great and Good GOD gives unto All the <hi>Godly,</hi> All thoſe that have the SON, ſo much of it, as He in His Infinite Wiſdom ſees them to ſtand in need of for the working out of their

Salvation, for the preparing of their Souls for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And that Glorious Life of the Body, which they that have the SON ſhall have for ever and ever in Heaven, this alſo is Really Diſtinct from <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> of which it is the Reward. But it has indeed a great <hi>Affinity</hi> therewith, or <hi>Conformity</hi> thereunto, which we can have but little Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of at preſent, but ſomewhat of it we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by that Saying of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. <hi>It is rais'd a Spiritual Body.</hi> Here it is moſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Bodies of the Saints after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, ſhall be throughly Affected with the Temper of their <hi>God-like Spirits;</hi> as they are in ſome meaſure even in this preſent World. All theſe ſeveral Acts of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> CHARITY, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Affection, which the <hi>Elect</hi> of GOD perform in this Mortal Body, have the Nature of OBEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE: But that One Continued Act of the moſt Intimate, Full, Perfect Adherence to the ONE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FINITE GOOD, being by the <hi>Free Mercy</hi> of GOD in CHRIST made Abſolutely for ever and ever Uncapable of the leaſt <hi>Defection,</hi> is the REWARD of All the <hi>Godly,</hi> or <hi>Holy</hi> Actions, which are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Gods Elect, whilſt they are in the World. Finally, Theſe Holy Performances are in Divers Reſpects Acts of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi> thereof. In Reſpect of their <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD, they are Acts of <hi>Obedience;</hi> in Reſpect of the Joy, and Satisfaction they impart to the Soul of the <hi>Doer,</hi> they are in a manner their own <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> That <hi>Poet</hi> had a Glympſe of this Truth, who ſay'd <hi>Ipſa quidem Virtus Pretiumſibi,</hi> Virtue's its own Reward. But it ſhines forth moſt Gloriouſly in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29710:7"/>
Holy Scriptures. <hi>David</hi> ſayes Expreſly <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>In keeping of them (viz.</hi> the Judgments, or Juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of GOD) <hi>there is Great Reward.</hi> In the three Precedent Verſes he does moſt Pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth the Great Joy, and Satisfaction they import to the Soules of the <hi>Obedient,</hi> upon which account he ſayes here, In keeping of them there is Great Reward. <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are Right, Rejoycing the Heart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Her wayes</hi> (ſayes <hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 3. 17. 18.) <hi>are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her Pathes are Peace</hi> (this he ſpeaks of the ways of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and what are her wayes but the Wayes of the Commandements of the Onely Wiſe GOD?) <hi>She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold on her, and happy is every one that retaineth her.</hi> We may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the <hi>Service of God,</hi> which is the Life of a True CHRISTIAN, is Perfect Freedome, if we conſider that a <hi>Man's Freedome</hi> is to Do What <hi>He Would Do,</hi> For certainly He onely Does What he <hi>Would,</hi> that is to ſay, He onely Satisfies his <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Intellectual</hi> Appetite, who <hi>Conforms</hi> It to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> which we cannot Doe, unleſs <hi>we have the</hi> SON. <hi>Without Me</hi> (ſayes <hi>the Son</hi> John 15. 5.) <hi>ye can Do nothing.</hi> And John 8. 36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you Free, ye ſhall be Free indeed. He that hath the Son</hi> (ſayes his Beloved Diſciple) <hi>hath Life,</hi> &amp;c. But what is it to have the Son? That we may know what it is as We Ought to Know, Shine upon us O FATHER by the Influences of the HOLY GHOST in the Face of the Son JESUS CHRIST <hi>the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Thy Glory, that in Thy Light we may See Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Have the SON is to <hi>Believe</hi> in Him, which is To have Him Dwelling in Our Hearts by Faith, for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29710:8"/>
ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> phraſes it in his Prayer for the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they might ſyncerely Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That Chriſt ſayes he, may Dwell in your Hearts by Faith.</hi> But, alas, what Stirs, and Petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Controverſies have there been, and are ſtill continued amongſt thoſe, that joyntly Profeſs the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> concerning the Nature of Faith in Chriſt, of the Faith of GODS ELECT! A man can hardly ſay any thing by way of Deſcription of it, but preſently up ſtarts one, or other, with ſome Argument to Diſprove what we ſay. I ſhall do what I can in Declaring my Senſe of it to ſpeak Convincingly, and Unexceptionably, and therfore I ſhall paſs by all ſuch <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> of it, as I have found to have been Controverted, though I do heartily Approve many of them, as Implying the ſame Truth, which I ſhall endeavour to ſet forth in theſe words: The <hi>Faith,</hi> we ſpeak of, <hi>Faith by which the Juſt do Live, Faith that Overcometh the World, Faith that worketh by Love,</hi> is Such an ASSENT to the Truths contained in the Holy Scriptures, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in its Nature the Truſting in God the Father Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth, for Grace and for Glory, through the Merits of the Paſt Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Power, and Virtue of the Preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt His Only Son, Our Lord.</p>
                  <p>By Grace I underſtand <hi>Principally</hi> All thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Holineſs, of Purity of Heart, of Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> which are Attainable here upon Earth, and Secondarily whatſoever the Onely Wiſe God Judges to be the Means of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereunto: By Glory I underſtand the Full Perfect, Eternal Enjoyment of the Holy, Bleſſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29710:8"/>
and Glorious TRINITY, in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. By Truſting in God for Grace, and for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Through the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Inceſſion</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt I underſtand a Syncere <hi>Abſolute</hi> Expectation from God of whatſoever He Knowes to conduce to our Eternal Happineſs, that is, a Perfect CONFORMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY to <hi>Our Bleſſed Redeemer,</hi> both in Body and Soul, Upon the bare Account of His Promiſe to Give us <hi>Freely</hi> whatſoever we ſhall Ask of Him in the Name of His SON, that is to ſay, in a Syncere <hi>Beliefe</hi> that the SON, Being Over All, GOD <hi>Bleſſed for Ever,</hi> did in Time, for Us Sinful Creatures to Reconcile Us to the <hi>Holy Creator</hi> of All Things, Take upon Him the Nature of Man, <hi>Was conceiv'd by the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>ſuffer'd under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was Crucifyed, Dead, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he deſcended into Hell, the third day he roſe again from the dead, he aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence he ſhall come to judge the quick, and the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Syncerity of this Belief conſiſts in a True, and Real Bent, or Intention of the Heart <hi>to Live no longer unto our ſelves, but unto him that Dyed for us, and Roſe again.</hi> But here it may be ſay'd, why do you not mention the Pardon of Our Sins? muſt we not Truſt in God for that alſo? I Anſwer, God's Pardoning of our Sins is implyed in the Giving us his Grace, in making us Partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature, in ſhedding abroad his Love in our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> For they that are <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> they that Love God Above All things, from whence Neceſſarily flowes the Loving of Every Man as themſelves, <hi>They are in Chriſt and</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:29710:9"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt in Them:</hi> And, you know, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſayes <hi>There is no Condemnation to Them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
                  <p>From the Due Conſideration of what has been ſay'd, This moſt Important Truth ſhines forth moſt evidently, That we cannot Do any thing Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, but only in the Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Bleſſed, and Glorious TRINITY: and hence it is that the Frequent Repetition of the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> that moſt Excellent <hi>Doxologie, Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. And the like Frequent Mention of the Name, and Merits of Jeſus Chriſt Our Lord, Hence it is, I ſay, that theſe Excellent Paſſages in Our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which ſome Naughty men have call'd Vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, cannot but be exceeding Pleaſing, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to All Truly Chriſtian Devout Souls. As for thoſe, who are ſtill ſo Mad, as to Diſlike this Truly CATHOLICK <hi>Doxologie,</hi> they are more Fit for our Pity, than our Arguments. And let that <hi>Pity</hi> ever Move us to Pray Our <hi>Almighty, and moſt Merciful Father</hi> to Draw them out of thoſe <hi>Waters of Strife,</hi> thoſe Looſe, Variable, Turbulent Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to Lead them by His Good Spirit in the Pleaſant Wayes of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, my Brethren, Let us ſeriouſly Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our own Hearts, and See whether or no we are <hi>Spiritually</hi> Living or Dead Men. Does the main Stream of our affections Run out not <hi>upon the things that are on the Earth, but the things that are Above, where Jeſus ſitteth on the Right Hand of GOD?</hi> Do we find any <hi>Rational</hi> Contentment, and Satisfaction even in the Objects of our <hi>Senſible</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Do we indeed, and in Truth Reſolve, through Chriſt enabling us, to do Always to All men, as we Would that in the like Caſe any one ſhould Do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Us? If ſo, then we begin to Live, Then we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Satisfie our Immortal Soules, which Finite Objects can never in any meaſure truly Satifie; Then I ſay we begin to Satisfie our Thirſty Soules with the <hi>Participation of the Divine Nature,</hi> with the Real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Lord Our God, who calls Himſelf the <hi>Fountain of Living Waters,</hi> and <hi>He that drinketh of this Water ſhall never Thirſt, but it ſhall be in him a well of Water ſpringing up into Everlaſting Life.</hi> Joh. 4. 14.</p>
                  <p>Here (it may be) ſome Unſanctifyed man may ſay in his Heart, but what if I find that I am in a State of Death, what ſhall I doe? I cannot give Life unto My ſelf. 'Tis true, Thou can'ſt not, but CHRIST will give thee Life, if Thou wilt not <hi>Reject</hi> it. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and Ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light,</hi> the Light of that Glorious Day that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29710:10"/>
ſhall never End, that Light in which thou ſhalt for Ever See, and Enjoy Him <hi>in whoſe Preſence there is Fullneſs of Joy, and at whoſe Right Hand there are Pleaſures for ever more.</hi> But I am not able to Ariſe from the Dead: Not, in Thine own Naturall Power, but thou mayſt Certainly by the Power of <hi>the Lord of Life,</hi> that Calls upon Thee to ariſe: This Call, this <hi>Commandement is Life Everlaſting.</hi> If Thou wilt not Stop thine Ears againſt it, Thou ſhalt Live for ever. But I do not yet underſtand this Myſtery, how I ſhould Act in the Power of Chriſt. Take it for Thine own, Rely upon It in a Senſe of Thine Intereſt, or Propriety in It. How ſhall I do that? why It is in a manner Thine own already, becauſe It is <hi>Freely offer'd</hi> unto Thee. So that there can be no other Cauſe of thy <hi>Abiding in Death,</hi> but the <hi>Perverſeneſs</hi> of Thine own Will, Becauſe Thou wilt be a Fool, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Preſent World, and Deſpiſe the Lord of Glory, Becauſe Thou wilt be the Worſt of Mad men, a Deſtroyer of Thy ſelf, a Lover of Death. But oh! why Wilt Thou dye? <hi>Receive the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and He will give thee Power to become one of <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> to have thy Converſation in Heaven: He will make thee Partaker of Eternal Life, of Joy Unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of Glory. And, O, that We would All Hearken with the utmoſt Propenſity, and Intention of our Hearts, and Minds to the Voice of the Lord Our God, Calling upon Us in the Words of the Bleſſed Pſalmiſt, with which I ſhall Conclude my Diſcourſe: <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt He be angry, and ye Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from the way, when his Wrath is Kindled but a little.

You give me not any punctual Anſwer to my Queſtion, whether you do not Judge it <hi>Sinful</hi> to ſtay at home (though to read Good Books <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> on the Lords Day, rather than come to Church when nothing is to be heard there, but the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> You ſay you are more againſt ſpending the Lords Day in Idleneſs or in any thing which is worſe, than in Hearing that alone. I thank God I was never ſo Mad, as to make a queſtion of This: I have nothing to ſay to it but that I diſlike theſe words, <hi>worſe than the Common Prayer,</hi> which ſeem to inſinuate that It is not Good. I am not guilty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lighting Preaching (as 'tis taken in contradiſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Reading <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as you ſeem to Conceit.</p>
                  <p>I Affirm, that to Suit, or Proportion our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of Grace, in the Uſe of All Means whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we are Called, to the Apprehenſions of INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITE <hi>Bounty, &amp;c.</hi> is a Property of Saving Faith.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay you, GOD <hi>who appointeth ſeveral Means, doth uſually work according to them; and when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth them it is a Judgment, which it were not, if he had promis'd as much Grace without them as with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, that God who appointeth ſeveral Means, doth uſually work according to them. But I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deny, that when he withdraweth any Particular Means of Grace it is a <hi>Judgment</hi> to Him who is in the <hi>Act</hi> of ſyncere Love to the Bleſſed Jeſus; for ſuch a one is at All Times, and in All Places Under the <hi>Gracious</hi> Influences of the INFINITY of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> directing him how (by Submiſſion to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Will</hi> withdrawing any Particular Means of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29710:13"/>
Grace, and by the Renewing his Reſolutions to make a Right Uſe of all ſuch Means as God ſhall at any time call him unto, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> He may Receive of the <hi>Fullneſs of Chriſt,</hi> in as great Meaſures, as he could have done in the Uſe of the Means withdrawn from him. The LORD give us both Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Things.</p>
                  <p>Now I have found the way by your Letter to diſcover your Thoughts concerning the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> in your Printed Papers; I ſhall not trouble you with any more Poſt-Letters on that Subject: but ſhall ſtick to the Defence of this Great Truth, <hi>that the withdrawing of any particular Means of Grace is not a Judgment to him that is in the Act of Divine Love—</hi>Againſt which you Argue thus: <hi>That which tendeth to hinder his continuance in that Act of Love is a Judgment, but ſuch is the withdrawing of ſome Means of Grace.</hi> I Anſwer, the withdrawing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſo far from being Directly, and in its own Nature <hi>that which tendeth to hinder</hi> &amp;c. that, as It is in its own Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the work of the <hi>Infinitely Good</hi> GOD, It is the Means of Grace, and he takes it for Such that is in the Act <hi>of Divine Love,</hi> as I endeavour'd to ſhew you in my laſt. <hi>We queſtion not,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Gods bounty, but his Will: ſhew us a Promiſe that when a man is deprived of the Preaching of the Goſpel, the Communion of the Church, the Company of all good men, and caſt amongſt impious deceivers, and haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, he ſhall have his love continued, and encreas'd as much as if he had better Means.</hi> I Anſwer, This Promiſe of Our Saviour, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall Aske the Father in my Name he will give it you</hi> (John 16. 27.)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29710:13"/>
would Ingage the Heart of any one in the Act of Divine Love, if God ſhould put him into ſuch a Condition, as you expreſs, to expect from GOD through Our LORD JESUS, as much <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of his <hi>Divine Temper</hi> under that Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Providence, as he knows he could have grounds to Expect in the Uſe of thoſe Means of Grace which the Only Wiſe GOD has thought fit to Withdraw from him. But I am ready to ſay with you, <hi>If God ſhould take away the Bible, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Land, I would take it for a Judgment, though the Common Prayer were left us:</hi> neither did I ever ſay any thing to the contrary: but I have ſay'd implicitly, and ſhall upon all occaſions ſay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that nothing retains the Nature of a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>Sign of the Wrath of God,</hi> to him that is in the <hi>Act of Divine Love,</hi> which Eſſentially implies <hi>Rational</hi> Complacence in Every thing that proceeds from the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Infinitely Good</hi> GOD, I do not Grant (as you may gather from what I have ſay'd) that any Particular Means of Grace are Better, or more Spiritually advantageous, than the being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of them, will certainly be to him that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with the <hi>Divine Will</hi> in that Diſpenſation, Doing whatſoever is his Duty to do in Relation thereunto. <hi>If in ſaying we queſtion not Gods Bounty, but his Will:</hi> and <hi>Gods bounty giveth Grace according to his Liberty of Will,</hi> you imply this Propoſition (which I find aſſerted by a very Ingenious Perſon <hi>E. W.</hi> in his NO PRAEEXISTENCE <hi>p.</hi> 13.) that <hi>the Will of God ſometimes Obſtructs the Effluxes of his Goodneſs;</hi> your meaning is Falſe, as I ſhall Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29710:14"/>
if you ſhall call me thereto. 'T would be Abſur'd indeed to ſay that Gods Bounty giveth Grace <hi>per modum naturae, quantum in ſe,</hi> but Gods Offers of Grace (as I have formerly expreſt my ſelf) are in an unlimited Abundance. Grace is Receiv'd by the Faithful <hi>Ad modum Recipientis:</hi> 'tis only the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> or <hi>Non-Ultra</hi> of the Recipients <hi>Expectancy</hi> that Stints its <hi>Influence.</hi>

                  <l>Whoſe Attributes are Thee, who art alone,</l>
                  <l>Cauſe of all various things, and yet but One?</l>
                  <l>Whoſe Eſſence can no more be ſearcht by man,</l>
                  <l>Then Heav'n thy Throne, be graſped with a Span.</l>

And as our Dignity 'tis Duty too</l>
                  <l>Which is ſumm'd up in this, to Know, and Do.</l>
