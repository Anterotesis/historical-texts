            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my dearly beloved the Inhabitants of the Burrough and Parish of <hi>Kederminster</hi> in <hi>Worcester-shire.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS I never desired any greater preferment in this world, than to have continued in the work of my Ministry among you, so I once thought my dayes would have been ended in that desired station: But we are unmeet to tell God how he shall dispose of us; or to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know what changes he intends to make. Though you are low in the world, and have not the Riches which cause mens estimation with the most, I see no probability that we should have been separated till death, could I but have obtained leave to preach for nothing.</p>
            <p>But being forbidden to preach the Gospel in that Diocesse, I must thankfully take the liberty which shall anywhere else be vouchsafed me. And while I may enjoy it, I take it not for my duty to be over querulour, though the wound that is made by my separation from you be very deep. And though to strangers it will seem probable that such severity had never been exercised against me, but for some heynous crime, yet to you that have known me, I shall need to say but little in my defence. The great crime which is openly charged on me, and for which I am thought unworthy to preach the Gospel, (even where there is no other to preach) is a matter that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with, and therefore, as you have heard me publikely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of it, I am bound to redder you such an account as is necessary to your just information and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>It pleased the Kings Majesty, (in the prosecution of his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian resolution, of uniting his differing subjects by the way of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual approaches and abatements) to grant a Commission to twelve Bishops and nine assistances on the one side, and to one Bishop and eleven other Divines and nine assistants on the other side, to treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout such alterations of the Liturgy, as are <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>the satisfying of tender Consciences,</hi> and to <hi>the restoring of unity and reace.</hi> My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences in a former Treaty (for Reconciliation in matter of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline) made me intreat those to whom the nomination on the one side was committed, to excuse me from the service which I knew would prove troublesome to my self, and ungrateful to others; but I could


<pb facs="tcp:59251:3"/>
not prevail. (But the Work it self, I very much approved, as to be done by fitter and more acceptable persons.) Being commanded by the Kings Commission, I took it to be my duty to be faithful, and to plead for such Alterations as I knew were necessary to the assigned ends; thinking it to be treachery to his Majesty that entrusted us, and to the Church and Cause for which we were entrusted, if under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of making such Alterations as were necessary to the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ends, I should have silently yield to have \[<hi>No Alterations</hi>\] or \[<hi>next to none.</hi>\] In the conclusion (when the chief work was done by writing) a Committee of each part, was appointed to manage a Disputation in prefence (by writing also.) Therein those of the other part formed an Argument, whose Major proposition was to this sense (for I have no copy) \[<hi>Whatsoever book enjoyneth nothing but what is of it self lawfal, and by lawful authority, enjoyneth nothing that is sinful:</hi>\] We denied this proposition; and at last gave divers Reasons of our denyal; among which one was that \[<hi>It may be unlawful by Accident, and therefore sinful</hi>\] You now know my crime; It is my concurring with learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reverend Brethren, to give <hi>this Reason</hi> of our denyal of a proposition: Yet <hi>they</hi> are not forbidden to preach for it, (and I hope shall not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but only I. You have publikely heard, from a mouth that should speak nothing but the words of Charity, Truth, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernesse, (especially there) that this was \[<hi>a desperate shift that men at the last extremity are forced to</hi>\] and inferring \[<hi>that then neither God nor Man can enjoyn without sin.</hi>\] In City and Country this soundeth forth to my reproach. I should take it for an act of clemency to have been smitten professedly for nothing, and that it might not have been thought necessary to afflict me by a defamation, that so I might seem justly afflicted by a prohibition to preach the Gospel. But indeed is there in these words of ours so great a crime? Though we doubted not but they knew that our Assertion made not <hi>Every</hi> evil accident, to be such as made an Imposition unlawful, yet we exprest this by word to them at that time, for fear of being misreported; and I told it to the Right Reverend Bishop when he forbad me to preach, and gave this as a reason: And I must confesse I am still guilty of so much weaknesse, as to be confident that <hi>some things not evil of themselves, may have Accidents so evil, as may make it a sin to him that shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them.</hi> Is this opinion inconsistent with all Government? Yea I must confesse my self guilty of so much greater weaknesse; as that I thought I should never have found a man on earth, that had the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reason of a man, that had made question of it; yea I shall say


<pb facs="tcp:59251:3"/>
more then that which hath offended, viz. <hi>that whenever the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or forbidding of a thing indifferent is like to occasion more hurt than good, and this may be foreseen, the commanding or forbidding it is a sin.</hi> But yet this is not the Assertion that I am chargeable with, but that \[<hi>some Accidents there may be that make the Imposition sinful;</hi>\] If I may ask it without accusing others, how would my crime have been denominated if I had said the contrary? Should I not have been judged unmeet to live in any Governed society? It is not unlawfull of it self to command out a Navy to Sea: But if it were foreseen that they would fall into the enemies hands, or were like to perish by any accident, and the necessity of sending them were small, or none, it were a sin to send them, It is not of it self unlawful to sell poyson, or to give a knife to another, or to bid another do it: but if it were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen that they will be used to poyson or kill the buyer, it is unlawful, and I think the Law would make him believe it that were guilty. It is not of it self unlawful to light a Candle or set fire on a straw; But if it may be foreknown, that by anothers negligence or wilfulnesse, it is like to set fire on the City, or to give fire on a train and store of Gunpowder, that is under the Parliament House, when the King and Parliament are there: I crave the Bishops pardon, for believing that it were sinful to doe it, or command it: Yea or not to hinder it (in any such case,) when <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet.</hi> Yea though going to Gods publike worship be of it self so far from being a sin, as that it is a duty, yet I think it is a sin to command it to all in time of a raging pestilence, or when they should be defending the City against the assault of an enemy. It may rather be then a duty to prohibite it. I think <hi>Paul</hi> spake not any thing inconsistent with the Government of God or Man, when he bid both the Rulers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Church, not to destroy him with their meat for whom Christ dyed: and when he saith that he hath not his Power to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but to Edification. Yea there are Evil Accidents of a thing not evil of it self, that are caused by the Commander: and it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may prove his command unlawful.</p>
            <p>But what need I use any other Instances then that which was the matter of our dispute? Suppose it never so lawful of it self to kneel in the Reception of the Sacrament, if it be imposed by a penalty that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an Accident of the command, and maketh it by accident sinful in the Commander: If a Prince should have Subjects so weak as that all of them thought it a sin against the example of Christ, and the Canons


<pb facs="tcp:59251:4"/>
of the general Councils, and many hundred years practice of the Church to kneel in the act of Receiving on the Lords day, if he should make a Law that all should be put to death that would not kneel, when he foreknew that their consciences would command them all, or most of them, to die rather than obey, would any man deny this command to be unlawful by this accident? Whether the penalty of ejecting Ministers that dare not put away all that kneel, and of casting out all the people that scruple it, from the Church, be too great for such a circumstance, (and so in the rest,) and whether this, with the lamentable state of many Congregations, and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that will follow, being all foreseen, do prove the Impositions unlawful which were then in question, is a case that I had then a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer call to speak to, then I have now. Only I may say that the eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the servants of Christ from the Communion of the Church, and of his faithful Ministers from their sacred work, when too many Congregations have none but insufficient or scandalous teachers, or no preaching Ministers at all, will appear a matter of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the day of our Accounts, and such as should not be done upon any but a Necessary cause, where the benefit is greater then this hurt (and all the rest) amounts to.</p>
            <p>Having given you (to whom I owe it) this account of the cause for which I am forbidden the exercise of my Ministry in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I now direct these Sermons to your hands, that seeing I cannot teach you as I would, I may teach you as I can. And if I much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enjoy such liberty as this, it will be much above my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>My dearly beloved, stand fast in the Lord; And <hi>fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid</hi> of <hi>their revilings: For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wooll: but the righteousnesse of the Lord shall be for ever, and his salvation from generation to generation, Isa.</hi> 51. 7, 8. If I have taught you my doctrine of error or impiety, of disobedience to your Governours in lawful things, of schism or uncharit blenesse, unlearn them all, and renounce them with penitent detestation: But if otherwise, <hi>I beseech you mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them: For they are such as serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. If any shall speak against <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> remember what you have received; and how little any adversary could say, that ever made such assaults upon you:


<pb facs="tcp:59251:4"/>
and that it is easie for any man to talk confidently when no man must contradict him. I denyed no man liberty upon equal terms, to have said his worst against any doctrine that ever I taught you. And how they succeeded, I need not tell you: your own stability tells the world. As you have maintained true Catholicism, and never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any sect, so I beseech you still maintain the ancient faith, the Love of every member of Christ, and common charity to all, your Loyalty to your King, your peace with all men: And let none draw you from Catholick Unity to faction, though the declaiming against Faction and Schism should be the device by which they would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as the world is <hi>nothing,</hi> and God is <hi>all,</hi> to all that are sincere believers? so let no worldly interest seem regardable to you, when it stands in any opposition to Christ; but account all <hi>loss</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. And if you shall hear that I yet suffer more then I have done, let it not be your discouragement or grief; For I doubt not but it will be my crown and joy: I have found no small consolation, that I have not suffered, for sinfull, or for small and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things: And if my pleading against the ejection of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and the excommunicating of his member, for a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and the divisions of his Church, &amp; the destruction of Charity shall be the cause of my suffering (be it never so great,) it shall as much rejoyce me to be a suffering witnesse for CHARITY and UNITY, as if I were a Martyr for the Faith. I participate with <hi>Paul</hi> in an <hi>expectation and hope, that Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or death: and as to live will be Christ, so to die will be gain; Only let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel of Christ, that whether I ever see you</hi> more, <hi>or be absent</hi> (till the joyfull day) <hi>I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together for the faith of the Gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God; if to you it shall be given in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</hi> Phil. 1. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21, 27, 28, 29. But let no injury from inferiors provoke you to dishonour, the Governors that God himself hath set over you. <hi>Be meek and patient;</hi> the <hi>Lord is at hand; Honour all men; Love the Brotherhood; Fear God; Honour the King: For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 15, 17. It is soon enough for you and me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be justified at the bar of Christ (by himself that hath undertaken it) against all the Calumnies of malicious men. Till then let it seem no greater a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb facs="tcp:59251:5"/>
then indeed it is, to be slandered, vilified or abused by the world. Keep close to him that never faileth you, and maintain your integrity, that he may maintain the joys that none can take from you. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well my dear brethren, who are my glory and joy in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming (1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>

            <p>I Have received that Letter of yours, whereby you inform me that Mr. <hi>Bazter</hi> hath lately written and printed something with such a reflection upon me, that I am obliged to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
            <p>I thank you for your care of my Reputation, which next to Conscience ought to be the dearest of all things to all men, especially to men of my Profession and Order, who the more they are vilified (whether justly or unjustly) the less good they will be able to doe, especially amongst those that have industriously been prepossessed with prejudice either against their Persons or their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Case, when there were some that did what they could to make the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to undervalue his person, that thereby they might discredit his Doctrine, and weaken his Authority, whom therefore he thinks he may without breach of Charity call <hi>False Apostles and Deceitful Workers.</hi> Nay this was our Saviours own Case, who, whilest he lived here upon the Earth, was ever and anon traduced and slandred by the Scribes and Pharisees, those proud Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who were the greatest Pretenders to holinesse, and yet the greatest Seducers of the people, and the grossest falsifyers of Gods Word, that ever were in the world, until these our times, which have brought forth a generation of men (St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> would have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them a <hi>Generation of Vipers</hi>) who in the Art of holy jugling and malicious slandring have out done the Pharisees themselves, and all that went before them; witnesse their so often wresting and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture in their Sermons to stir up the people to Sedition, and their as often Libelling the King in their Prayers, in order to the making of his Subjects first to hate him, then to fight against him, and at last to take away his Crown, and his Life from him. And is it any wonder that those that are such Enemies to Kings, should not be friends to Bishops? or that one (who hath done what he could to make the late King odious unto his people) should do what he can likewise to make the Pastor odious unto his Flock? to this Flock I


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59251:6"/>
say; for it is the <hi>bishop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that is Pastor of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> as well as of all other Parochiall Churches in that Diocess; neither did I or any other <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> ever commit the care of Souls in that, or any other Parish of that Diocess to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> though by that Preface of his to those of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> he would make the world believe, that they were <hi>his</hi> Flock, and not <hi>mine,</hi> and that therefore he hath the more reason to complain of my defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of him (as he calls it) in that place and before that people: whereas the truth is, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was never either <hi>Parson, Vicar</hi> or <hi>Curate</hi> there or any where else in my Diocess; for he never came in by the <hi>Door,</hi> that is, by any legal right or lawful admission into that sheepfold, but climbed up some other way, namely, by violence and intrusion, and therefore by Christs own inference he was a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber;</hi> and indeed he did <hi>Rob</hi> him that was then, and is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the lawful <hi>Vicar</hi> of that Church; he <hi>Robbed</hi> him I say, first of his <hi>Reputation</hi> amongst his Flock, and then of his <hi>means</hi> and <hi>maintenance,</hi> by taking away the <hi>Fleece</hi> as well as the <hi>Flock</hi> from him; though (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath confessed to me) <hi>He be a man of an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life and conversation, though not of such parts</hi> (said Mr. Baxter) <hi>as are fit to qualifie him for the Cure of so great a Congregation;</hi> which whether it were so or no, I am sure Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not to be Judge; but in that case the Bishop that was then living should and would have provided him a Coadjutor, as I have done since, and such an one, as I hope will feed that flock with much more wholsome Doctrine then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, when he sowed the seed of Schism and Sedition, and blew the Trumpet of Rebellion amongst them. For which cause I thought it my Duty (as being the Pastor in Chief) not only to forbid Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to Preach there any more, which, by the way, he had done without any License; but likewise to Preach there my self, and to do what I could to undeceive that poor seduced and miserably deluded people; which was not to be done, as long as they had the person of their <hi>Seducer</hi> in so great admiration; and therefore by the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in order to the same end did take the same course with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith, with <hi>Demas, Philetus,</hi> and <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous;</hi> as likewise by the example of Christ himself, who in order to the same end, did take the same course with the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, I thought it necessary to let them know <hi>that one that was of great authority amongst them</hi> (meaning indeed, though not naming Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) was not the man they took him for; that he had not dealt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with them, nor preached the Word of God sincerely to them, when he made them believe it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lawfull for them to take</hi>


               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59251:6"/>
               <hi>up Arms against the King, nor in suffering (if not making) them to scruple at these things as unlawfull, which he he himself confesses to be lawfull;</hi> and afterwards making use of those scruples of theirs (which he himself had infused into them, or not endeavoured to take from them) as the only argument why those things they did so scruple at should not be enjoyn'd by lawful Authority, though lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>because,</hi> forsooth, <hi>the enjoyning of things lawful by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if they may by accident be the occasion of sin, is sinful;</hi> which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of his (as then I said, and must still maintain) is destructive of humane society in taking away the Authority of commanding and the obligation of obeying together with the whole Legislative power, Civil as well as Ecclesiastical, and Divine as well as Humane. And thus much (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself saith) I told him before in mine own house, neither did he then deny the assertion, or endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what I inferr'd from it, by any of those distinctions or instances he now useth. And that this is true the <hi>Reverend Dr. Warmstry</hi> now <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> will witness for me, whom I desired to be by whilest I conferr'd with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> foreseeing what mis-report a man of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> principles and temper was like enough to make of what should pass betwixt us. And it was very well I did so; for I find that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> as well as the <hi>Papist</hi> will serve themselves, as often as they are put to it, of their <hi>piae fraudet,</hi> or holy artifices, of speaking more or lesse then the truth, as it makes more or less for their purpose or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; as likewise of putting <hi>non causam pro causa,</hi> or a part and a less principal part of the cause for the whole cause. For who would not think that knows not Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that when he tells his Disciples of <hi>Kidderminster, You now know my Crime,</hi> with reference to the aforesaid assertion, and to that only, who would not think, I say, that either there was nothing else objected against him, or at least nothing of moment, or that could be any just and reasonable cause of my forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to Preach in my Diocess? especially when he adds that the <hi>Right Reverend Bishop gave him this as a reason for his forbidding him to Preach;</hi> where if he means that the Bishop gave him this as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the principal reason, he speaks without truth, and against his Conscience; for the first and principal reason the Bishop gave him for his forbidding him to preach, was (as he well knows, and as the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> will witness against him) <hi>His preaching before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out License, having no Cure of his own to preach to;</hi> whereunto when he replyed, <hi>I had promised to give him such a License as the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>had given him, viz.</hi> Quàm diu se bene gereret, &amp; durante beneplacito; I rejoyn'd, <hi>that it was true indeed, I had once promised to</hi>


               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59251:7"/>
               <hi>give him such a License, but withal, that it was as true, that first I had never promised to give him a License, if he took it before I gave it him; and that for this presumption of his, I had now forbidden him to preach any more.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That I knew more of him since then I did at that time; for,</hi> first, <hi>I had been credibly informed, that he had abused the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> London's <hi>favour in preaching factiously, though not in the City, yet in the Diocess of</hi> London, <hi>and I named the place to him:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>that since that promise of mine (which cannot be supposed no other then conditional) I myself had heard him in a Conference in the</hi> Savoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>maintaining such a position as was destructive to Legislative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both in God and Man</hi> (meaning the Assertion before spoken of, <hi>viz. That the enjoining of things lawfull by lawfull Authority, if they might by accident be the cause of sin, was sinful</hi>) <hi>which Assertion of his with the horrible consequences of it I told him then at</hi> Worcester, <hi>I had formerly told him of at the</hi> Savoy <hi>openly, and before all the company that was at the Conference;</hi> whereunto all that he replyed at my second telling him at <hi>Worcester,</hi> was, <hi>that he had used some distinctions to salve that Assertion from those consequences;</hi> but what those distinctions were he did not then mention, (as Dr. <hi>Warmstry</hi> can witness) though in this printed address of his to his friends of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> he saith, <hi>he did tell the</hi> Bishop <hi>in what a limited and restrained sense he and his brethren understood that Assertion;</hi> which whether they did or no, will appear by and by, when we shall more nearly examine his print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Narrative as to that particular. In the mean time, though I said indeed that one that held and was likely to teach such Doctrines, was not to be suffered to Preach unto the people, yet this was not then alledged by me as the cause or crime for which I had forbidden him to Preach, (for that, as I said before, was <hi>His presuming to preach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out License</hi>) but only as a reason why I should have thought myself not obliged by the promise I had formerly made him, to give him Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, though he had not otherwise forfeited his claim to that promise by Preaching without, or before he had it. Lastly, He might have remembred another reason I gave him why I could not have made good that promise, namely, <hi>those principles of Treason and Rebellion publickly extant in his books, which I had not taken notice of till after the making of that promise, and which till he should recant in as publick a manner, I thought myself obliged in Conscience not to suffer him to preach in my Diocesse;</hi> whereunto his Answer was, <hi>That whatsoever he had said or done in that kind, was pardoned by the Act of Indempnity: True,</hi> said I, <hi>so far as the King can pardon it, that is, in regard of its corporal punishment here in this world, but it is God that must pardon</hi>


               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59251:7"/>
               <hi>the guilt or obligation to punishment in the world to come, which he will not without Repentance, and it is the Church that must pardon the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, which she cannot do neither without an honourable amends made her by publick Confession and Recantation.</hi> I could tell Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his ear likewise, that in excuse of his Rebellious principles formerly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, he said, <hi>That now the Parliament had declared where the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power was, he should acknowledge it and submit to it,</hi> as if the King owed his Soveraignty to the declaration of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is as false as Rebellious, and as dangerous a principle as any of his former, however by what hath been said, it appears that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meant to impose upon his credulous friends at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> &amp; upon his unwary Readers, by making them believe that was the only cause for which the Bishop forbad him to Preach, which was neither the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor the principal cause, why the Bishop did so, nor indeed, to speak properly, any cause of it at all; for the only proper cause for which the Bishop forbad him to Preach, was <hi>His preaching before without the</hi> Bishops <hi>License;</hi> the other which he pretends, together with the third which he conceals, where properly and professedly the Causes why the Bishop would not take off that prohibition, or why he would not give him a License to Preach for the future, either at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> or in any other place of his Diocess, until he should publickly retract that Position which he had openly asserted at the Conference, and should publickly renounce likewise those seditious and rebellious principles which are published in his Books. And this is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth of what passed betwixt me and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at <hi>Worcester,</hi> before I preached at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> where whether I defamed him, or he, by saying so, hath not grosly defamed me, will appear by that which follows; wherein that I might neither be deceived myself, nor deceive others, I have not trusted to my own memory only, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he doth to his, but I have consulted with Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> two of the three that managed that Conference with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his <hi>Assistants,</hi> and have seen that Assertion in the same sense that I object it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> disclaimes it, affirmed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself under his own hand.</p>
            <p>I found Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> engaged in a Dispute, and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that to keep himself off from that part of the argument which would presse near to the merits of the Cause, he had often affirmed in his <hi>Answers, That the Command of a most lawful Act was sinful; if that Act commanded might prove to any one a sin</hi> per accidens. This asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I did then and there presently and openly lay to his charge; and when he denied it (as it was most frequent with him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59251:8"/>
to deny what he had before affirmed) the answers which he had delivered written with his own hand were produced, and upon the reading of them, the Justice of my charge was most apparent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I urged him farther, that this Assertion of his was not only false, but destructive of all Authority, Humane and Divine, as not only denying all power to the Church of making Canons Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal for the better ordering and governing of the Church, but also taking away all Legislative Power from the King and Parliament, and even from God himself: I delivered at the same time my reason for what I said, which was briefly this, because there can be no Act so good of itself, but may prove <hi>per Accidens,</hi> or by Accident, a sin; And therefore, if to command an Act which may prove <hi>per accidens</hi> a sin, be a sin, then every Command must be a sin. And if to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be a sin, then certainly God can command nothing, because God cannot sin; and by the same reason, Kings, Parliaments and Churches ought not to command any thing, because they ought not to sin.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I then charged Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and to this Charge he gave then no satisfaction. Neither can I yet conceive it possible to give any satisfaction, but by one of these two waies, either by proving that the assertion, with which I charged him, was never his, or by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the consequence I urged, is not good; neither of which was he then able to doe: and by what he hath now been pleased to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, it is more then probable that he can never perform either of them.</p>
            <p>For in his bold, but weak Apology, he doth not so much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to shew any Invalidity in my Inference; and for the Assertion with which I charged him, he denies it so poorly, and goes about to prove another instead of it so manifestly, that he may without any injury be interpreted to yield it, He saith indeed now, <hi>That he told us that his Assertion made not every Evill accident to be such as made an Imposition unlawfull.</hi> But whether he ever said so before this time or no, it was then clearly proved that he did assert, <hi>That an Act for nothing else, but because it might be</hi> per accidens <hi>a sin, could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded without sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now in his publick appeal, he hath taken a strange way to wipe off all this, for he makes a very brief Narration, and most notoriously imperfect, and then sayes, <hi>You know my crime,</hi> as if that were all that had been, or could be objected against him. Besides, in the relating of this short Narrative, he relies wholly upon his own memory; not so much as endeavouring to satisfie himself, before he


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59251:8"/>
presumed to satisfie others. How his memory may be in other things I know not, in this if it hath been faithfull to him he hath been very unfaithfull to others. He relates an Answer in what terms he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and brings one proposition, as made by his Opponents, in what terms he thinks fit, and the Application of this answer to that propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition he propoundeth as all his Crime; whereas his answer was farre more largely given, and that to several propositions in several Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms, of which the proposition which he relateth was but one, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none; so that he hath most shamefully abused his Disciples at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> with a short and partial Narrative of his fact.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Concurring with Learned Reverend Brethren,</hi> (which he would pretend to be part of his Crime) and his invidious insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That they are not forbidden to Preach for it, though he be;</hi> the reason is clear. He had often delivered this assertion before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, his Brethren had not; the words of the Answer were written with his hand, not with his Brethrens. His Brethren had several times declared themselves not to be of his Opinion (as particularly when he affirmed (<hi>That a man might live without any actual sin</hi>) And therefore we were so just as not to charge them with this Assertion; especially considering they did shew themselves unwilling to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this dispute, and seemed to like much better another way tending to an amicable and fair complyance, which was wholly frustrated by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> furious eagerness to engage in a Disputation.</p>
            <p>All his discourse which followeth (after his imperfect Narrative) in justification of himself, is grounded first upon a mis-reporting of his own Assertion; Secondly, upon the dissembling of the severall Propositions, to which his answer was so often replyed; Thirdly, upon his pretending <hi>That he says more now, then that which had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded formerly;</hi> which is most palpably false, and in all probability (if he have any memory) against his own Conscience. And this will presently appear by the vanity and impertinency of all those specious instances which he brings to mollifie his Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To Command a Navy to Sea</hi> (he sayes) <hi>is lawfull, but if it were foreseen that they would fall into the Enemies hand, or were like to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by any accident, it were a sin to send them.</hi> Is there more then he said before, or is it any defence of his Assertion at all? Is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the Opponents had put it expresly in the Proposition; <hi>That the Act in it self lawful, was to be supposed to have nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, which the Commander of it ought to provide against;</hi> and yet being so stated, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmed, <hi>That if the Act might be</hi> per accidens <hi>sinfull, the Commanding of it was sin.</hi> Now certainly the


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59251:9"/>
falling of a Navy into the Enemies hand, or the perishing of it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, <hi>if foreseen,</hi> ought to be provided against by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whereas Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> answer did import, That if any Prince did command a Fleet to Sea, though he did not foresee the Fleet would fall into the Enemies hand, or perish any other way, yet if by Accident it miscarried that or any other way, which he could not foresee, or were not bound to provide against, the very Command at first was sin.</p>
            <p>The same reason nullifies his instances of the <hi>poyson,</hi> and the <hi>knife,</hi> because the sin in selling them supposeth the murder of the buyer to be foreseen, and consequently that the seller ought to prevent it; but if he will speak in correspondence to his former Answer, he must shew, that though the seller do not foresee that the buyer will use the poyson or the knife, to his own, or any other mans destruction, yet if by any Accident or mistake, either the buyer, or any other perish by the poyson or the knife, the Seller is guilty of his death.</p>
            <p>His instance of <hi>setting a City on fire, or putting Gunpowder unto the Parliament House when the King and Parliament are there,</hi> is of the same nature, and needs no addition of answer but only this, that Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in a sense too true, hath been very instrumental in setting the City on fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in adding powder to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The rest which follows betrayes the same weaknesse, because the inconveniences are urged <hi>upon a Duty to prohibit them,</hi> and his answer did charge the Command with sin in respect of such Accidents, as it was no part of the Commanders Duty to provide against. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most certain, that no one of those instances single, nor all of them jointly have any force in any measure to justifie that Assertion which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did maintain, and whereof he is accused.</p>
            <p>As for that last instance, <hi>which was</hi> (saith he) <hi>the matter of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> and which he urgeth in this manner, (<hi>Suppose it never so lawful of it self to Kneel in the reception of the Sacrament, if it be imposed by a penalty, that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an Accident of the Command, and maketh it by Accident sinful to the Commander</hi>) he is manifestly guilty of a double falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: First, in pretending the matter in dispute, <hi>was the imposition of kneeling at the Communion;</hi> when this very matter was expresly rejected in the very beginning of the dispute, as belonging to the <hi>Canons</hi> not the Common-Prayer-book, the lawfulnesse of which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> the Commissioners had no Authority to debate, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows, that his Argument was denied upon that ground. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond falsification is yet greater, in urging the penalty to make the


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59251:9"/>
Command sinful, when his Answer did charge the Command with sin, without any relation to the punishment; and when the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition he replyed to was so framed, that all unjust penalties were <hi>in terminis</hi> expresly excluded, even then I say he charged the Command of a lawful Act with sin, if it were otherwise by Accident sinful; though by the way I must not grant that the penalty imposed by the Law for not kneeling at the Receiving of the Sacrament (namely the not admitting of such as will not kneell, at the receiving of it) <hi>is incomparably greater then the offence;</hi> for the greatnesse of the offence in such cases, and as it stands in relation to such or such a penalty appointed for it, is not to be measured by the Quality of the Act considered in it self, but by the more or lesse Mischievous consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is likely to produce, if men be not restrain'd from such an Act by such a penalty; for example, when a Souldier is Hanged for steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Hen, or for taking away any thing of never so little a value, without paying for it, no wise man will blame the <hi>Generall</hi> for such a severity; because if he did not do so, every one would take what he pleased, which would discourage the Countrey from bringing in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and consequently the whole Army would be ruin'd. And as the Martial, so the Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws likewise in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding or forbidding any thing under such or such a penalty, have an eye not so much to the merit of the Action it self, as to the more or less danger of the Publick in the consequences of it; whence it comes to passe, that a lesse evil may sometimes most justly be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under a more severe penalty then a greater, because the former may be of much more dangerous consequence then the latter; so that he that will judge rightly, and impartially of the equity or ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of appointing or inflicting such or such a penalty, he must not so much consider the quality of the Transgression singly in it self, nor whether it be from weaknesse, or wilfulnesse in the party transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (as he is this or that individual person) but rather he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what the <hi>Consequence</hi> would be of the breach of such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand if it were not prevented by such a penelty, alwayes supposing the Command it self to be lawful, and that the transgressor of it is to be considered as he stands in relation to that whole body, whether Civil, or Ecclesiastical, whereof he is a part; and that the whole is not to be endangered out of tendernesse and indulgence to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as evidently it would be, if every man were left at liberty to do what seem'd best in his own eyes, even in the Ceremonials and Circumstantials of Gods Worship; for considering the pride and


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59251:10"/>
self-love that is in humane nature, which makes men so overvalue their own practises and their opinions, that they are alwayes apt to undervalue those that will not conform to them, as it alwayes hath been, so it alwayes will be; he that worshippeth God one way, will either judge or condemn him that worshippeth God another way; he that <hi>Kneeleth</hi> at the Sacrament, will be thought to be Idolatrous or Superstitious by him that <hi>Kneeleth not,</hi> and him that kneeleth not will be thought wilful, or weak, by him that kneeleth. And thus from diversity grows dislike, from dislike enmity, from enmity op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and from opposition, first Separation and Schism in the <hi>Church,</hi> and then Faction, Sedition and Rebellion in the State; which is a progress very natural, and I would we had not found it to be so by our own experience; for as the State depends upon the safety of the Church, so the safety of the Church depends upon Unity, and Unity it self depends upon Uniformity, and Uniformity there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, as long as there is diversity or divers wayes of worship in the same Church, which will be alwaies, unlesse it be lawful for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority to oblige all particulars to one way of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that under such penalties, as the Law-givers shall think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to prevent the disturbing of the publick Peace and safety; the preservation whereof being the main end of all Laws, and of all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties appointed by Law, those practises that are either intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or consequentially destructive to this End, may be, and no doubt ought to be restrain'd by severe penalties. It is not therefore the <hi>not kneeling</hi> at the Sacrement, but the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church, and the endangering of the Peace and Safety of the whole, which our Lawes punish by not admitting such unto the Sacrament, as will not, or perhaps dare not kneel at it; for as they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Peace of their Consciences for the Churches sake; so it becomes the Law-givers not to endanger the Churches and the States Peace for their sakes. And surely when there is a necessity of the yielding of the one or of the other, it is much more reasonable that a part should yield unto the whole, then the whole unto a part, especially when the whole cannot yield without endangering it self, and with it self even those themselves also, that, will they nill they, must be involved in the ruine of it, as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have found by their own experience also, who by their groundlesse and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse separation from us, have given example and ground enough for others to separate from them, till by dividing and subdividing from one another, there was nothing of Uniformity, or unity, or order, or decency left in that <hi>Church,</hi> which was formerly (and I hope by


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59251:10"/>
the Prudence and Piety of publick Authority will be now again) the Glory and Pattern of all other Protestant and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in the world; of which, by the way, there is not one which doth not use as great severity for the preserving of Unity by Uniformity as we do, even in this particular; for do not the Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in <hi>France</hi> enjoyn <hi>Standing,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Holland, Scotland,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Germany</hi> that follow <hi>Calvin</hi> enjoyne sitting, and the Churches that follow <hi>Luther</hi> there and elsewhere enjoyn <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as we do, and all of them upon the same penalty of not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it otherwise? And is it not as lawful for our Church, as for all other Protestant, and all other Christian Churches, to require of her children the like conformity to her laws under the like penalty for the same end, &amp; to prevent the same danger? <hi>yes</hi> (replyed Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> when this question was asked him) <hi>just as lawful,</hi> that is, <hi>not lawful at all, such an injunction upon such a penalty being sinful, wheresoever and by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is enjoyned.</hi> A happy <hi>England,</hi> that hath such an <hi>Aristar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> as is worthy to censure all the Churches of the world, whose Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick practise (if it cross Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> opinion) must presently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe be condemn'd as sinful, and all the world must be Lyars rather then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must not be justified in his sayings. You have before seen the ingenuity and veracity, you now see the humility, and the modesty of the Man; and indeed in proportion, of the whole party, for <hi>crimine ab uno,—Disce omnes.</hi> But doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the rest of his perswasion think indeed, that it is so great and grievous a punishment to be kept from the Sacrament when men will not receive it in that way and upon those terms that the Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers? if they doe, why then do they deny it to so many that hunger and thirst after it, whensoever either by reason of Age, or Lameness, or sicknesse, or some other bodily infirmity they cannot come to Church for it? especially when the Catholick Church in the Twelfth Canon of the first General Council commands it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven even to those that are Excommunicate, if they desire it when they are <hi>in Extremis,</hi> or going out of the world. Secondly, why have they suffered so many whole Parishes in <hi>England</hi> under their charge to have been without a Communion so many years together, as I am credibly informed they have? Thirdly, why do they reject those from the Sacrament, that will not come before hand to them to be examined by them, there being neither precept nor practise in the Gospel, nor Canon in the Church, either to warrant them to require it, or to oblige the People to submit to it upon any such penalty? I am sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he chides those of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59251:11"/>
coming ignorantly to the Sacrament, and for behaving themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely at the Sacrament, that which he prescribes for avoiding the same or the like faults for the future, is not that every man should come and be examined by the Minister, but that <hi>every man should examine himself before he eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup;</hi> And yet I will not deny but that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every man before he Communicates ought to be well Catechis'd and instructed by the Minister, and thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to examine himself the better; nor will I deny neither but that every man may and ought in Case of scruple of mind or trouble of conscience to advise with, and to be advised by him that hath the cure of his Soul; but that every man as often as he intends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament should be obliged under the penalty of being rejected from it, this is that which I utterly deny, and which I take to be the same thing in other words with that of <hi>Auricular Confession;</hi> so that they who exact the one, have no reason to condemn the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unlesse it be because they would ingrosse it wholly unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Howsoever, if refusing the Sacrament to those that will not kneel, when the Church enjoyns it, be a penalty so far transcending the offence, how much more must the same penalty transcend the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when there is indeed no offence at all? for where there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there can be no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where there is no Law there can be no transgression, and consequently there being no Law of God nor Man that requires all Communicants to be pre-examined by the Minister, those that are refused the Sacrament because they will not be pre-examined, are punished with the same punishment which they complain of, for no offence at all. And therefore <hi>si maximè digna essem</hi> (may our Church say) <hi>ista contumelia, indigni vos, qui faceretis tamen;</hi> for, <hi>Who art thou O Man that judgest another?</hi> nay, that judgest thy Mother, <hi>when thou doest the same,</hi> or worse, <hi>thing,</hi> then those are for which thou condemnest her? and how can any man of reason be so scrupulous, as to quit his Calling, rather then deny the Sacrament to those that will not receive it kneeling, when the Church commands it should neither be taken nor given otherwise, and yet make no scruple at all of denying it to whole Parishes, of denying it to those that cannot come to Church for it, though desirous of it, and qualified for it, and such as have most need of it to strengthen their faith in their last Agony? and lastly, of denying it to such as refuse to be pre-examined by them, and all this without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or warrant from Gods Word, and contrary to the Command and Custome of Gods Church? whereby it plainly appears, that either they do not think the receiving of the Sacrament of so great


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59251:11"/>
importance, as indeed it is, nor the denying of it so great an injury or punishment as they pretend it to be; or else that they would have every Minister to be a Monarch or Soveraign Law-giver in his own Parish, and this indeed is that they would fain be at, now they have lost their hopes of Governing the whole Kingdome; for you see by what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adds, that if they may not be suffered to give or deny the Sacrament to whom they please, and in effect to doe what they list in their own Parishes, they threaten to quit their Stations, which he calls <hi>being Ejected because they dare not put away all that will not kneel at the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And this menace they often repeat upon all occasions, as if they were the only men that could carry on the work of the Lord; or as if the Church must needs sink and perish, if it wanted such Pillars as they are to uphold it. But (thanks be to GOD for it) the CHURCH of <hi>England</hi> is not yet (notwithstamding all their endeavours to that purpose) reduced to so very ill a condition, that she cannot subsist without them; as long as they can continue to be what they have been the sowers and fomenters of Schism in the Church, and sedition in the State; and as long as they continue to do as they have done in humouring, and hardning, and confirming the people in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate standing out against the lawful commands of their Superiours; which they would never have done at all, if these men had not at first infused into them these scruples. And therefore as God asked <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, How, came you to know that you are naked?</hi> so if I should ask those poor souls whom those sly and subtle Serpents have beguiled and seduced, How came you to know that you shall sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God if you obey the Orders of the Church in Generall? or particularly how came you to know, <hi>That it is against the Canons of the Generall Councels, and many hundred years practise of the Church to Kneel in the Act of receiving?</hi> Did you or can you your selves read those General Councels? Did you or can you examine so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years practise of the Church as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks of? What answer can they make to these demands, but that which <hi>Eve</hi> made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or some such Godly and Learned men as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, did tell us so, and we believed them: But what if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do not believe that himself which he would have you believe? For first he would have you believe that there is great reverence and respect to be given (as indeed there is) to the Canons of <hi>Generall Gouncels,</hi> and to the <hi>Catholick practise</hi> of the Primitive Church; but doth he himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59251:12"/>
this? if he do, why did he so furiously oppose that which all General Councels approve of and confirm? I mean the Government of the Church by Bishops in the sense wherein it is asserted and practised in one Church? Or why did he perswade Subjects to take up Arms against their <hi>Soveraign?</hi> which he knows to be contrary to the Doctrine and practise of the Primitive Christians for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years more then he speaks of. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have you believe, that Kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament is forbidden by <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> and contrary to the custome and <hi>practise</hi> of the Antient Church, which I am afraid he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live himself; I am sure there is no convincing reason to make him believe it; for it is not the Ancient Churches injunction to stand when they prayed betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> that will prove they were forbidden to Kneel when they received; especially if the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> opinion be true, <hi>that we are not to be in the Act of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we are in the Act of receiving;</hi> but if we may pray (as no doubt we may and ought to pray) in the Act of Receiving, then supposing the Ancient Injunction of the Church to stand at Prayer upon Sundaies betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide</hi> to be still in force, yet all the rest of the year we are to kneel when we Pray, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently when we Receive, though there were no particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our own Church for it. Besides, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows not the aforesaid Injunction of the Church was but Temporary, till the people were sufficiently confirmed in the Doctrine and Belief of the Resurrection; for if it had been of perpetual obligation, and were still in force, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must needs condemn the whole present Church of God for kneeling when they pray betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and particularly he must most of all condemn himself and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for not standing when they receive, if at least that Injunction be to be understood of Receiving as well as Praying; which if it be not, then it is urged by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against us to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as indeed it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore no doubt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not believe himselfe what he would have others believe, when he presseth that occasional temporary injunction of the Church for <hi>standing</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>kneeling;</hi> which if it be of force, must needs condemn his own practice of <hi>sitting</hi> as well as ours of <hi>kneeling.</hi> The like may be said of Christs example, alledged by him also; for would he, or would he not have his Disciples believe that they are obliged to doe as Christ did; if he would not have them believe so, why doth he presse them with Christs example? if he would have them believe so, I demand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59251:12"/>
whether he doth believe it himself or no? if he do not, it is plain he is a seducer of the <hi>peeple:</hi> but if he do believe it, he must needs condemn the <hi>French Presbyterians</hi> for <hi>standing,</hi> as well as the <hi>English Protestants</hi> for <hi>kneeling;</hi> nay he must needs condemn himself and all other Christians in the world for not doing as Christ did in point of time, I mean for not giving and receiving the Sacrament in the Evening, as Christ did, as well as he condemns us for not doing as Christ did in point of gesture; unless he can prove (which I think he cannot) that we are of necessity to follow Christs example in one circumstance of the same action, and not in another; and in that circumstance which is lesse, but not in that which is more material; for certainly that circumstance which denominates the action (as the circumstance of time doth the Lords supper) is most material; and yet that circumstance by the consent of all Christendome is altered from the Evening to the Morning, and so was the gesture or posture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving also, and that upon most just and weighty reasons, till those that delight in change would needs have it otherwise, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for no other reason, but because they found it setled in the Church: This is not to follow Christs example, who in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their own nature conform'd his practise to that of the Church in which he lived, though varying in some circumstances from the Primitive Institution; and particularly in this very action, from which they press us with Christs example: For it is certain that Christ and his Disciples sate at the Passeover, (though it be uncertain whether he or they sate at the giving and receiving the Sacrament or no, for it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>after he had supped,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20.) Howsoever it is certain, I say, that Christ and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples sate when they eat the Passeover, and this no doubt was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome of the Jewish Church at that time; but it is as certain that this was not the manner according to the first institution of it, which was to eat it <hi>standing,</hi> as you may read <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. So that to urge Christs example against us, is to urge Christs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against himself; for as we conform our selves to the Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and custome of our times, in receiving the Communion other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in point of gesture, then perhaps it was received at the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; so Christ and his Apostles conforming themselves to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and practise of the Church of their times, did celebrate the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over otherwise then according to the first Institution it was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in point of gesture also; thereby intending to teach us, that as long as the Essentials of Doctrine and Worship (which are unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59251:13"/>
are preserved, we are not to separate from the Church or quarrel with our Superiours, if those things that are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alterable, be not alwaies and in all places just the same that they were at first; because there may be very just cause for the alteration of them; and whether there be such a cause or no in this and the like particulars, it is the Church that is to be the Judge. So that there is nothing that can be collected either from the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or from the practise of the Primitive Church, no nor from Christs own example, that can prove Kneeling at the Sacrament to be a sin; neither doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself believe it to be sinful, for if he did, he would not say (as he does Pag. 4. 11. of his five Disputations) <hi>that he himself would kneel rather then disturb the Peace of the Church, or be deprived of its Communion.</hi> In which words he confesseth, First, that Kneeling at the Sacrament is not sinful or unlawful; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that not to Kneel when it is imposed, is to disturb the Peace of the Church; and Thirdly, that the imposing of it upon penalty of being deprived of the Communion, is an effectual means to make those that otherwise would not kneel, to conform to it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the imposing of it upon such a penalty is prudent and rational, and whatsoever is prudent and rational cannot be unlawful; so that not only the Act of Kneeling it self, but the imposition of it by lawful Authority must needs be lawful. Neither indeed would the People scruple at the imposition, if they had not been taught that the thing it self were unlawful, or if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would yet teach them to believe what he himself believes, namely, that it is lawful; which with what conscience he can refuse to do I know not; for sure he is obliged to teach them obedience not to Divine Authority only, but to humane Authority also in all lawful things; and not to let them go on in such an erroneous opinion, <hi>as will disturb the Peace, and deprive them of the Communion of the Church,</hi> and consequently make them sin against God and Man and their own Souls. Of which sin of theirs he must needs be a partaker in a great measure, if he do not perswade them from it; seeing (as he himself saith) <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet.</hi> And what <hi>Power</hi> he hath to lead or mislead those kind of men, <hi>their</hi> venturing to kill and be killed in a most unrighteous quarrel (upon his perswasion) hath more then enough demonstrated during the time of the late troubles; unlesse he will say that he hath conjured up a Spirit that he cannot lay. Howsoever by how much the more faulty he hath been in misleading them heretofore, by so much the more zealous he should be to reduce them into the right way


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59251:13"/>
hereafter; which if he and the rest of his Brethren can do (as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident they can if they wil) they wil make some amends for the mischief they have done, and then there will be no fear or danger <hi>of Ministers being Ejected for their tenderness towards the People, nor of the Ejecting of any of the People from the communion of the Church for not conforming themselves to the Orders and Commands of it,</hi> &amp; consequently, there will be no Schisms or Divisions amongst us, when we shall all worship the same God the same way. But if they will not do this (which by all obligations Humane and Divine they are bound to do) for my part I know no better way for undeceiving &amp; reducing of the People, then by removing such Ministers, and then we shall see when the blowing of those boisterous winds ceaseth, whether the waves will not be still or no: In the mean time I hope the removing of <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>seditious,</hi> will not necessitate the introducing of <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ministers,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ought to remember, that as there is no sin more heinous then Rebellion, so no teacher ought to be more scandalous (I am sure there is none more dangerous) then a teacher of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And now (to use Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words) I think there is <hi>no man to be found on earth, that hath the ordinary reason of a Man, but will confess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That it is indeed destructive of all Government and Legislative power, to Assert</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did Assert) <hi>the command of a thing in it self lawful by lawful Authority, under no unjust punishment, with no evil circumstance, which the Commander can foresee or ought to provide against</hi> (for all these pre-cautions were expresly put in the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied) <hi>as a sinful Command, for a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but because the Act Commanded may be by Accident a sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then know, and (if he have ingenuity enough) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the words I spoke (as to this particular) were <hi>words of truth,</hi> and <hi>words of charity</hi> also, as being intended and spoken to no other end, but to undeceive that People, who by having his person too much in admiration (as if he could neither deceive nor be deceived) had been so long and so dangerously mislead by him; so that it was not I that defamed him then, but it is he that hath defamed me now. Neither could I expect lesse from the boldnesse of this man and that party, who have had the confidence publickly to own the obligation of the Covenant, even since it hath been condemn'd to be burnt by the Parliament. And truly I see no reason why all those Books and Sermons which have been Preach'd and Printed in defence of the Covenant, or to maintain the same or worse principles of Sedition


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59251:14"/>
then are in the Covenant, should not be burnt also. Nay I dare be bold to say, that if the Authors of such Books and Sermons were not still of the same opinions (and if they be, God deliver us from such Preachers) if they were not still, I say, of the same opinions, but did truly repent of them, and were heartily sorry for the horrible mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they have done by them, they would with those converted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcists, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 19. bring all those Conjuring Books of theirs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and to save the Hang-man a labour, would publickly burn them all with their own hands, that so, though by the burning of their works they may perhaps suffer some losse in point of reputation with some of their Disciples, yet they themselves may be saved, but so as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. At least they ought to be enjoyned to write Books of Retractation, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did, having much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do so then St. <hi>Augustine</hi> had.</p>
            <p>And this Sir is all I have to say upon this occasion, and more a great deal then I thought to have said, or then perhaps was needfull to be said to one that knows Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and me as well as you do; which if it satisfie you, as I hope it will, you may do what you please with it, in order to the satisfying of others; for this is the first and last trouble I mean to put my self to of this kind, whatsoever provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I may have from him hereafter.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied it for two reasons which he gave in with his own hand in writing thus: One is, <hi>Because that may be a sin</hi> per accidens, <hi>which is not so in it self, and may be unlawfully commanded though that accident be not in the command.</hi> Another is, <hi>That it may be commanded under an unjust penalty.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied it for this reason given in with his own hand in writing thus: <hi>Because the first Act commanded may be</hi> per accidens <hi>unlawful and be commanded by an unjust penalty, though no other Act or circumstance commanded be such.</hi>

               <p>LEast Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should say I have defamed him once more, by charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with devising and publishing <hi>Maxims</hi> of Treason, Sedition and Rebellion (which till he should as publiquely recant, I thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to restore him to the exercise of any act of the Ministry in my Diocess) I think my self obliged to set down some few of his political <hi>Theses</hi> or <hi>Aphorisms</hi> in his own words, as they are extant (though it be strange such a Book should still be extant) in his \[<hi>Holy Common-wealth</hi>\] most falsly and prophanely so called.</p>

               <head>Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Theses of Government and Governours in generall.</head>
               <p n="1">I GOvernours are some limited, some <hi>de facto</hi> unlimited: The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited are Tyrants, and have no right to that unlimited Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>P.</hi> 106. <hi>Thes.</hi> 101.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The 3. qualifications of necessity to the being of Soveraign Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer are, 1. So much understanding, 2. So much will or goodness in himself, 3. So much strength or executive power by his interest in the People or others, as are necessary to the said ends of Government, <hi>P.</hi> 130. <hi>Thes.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p n="3">III. From whence he deduceth 3. Corollaries, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When Providence depriveth a man of his understanding and intellectual Capacity, and that statedly or to his ordinary temper, it maketh him <hi>materiam indispositam</hi> and uncapable of Government, though not of the name. <hi>Thes.</hi> 135.</item>
                  <item>2. If God permit Princes to turn so wicked as to be uncapable of governing so as is consistent with the ends of Government, he permits them to depose themselves. <hi>Thes.</hi> 136.</item>
                  <item>3. If Providence statedly disable him that was the Soveraign from the executing of the Law, protecting the just, and other ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it makes him an uncapable subject of the power, and so deposeth him. <hi>Thes.</hi> 137.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Whereunto he subjoyns,</hi> that though it is possible and likely that the guilt is or may be theirs, who have disabled their Ruler by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting him, yet he is dismissed and disobliged from the charge of


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59251:15"/>
Government; and particular innocent members are disobliged from being Governed by him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If the person (<hi>viz. the Soveraign</hi>) be justly dispossest, as by a lawful War, in which he loseth his right, especially if he violate the Constitution and end enter into a Military state against the People themselves, and by them be conquered, they are not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him, unlesse there be some special obligation upon them besides their Allegiance. <hi>Thes.</hi> 145.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If the person dispossess'd, though it were unjustly, do afterwards become uncapable of Government, it is not the Duty of his Subjects to seek his restitution. <hi>Thes.</hi> 146. No not although (<hi>saith he</hi>) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity be but accidental, as if he cannot be restored but by Arms of the Enemies of God or of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If an Army (of Neighbours, Inhabitants, or whoever) do (though injuriously) expel the Soveraign, and resolve to ruine the Commonwealth, rather then he shall be restored; and if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth may prosper without his restauration, it is the Duty of such an injured Prince for the Common good to resign his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if he will not, the people ought to judge him as made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable by Providence, and not to seek his restitution to the apparent ruine of the Commonwealth. <hi>Thes.</hi> 147.</p>
               <p>Where by the way we are to note, he makes the people judge of this and all other incapacities of the Prince, and consequently when or for what he is to be Depos'd, or not Restored by them.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If therefore the rightful Governour be so long dispossess'd, that the Commonwealth can be no longer without, but to the apparent hazard of its ruine, we (<hi>that is, we the people, or we the Rebels that dispossess'd him</hi>) are to judge that Providence hath dispossess'd the former, and presently to consent to another. <hi>Thes.</hi> 149,</p>
               <p n="9">IX When the People are without a Governour, it may be the duty of such as have most strength, <hi>ex charitate,</hi> to protect the rest from injury. <hi>Thes.</hi> 150. <hi>and consequently they are to submit themselves to the Parliament, or to that Army which deposed or dispossess'd or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the rightful Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59251:16"/>X. Providence by Conquest or other means doth use so to qualifie some persons above other for the Government when the place is void, that no other persons shall be capable competitors, and the persons (<hi>doth not he mean the</hi> Cromwells?) shall be as good as named by Providence, whom the People are bound by God to choose, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to, so that they are usually brought under a divine obligation to submit to such or such, and take them for their Governours, before those persons have an actual right to Govern. <hi>Thes.</hi> 151.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Any thing that is a sufficient sign of the will of God that this is the person, by whom we must be Governed is enough (as joyned to Gods Laws) to oblige us to consent and obey him as our Governour, <hi>Thes.</hi> 153.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. When God doth not notably declare any person or persons qualified above others, there the people must judge as well as they are able according to Gods general rules. <hi>Thes.</hi> 157.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. <hi>And yet</hi> All the people have not this right of choosing their Governours, but commonly a part of every Nation must be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to consent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Those that are known enemies of the Common Good in the chiefest parts of it, are unmeet to Govern or choose Governours, but such are multitudes of ungodly vicious men. <hi>Pag.</hi> 174. <hi>So that if those that are strongest (though fewest) call themselves the Godly Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all others besides themselves are to be excluded from Governing or choosing of Governours. As amongst the ungodly that are to be thus exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he reckons all those</hi> that will not hearken to their Pastors (<hi>he means the Preshyterian Classis</hi>) or that are despisers of the Lords-Day, <hi>that is, all such as are not Sabbatarians, or will not keep the Lords-Day after the Jewish manner, which they prescribe, and which is condemned for Judaism by all even of the presbyterian perswasion in the world, but those of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">XV. If a People that by Oath and Duty are obliged to a Soveraign, shall sinfully dispossess him, and contrary to their Covenants, choose and Covenant with another, they may be obliged, by their latter Covenant notwithstanding their former; and particular subjects that consented not in the breaking of their former Covenants, may


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59251:16"/>
yet be obliged by occasion of their latter choice to the person whom they choose. <hi>Thes.</hi> 181.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. If a Nation injuriously deprive themselves of a worthy Prince, the hurt will be their own, and they punish themselves; but if it be necessarily to their welfare, it is no injury to him. But a King that by war will seek reparations from the body of the People, doth put himself into an hostile State, and tells them actually that he looks to his own good more then theirs, and bids them take him for their Enemy, and so defend themselves if they can. <hi>Pag.</hi> 424.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. Though a Nation wrong their King, and so <hi>quoad Meritum causae,</hi> they are on the worser side, yet may he not lawfully war against the publick good on that account, nor any help him in such a war, because <hi>propter finem</hi> he hath the worser cause. <hi>Thes.</hi> 352.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet as he tells us</hi> (<hi>pag.</hi> 476.) we were to believe the Parliaments Declarations and Professions which they made, that the war which they raised was not against the King either in respect of his Authority, or of his Person; but only against Delinquent Subjects, and yet they actually fought against the King in person, and <hi>we are</hi> to believe (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pag. 422.) that men would kill them whom they fight against.</p>

               <head>Mr. <hi>Baxter's Doctrine</hi> concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> in particular.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>HE denies the Government of</hi> England <hi>to be Monarchical in these words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I, The real Soveraignty here amongst us was in King, Lords, and Commons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 72.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:59251:17"/>
               <p n="2">II. As to them that argue from the Oath of Supremacy and title given the King, I refer them (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>)<note place="margin">He might have refer'd them to himself, pag. 460. where he gives the same answer to the same objection.</note> to Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi>'s answer to <hi>Hobb</hi>'s Politicks, where he sheweth that the Title is often given in the single Person for the honour of the Commonwealth and his encouragement, because he hath an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minet interest, but will not prove the whole Soveraignty to be in him: and the Oath excludeth all others from without, not those whose interest is implied as conjunct with his—The eminent dignity and interest of the King above others allowed the name of a Monarchy or Kingdome to the Common wealth, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Soveraignty was mixed in the hands of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>pag.</hi> 88.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>He calls it</hi> a false supposition. 1. That the Soveraign power was onely in the King, and so that it was an absolute Monarchy. 2. That the Parliament had but onely the proposing of Laws, and that they were enacted onely by the Kings Authority upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. 3. That the power of Armes, and of Warre and peace was in the King alone. And therefore (saith he) those that argue from these false suppositions, conclude that the Parliament being Subjects, may not take up Arms without him, and that it is Rebellion to resist him; and most of this they gather from the Oath of Supremacy, and from the Parliaments calling of themselves his Subjects; but their ground (<hi>saith he</hi>) are sandy, and their superstructure false, <hi>pag.</hi> 459 &amp; 460.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us,</hi> That though the Parliament are Subjects in one capacity, yet have they their ptrt in the Soveraignty also in their higher capacity, <hi>Ibid. And upon this false and trayterous supposition he endeavours to justifie the late Rebellion, and his own more then ordinary activeness in it. For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. Where the Soverainty (<hi>saith he</hi>) is distributed into several hands (as the Kings and Parliaments) and the King invades the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part, they may lawfully defend their own by war, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject lawfully assist them, yea though the power of the Militia be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly given to the King, unlesse it be also exprest that it shall not be in the other. <hi>Thes.</hi> 363.</p>
               <p>The conclusion (<hi>saith he</hi>) needs no proof, because Soveraignty,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59251:17"/>
as such, hath the power of Arms and of the Laws themselves. The Law that saith the King shall have the <hi>Militia,</hi> supposeth it to be against Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not against the Common-wealth, nor them that have part of the Soveraignty with him. To resist him here is not to resist power but usurpation and private will; in such a case the Parliament is no more to be resisted than he. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. If the King raise War against such a Parliament upon their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dangers of the Common-wealth, the people are to take it as raised against the Common-wealth. <hi>Thes.</hi> 358.</p>
               <p>And in that case (saith he) the King may not only be resisted, but ceaseth to be a King, and entreth into a state of War with the people. <hi>Thes.</hi> 368.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Again, if a Prince that hath not the whole Soveraignty, be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Senate that hath the other part, and that in a just defensive War, that Senate cannot assume the whole Soveraignty, but supposeth that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>specie</hi> to remain, and therefore another King must be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, if the former be incapable. (<hi>Thes.</hi> 374.) <hi>as he tells us, he is,</hi> by ceasing to be King, <hi>in the immediately precedent</hi> Thes.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>And yet in the Preface to this Book he tells us that</hi> the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing (<hi>so he calls the murdering of one King, and the casting off of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) the Lords and Commons ruled alone; <hi>was not this to change the</hi> species <hi>of the Government? Which in the immediate words before he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> to be in King, Lords and Commons; which constitution (<hi>saith he</hi>) we were sworn, and sworn, and sworn again, to be faithful to, and to defend. <hi>And yet speaking of that Parliament which contrary to their Oaths changed this Government</hi> by ruling alone, and taking<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Preface to the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</hi> pag. 6.</note> upon them the Supremacy, he tells us that they were the best Governours in all the world, and such as it is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Subjects to depose upon pain of damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What then was he that deposed them? one would think Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>should have called him a Traytor, but he calls him in the same Preface,</hi> the Lord Protector, <hi>adding,</hi> That he did prudently, piously, faithfully, and to his immortal honour exercise the Government, <hi>which he left to his Son,</hi> to whom (<hi>as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>saith pag.</hi> 481.) he is bound to submit as set over us by God; and to obey for conscience sake, and to hehave himself as a Loyal Subject towards him, because (<hi>as he saith in the same place</hi>) a full and free Parliament had owned him: <hi>thereby implying, That a maimed and manacled House of Commons, without King and Lords, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the violent expulsion of the secluded Members,</hi> were a full and free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; <hi>and consequently that if such a Parliament should have taken Arms against the King, he must have sided with them. Yea, though they had been never so much in fault, and though they had been the beginners of the</hi>


                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59251:18"/>
                  <hi>War, for he tells us in plain and expresse terms,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII. That if he had known the Parliament had been the beginners of the War, and in most fault, yet the ruine of the Trustees and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and so of all the security of the Nation, being a punishment greater than any faults of theirs against the King could deserve from him, their faults could not dis-oblige him (<hi>meaning himself</hi>) from defending the Common-wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 480.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that he might do this lawfully, and with a good Conscience, he seems to be so confident, that in his Preface, he makes as it were a challenge, saying; that</hi> if any man can prove that the King was the highest power in the time of those Divisions, and that he had power to make that War which he made, he will offer his head to Justice as a Rebel.</p>
               <p>As if in those times of Division the King had lost or forfeited his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and the Parliament had not only a part, but the whole Soveraignty in themselves.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Finally Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us, pag.</hi> 486. That having often searched into his heart; whether he did lawfully engage into the War or not, and whether he did lawfully encourage so many thousands to it; he tells us, I say, that the issue of all his search was but this,—That he cannot yet see that he was mistaken in the main cause, nor dares he repent of it, not forbear doing the same, if it were to do again in the same state of things. <hi>He tells us indeed in the same place,</hi> that if he could be convinced he had sinned in this matter, he would as gladly make a publick recantation, as he would eat or drink: <hi>which seeing he hath not yet done, it is evident he is still of the same mind, and consequently would upon the same occasion do the same things,</hi> viz. <hi>fight, and encourage as many thousands as he could to fight against the King, for any thing that calls it self, or which he is pleased to call</hi> a full and free Parliament: <hi>as likewise that he would own and submit to any Usurper of the Soveraignty,</hi> as set up by God, <hi>although he came to it by the murder of his Master, and by trampling upon the Parliament.</hi> Lastly, <hi>That he would hinder as much as possibly he could, the restoring of the rightful Heir unto the Crown. And now whether a man of this Judgement, and of these affections, ought to be permitted to Preach or no, let any, but himself, judge.</hi>

               <head>A Letter unto a Person of Honour and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Containing some Animadversions upon the Bishop of <hi>Worcester's</hi> Letter.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Honourable and Worthy Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Am to thank You for the last piece of Divertisement you gave me, in sending the Bishop of <hi>Worcester's</hi> Letter, and I wish you would have let me enjoyed the satisfaction I took in reading it, without obliging me to give You my sense upon it: For besides my unwillingness to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in a Personal quarrel, it will not, I think, be very safe for any to engage against so angry an Adversary, which I shall be thought to do, though I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to speak nothing but Truth in the Character I intend to give of him; And it is briefly this, That, in fewer leaves I never yet read more Passion, which is so very predominant, that his disorderly and abrupt stile doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together partake of it; so that the Bishops best way will be, to get his Heat mistaken so Zeal, for else it may justly be accounted something that hath a worse Name, and which, in the Dog-dayes will be very dangerous.</p>
               <p>This being, Sir, my Judgement upon the whole Letter, You may well expect that I should make it good, by an Induction from particular instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but before I do this, I must deal impartially, and assure you, that as to the main Controversie, I think the Bishop hath much the better of Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> For if the Question between them, was as D. <hi>Gunning,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> do attest, such a Command is so evidently lawful, that I shall much wonder if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did ever dispute it; and till he doth clearly disprove that that was not the thing in Question, I must needs think that he hath much forgot himself in making an Imperfect and Partial Relation.</p>
               <p>Setting therefore aside the business of that particular Contest (wherein You see how much I am inclined to favour the Bishop) there are other things in his Letter of general Concernment, which I think lyable to just Exception; As,</p>
               <p>First, That he supposeth there is so strict an Union, and so inseperable a Dependence between <hi>Kings and Bishops, that they must stand and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and all who are Enemies to the one, must needs be Enemies to the other.</hi> I know very well this Axiom is much talked of, and some advantage may


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59251:19"/>
be taken to confirm it, from the event of our late Wars: You know like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, Sir, how much my Judgement is for the Order of Bishops; and how Passionate a Lover I am both of the Kings Person and Government, but yet, being thus called by You to declare the truth, though contrary to my own Humour and Interest, I must needs say, 1. It is clear from Story, that <hi>Kings</hi> were in all parts of the World, in their most flourishing Estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever <hi>Bishops</hi> were heard of; and no reason can be given, why what hath once been, may not with the same terms of convenience be again? 2. <hi>Bishops</hi> as they are by Law established in <hi>England,</hi> are purely the <hi>Kings subordinate Ministers, in the management of Ecclesiastical Affairs;</hi> which His Majesty may confer upon what order of men he pleases, though they be as much <hi>Lay persons</hi> as You and I are. It is therefore very injurious to the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> to averre that He could not otherwise uphold and maintain it, than by preserving the Undue, and, as some think, Antichristian Dignity and Prelation of His inferiour Officers. 3. <hi>Bishops</hi> are so little useful to support the <hi>Regal Dignity</hi> (which is founded upon a distinct Basis of its own) that upon enquiry it will be found, how none have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Enemies to the True and Undoubted Soveraignty of Princes, than some Bishops themselves: For by their Officious, and scarce warrantable, intermedling in Civil Affairs; by their Absurd and Insignificant distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Causes</hi> (of which last they have alwayes made themselves sole Judges) they mangle the Kings Authority, and as to <hi>Church-matters</hi> (which may be extended as far as they please) they leave the King nothing of <hi>Supremacy</hi> but the Name. The <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> therefore (who is the great Father of all such Bishops) hath impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Notion and Distinction so far that <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> he hath laboured to subject all Civil Empires unto his sole Jurisdiction. So that if the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s Rule hold good, of <hi>Crimine ab uno—Disce omnes,</hi> i. e. <hi>That all men who are of a Party may be</hi>

                  <hi>judged of by the miscarriages of one,</hi> then I must leave it to You to judge, what all those Bishops, that are of the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, do really drive at, by the fatal example of that one Bishops Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? For,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Assertion, <hi>That the Bishop of Worcester</hi> (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every other Bishop) <hi>is the sole Pastor of all the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Diocesse,</hi> if it be at all defensible, I am sure can be<note place="margin">Pag. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 3.</note> defended only by those Arguments, which are commonly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to maintain the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> over all Churches whatever. For since a Bishop can no otherwise discharge his duty herein, than by providing <hi>Substitutes,</hi> what hinders but the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> may as well oversee a million of Churches, as the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> five hundred?

Since if Deputation be lawful, more or less compass and circuit of ground doth not at all alter the case.

unacquainted with. For the <hi>Bishops</hi> instance of our Saviours <hi>putting to silence the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> is both Impertinent and False, because our Saviour did only <hi>silence them by Argument,</hi> which the Bishop may do when ever he is able; but what is that to an Authoritative and Imperious commanding men to be Silent. Besides, even then when our Saviour was most strict in pronouncing <hi>Woes</hi> against the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> in that very Chapter, he is so far from forbidding the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to preach, that he commands his Disciples both to Hear and to Obey their Doctrine.

                  <hi>State,</hi> by <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. There can be nothing more False, or more dishonourable unto our Civil Government, than to affirm that it lies in their power, not only to Punish, but likewise to exact a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,</hi> for those Faults which the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> have not only pardoned, but under severe Penalties commanded should never more be remembred: And therefore I doubt not, but they will resent this Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Ill-grounded Fancy. And since the Bishop is so over-zealous for the very Letter of the Law, when it imposes <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> give me leave a little to wonder, that one of his Profession and Place in the Church should so unchristianly go against it, when it enjoyns Moderation and Forgiveness as to Civil Injuries. Such as he, who make the Law, instead of being a <hi>Buckler</hi> to protect <hi>Converts,</hi> a <hi>Sword</hi> only to cut off all such as were once Offenders, labour what they can to make men Desperate, and thereby render the Peace of the Nation, and, in that, the prosperity and Welfare of His Majesty very Insecure and Hazardous. For what can more enrage Men to take Wild and Forbidden Courses, than to see even Preachers of the Gospel strive to widen their Wounds, and, contrary to their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Professions, to pull off that Plaister, which the Wisdom of our State Physicians had provided to heal our Distempers.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is Bold and Impious (I know not how to express it more mildly) what he affirms, that <hi>If to command an Act, which by accident may prove an occasion of sin, be sinful, then God himself cannot command any thing.</hi> For, though as I said before, I will by no means own that Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet, a thing, which by accident may become sinful, may be Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in another to command, for want of sufficient Authority, whereas Gods Soveraign power doth without dispute or controversy make all his Commands to be just; and therefore his Name ought not to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in our trivial disputes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because every such vain Use of it, is nothing but a diminution and lessening of his Greatness.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>That an Offence; to which a disproportionable Penalty is annexed, is not to be measured by the Quality of the Act considered in it self, but by the mischievous consequences it may produce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>ther this ought to hold good in <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> becomes neither the Bishop nor me to dispute: but in <hi>Divinity</hi> nothing can be more False and Dangerous. For to impose, in the Worship of God as necessary circumstances of it, things confessedly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial and needless; and, upon the forbearance of them, to debar any from the benefits first of Christian, and then of Civil Communion, is a thing which hath not the least pretence of Scripture or Primitive practice to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie it. For our Saviour tells us, That <hi>whoever were not against him, were for him;</hi> and the Apostle bids us <hi>to receive our weak Brother, and not to judge,</hi> much less to <hi>burden his Conscience.</hi> Unto which <hi>Sacred Canon;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59251:23"/>
can be more directly contrary, than what the Bishop most Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionately tells us, <hi>That the Laws do well to punish, even with non-admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament, such as will not, or perhaps dare not, kneel.</hi> And the Reason he gives is equally <hi>Apocrypha, Because,</hi> saith he, <hi>it becomes not the Law-givers to endanger the Churches peace for their sake:</hi> As if first, It did not much more become all Law-givers, in the things of God, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Law of Christ, which is a Law of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> Secondly, As if the Churches peace would not be much more endangered, by the pressing of things doubtful, than by the forbearance of them. For since by the enforcing of such things, as God hath no where commanded, our Christian liberty is entringed; from hence it follows, that, if we ought not, yet we lawfully may refuse to submit unto such Impositions; as our Saviour did <hi>in not washing his hands before Meat;</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the case of <hi>Circumcision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, As for the chain of Consequences, which the Bishop links and ties together. As that <hi>from Diversity in external Rites, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth Dislike; from Dislike, Enmity; from Enmity, Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>thence Schism in the Church, and Sedition in the State;</hi> For proof of which, he doth very virulently instance in our Unhappy times. To prevent which, he tells us, That <hi>the State cannot be safe without the Church, nor the Church without the Unity, nor Unity without Uniformity, nor Uniformity without a strict and rigorous Imposition.</hi> To all this I answer, that it is a meer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rope of Sand, and the Parts of his Chain do as little harg together, as <hi>Sampsons Foxes</hi> did before they were tied by the Tails, which course the Bishop hath imitated, not forgetting to put in even the <hi>Firebrand</hi> it self to make up the comparison. For 1. Nothing is more clear than that there hath been, nay ought to be, <hi>Diversity in external Forms,</hi> without any <hi>Dislike</hi> at all as to the Person of another: For the <hi>Apostles that preached to the Circumcision</hi> gave the right hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship unto the <hi>Apostles of the Gentiles;</hi> although their <hi>Outward Rites</hi> in publick Worship, were far more different, than those, which, by any of the most distant perswasions, are now practised in <hi>England.</hi> 2. The <hi>State</hi> may be preserved, without the least reference to the <hi>Church,</hi> unless it turns Persecuter of it; as is evident in those 300 years before <hi>Constantines</hi> time, in which there was no Church at all legally countenanced; and for some scores of years after, both the <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were equally advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and favoured. 3. <hi>Unity,</hi> I mean such as Christ came to establish (which is an <hi>Unity</hi> in heart and spirit) doth not in the least depend upon <hi>Uniformity</hi> but upon <hi>Charity, i. e.</hi> a Christian and a Candid forbearance of one another in things <hi>Circumstantial,</hi> when we agree in the <hi>Essentials of Worship;</hi> which is a thing, that meer Civility would teach, though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59251:23"/>
were silent in it. And whereas the Bishop thinks he hath got some advantage, by reviving the memory of our late <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> which, were he either Christian or Man enough, he would wish were eternally buried in silence) I must (to use his own Phrase) <hi>tell him in his ear,</hi> that our Wars did not arise from the separation of Conscientious Dissentors, but from the violence and Fury of Unconscionable Imposers: Who would not allow their Brethren (who desired nothing more than to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably by them) that sober Liberty, which the <hi>Law of God</hi> commanded, and no Law of Man could justly deprive them of. And whether the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick maintaining of the very same Positions and Practises, may not in time beget the same Feuds and Animosities, although this Bishop cares not, yet I doubt not, but His Majesty, as he now doth, so will alwayes graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Whether as to the matter of Fact, the <hi>French Protestants</hi> do enjoyn <hi>standing</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and the <hi>Dutch kneeling;</hi> I will labour to inform my self of some more Un<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>yassed witness than this Bishop; for in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> which I have carefully peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I can find no such matter. But if they did so, this would not at all justifie the Imposition of <hi>Kneeling;</hi> because 1. The Question is <hi>de Jure,</hi> whether it be lawful to prescribe any one such certain Posture, without submiting to which, it shall not be lawful to admit any to the Sacrament; and till the Affirmative of this be proved by Scriptures, Examples, and Instances from the Practice of men, will not satisfie a doubting consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Neither of those fore-mentioned Postures are so much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as <hi>Kneeling;</hi> because this last is manifestly more superstitious, for 1. It varies most of any from the <hi>First Pattern.</hi> 2. It hath been mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously abused by the <hi>Papists</hi> to <hi>Idolatry;</hi> which alone renders it most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to be practised, &amp; most Unwarrantable to be imposed: Especially, till it be again explained, as in the very first <hi>Liturgy</hi> of all it was; which I particularly mention, to shew how little our <hi>Reformation</hi> since <hi>Edw. 6th.</hi> time, hath been improved.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As it was Needlesly, so was it likewise Uncharitably done, to revile the whole Body of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> for the Faults of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> upon supposition that either he is a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or so culpable as the Bishop would make him. For since every man is <hi>to bear his own Burden,</hi> what Bible did the Bishop find it in, that he might without scruple, asperse a whole order of Men, for the pretended miscarrige of one; who, by the Bishop's own Confession, was not of so Amicable and com<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

The Custom being that men were only once for all examined, at their first coming to the Sacrament; which the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self allows under other Names of being Catechised and Instructed.

               <p>Lastly, I can never enough commend the Bishops wisdom, in resolving so angrily never to write again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he is Old, and hath Travelled far, and knows that it is much easier to speak rash and unjustifiable things, than to defend them. And therefore he deals with those, that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, as witty School-boyes do with their Companions, first he hits them a box on the Ear, and then very discreetly retreats, and fairly runs away. But if <hi>Goliah,</hi> who took upon him to defie the Host of <hi>Israel,</hi> should as soon as ever he had dope, have sneaked out of the Field, and thought he had done manfully enough in making a bold Challenge, and in shewing his Teeth at them; I believe the <hi>Philistines</hi> would hardly have thanked him for that Empty shew of Valour, whereby he could not Conquer, but only Enrage the Enemy. And whether the Bishops will not have the same opinion of this over-forward and unwary Champion of theirs, I hope, Sir, you will neither enquire your self, nor desire that I should: For I have already done enough to shew how much I am,</p>

               <head>A Second Letter unto a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Quality, containing some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions upon the Bishop of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's</hi> Letter.

                  <salute>Honourable and worthy Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU much surprized me in your last, wherein you acquainted me, that the Letter I sent you (which was the hasty issue of one or two leasure hours, and therefore very unfit for Publick View) was by your self, to prevent the trouble of transcribing, communicated to the World; and the Result, you tell me, is, that many sober Persons (who thought it very fit that the Bishop should be a little humbled) are much satisfied by it, but the Bishop himself so far concerned, that he hath employed one <hi>L'S</hi>—to answer it. Truly, Sir, I am so taken with this last part of your News, that, instead of prosecuting my resentments against the Reverend Bishop (which nothing but Publick Considerations made me take up (I now begin to pity him; and am heartily sorry he should be driven to so desperate a shift, as that, for want of better Champions, he is forced to commit his Cause to the Patronage of such a Pen, whose De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will more dishonour him than the sharpest Accusation. For who that knows any thing of Civility and Learning, doth not know, that the Character you give of that <hi>L'S</hi>—is not more sharp than serious, when you call him a Person so lost to all good Breeding, of so forfeited, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done a Reputation in point of meet Morality, that for a Bishop, so much as to countenance him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a crime which some Councels have pronounced <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n <hi>Anathema</hi> against; but to employ him, and to think, that either he is fit to manage such Nice Points as that Letter glanceth upon; or that such indigested stuffe as he must needs disgorge, will not create a <hi>Nausea</hi>


                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59251:26"/>
and Loathing in all Sober Readers, is altogether as improper, as if the Bishop should set (to use a Phrase which that Gentleman understands) <hi>a Hog to play upon his Organs,</hi> or appoint a Scavenger to wash his Surplice; the very attempting of which would betray, that he loved neither Musick nor Cleanlinesse.</p>
               <p>I must confess Sir, I am very tender of the Bishops Reputation, and there is yet a possibility for him to recover his Credit again; For though he be a little Angry, yet the World must needs acknowledge, that he is a plain dealing man; since his Dudgeon phrase of<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>this is the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth,</hi> with such kind of Home-spun. Harmless Elegancies that are scattered in his Letter, Savour very much of the old <hi>English</hi> Breeding, and call to mind the Trunk-Breeches, and Wooden Daggers of our Ancestors; who I believe, spake all in the same uncounterfeit stile, which it well becomes a Bishop who loves Antiquity, to imitate: But for him now to grow weary of this Primitive simplicity, to suspect his own strength, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust <hi>Mounsieur Le Friske</hi> the Morice-dancer to undertake his Quarrel; To chuse one for his Champion, who hath been a Fidler in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would have been a Fidler to the worst of them (for which end he knows how many pitiful Begs and Faces he made, to scrape acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Tyrant <hi>Oliver</hi>) for him now to be suddenly advanced so much beyond his Art, will run the poor man into a dangerous <hi>Vertigo;</hi> and in the mean while much discredit the Bishops Cause, as if he could get none to maintain it but this common Barreter, this Mercenary Song<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that for two Crowns more will change his Note, and rail against his Patron.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, if possible, much more low and mean being my Opinion of that Whiffling and Thin souled Adversary you mention, give me leave to tell you, that I am so little concerned in any thing he intends to write, that since you resolved to divulge the Letter I sent you, I am sorry you did not likewise publish my Name to the World to; that so, another, whom, as you tell me, he designes to fall upon, might not, upon Mistake, have the Credit of his Calumnies; since every Reproach from him (who hath not let any thing Sacred, whether Person or Doctrine, escape his venomous Pasquils) I look upon as a Signal Mark of Honour, beyond what any other Epitaph can give me. As when men scatter Dung upon a Garden, the Flowers grow more Fair and Fragant ever after; So were I ambitious of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Name, I think I could not more speedily procure it among all good men, than by entreating that <hi>L'S</hi>—to appear against me.</p>
               <p>As therefore, Sir, you love my Credit, manage this Design for me, and promote the Work as much as you can; And by divulging my true Name,


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59251:27"/>
let not any Jot of the Commendation he designes me, be derived upon that Gentleman you mention, whose Vein, if I mistake not, lies in another way. However, Sir, if there be no Help, but the Innocent must suffer, pray think so Nobly of me, as that I do religiously intend to follow your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and not offer to answer one, who would fain be Answered, that he might appear Considerable. I will not, Sir, by taking any notice of him, suffer him to Rail himself into Reputation: But as hitherto, with all his little <hi>Witticismes,</hi> and Twenty <hi>Good morrows</hi> (to shew what Trade he drives) he could never gain so much Respect from any, as to deserve a Confutation; So shall I let him pass still, like <hi>Bessus</hi> in the Comedy, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in his own Want of Worth, and by that, safe from Censure. And thus, Sir, I dismiss that Puny Authour, unto his Learned Labours, of which, you tell me, he is now lying in; And if there be any Vertue in Sack (for he drinks and writes in the same measure, only with this Difference, that what goes in Wine, comes out Water) the Women of <hi>Turnball-Street</hi> shall not long be unfurnished of a Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, to conclude with something more serious, I can assure you; that I am perfectly reconciled to the Bishop, and will point him out a Fair and Noble way of righting himself. For, setting aside those Merry Passages in my Letter, which his too much Heat gave but too just an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for, I give you free Leave to acquaint both him and the World, that I intend to make him an Acknowledgment as submiss as any Canon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he will either by Writing, or Conference, make good any of these Positions, which he asserts in his Book, and against which, I have briefly subjoyned my Reasons.</p>
               <p>Pos. 1. <hi>That Monarchy cannot consist without Episcopacy. Neg.</hi> F<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Monarchy was many 1000. Years before Episcopacy, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrably may be without it.</p>
               <p>Pos. 2. <hi>That the Bishop of</hi> Worcester <hi>is the Sole and Immediate Pastor of all the Congregations in his Diocesse. Neg.</hi> For it is utterly against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule, to extend the Name of Pastor, beyond the Flock which one actually feeds.</p>
               <p>Pos. 3. <hi>That it is unlawful for any, though Ordained, to preach in the Bishop of</hi> Worcester'<hi>s Diocesse, without his License. Neg.</hi> For Ordination is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient License, which runs as the Apostles Commission did, <hi>Go preach the Gospel;</hi> without being confined to Place, or needing a new License.</p>
               <p>Pos. 4. <hi>That it is Lawful in the Worship of God, to enjoyn a small thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a great Penalty. Neg.</hi> For we have no Warrant for such an Imposition in the Word of God, which ought to be the sole Rule of all Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>Pos. 5. <hi>That the Church hath Power to exact Confession and Recantation,</hi>


                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59251:27"/>
                  <hi>for those Crimes which the State hath pardoned. Neg.</hi> For, as to Coercive Power and Jurisdiction, there is no difference at all between the Church and State.</p>
               <p>Pos. 6. <hi>That the Presbyterians</hi> (I suppose, he means, not Imposers of their own Formes, but barely Dissenters from those Imposed by others) <hi>are all Seditious. Neg.</hi> For it is against their publick Confession of Faith; which, as the 39. Articles, and Church-Canons are of the Episcopal, so that ought to be the Test of the Presbyterian Perswasion.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, You see I am willing to reduce this Controversie unto a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Calm way of Debate, and if the Bishop, or any sober Person for him, will undertake to maintain, either all, or any of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Positions, I will either make good my Negative, or declare my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>And because, Sir, it is possible you may be asked, Who it is that thus boldly makes a Challenge unto one of our Learned Prelates? Your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Knowledge of me can abundantly satisfie them, that he is very much for Bishops, more for the King, most of all for the Purity and Peace of Religion; And were he not for all these, in their Due and Just Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he thinks you would not own him for,</p>
