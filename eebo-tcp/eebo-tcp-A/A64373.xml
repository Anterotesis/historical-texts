            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH <hi>the Being of a God is,</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>first and most fundamental Article;</hi> yet it may be prov'd by some forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Reason.</hi> This <hi>may</hi> be done, but the attempt seems unnecessary in a Christian

            <p>For these two <hi>Remarks</hi> are here offer'd by the Royal Psalmist in the <hi>Text; The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God: they are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is none that doth good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> does, here,</p>

            <p>Take notice of the Folly of those who <hi>live without God in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They can never be without his <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101737:3"/>
Presence,</hi> nor always without an in ward <hi>sense</hi> of it; there is no worldly Charm that can, perpetually, keep the Conscience from such reflections; but <hi>whilst</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main insensible of a God, <hi>their way is their Folly.</hi> And</p>
            <p>1st. <hi>They want Knowledge and Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>They want Wisdom and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ist.</hi> They <hi>want Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and commit wonderful mistakes about Principles common to Mankind. For as a <hi>natural Fool</hi> may sometimes speak a shrewd and seasonable thing; so an <hi>irreligious</hi> one, tho he has, in other respects, ability of mind (as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> themselves had, being <hi>wise in their generation;)</hi> yet with reference to the Existence of a Deity, he is guilty of gross and palpable Errors: None deserve
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101737:4"/>
those Epithetes more than these that sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; <hi>viz. That there is an Effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cause.</hi> That <hi>an insufficient Cause can produce a perfect and sufficient Effect.</hi> That <hi>something (without an Almighty Power) can come out of nothing.</hi> They are to be derided rather than confuted; who shall have the confidence to say, That a <hi>House had no Builder;</hi> that all the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> fell into that useful <hi>Order</hi> by <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> and that the <hi>Master</hi> of the House <hi>Sprung</hi> at last, out of the very <hi>Frame</hi> of it: The <hi>Atheist</hi> does not say this in terms, but he maintains that which is equally absurd: For, seeing the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> are imperfect beings, and did not, could not make themselves; he that denies that a God, or a First, and absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, was the Maker of them, does by consequence, set before us imperfect Causes and Effects, existing without a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101737:4"/>
Cause. And seeing all things are made in <hi>Number, Weight,</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> either he shews his stupidness in not <hi>discerning</hi> the Footsteps of Wisdom in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful frame of Nature, which appears the more regular, the greater portion a man has of the knowledg of the Lines and Figures of Bodies, and the Rules of Motion; or he ascribes all this to <hi>Chance</hi> (which yet is a word he ought not to use, who makes all Causes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary) and maintains, that <hi>Confusion</hi> is the most wise Parent of <hi>Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing, also, he makes the <hi>Soul</hi> to be the <hi>Temper of the Body;</hi> and the substance, and the modese and motions of it are as distinct from Understanding, as is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and movement of any other Engine, from a reasoning mind; he makes <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> to be the Spring of <hi>Something;</hi> that is, the Constitution of the Body,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101737:5"/>
which hath no thought, nor any thing from whence it can possihly come, to be the Cause of Thought, of Judgment, of Wisdom, of Conscience.</p>
            <p>But (as one of that sort of men has written in one of his Intervals) <q>'Tis very <note place="margin">Decam. Physiolog. p. 130, 131</note> hard to believe, that to produce all the several and curious <hi>Organs of Sense and Memory,</hi> could be the work of any thing that had not Understanding:</q> And he might have added, <hi>Much more of the Understanding it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Error is still the more gross, because the Godless person holds it to be an Error, whilst he denies the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World <hi>out of nothing;</hi> and then sees not that it is one, when he speaks of the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> out of that which hath nothing <hi>of Soul</hi> in it. Such <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> is a plain indication of want of judgment; and ungodly men are, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101737:5"/>
more particulars, at variance with themselves.</p>
            <p>As <hi>for example;</hi> In <hi>Health</hi> they are <hi>Atheists;</hi> and in <hi>Sickness, Superstitious;</hi> They say, all <hi>we do</hi> is <hi>necessary;</hi> and yet <hi>blame</hi> some Actions, and <hi>commend</hi> others. They have no <hi>Faith</hi> about Divine <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,</hi> even those which have been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently fulfill'd in the Coming and Death of Christ, and the precise times of them; yet they can put their trust in <hi>Astrology,</hi> which is not so much as <hi>good guessing.</hi> They <hi>scoff</hi> at Good men, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wish, that <hi>their latter end were like heirs.</hi> They mock at <hi>the Being of Ghosts,</hi> in the <hi>light,</hi> and dread them in the <hi>dark.</hi> In <hi>company</hi> they deny the <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> of Evil <hi>Spirits;</hi> and fear to be <hi>all alone</hi> in the <hi>night,</hi> lest Evil Spirits should <hi>fetch them away.</hi> In fine, men that live without God, are so destitute of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101737:6"/>
that they are a <hi>riddle to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, even whilst they think they have asserted their Liberty, and that they are perfect Masters of themselves, they are <hi>led captive by the Devil at his will;</hi> for <hi>he rules in the hearts of the disobedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This shews <hi>that part of</hi> their Folly, which consists in want of <hi>Knowledg</hi> and steddy <hi>Judgment.</hi> And there is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> A <hi>great deal</hi> that gives us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the <hi>other part of it,</hi> their <hi>want of Wisdom,</hi> even that of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the doing of things for their own benefit, safety, and comfort. For,</p>
            <p>1st. <hi>They use means contrary to their ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly. <hi>They run an infinite hazard, upon inconsiderable motives.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101737:6"/>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Those who <hi>say in their hearts, There is no God, manifest their want of Wisdom and Discretion, by using means contrary to their End.</hi> For one great pretended End of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Unbelief,</hi> is a <hi>deliverance from fear,</hi> 
               <note n="⸪" place="margin">Lucret. l. 1.

            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Fear which hath Torment,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise be wholly prevented, than either by <hi>Innocence,</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Application to God;</hi> and for the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> it brings into the bosom that <hi>Anxiety</hi> which it pretends to expel; for men having had experience of

their own impotence and imperfection, and of the weakness and deceitfulness of others, and observing the daily <hi>changes</hi> and <hi>chances</hi> of this world, can by no means be secur'd against them, but by the belief of an <hi>over-ruling Providence,</hi> and the performance of such things as may secure to them the Protection of it. He only who is not conscious to himself of guilt unrepented of, who is sincere in his duty to God and Man, is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining without despair, if he should perceive the frame of Nature ready to be dissolv'd. Our Saviour's question carries its answer along with it; <hi>Why are yee fearful, O yee of little faith?</hi> A weak Faith is scarce sufficent to keep out fear and trouble: What Peace then can there be, where there is no <hi>faith at all?</hi> What Peace can there be to the Wicked, remaining such, who are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101737:7"/>
without God, without Providence, without inward Comfort, without help in Nature; without hope in this World, or the Other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The want of Wisdom, in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious men, is seen, by the <hi>infinite hazard they run, upon inconsiderable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi>

            <p>And upon what Temptation is it, that they make this perillous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>Why! for the sake of a few vile Lusts, and inordinate Passions, the fruit of which is present shame, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience: They lose their hopes of being like <hi>Angels</hi> for ever, that they may enjoy

a few <hi>Brutal Pleasures</hi> for a few days on earth.</p>
            <p>A man would mortifie all those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Appetites, with respect even to the <hi>dignity</hi> of his own nature, and for the Interests of this life, upon the account of which this foolish sinner parts with a blessed Eternity.</p>
            <p>Wisdom would prescribe Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Justice, Gratitude, Peaceableness, decent speaking, and the like, if there were no other World; much more does it require obedience to the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Commands of Religion, when they are means to the comforts both of this life, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Nothing was more remote from Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than the choice of <hi>Esau;</hi> what man of common understanding would have lost his birth-right, to satisfie an impatient appetite, which might in a little time have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101737:8"/>
bin appeas'd, without the loss either of Birth-right, or Health? Who then is the foolish Merchant? He, doubtless, who whilst he deals in the World, parts with a present certainty upon the probable hopes of very great gain; But will not part with so much as a Vice which is of no profit to him (with so much as <hi>an Oath</hi> which offends others, and weakens his Credit among them, and brings him no imaginable Advantage) upon the <hi>Hopes</hi> of Life eternal.</p>
            <p>Now the Folly of such Persons is the more notorious, because, whilst they are blind, they look upon themselves as those, who see furthest into the causes of things. Thus it happen'd to the ungodly among the <hi>Romans; professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to such Folly as consists both in the want of Judgment, and of Wisdom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101737:9"/>
in the best things, may sitly be joyn'd, that which <hi>David</hi> (in the second place) takes notice of in the Text, The <hi>vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of those who live without Religion: Which is <hi>two fold;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The vileness of their <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Disposition;</hi> They are <hi>corrupt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>vileness</hi> of their Practice, <hi>They have done abominable works; There is none that doth good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Atheistical Persons are <hi>vile</hi> in their <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>inclination. They are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> or they have corrupted, first them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and then their works. There is rottenness at the <hi>heart of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Na-bhal</hi> is the Original word. From thence a Writer <note n="a" place="margin">Bythn.</note> on the Text, will have that of <hi>Nebulo</hi> derived. He fails in his Etymologie, but his meaning is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101737:9"/>
good; For he would suggest thus much to us, that it is the <hi>knavish man</hi> who <hi>hath said in,</hi> or to <hi>his heart, There is no God.</hi> He is of so villanous a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as, whilst he believes there is a God, to wish there <hi>were none,</hi> because his Vices cannot approve themselves to Wisdom, and Justice, and Holiness.</p>
            <p>Immorality is the beginning of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, and Atheism is the strengthning of Immorality; for the Immoral first would be glad there were no God, and what they desire they readily believe; and when once they so believe, then they are confirm do and encourag'd in their Vices, and sin with Assurance.</p>
            <p>For Atheism begins, not from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of a sound Mind <note n="*" place="margin">Tarq. fatuus, insanus.</note> in a sober Temper, but in a sensual Disposition, which inclines Men to seek out sor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whereby they may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101737:10"/>
into an opinion of the safety of living in a course that pleases them</p>
            <p>What they assert through sensuality, that they do, and when they have done it, they study to make a defence, both that the sting of Conscience may not give any pain to them, and that they may have something to say to those who reprove them.</p>
            <p>It was from the corrupt hearts of the Rulers, Elders, Scribes, <hi>Annas</hi> the High Priest, <hi>Caiphas, John, Alexander,</hi> and others;</p>
            <p>It was (I say) from their love of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, and their fear of being look'd upon as openly confuted, that They endeavour'd to stifle a plain <hi>Miracle</hi> which God wrought by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> in healing a lame Man, instead of being convinced by it. When They saw <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 4. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> the boldness of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101737:10"/>
and perceived that they were unlearn'd and ignorant Men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus, And beholding the Man which was healed standing with them, <hi>they could say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against it.</hi> Put when they had commanded them to go aside out of the Council, they conferred among themselves, saying, What shall we do to these Men? for that indeed <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miracle hath been done by them, is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</hi> But <hi>that it spread no further among the People,</hi> let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no Man in this Name.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To the pure all things are pure, but to the defiled, nothing is pure, but the very Conscience is defiled,</q> the sense
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101737:11"/>
they have of things is (by their ill temper) perfectly corrupted.</p>
            <p>If Men had in them a principle of <hi>Probity,</hi> and were inclin'd to seek neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Truths, and the Rules of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with impartiality, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find them; but having some Lusts or other earthly Interests to gratifie, the corrupt Heart, biasseth the judgment; <hi>and they will not understand nor seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God.</hi> When you speak of a <hi>just God,</hi> to an <hi>unjust Man;</hi> of a <hi>holy God,</hi> to an <hi>unclean Man;</hi> of a <hi>merciful God,</hi> to a <hi>cruel Man;</hi> of a God that is <hi>good,</hi> and do's good, to a <hi>covetous</hi> Man; of a God of <hi>condescension,</hi> to a <hi>proud</hi> Man; of a <hi>long suffering</hi> God, to a <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Man; of a God that <hi>rules over all,</hi> to an <hi>untractable</hi> Man; of a God that will call every Man to an <hi>account,</hi> to an unjust <hi>Steward;</hi> you speak of Pearls to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101737:11"/>
Swine: nay, each of these, has not only no value for such a God; but there is in them, a wicked prejudice against the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a Deity; <hi>there</hi> is an interest (tho' a wretched one) made by their earthly Affections, in their Hearts against the Being of him. When you speak of a <hi>Heaven</hi> where they neither eat nor drink to an <hi>Epicure;</hi> of the Idolatry of the worship of <hi>Diana</hi> to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and others who get their living by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Silver <hi>Models</hi> of her Temple; you speak to those whom Pleasure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest have rendred deaf.</p>
            <p>If a Man could see into the Breast of a <hi>godless Person,</hi> what a Cave of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would he look into? What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governableness of Spirit would he behold; what an unwillingness to own any Lord over it? What heighth of pride would he find there? <hi>The wicked through the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101737:12"/>
pride of his countenance will not seek after God; God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How is such a one puffed up with this vain conceit that He understands the deepest secrets of Nature, and is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than all the Men of all Ages, who have by the things that are seen, ascended to the acknowledgment of an invisible God? What uncharitableness would he see in such a Person, rendring him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful of all the World as designing, and unfaithful? for they that live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, mete by the Measures of their own dishonest Hearts.</p>
            <p>What disgust would be given him by many filthy and monstruous Lusts, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by their impure steams, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of knowing Men, and driving them impetuously into such beastly Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as are the shame and peril, as well as the degeneracy of humane nature?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101737:12"/>
From Hearts so corrupt cannot but proceed <hi>first, wishes of Atheism,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> they have deluded themselves into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that they have their wish, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>but follow</hi> (what I am next to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>vileness</hi> of their practice. <hi>They have done abominable works; there is none that doth good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> There is a natural tendency to such abominable practice, in the Heart of godless Men</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is true in fact, that their Practice is, the <hi>Omission of all good,</hi> and the <hi>Commission of presumptuous evils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a tendency to such abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practices in the Heart of Godless Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Unbelievers</hi> have pretended to regulate their practice by Honour, by Decency, by Discretion, by cunning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101737:13"/>
Craft; they have pretended to sin by Method, and to act with worldly Safety.</p>
            <p>But where there is so ill a Heart, so brutishly inclin'd, so given up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sense, so void of the Grace of God; it will, upon temptation and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, break forth into the most exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable abominations.</p>
            <p>Our Laws suppose all Murthers, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries,' Thefts, and other such viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, to be acted by Persons, who have <hi>not the fear of God before their Eyes.</hi> That is the Bridle which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them, if they are not past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
            <p>And if those, who <hi>believe</hi> in general, <hi>that God is,</hi> but consider not what they believe, and forget him, and have him not in their Thoughts, commit very black Crimes: certainly they preserve not themselves innocent, who are by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101737:13"/>
Heart, inchanted into this worst of persuasions, that <hi>there is no God at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All find it difficult to live a holy and blameless lise after having entertain'd good Principles; after much consideration, and striving to master themselves, and Prayer to God for his Assistance. How impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then is it, that those should be free from presumptuous evils, who neither fear God, nor regard Man; who make Sense their Guide; who rather give up the Reins to brutal nature, than endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to govern it.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>2dly,</hi> It is true in fact that their practice is the <hi>omission of all good,</hi> and <hi>the commission of presumptuous evils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>good,</hi> that, saith <hi>David,</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>omitted</hi> amongst them, <hi>There is none of them that doth good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that ungodly Men do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that which is <hi>materially good,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101737:14"/>
but it is not from the true motives of Goodness. The <hi>unjust Judge</hi> did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <note place="margin">Luke 18. 5.</note> but 'twas upon <hi>Importunity,</hi> and to avoid being wearied. Ill Men do good, not because it is an imitation of God, or pleasing to him; because it is beneficial to the Community of which they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; because it is a means to <hi>find mercy at that day:</hi> they will not give up <hi>a cup of mater to a Disciple of</hi> our blessed Master Jesus <hi>in the name of a Disciple.</hi> For they cannot act by principles which they have not: but, with the <hi>Publicans,</hi> they do one Courtesie to receive another; and they have a hook in every gift: They some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do a good office for good Men who may honour them before the People, and serve them in another way: But the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they most readily support, are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites, Flatterers, the Instruments of their Lust, Injustice and Revenge, and such
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101737:14"/>
who <hi>know their several Abominations,</hi> and for that reason are <hi>fear'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Good they do is not <hi>properly good.</hi> But</p>
            <p>2dly, For their Evils, they are <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil;</hi> They are all manner of Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities in the <hi>Root</hi> of them: For if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists</hi> actually forbear any Evil, it is not from Conscience (for that they have not) but from fear of the Law, or of those they depend on, or publick Infamy, or expence, or disease, or from impotence, or want of opportunity.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two sorts</hi> of their <hi>evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi> which I shall take notice of, from the <hi>second Chapter</hi> of the Book of <hi>Wis-dom</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>abominable sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> is, cruel and <hi>unmerciful oppression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101737:15"/>
1. For the <hi>first, Their abominable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,</hi> holy <hi>David</hi> observes in <hi>verse</hi> 3. that <hi>they are altogether become filthy.</hi> Their filthiness is thus describ'd in the 6, 7, 8, and 9th Verses of the forementioned Book of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> 
               <q>Come on,—let us enjoy the good things that are present; and let us speedily use the Creatures like as in youth: Let us fill our selves with costly Wine and Oyntments; and let no Flower of the Spring pass by us. Let us crown our selves with Rose-buds before they be wither'd; let none of us go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his part of our voluptuousness; let us leave tokens of our <hi>joyfulness</hi> (that name they give to their Lusts and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) in every street.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This course, being very <hi>expensive,</hi> brings on,</p>
            <p>The <hi>second part</hi> of their abominable practice, which is <hi>cruel and unmerciful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101737:15"/>
The Author of that Book doth therefore, in the <hi>tenth Verse,</hi> go on after this manner, <q>Let us oppress the poor righteous man; let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let our strength be the law of Justice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that whensoever any one shews his Neighbour a <hi>godless Man,</hi> his Neighbour can immediately shew him a Monster made up of the Goat, the Swine, the Wolf, the Lion; if I may allow him any thing so generous as, they say, there is in that King of the Forest.</p>
            <p>After all this manifestation of the <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>vileness</hi> of such as <hi>are without God in the World;</hi> It is time in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third place</hi> to think what <hi>is fit,</hi> in this case, for those to do, <hi>who believe in God;</hi> both <hi>first as to themselves,</hi> and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, To those who believe not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101737:16"/>
And, <hi>first, for our selves,</hi> who believe in God, and in Jesus Christ whom he has sent; It is necessary to keep our <hi>Faith</hi> from <hi>deadness,</hi> by the exercises of holy <hi>Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Devils</hi> do more than the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,</hi> for they believe; but because they promote infidelity in others, and obey not themselves, they are Devils still.</p>
            <p>If we own a God, it is our duty to <hi>glorifie him as God;</hi> otherwise <hi>our Faith is vain,</hi> and the unfruitfulness of it will be the Aggravation of our sin; and if we desire not to <hi>retain God in our knowledge,</hi> and to honour him with the Talent with which he has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted us; he will deliver us up to those vile Affections over which a Victory is to be obtained by a living Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101737:16"/>
But if we adorn our Belief by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Life, that will be a means to save our selves, and to gain others; at least, to <hi>put to silence the Ignorance of foolish Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. With relation to such,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All should <hi>learn to distrust,</hi> and to be watchful. For what Confidence can be put in a Man that thinks not of a God that will call him to an Account? who measures all things by Power and personal Humour or Interest? Who if he pursues his Principles, must never speak Truth, nor do Justice against his private Ends?</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Persons should <hi>pray to God,</hi> not to work Miracles before Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, not to call up Men from the Dead, and send Ghosts to convince them; but to give them Grace to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101737:17"/>
to the <hi>sufficient Means</hi> which are offer'd to them in the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All judicious good Men should endeavour to become part of the Means of their Conversion, by sound Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, by exemplary Lives, and by bearing, not with mean Cowardise, but with Courage and Patience, their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Scorn; not <hi>answering Fools accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Folly;</hi> but shewing them that True Religion can govern those Passions, which make them, as <hi>raging Waves,</hi> to <hi>foam out their own shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It concerns all <hi>Masters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> to defend their Threshold against the Footsteps of the Ungodly, who will tempt their <hi>Children,</hi> and their <hi>Servants</hi> to Lust and Prodigality, and to the Supports of them, Theft, and imbezlement of Goods.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All <hi>Churches</hi> should, as far as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101737:17"/>
possible, discountenance <hi>Superstition,</hi> and loosness of Life.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They should banish far from them all <hi>Frauds</hi> abusively call'd <hi>Pious,</hi> all fabulous Legends, all feigned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, all absurd and superstitious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices, which beget and nourish Atheism; for these, where they are discover'd, blemish Religion in those who are educated in such Societies; for they have taken that in which they have been bred, for <hi>All Religion;</hi> and rejecting that, with it they <hi>reject all.</hi> They distinguish not betwixt the Impostures of Men, and the Truths of God, the Light of whose <hi>Word</hi> is taken from them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Where there are not such <hi>Frauds,</hi> or they are <hi>not discover'd;</hi> Men who have liv'd <hi>loosly,</hi> and without any Principles, not being able to content
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101737:18"/>
the Conscience without some Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will at last run from the extream of <hi>Atheism</hi> to that of <hi>Superstition.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having liv'd <hi>Infidels,</hi> they will die <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no where so great a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest for Romish Missionaries, as where Men, under the true Light of the Gospel, have no Religion at all.</p>
            <p>And a Church that will keep out <hi>Popery,</hi> must, as far as it can be done by its Discipline, mortify Lewdness and Profaneness.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It behoveth all <hi>Civil Governours</hi> to animadvert upon Atheism, as that which supplants the Foundation of all Humane Society.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalm</hi> is supposed to have been penned upon occasion of the Conspiracy of <hi>Absolom,</hi> and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Wickedness of that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101737:18"/>
which gave occasion to it, and to the spreading of Atheism. It was an Age so corrupt, that <hi>David</hi> seems to compare it to the State of the Old World before the Flood, at which time <hi>the Earth was filled with Violence,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and all Flesh had corrupted its Ways.</hi> We read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. That <hi>those who spake Evil of God, spake Evil of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. They who will not fear God, will not inwardly reverence Man. They who scoff at Religion as <hi>Priest-Craft,</hi> will, under the Name of <hi>Prince-Craft,</hi> despise Civil Government. If such universally prevail'd, they would ruin all Kingdoms, by taking away all Faith and Trust, which is the Ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. They would make all <hi>Publick Pacts</hi> and Covenants of none effect, by removing <hi>Conscience,</hi> which ties Men to the performance of their <hi>Words</hi> and
