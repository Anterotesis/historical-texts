         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Prince of Orange that is a knowne Souldier, and hath deſerved much of the Eſtates, will not brooke this oppoſition; but finding that the common people eſteeme Princes and Souldiers only in the field, and doe forget their brave ſervice, accounting them for ſervice, only their ſervants, and then prove ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Beſides, a Prince incenſed can endure no vulgar weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtrong onely in baſe thoughts and contempt of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities, as your plebeians are in England. From theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives much diſturbance is like to proceed: For when vulgar ſtrength and Principality meet, they are like torrents, that mutually oppoſe one another. Theſe growing evils are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by malignants, as you have; ſome declare themſelves for the Prince, ſome for the States: and I know not whether they have learned the Art of oppoſing Princes, by adhering to your Parliament; but beleeve it, we fore-ſee what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

miſchiefes the Fates have plotted againſt us, and what blood muſt be drawne from our owne veines, or rather vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pride and ambition, and competition for prerogative, drawing us on to murther one another, as you (according to intelligence given us) did at Kenton battell: Our hopes are weake concerning any pacification; but our feares are great that the Low-countries have ſeen their beſt and moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing daies: for warre doth ſhut up all trading and commerce; and where it doth once enter, it deſtroyes whole kingdomes, it brings in wretched miſery, and all ſorts of ineffable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. What paſſionate words can declare the bleeding ſtate of a kingdome diſtracted by civill warre? Our daily intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your affaires, doth make great impreſſions of feare in us, that our diſagreement between the Prince of Orange and the States, will at laſt (as your contention in England did) break out into a civill warre. In regard of the firme league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and Holland, and the good ſervice our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey hath done unto that Kingdome, by fruſtrating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall deſignes of many Spaniſh Fleets, and ſinking their tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſhips in the mercileſſe ſeas, I perſwade me, that the report of theſe growing diſſentions amongſt us, will make ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to compare your preſent ſtate with ours. Prerogatives claimed on both ſides, doth thruſt us on to fight, and our great power flatters us, that we have both right unto that which we pretend. The Prince and the States are united and ſeparated, as the King and Parliament are in England, by the affection of the people, and I fear that this our diviſion can bring nothing but ruine. Ioyne with us therefore in your prayers, that it would pleaſe God to ſettle and compoſe the diſtracted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your Kingdome, to eſtabliſh your King in peace, and the generall affection of his ſubiects, and vanquiſh all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:155695:4"/>
in his owne Army; and that our countrey looking on your calamity, may clearly behold it ſelfe, and what wee ſhall be if we fall out about words. It is a ſtrong peece of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels ſubtilty, to provoke nature to ſhedding of blood, let the cauſe be never ſo good, his ends are cloſe and private, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of kingdomes is that whereat his malice doth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aime. But we hope ambition ſhall not make us butcher and murther one another, as you have done: And ſince ſome part of Englands ſtrength muſt needs live and dye with Hollands happineſſe, let your prayers beſeech heaven for peace in both countries, to prevent our warre, and ſet a period to yours.</p>
