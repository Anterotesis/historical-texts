            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you please to turne to the 19. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and to read from the 24. to the 33. <hi>verse</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> there is there mention made of a great Assembly, and concurse of <hi>people;</hi> Who upon the Instigation of one <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a <hi>Silver-Smith,</hi> were confusedly drawne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a <hi>publick Theater.</hi> And when they were met there, the <hi>Confusion</hi> was so great, that the <hi>Theater</hi> for the time, was quite changed into a <hi>Babel;</hi> there was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Division of <hi>speech,</hi> and <hi>Tongues</hi> among them, scarce any two spoke the same <hi>Language;</hi> For <hi>some cryed out one Thing, and some cryed out Another,</hi> as you may read at the 32. v. of that Chap. Rudenesse, Clamour, Tumult, Noyse, was all that issued from them. Nay 'twas a <hi>Meeting</hi> so confused, so wholly void of Reason, that the greatest part knew not why they were come together, as you may read in the end, and close of that verse. And hence 'tis, that when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe among them, and would have preacht to them to <hi>convert</hi> and turne them from their Errour, 'Tis said at the 31. verse of that Chapter, That some of the <hi>chief</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> who were his <hi>Friends,</hi> sent to him, and desired him, that he would not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himselfe among such a rude, Tempestuous rout of <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, if you desire to know why I have sayd this to you,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47537:5"/>
'tis to let you see, First, That this hath partly been my case, I have been sent, nay spoken to, by some <hi>persons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> not to ingage my selfe among such a mixt <hi>Multitude</hi> as this; where my <hi>Affronts</hi> may be great, but my <hi>successe,</hi> and <hi>Harvest</hi> small: And to speak truth to you, if I had been left to the peaceablenesse of my owne quiet Temper, (which never did delight in <hi>stormes,</hi> nor to dispute with <hi>Fire.)</hi> If the fierce, and eager Importunity of <hi>some</hi> who have provokt me, had not drawn me from my <hi>Iudgement,</hi> I should have followed their <hi>Advice,</hi> this <hi>Meeting</hi> had not beene. Nay, I should have lookt upon my <hi>Appearance</hi> here, as a <hi>Distemper,</hi> like to <hi>theirs,</hi> who have provokt and called me hither. For my coole and wiser Thoughts have still suggested to me, that to dispute of <hi>Truth</hi> with those who doe not understand it, is such a piece of <hi>Madnesse,</hi> as if I should dispute of <hi>Colours</hi> with a <hi>Blind man,</hi> of <hi>Musicke</hi> with a <hi>Deafe,</hi> or of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>Flowers</hi> with <hi>One</hi> borne without a <hi>Smell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, therefore, having so farre departed from my <hi>Reason,</hi> as to submit to a <hi>Dispute</hi> in this great publick <hi>Meeting,</hi> lest it should prove such a <hi>confused Meeting,</hi> as I described to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; A <hi>Meeting</hi> where my <hi>Logick</hi> must fight <hi>Duels</hi> with Men made of Rudenesse, Tumult, Noyse; Or lest it should prove a <hi>Meeting</hi> where Men who can speak nought but <hi>English,</hi> shall yet speak <hi>divers Tongues;</hi> And where <hi>some shall cry out one Thing, and some shall cry another,</hi> I have made it my humble suit to some <hi>persons</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> here present, that by their <hi>presence</hi> they will free the place from all such <hi>wild Confusions.</hi> And that, if I must dispute, I may dispute with <hi>civill men,</hi> and not undergoe Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s misfortune, who fought with <hi>Beasts at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, lest this <hi>Meeting</hi> should prove like the <hi>confused Meeting,</hi> which I mention'd to you before, in one particular more; That is, lest the greatest part of you should not know why you are this day come together. Before I enter upon a full pursuit, or handling of this <hi>Text,</hi> it will be needfull that I tell you the occasion of this <hi>Meeting,</hi> which that I may the better doe, I shall desire you to beleeve, that 'tis not a <hi>Meeting</hi> of my <hi>projection</hi> or <hi>Contrivance.</hi> I appeare not here to raise a <hi>Faction,</hi> or to draw a <hi>party</hi> after me, nor to adde to the <hi>Rents</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47537:5"/>
which are too wide already. Nor am I come hither to revenge my selfe in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or to speake ill of those who have most lewdly railed at me. Let them wallow themselves, as much as they please, in their owne grosse filth, and mire; let them, if they please, be those <hi>raging Waves</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> speakes of, which are alwayes <hi>foming out their owne shame,</hi> when <note place="margin">Jude 13.</note> they have steept their <hi>Tongues</hi> in <hi>Gall,</hi> and spewd forth all their <hi>Venome,</hi> They shall not make me change my <hi>Opinion;</hi> which is, that to cast <hi>dirt</hi> for <hi>dirt,</hi> or to returne <hi>Ill-Language</hi> for <hi>Ill-Language,</hi> is a course so unreasonable, as if two Men should fight a <hi>Duell,</hi> and chuse a <hi>Dunghill</hi> for their <hi>weapon.</hi> As therefore, I am not come hither to shew my selfe <hi>Malitious,</hi> so I am not come hither to gaine <hi>Applause,</hi> or <hi>Reputation</hi> by this <hi>Meeting.</hi> No thirst of <hi>Fame,</hi> no affection of <hi>Victorie</hi> hath drawne me from my <hi>Study</hi> to steppe into this <hi>Pulpit.</hi> I understand my owne <hi>Infirmities</hi> too well to be so selfe-conceited. Or if my Abilities were farre greater then they are, yet I have alwayes lookt on <hi>Fame</hi> thus got, to be so slight a Thing, as if a Man should feed on <hi>Ayre,</hi> or make a meale of <hi>shaddows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to hold you therefore any longer in suspense, if you, who know it not already, desire to know the true occasion of this <hi>Meeting,</hi> 'tis briefely this; I have for some yeares (even with <hi>Teares</hi> in my eyes) seen one of the saddest curses of the <hi>Scripture</hi> fulfill'd upon this <hi>Nation:</hi> With a <hi>bleeding Heart</hi> I speake it, I have seene, not onely <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> but our <hi>Cityes, Towns,</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> nay even our <hi>private Familyes</hi> divided against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I have seene the <hi>Father</hi> differing in opinion from the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and I have seene the <hi>Sonne</hi> differing in opinion from the <hi>Father.</hi> I have seene the <hi>Mother</hi> broken from the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and I have seen the <hi>Daughter</hi> divided from the <hi>Mother.</hi> Nay, our very <hi>Marriage-Beds</hi> have not scapt the curse of <hi>Separation.</hi> Like <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> issuing from the same <hi>wombe,</hi> I have seene <hi>two Twins</hi> of <hi>Separation</hi> rise from between the same <hi>Curtains.</hi> I have seen the <hi>Wedlock knot</hi> quite untyed in <hi>Religion;</hi> I have seene the <hi>Husband</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Wife,</hi> goe to one, and I have seene the <hi>Wife</hi> in opposition to her <hi>Husband,</hi> for many years together, goe to another <hi>Congregation.</hi> In a Word (my Brethren,) the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> among us, which was once as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47537:6"/>
                     <hi>Seamelesse</hi> as his <hi>Coate,</hi> is now so rent by <hi>Schismes,</hi> so torne by <hi>Separations,</hi> that 'tis become like the <hi>Coate</hi> of <hi>Ioseph</hi> which you reade of in the 37. Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> at the 3. verse, scarce <hi>one piece</hi> is colourd like <hi>another;</hi> And I pray God it prove not like the <hi>Coat</hi> of <hi>Ioseph</hi> in one particular more; I pray God the <hi>Weaker</hi> be not sold by his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and his <hi>Coate</hi> be not once more dyed <hi>red,</hi> once more imbrued in <hi>Bloud.</hi> This, you will say, is very sad, and yet this is not all; That which extremely adds to the Misery of our <hi>Rents,</hi> and <hi>Separations,</hi> is, that the <hi>wisest</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope they will ere be <hi>peeced,</hi> or reconciled. For the <hi>persons</hi> who thus <hi>Separate,</hi> are so far from beleeving themselves to be in an <hi>Errour,</hi> that they strongly thinke all <hi>Others</hi> erre who <hi>separate</hi> not too; They thinke <hi>themselves</hi> bound in <hi>Conscience</hi> to doe as they doe. Nay, zealous Arguments are urged, and Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> quoted, to prove that 'tis a <hi>damning sinne</hi> not to goe on in <hi>Separation.</hi> The <hi>Churches</hi> where their <hi>Neighbours</hi> met are now contemned, and Scorned: Nay, I have with mine owne Ears heard a <hi>Dining Room,</hi> a <hi>Chamber,</hi> a <hi>Meeting</hi> under <hi>Trees;</hi> Nay, I have heard a <hi>Hog-stye,</hi> a <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whether a <hi>Hermit,</hi> or <hi>Monastic man,</hi> breake not the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> because he <hi>separates</hi> himselfe from the company of <hi>Men?</hi> And 'tis clearly stated by some great <hi>Casuists,</hi> That if he <hi>seperate</hi> from others for no End but <hi>separation,</hi> if he retire himselfe into a <hi>Cave</hi> or <hi>Wildernesse,</hi> or <hi>Desart,</hi> (as some of the <hi>Ancient Hermits</hi> did) not for <hi>Devotion,</hi> but out of a hatred, or distaste of the rest of <hi>Mankinde;</hi> In that particular he cannot well be called a <hi>Man,</hi> but some <hi>wilder Creature,</hi> made to dwell in <hi>Caves, Desarts, Forrests, Dens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As then, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> doth require us to preserve <hi>society</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> so the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath tyed, and woven this <hi>knot</hi> much faster.

                  </p>
                  <p>Which, that you may the more clearly understand, give me leave to aske you in truth what is <hi>Schisme?</hi> Why the best <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> of it that was ever yet given is this, That <hi>Schisme</hi> is nothing else, but a <hi>separation</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> from that part of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> of which they were once <hi>Members,</hi> upon meere <hi>fancyed, slight, unnecessary Grounds.</hi> In which <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Schisme,</hi> three things doe offer themselves to your serious observation, to make it <hi>formall Schisme,</hi> or a <hi>signe</hi> of <hi>Separation.</hi> First it must be a <hi>separation</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> from some part of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> of which they were once <hi>Members;</hi> That is, (according to the <hi>Definition,</hi> a <hi>visible Church</hi> as it concerns this present purpose) it must be a Deniall of <hi>Communion</hi> with that <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> with whom they were once <hi>united</hi> under a <hi>rightly-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Pastor.</hi> Next, they who thus <hi>separate,</hi> must betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to some other <hi>Teacher,</hi> whom, in opposition to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> they chuse to be their <hi>Guide,</hi> and so make themselves his <hi>Followers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they must erect a <hi>New Assembly,</hi> or place of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> as a <hi>New Church</hi> distinct from that from which they doe <hi>divide.</hi>

Lastly, This choyce of a <hi>New Guide,</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Old,</hi> this <hi>Erection</hi> of a <hi>New Church,</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> from the <hi>former</hi> must be upon slight unnecessary <hi>Grounds;</hi> For if the <hi>Cause,</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of their <hi>Separation</hi> be <hi>needlesse, vaine, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> if it spring more out of <hi>Humour, Pride,</hi> desire of <hi>change,</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> then out of any <hi>Christian love</hi> to keepe themselves from <hi>sinnes;</hi> 'Tis in the <hi>Scripture-</hi>Language <hi>Schisme,</hi> That is, a <hi>sinne</hi> of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if you will heare me expresse my self in the language of a very <hi>learned Man</hi> (who hath contrived a <hi>clue</hi> to lead us through this <hi>Labyrinth)</hi> This breach of <hi>Communion,</hi> This <hi>separation</hi> from a Church <hi>rightly constituted;</hi> This choyce of a <hi>New Guide, New Teacher, New Instructer.</hi> Lastly, This setting up of a <hi>New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> or place of <hi>private Meetings,</hi> is the same sinne in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which <hi>Sedition,</hi> or <hi>Rebellion</hi> is in the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> For upon a right examination of the matter 'twill be found, That <hi>Schisme</hi> is a <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall Sedition,</hi> as <hi>Sedition</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> is a <hi>civill, Lay-schisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which two <hi>sinnes,</hi> though they appeare to the World in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse <hi>shapes,</hi> the one with a <hi>Sword,</hi> the other with a <hi>Bible</hi> in his H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>To let you yet farther see, what a <hi>grievous sinne</hi> this sinne of <hi>Schisme</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> is; If the time would give me leave, I might here rayse the <hi>Schoolemen, Antient Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Generall Councells</hi> from the dead, and make them preach to you from this <hi>Pulpit</hi> against the sinne of <hi>Separation.</hi> I might tell you, that in the purest Times of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> and <hi>Hereticke</hi> were lookt upon as <hi>Twinnes;</hi> The one as an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Faith,</hi> the other to <hi>Communion.</hi> But because in our <hi>darke Times, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is so grown out of date, that to quote an <hi>Ancient Father,</hi> is thought a piece of <hi>Superstition;</hi> And to cite a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> is to speake words to our <hi>New Gifted men</hi> unknowne, I will say nothing of this sinne, but what the <hi>Scripture</hi> sayes before me.</p>
                  <p>First, then, I shall desire you to heare what S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47537:8"/>
this <hi>case,</hi> in the last Chapter of his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> at the 17. verse. Turne to the place, and marke it well I beseech you. <hi>Now I beseech you, brethren,</hi> sayes he there, <hi>Marke them which cause Divisions, and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e have learned, and avoid them:</hi> That is, in other words, <hi>Separate your selves from them.</hi> And then he gives you a <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> of those <hi>Separaters</hi> at the 18. verse of that Chapter; And sayes, <hi>For they that are such, serve not our Lord Iesus Christ, but their owne Belly. And by good words and faire speeches deceive the Hearts of the simple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words, <hi>Foure things</hi> are so exactly drawn to life, as makes them a perfect <hi>Prophecye,</hi> or rather <hi>picture</hi> of our <hi>Times.</hi> The first is, that there were some in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes, who caused <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church; Men,</hi> who in a way of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> made themselves the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>divided Congregations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, The <hi>Ground</hi> upon which they built their <hi>Separation;</hi> 'twas not upon any just, true, lawfull, Scripture-<hi>Ground.</hi> For the Text sayes, <hi>'Twas contrary to the Doctrine which the Apostles taught, and preacht.</hi> But the true <hi>cause,</hi> or <hi>Ground,</hi> why they thus caused <hi>Separations,</hi> was meerly <hi>self-Interest;</hi> And that they might <hi>gaine</hi> by their <hi>Divisions.</hi> Nay, 'twas such a poore, base, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>selfe-Interest,</hi> that 'tis there said, they did it in compliance to their <hi>Belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third thing which will deserve your <hi>observation,</hi> is, the <hi>cunning Art</hi> they used to draw the <hi>weaks</hi> to be their <hi>Followers.</hi> 'Tis there sayd, that by <hi>good Words and faire Speeches, they decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Hearts of the simple,</hi> especially the <hi>simple</hi> of the <hi>weaker sex.</hi> And who these were, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in other words, but to the same purpose tells you, in the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his second <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>pistle</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> at the 5, 6, 7. <hi>verses</hi> of that <hi>Chapter.</hi> Where speaking of such <hi>Coseners,</hi> he sayes, they had a <hi>Forme of Godlinesse,</hi> an outward seeming <hi>Holynesse</hi> to deceive and cosen by; And that under this <hi>Forme of Godlynesse they crept into Houses,</hi> and there <hi>led Captive silly Women, loaden with sinnes, and drawne away with divers Lusts. Women</hi> so unable to distinguish <hi>Right</hi> from <hi>Wrong,</hi> that they were <hi>alwayes learning, and never able to come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47537:8"/>
And certainly, my Brethren, 'tis no new thing under the <hi>sunne,</hi> to see the <hi>weaker sexe</hi> misled by <hi>holy Formes,</hi> and <hi>Shews.</hi> 'Tis no new thing, I say, under the Sunne, for a man that makes <hi>long prayers,</hi> to eat up a <hi>Widdows House;</hi> Or for a <hi>cunning Angler</hi> to catch the <hi>fillyer sort,</hi> with a hooke <hi>bayted</hi> with <hi>Religion.</hi> 'Twas so in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, and 'twas so in S. <hi>Pauls.</hi> And whether their demure lookes, their precise carriage, their long prayers, their good words and fayre speeches, be not the <hi>Hooke,</hi> and snare, by which <hi>weake people</hi> are caught now; whether the feasting of their <hi>Bellyes,</hi> or the making <hi>Gayne</hi> of <hi>Godlinesse;</hi> Or whether the <hi>Itch</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> of being the <hi>Leaders</hi> of a <hi>Faction;</hi> Or whether the vaine <hi>Ambition</hi> of being thought more <hi>holy</hi> or more <hi>gifted</hi> than the rest, be not the true end of those, who doe now cause <hi>Separations,</hi> I will not rashly censure, but I have some reason to suspect. But this is not all.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, and last thing, which most deserves your <hi>observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is, that <hi>Separation</hi> in that place is such a <hi>Scripture-sinne,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to <hi>separate</hi> from those, who doe thus cause <hi>Separations.</hi> Heare the place, I pray, once more repeated to you, <hi>I beseech you, Brethren,</hi> sayes he, <hi>Marke them who cause Divisions among you, and avoid them.</hi> That is, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Separate your selves from them.</hi> If they, who upon no just <hi>cause</hi> doe <hi>Separate,</hi> must be <hi>Separated</hi> from, I hope you'l all confesse that <hi>Separation</hi> is a sinne.</p>
                  <p>And what <hi>sinne</hi> thinke you is this sinne of <hi>Separation?</hi> Why, I know some of you will thinke it strange if I should say, 'tis a <hi>sinne</hi> of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> And yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, that 'tis a <hi>sinne</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> in the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Marke I beseech you what he sayes in that place. <hi>Are ye not carnall?</hi> sayes he there. For <hi>whereas there are among you Envyings,</hi> and <hi>Strifes,</hi> and <hi>Divisions; Are ye not carnall, and walke as men?</hi> Sayes He at the 3. verse. Againe, <hi>when one saith, I am Paul; And when another saith, I am of Apollos; Are ye not carnall?</hi> sayes he at the 4. v. of that <hi>Chapter.</hi> If to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Followers</hi> of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and to make themselves the <hi>Followers,</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Apollos;</hi> or if by way of <hi>Separation</hi> to make themselves the markes of severall <hi>Churches</hi> to which <hi>Apostles</hi> were the <hi>Guides,</hi> were a sinne of <hi>Carn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

(as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes it was) what shall we say of some people of our <hi>Times?</hi> who instead of severall <hi>Apostles</hi> to divide themselves by, doe chuse to themselves <hi>Guides</hi> so <hi>meane,</hi> so <hi>unlearned,</hi> so lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Errour,</hi> that they perfectly make between them the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Mistakes:</hi> The <hi>Blinde leading the Blinde,</hi> and both <hi>fallen into a Ditch?</hi> 'Tis not now, as 'twas then.

                  <p>And here, now, if <hi>Time</hi> were not a Winged Thing, or if it would but stay my leisure, I might lay before you many other places of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which clearly doe <hi>demonstrate</hi> that <hi>Separation</hi> is a sinne.

Of the which I tell you before,</hi> sayes he, <hi>As I have told you in Times past, That They which doe such Things shall not Inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> Where you see <hi>Seditions, Sects,</hi> and <hi>Schismes,</hi> as well as <hi>Adulterie,</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> are there listed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> among those <hi>works of the Flesh,</hi> which doe shut men out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and exclude them from <hi>salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many such like places of the <hi>Scripture</hi> I might lay before you. But I will content my selfe with one <hi>Argument</hi> more; which shall not onely prove to you, That <hi>Separation</hi> is a <hi>sinne;</hi> But one of the <hi>Greatest sinnes,</hi> of which <hi>Christians</hi> can be guilty.</p>
                  <p>To make this cleare to you, and beyond all <hi>Dispute,</hi> or <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> That which I will say to you (and mark it well) is this. 'Tis a Rule in <hi>Divinity,</hi> (and tis a <hi>Rule infallible)</hi> That those <hi>sinnes</hi> are the <hi>Greatest,</hi> which are most <hi>contrary,</hi> and doe most <hi>oppose</hi> the <hi>greatest Christian vertues.</hi> Now the Three Great Christian <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> which doe make and constitute a <hi>Christian,</hi> are set downe by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 13. chapter of his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at the last verse, where he sayes, Now abideth <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity; But the Greatest of these is Charity.</hi> Thus, then, stands the case. <hi>Distrust in Gods promises,</hi> or an <hi>unbeliefe</hi> in his <hi>power,</hi> is a very great sinne. For 'tis a sinne which doth <hi>oppose</hi> and quite cut off the wings of <hi>Hope. Haeresie,</hi> or the strife, and obstinate <hi>Defence,</hi> and persisting in a <hi>knowne Errour,</hi> is a farre <hi>greater sinne.</hi> For 'tis a sinne against <hi>Faith,</hi> a sinne which strives to draw a Cloud about the Beames of <hi>Truth.</hi> But if it be true what S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, (as most certainly it is) If it be true that <hi>Charity</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> then either <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> Then 'twill follow by <hi>Good Logick</hi> and all the <hi>Consequence</hi> of <hi>Reason;</hi> That that <hi>sinne</hi> which doth <hi>untie,</hi> and <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Bond</hi> of <hi>peace;</hi> That sinne which destroyes <hi>Christian Friendship,</hi> and <hi>Communion;</hi> Lastly, That sinne which rends, and teares the Cords of <hi>Charity</hi> asunder, is a farre <hi>greater</hi> sinne then <hi>unbeliefe</hi> or <hi>Haeresie.</hi> And the sin which doth all this is the sin of <hi>Separation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First 'tis a <hi>greater</hi> sinne in it <hi>selfe,</hi> and the very <hi>formality</hi> of the <hi>sinne.</hi> As being the <hi>worst Extreme</hi> to the best, and <hi>greatest vertue,</hi> Namely, The <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Love;</hi> By which <hi>Christ</hi> would have his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47537:10"/>
                     <hi>Followers</hi> distinguisht from the rest of <hi>Mankinde.</hi> For <hi>by this shall all men know,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that you are my Disciples,</hi> if yee <hi>love one another.</hi> As you may read in the 13. chapter of <hi>Iohn</hi> at the 35. verse. And agreeable to this is that which is delivered here in this Text, where the <hi>Authour</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> sayes, <hi>Let us consider one another to provoke one another to Love. And not forsake the Assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Schisme,</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> upon a <hi>slight,</hi> or <hi>needlesse Ground</hi> is in it <hi>selfe</hi> one of the <hi>greatest</hi> sinnes; So tis one of the <hi>greatest</hi> sinnes too, in its <hi>dangerous Effects.</hi> Besides the <hi>Hatred, Envy, Strife,</hi> which it begets among Men of divided <hi>Interests,</hi> and <hi>Mindes,</hi> Tis many times the <hi>Coale</hi> which sets whole <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths</hi> on fire. It pretends, indeed, very much to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> And at first cloaths it selfe in the <hi>Dresse</hi> of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Meeknesse;</hi> But they who have written the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can tell you, That those <hi>pretences</hi> to the <hi>Spirit</hi> have no sooner gathered strength, but they have proceeded to <hi>bloudy Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells,</hi> and <hi>pitcht fields.</hi> Where the <hi>Meeke</hi> persons have throwne aside their <hi>Bibles;</hi> and have changed the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> into the <hi>Sword of Warre.</hi> The proceedings of the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and of the <hi>Iohn-</hi>of <hi>Leyden-</hi>Men at <hi>Munster</hi> are two sad <hi>Examples</hi> of the truth of what I say.</p>

just length of our <hi>Weapons:</hi> If your <hi>patience</hi> will hold out so long, who come <hi>dis-interested</hi> hither, This second part of this <hi>Sermon</hi> shall be spent in the pursuit of that, which Master <hi>Deane</hi> of <hi>Christ-church</hi> just now very <hi>seasonably</hi> noted as a <hi>Defect</hi> in our present way of <hi>Arguing,</hi> and <hi>Dispute,</hi> which was, that the <hi>Grounds</hi> were not examined upon which the <hi>present Separations</hi> of these Times, do build themselves. These <hi>Grounds,</hi> therefore, I shall now in the next place call to some <hi>reckoning</hi> and <hi>Account,</hi> And in the doing of this, I will hang up a payre of <hi>Scales</hi> before you, you shall see their <hi>Arguments</hi> placed in <hi>One Scale,</hi> and my <hi>Answers</hi> in the <hi>Other:</hi> And because no <hi>Moderatour</hi> sits in the <hi>Chayre</hi> to judge (which was a thing foreseen by <hi>me,</hi> but could not well be compast) I shall make <hi>you</hi> the <hi>Iudges</hi> who heare me this day.

                  <p>Here (as I said before) may some of the <hi>Separating party,</hi> say to me, How doth the former part of your <hi>Sermon</hi> concern us? We <hi>separate,</hi> 'tis true, But not on those <hi>false Grounds</hi> which you have all this while described. We grant, indeed, That if we broke <hi>Communion</hi> with you out of <hi>Faction,</hi> or <hi>Selfe-Interest,</hi> or <hi>Pride,</hi> or desire of <hi>Gaine,</hi> or meere <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> you might well call us <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> and we should well deserve that <hi>Name.</hi> But the <hi>Ground</hi> on which we <hi>separate</hi> from you, is, because you are not fit to be <hi>Assembled</hi> with, you are <hi>sinners;</hi> wicked, lewd, profane, notorious <hi>sinners.</hi> The <hi>places</hi> where you meet breathe nothing but <hi>Infection.</hi> Your <hi>Teachers</hi> preach false <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and your people practise <hi>Lyes.</hi> In a word, we cannot with the safety of our Conscience frequent your <hi>Congregations.</hi> Since to appeare there would be an enterprize as dangerous, as if we should make Visits to a <hi>Pest-house,</hi> and there hope to scape the <hi>Plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This you will say (good people) is very hard language. And How, thinke you, do they prove it? why, as they thinke by two cleare places of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which no man can <hi>oppose,</hi> and not make <hi>Warre</hi> with <hi>Heaven.</hi> Two places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> I say, have

For all Nations have drunke of the wine of the wrath of her Fornications; And the Kings of the Earth have committed Fornication with her.

But here perhaps, will some of you who heare me this day, say; We doe not <hi>separate</hi> from you, because you are out-right <hi>unbeleevers, Pagans, Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Heathens;</hi> But because you weare the Names of <hi>Christians,</hi> and yet live the Lives of <hi>Heathens.</hi> Though you doe not worship <hi>Idols,</hi> yet there is <hi>Covetousnesse</hi> among you, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <note n="†" place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And though you doe professe <hi>Christ,</hi> yet you walke <hi>disorderly;</hi> And doe commit those <hi>sinnes</hi> which they who <hi>denyed Christ</hi> did. Though we see no <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> nor <hi>Silver</hi> in your <hi>Temples,</hi> yet if we came there, we might see a <hi>Congregation</hi> of such people as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in other places bids us <hi>Separate</hi> from. As for <hi>Example,</hi> turne to the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his second <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and the 6. verse. Doth he not there command us <hi>In the name of the Lord Iesus to withdraw our selves from every Brother, who walkes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, and not according to the Traditions which he taught?</hi> Or if this place be not cleare enough, turne to the 5. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the first <hi>Epistle</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to the 11. verse, Doth he not there say, that if <hi>Any man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicatour, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Rayler, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner,</hi> with such a one we are not to keep Company, <hi>No, not to eat?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, indeed, S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes so, and doe think it very fit that S. <hi>Paul</hi> should be obeyed. But how doth this prove that they are to <hi>forsake</hi> our <hi>Congregations?</hi> That there are <hi>such men</hi> among us, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth there describe, is a <hi>Truth</hi> too cleare to be denyed. But are our <hi>whole Congregations</hi> composed of such men? Are <hi>all Drunkards?</hi> Are <hi>all Fornicatours?</hi> Are <hi>all Raylers?</hi> Are <hi>all Extortioners?</hi> Are <hi>all,</hi> both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>People</hi> so like one another, that when they meete they make not a Church. <hi>Assembly,</hi> but a <hi>Congregation</hi> of such <hi>sinners?</hi> Or are they onely <hi>some?</hi> And they, perhaps, the <hi>lesser part</hi> who are guilty of those <hi>sinnes?</hi> Nay suppose they should be farre the <hi>greater part,</hi> who are guilty of these <hi>sinnes;</hi> yet you know our <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> compares the <hi>Church</hi> to a <hi>Field sowne with good seed;</hi> But then he tells us too, That to the Worlds end, among the <hi>good seed</hi> there shall still grow <hi>Weeds,</hi> and <hi>Tares.</hi> Againe, in the 13. <hi>chapter</hi> of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> at the 47. and 48. <hi>verses</hi> of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> he compares the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> here in this World, to a <hi>Net cast into the Sea,</hi> which inclosed <hi>Fishes</hi> of all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47537:13"/>
                     <hi>sorts, Bad</hi> as well as <hi>Good.</hi> And what the meaning of this draught of <hi>mingled Fishes</hi> is, I shall desire you to read at the 49. and 50. <hi>verses</hi> of that chapter, where he sayes; That at the <hi>End of the world,</hi> and not till then, the <hi>Angels shall go forth,</hi> and shall <hi>separate the wicked from among the Iust:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, sayes the Originall <hi>Greek,</hi> They shall <hi>separate</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi> from the <hi>midst</hi> of the <hi>Iust,</hi> which clearely doth prove to us, That till this finall <hi>Separation,</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> here on earth, there will alwayes be a <hi>mixture:</hi> To <hi>divide</hi> or <hi>separate,</hi> therefore, from the <hi>whole Congregation,</hi> because some <hi>wicked men</hi> are in it, is a course so <hi>unreasonable,</hi> as if they should refuse a <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Corne</hi> because there grew some <hi>weeds,</hi> or should renounce a <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Wheat</hi> because it beares some <hi>Tares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, I would faine know, how farre they will extend the meaning of that <hi>Text,</hi> where S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, That they are <hi>not to eat with a Brother,</hi> who is a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or <hi>Adulterer,</hi> or <hi>Rayler,</hi> or <hi>Extortioner.</hi> Will they extend it to <hi>all sorts</hi> of persons who are such? If they will, Then if a <hi>Woman</hi> have a <hi>Drunkard</hi> to her <hi>Husband,</hi> she must <hi>separate</hi> from him because he is a Drunkard, if she doe not, every time she eats with him, she disobeyes S. <hi>Paul;</hi> and in every <hi>meale</hi> she makes with him she commits a <hi>Scripture sinne.</hi> By the same reason also, If the <hi>Sonne</hi> have a <hi>Drunkard</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> he must remove <hi>Tables,</hi> and not dyet with his <hi>Father.</hi> And so there will be one <hi>Division</hi> more then those the <hi>Scripture</hi> speakes of: For that onely tells us that the time shall come when the <hi>Sonne</hi> shall be divided from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the <hi>Mother</hi> from the <hi>Daughter.</hi> But if this <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be true, the <hi>Wife</hi> must <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>break</hi> her selfe from her <hi>distemper'd Husband</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>Nay give me leave to goe one step farther yet. If the sinnes of a <hi>part</hi> be a just sufficient Ground to <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>whole,</hi> Why doe not <hi>they</hi> who <hi>separate, divide</hi> and fall <hi>assunder?</hi> For here let me ask them, and let me ask without offence; Are they <hi>all</hi> so <hi>Innocent,</hi> so <hi>pure,</hi> so <hi>free,</hi> so voyd of <hi>sinne,</hi> that there is not one <hi>disorderly Brother</hi> among them? Is their place of <hi>private Meetings</hi> so much the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> That no <hi>Drunkard,</hi> no <hi>Adulterer,</hi> nor <hi>Rayler</hi> enters there? I wish there did not, my Brethren.

                  <p>Tis there said, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> heard an <hi>Angel</hi> proclaime aloud, and say, <hi>Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen; and is become the Habitation of Divels, the Hold of every uncleane Spirit, and a Cage of every uncleane, and hatefull Bird;</hi> As you may read at the 2. <hi>verse</hi> of that <hi>chapter.</hi> Tis farther said, That he heard another voice from heaven, saying, <hi>Come out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her sinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> As you may read at the 4. <hi>verse</hi> of that <hi>chapter,</hi> where by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon fallen,</hi> they understand the <hi>Church of England falne,</hi> By the <hi>Habitation of Divels,</hi> the <hi>Hold of foule Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Cage of uncleane Birds.</hi> They understand our <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> and <hi>Congregations</hi> which meet there; which, they say, are so much a <hi>Cage of uncleane Birds,</hi> places so <hi>corrupt,</hi> so full of <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,</hi> and <hi>sinne,</hi> that <hi>God,</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it were, by a <hi>voice</hi> from the <hi>Clouds,</hi> hath said unto them, <hi>Come out of</hi> them, <hi>my people,</hi> divide your selves from them, <hi>lest ye be partakers of their sinnes,</hi> and go sharers in their <hi>plagues.</hi> This is, or must be their <hi>Interpretation</hi> of that <hi>place;</hi> or else 'twill no way serve to uphold
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47537:14"/>
their <hi>Separation.</hi> If, I say, by the <hi>Habitation of Divells,</hi> and <hi>Cage of uncleane Birds</hi> be not meant our Church <hi>Assemblyes,</hi> from which they doe <hi>divide,</hi> they doe but build a <hi>House of straw,</hi> and choose the <hi>sand</hi> for a <hi>Foundation.</hi> I am sure I have been told that this was the very <hi>Interpretation</hi> which the <hi>Gentleman</hi> gave of <hi>this place,</hi> who just now <hi>disputed</hi> with me, at a <hi>dispute</hi> which not long since he had with Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi> of <hi>Chinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now will you heare my <hi>censure</hi> of this wilde <hi>Interpretation?</hi> Take it then, thus. Among the severall <hi>Expounders</hi> of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> I once met with <hi>one,</hi> who when he came to interpret the <hi>Seven Angels,</hi> which blew the <hi>Seven Trumpets,</hi> He said that by one of those <hi>Angels</hi> was meant <hi>Luther,</hi> by another <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi> And when he came to give the meaning of the <hi>Locusts</hi> which ascended from the <hi>Bottomelesse pit,</hi> with <hi>Crowns</hi> on their <hi>Heads,</hi> by the <hi>Locusts,</hi> He understood <hi>Schollers</hi> of the <hi>Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi> And by the <hi>Crownes</hi> on their <hi>Heads,</hi> He understood <hi>Square Caps.</hi> Methinkes, these <hi>kinde</hi> of <hi>people</hi> deale just so with this place of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> They see <hi>strange visions</hi> in it which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> never saw; Namely, they see <hi>Babylon</hi> in our <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>uncleane Birds</hi> in our <hi>Assemblyes.</hi> Nay, though the <hi>Divels</hi> being <hi>Spirits</hi> are too <hi>invisible</hi> to be seen, yet, by the benefit of a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> they can see <hi>sights</hi> which no other <hi>Eyes</hi> can see without being present in the place to which <hi>foul Spirits</hi> do resort, (as if they had borrowed one of <hi>Galilaeo</hi>'s Glasses) they can see <hi>Divels</hi> take <hi>Notes</hi> at our <hi>Sermons.</hi> But whether in <hi>short-Hand,</hi> or at <hi>length,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath not revealed.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me, I beseech <hi>you, you</hi> who are of the more <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>nobler</hi> sort, that I am thus <hi>pleasant</hi> in the pulpit; I am compelled to be so when I meet with <hi>people</hi> who deale with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as men of <hi>melancholly Fancyes</hi> use to deale with the <hi>Clouds.</hi> For as I have knowne some <hi>Hypocondriack</hi> men, who have faigned to themselves <hi>flying Horses, winged Troops,</hi> and <hi>Skips sayling</hi> in the <hi>Aire;</hi> Nay, as I have knowne some, who, like the <hi>Melancholly man,</hi> who thought himselfe a <hi>urinall,</hi> have thought they have seene two <hi>Armyes</hi> in the <hi>Skie;</hi> and have mistaken <hi>Clouds,</hi> and <hi>Meteors</hi> for <hi>Soldiers, Trumpets, Drums,</hi> and <hi>Cannons;</hi> So I do not wonder that our <hi>Gifted, thinking people</hi> should so mistake the <hi>Revelation</hi> as they doe; or that they should see <hi>Monsters</hi> in the Scripture <hi>Clouds.</hi> Where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is most <hi>cleare,</hi> they hardly

understand it; How then, should they finde out the <hi>Key</hi> to such <hi>darke prophecies</hi> as <hi>this?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here may some man say to me, if they <hi>mistake</hi> this place, whats your <hi>Interpretation of it?</hi> Why, my <hi>Interpretation</hi> is the very same which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Himselfe delivers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 8. Where the <hi>Angel</hi> expresseth himself in the very same words, And sayes, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen; That great City which made all Nations drinke of the Wine of the Wrath of her Abominations.</hi> And what was that <hi>Great City?</hi> Why the <hi>City</hi> built on <hi>seven Hills;</hi> As 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in <hi>another</hi> place of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> That <hi>Great City</hi> which was the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Nations;</hi> Namely, the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when 'twas the <hi>seat</hi> of <hi>Heathen Emperours.</hi> Lastly, that <hi>Great City,</hi> which gave Laws to all the <hi>World,</hi> to <hi>worship</hi> her <hi>False Gods,</hi> and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of her <hi>Idolatryes.</hi> And this was that <hi>Great City,</hi> which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calls <hi>Babylon;</hi> either, because speaking of the <hi>Fall</hi> and <hi>Ruine</hi> of it, He thought it not safe to call it <hi>Rome,</hi> or by its right and proper <hi>Name;</hi> Lest, if he had done so, he might draw <hi>persecution</hi> on the <hi>Christians.</hi> Or els, Because as <hi>Babylon</hi> was the <hi>Head City</hi> of the <hi>Persian Monarchy,</hi> so <hi>Rome</hi> was then the <hi>Head City</hi> of the <hi>Roman.</hi> In a word, this is that <hi>Great City,</hi> which was then the great <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Superstitions;</hi> And therefore, justly called by the <hi>Angel</hi> which spoke to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> The <hi>Habitation of Divels,</hi> and <hi>Cage</hi> of <hi>uncleane Birds.</hi> And from this <hi>Babylon,</hi> this <hi>Rome,</hi> the then <hi>City</hi> of <hi>confusion,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>God</hi> bid the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>those Times</hi> to <hi>come forth,</hi> and <hi>separate themselves;</hi> lest they should be <hi>partakers</hi> of her <hi>sins,</hi> and go sharers in her <hi>plagues.</hi> But to say as they do, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is that <hi>Babylon the great;</hi> or that cut <hi>Parish Congregations,</hi> from which they do divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are the <hi>Habitation</hi> of <hi>Divels,</hi> the <hi>Hold</hi> of <hi>foule spirits,</hi> and <hi>Cage</hi> of <hi>unclean Birds</hi> here mentioned in this <hi>chap.</hi> is such a piece of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as well as <hi>zealous slander,</hi> that they will never be able to prove it, till they can make the <hi>Capitol</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> stand in our <hi>London streets,</hi> or till they can make the <hi>River Tiber</hi> run, where now our <hi>Thames</hi> doth; or till they can change the <hi>Countries</hi> in our <hi>Mapps,</hi> and make the <hi>Mid-lanà Sea</hi> flow on our <hi>English shore.</hi> And farther then this I will not trespasse on your <hi>patience;</hi> or inlarge my selfe to prove to you that <hi>Separation</hi> is a <hi>Sin.</hi>

Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen Plilosophers, we finde the number of Sects, to be much greater then the number of Sciences. Every new famous Teacher, who professed severity in his looks, and austerity in his man ners, had the power to draw a cloud of Disciples after him, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

a new Truth with a new School. And thus in the very Church of God it selfe, the Gospell no sooner began to be preached to the world, but it began to have its Sects and Schismes, and sidings too. The Apostles taught but one Faith, one Baptisme, one Christ, one plaine, open way of salvation to men; yet they were mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by some, as if they had preached many: Or as if the numbers of their severall Doctrines, had equalled the number of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons, and they had (every one where he went) scattered a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Gospell.</p>
                  <p>To speake yet more plainely to you, and neerer home to the History of this Text; The <hi>Corinthians</hi> (to whom this Epistle was written) as if from every new Teacher that came thither, they had learned a new Religion, began at length to have as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them as they had heard Teachers. You might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished divers Churches in the same City, and have divided their Beleefs and Creeds by their Families and streets. Where, by a fallacy and deceit of the eare, judging of the things taught, by their affection to the Teacher, and not judging of the Teacher by the things which he taught, every one chose to himselfe the name of his Minister to make a Side and faction by. One (as you read at the 12. Verse, of this Chapter) said, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi> a third, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> a fourth, <hi>I am of Christ:</hi> As if Christ had either been divided, or else were to stand with the rest as the name of a distinct Religion; Or at least, as if the Gospell (which at first sprung from him) like streams broken off from their spring-head, were no longer to retaine the name of the Fountain from whence it rose, but were to weare the stile of the severall pipes and channells, by which it was conveyed abroad into the world.</p>
                  <p>This diversity of names, and sides, grew at first from their diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of opinions, and minds. When the unlearned wresting the Scripture which they had heard preached to an Apostles sense, would presume to impose that sense, which was indeed, not an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, on others. And those others, equally as unlearned, thought it as reasonable, so they could entitle it to another Apostle, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their interpretation of Scripture on the first.</p>
                  <p>This diversity of minds, proceeded at length to diversity of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and speech. Congregation spoke censoriously of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47537:18"/>
as if none had been in the right, but they onely who most vehemently could charge others with being in the wrong. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was urged, and quoted against Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> against both, and <hi>Christ</hi> against all three. Whose Sermons, like those changeable figures which melancholly men frame to themselves in the clouds, were made to weare the shape and form, which every mans zeale and fancy suggested to him.</p>
                  <p>Hence, in time, from difference and disagreement in mindes and speech, they grew to difference and disagreement in society and conversation too. Difference of opinion bred separation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; and that which was at first but a neighbourly dispute, by degrees tooke flame, and grew to be mortall hatred, division and schisme. Men of the next doore were no longer neighbours to one another. All the bonds of Charity became utterly broken. All Christian entercourse, and familiarity and commerce ceast between them. He was thought to be false, and to betray his side, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to shew himselfe affable or civill to one of another party.</p>
                  <p>In short, the breach became so wide, that he was thought to be the onely religious man who could most enlarge the rent, and could bring most fuell to the present combustion which was thus unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily kindled among them. To compose these differences the refore, (differences not unlike those of our miserable, distracted times) and to make the Knot and Reconciliation as fast and strong, as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement and rent was large and wide, S. <hi>Paul</hi> here in this Text, prescribes a severall Cure, for every particular and severall breach. First, to remove the discord which rose among them, by calling themselves by severall names, and to banish the ill consequences of all such factious compellations, which for the most part are bitter Invectives, and sharp arrowes of detraction hurld at one another, he perswades them to unity of language and speech, and exhorts them to call themselves all by the same name, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, that ye al speak the same thing.</hi> Next, to remove their want of meetings, and Communion together in the same place of Gods Worship, he perswades them to unity of Assemblies, and Congregation, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, that there be no divisions,</hi> That is, (as I shall in the progress of this Sermon, make it clear to you from the Original) that there be no separations, that is, (as our English word doth wel express it) that there be no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47537:19"/>
private sequestred meetings, no such things as Conventicles among you. Thirdly, to remove the root, and spring of all these uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable strifes, and divisions, and separations, he perswades them to unity of opinions and minds, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, that you be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgement.</hi> Lastly, that he might with the greater successe do this, and (like a skilfull reconciler) might win upon all sides, he for a while layes aside the Authority of his Apostleship; and mingling Request and Conjuration, with Exhortation and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he acts the part of an Apostle, in the forme of a Petitioner, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Upon these parts, the Apostles mild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation, and addresse of himselfe, and the severall Degrees of unity and concord, in speech, in Assemblies, and in Opinions, to which he here exhorts the Corinthians, I will build my future dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. In the ordering of which, I will begin with the Apostles submissive insinuation, or addresse of himselfe, in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>

And thus enabled from above, without the forme of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or those other slow, tedious, lazy helps, of sitting twenty years in a Colledge to understand the Bible, may in the few minutes of a powerfull Inspiration spring up an Apostle, and go forth a Preacher of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>To this perswasion they have been invited by two sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture; one in the Old Testament, the other in the New, In the Old Testament, Doe you not read, say they, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47537:19"/>
God called <hi>Elisha</hi> from the Plough to be a Prophet? And doth not <hi>Amos</hi> tell you in the 7. Chapter of his Prophesie, at the 14. Verse, that he was a Herdman, and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit? Then for examples in the New Testament, pray what were the Apostles? were they great Schollars? or did Christ send to <hi>Athens</hi> for them? were they not Fishermen, men altogether unletter'd, men called from mending nets to preach the Gospell? If this were so, That God according to his good pleasure, without any consideration of study, or height of parts, chose simple, unlearned, unstudied men, to be Prophets and Apostles, and Teachers, then why should any thinke he hath so confined, or entailed his free Spirit, or vocation of men, upon great parts, and studies, that he may not, if he please call the like unstudied, simple men from the Plough or Fisher-boat, or Stall, or Shop-board, to be Ministers of his Gospel, and Teachers of his people now?</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, you see I have not prevaricated, or diminished ought of the strength of the Argument which is urged in favour of Lay-mens preaching. In answer to which, laying aside all partiality to my selfe, and prejudice against them, I shall with the same spirit of meekness and Candour, with which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here in this Text bespoke his Corinthians, beseech you, who heare me this day, to observe, and weigh, and consider well this which I shall say for a Reply?</p>
                  <p>First, Far, far be it from me so to flatter the place of my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or so to biass my beleef, by any false ovevarluing of humane Industry, or great parts that I should pinion, as it were, or put li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the power of the Almighty; Or should be so irreligiously bold, as to gain-say that piece of his Gospell which compares his holy Spirit to the <hi>Wind,</hi> which <hi>bloweth where it listeth.</hi> If they who thus pretend to a private Inspiration doe meane, that whatever God did in the times heretofore, he is able to doe now, I shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant it; And here in the presence of you all, confesse my selfe to be of their opinion. Nor shall I make any doubt or scruple at all, to say, that, if we looke upon what God is able to doe, by the same power by which he was able to raise up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of stones, or (to speake yet more neerly to the Argument in hand) by the same power that hee was able to make a Herd-man a Prophet, or a Fisher-man an Apostle, he is able, in our times also,
<pb facs="tcp:47537:20"/>
if he please, to make the meanest Tradesman one of the greatest Luminaries of his Church. Since to an Omnipotent Agent, whose gifts are meerly Arbitrary, and depend wholly upon the pleasure of his owne will, the greatest endowments of men, and the least, are alike easie. But though he be able to doe this, and in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times of the Scripture have imparted his Gifts without respect of Persons, yet whether he now will, or whether in our times hee doth still thus extraordinarily raise up Teachers to himselfe, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly to be doubted. For here with all the Christian gentleness and reason, which may possibly conduce to the clearing of this doubt, were I to argue this Controversie with one of those men who invade our function, and from gathering of Sycamore fruit step up into the Pulpit, I would onely aske him this question; What Commission he hath thus to usurp upon our Office; Or who signed him his patent; Since the Apostle tells us in the fifth Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, at the fourth Verse, (A place well worth your marking, my Brethren) That <hi>no man taketh this honour of a Priest to himselfe, But he who is called of God, as was Aaron?</hi> I know his common answer will bee, that God hath called him to this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by the secret Instinct, and Motion of his Holy Spirit. But, then, he must not take it ill, if I yet farther aske him, by what signes, or markes, or testimonies, or tokens, he can either ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> it reasonably appeare to himselfe, or others, that God hath dealt with him as he dealt with some of the Prophets, or Apostles; called him from his Trade by such a motion of his Spirit? <hi>Elisha</hi> we know, made I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron swim, and knew mens Closet-discourses in a farre Countrey, which was a sure and certaine signe that God had called him to be a Prophet. The Apostles also we know, wrought many of Christs miracles, which was a most infallible signe that God had chosen them to be Apostles. If any of these men, who derive their warrant from the same sacred spring, can make Iron swim, or like <hi>Elisha,</hi> remaining here in their owne. Israel, can tell us what the King of Syria saies in his Bed-chamber; Or if like Saint <hi>Peter</hi> they can cure fevers and diseases by their bare shadowes passing over them; Or if, like the rest of the Apostles, having never before knowne Letters, they can of a sudden speake all Languages, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie is at an end; It would bee a very great sinne against the Spirit of God to deny, that hee is in them of a Truth.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47537:20"/>
But if all the proofe and signe they can give us that they have him, be onely a strong perswasion of themselves; Nay, if by an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Illumination they could assure themselves, that they have him, yet as many as have not the like infallible Illumination to assure them so too, will not be guilty of an unpardonable offence, if they suspect they have him not. For here, I must once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat my former Question, and aske by what effects, or signes of the Spirit, men shall know them to be called? By what? will some man say, why? Doe you not heare them preach, expound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unfold Prophecies, interpret Parables; nay plucke the veile and cloud from the Booke of Mysteries it selfe, the very <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Can any of you great Schollers, with all your study of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, Fathers, Councells, Schoole-men, Historians, Oratours, Poets, either hold your Congregations longer, or send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way more edified? And will you yet ask Questions? Or doubt of the certainty of their vocation? I must not dissemble with you, if I could meet with an unlearned Handicraft-man, who without study, can doe this to the same height, and measure of Truth, as those unjustly-cryed downe, learned, and well-studied men doe, I should begin to alter my opinion; And should reckon him as hee deserves, in the number of the inspired. But alas, my Brethren, as I am not come hither to disparage the guifts of the Holy Ghost, in what person soever I finde them, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade that Scripture rightly expounded, is not one, and the same, from the mouth of a Priest, or an inspired Lay-man; so this I must freely say to you, That as many of those strange Teachers as I have heard, have expounded Scripture indeed, and have ventured upon some of the hardest places of the Prophets. But, then, if all my studies of the Bible, assisted with all those holy, uncorrupted learned helps, which might enable mee to understand it aright, have not deceived me, their expositions, and Sermons, how passionately delivered, or how long soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are evident proofes to mee that they have not the Spirit. If they had, they would never, certainely, expound Scripture so directly contrary to his meaning; Or make the writings of the Prophets or Apostles, weare only that present shape, not which the holy Ghost hath imprinted and stampt upon them, but which tends to the division of a Kingdom, and the confusion of a Church;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47537:21"/>
Nor would they, as they do, what ever the Text be, presse that sense from it, not which is genuine, and naturall, but which tends most to the destruction of a party, or the fomentation of a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Civill Warre. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the fift Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> at the 22, and 23. Verses, that <hi>the fruits,</hi> or effects <hi>of the Spirit, are love, peace, long-suffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, meeknesse, temperance.</hi> He useth to speake to men in the voice, and figure of a Dove: But to entitle him to all those forbidden workes of the flesh, of variance, hatred, sedition, heresies, envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, murthers, and the like, there reckoned up in the precedent Verses of that Chapter, is to make him speake with the voice of a Raven.</p>
                  <p>In short, my Brethren, the Holy Ghost is not the Author of such Doctrines as breake Gods Commandements in the Pulpit. Nor is it a long Prayer, or a zealous two-houres reviling of the foot-steps of the Lords Anointed, their lawfull Soveraigne, which can make their Sermons to be any other then so much Libell, or holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation; Or which can make their Intrepretations of the Word of God, how moderate soever in other cases, if they be not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the scope, and minde, and intention of the Holy Ghost, to be any more then so many zealous mistakes, and so many ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate births, and creatures of their own deluded fancies.</p>
                  <p>Next, in pursuit of this seasonable Argument, give me leave, I pray, with all the plainenesse I can, (for I well know where I am, and to what Auditorie I speake) to make it yet farther evident to you, that if I should grant what these <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as S. <hi>Basil</hi> calls them, these Saints of a daies growth, challenge to themselves, who thinke that all that is required to make a Minister of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, onely to be willing, and to start up a Preacher. If, I say, it should be granted them, that they have the inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Spirit, yet God is so much the God of order, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they will enter themselves into his service, by undergoing those Rites of Consecration and Imposition of Hands, which God hath prescribed in his Church, to stand for ever as the outward formes and signes of their vocation too, every act of the Ministerie which they performe, is but a sacrifice like theirs who offered strange fire before the Lord, and miserably perisht by their owne forbidden Censors. Or if you will have me expresse the danger of it by a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47537:21"/>
judgement as terrible. Thus to put their hand to the Arke, thus to support it, if 'twere ready to fall, is such an unwarranted piece of officiousnesse, as will (certainely) unrepented, at some time or other, draw the punishment of <hi>Uzzrah</hi> upon them, provoke the abused Almighty to breake forth in a flame of fire upon them, and consume them for their unnecessarie diligence. For here, all the Scripture examples which imbolden them to this worke, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne upon them, as so many instances and proofes of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on our office. For here let me once more ask them, How was <hi>Elisha</hi> called to be a Prophet? meerly by the secret, unknown whisper and instinct of the holy Ghost? Truly, if he had, yet this would not make much for them; because God never tyed himself precisely to those outward formes in the choice of a Prophet, which he then did, and still doth in the choice of his Priests. Yet the calling of this Prophet was not without its visible signe. <hi>Goe,</hi> saies God to <hi>Elias,</hi> in the 19. Chap. of the first booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> at the 16. Verse, <hi>Anoint</hi> Elisha <hi>the Son of</hi> Shaphat <hi>to be Prophet in thy roome.</hi> And whether the like Ceremony of powring oyle on his head, were not also performed by some elder Prophet upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> as the younger, as 'tis not affirmed, so 'tis not denyed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but left probable. In the Consecration of the Priests of those times, the case is much more evident: Read at your leisure the 29. Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there you shall finde, that before God would receive them into that sacred function, first, divers Sacrifices were to bee offered for them; then they were to be brought to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and there to bee washt; then the Priests Garments, the Coat, the Ephod, the Brest-plate, and Mitre, were to be put upon them. Lastly, followed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing oyle, which was powred upon their heads: And this was the Consecration of the Priests of those times.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremonies of Consecration in the New Testament, were different, I confesse, from those of the Old; but yet equivalent, and answerable to them in their kinde. These were, a publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Church together, a presentation there made of the person to bee made a Priest; solemne prayers and supplications put up to God, to make him usefull to his Church: and for a seale of all the rest, the Imposition of the Bishops hands, assisted by his Presbyters. Now, my Brethren, apply this to the strange
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47537:22"/>
Priests of our times, who with unwasht feet thrust themselves into the Tabernacle; not a sacrifice, not so much as a handfull of meale, or grain of Incense, or drop of oyl spent towards their Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; No solemne assembly, no presentation of themselves made to God, no imposition of hands, not so much as a short Prayer, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, or God speed you, used towards their setting forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords Vineyard, and you will find that these are the theeves and robbers (pardon the hardness of the language, I cannot make the Scripture speake mildlier then it doth) which our Saviour Christ speaks of in the 10. Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> at the first Verse, <hi>Men who enter not in by the doore into the sheep-fold, but climbe up some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</hi> In briefe, men, whose Sermons and Doctrines correspond to their consecrations. By stealth they enter into the Ministery, and by stealth they exercise it. And whereas the mark and Character of all the true Ministers of the Gospel is to stand, <hi>having their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace,</hi> these men wander, and goe about, having their feet shod with the preparation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel <note place="margin">

Men who speake fire, and throw lightning among the people; and thinke they have then onely done the worke, and businesse of an Apostle, when they have cast the Congregation which they leave behind them into a cumbustion and flame. I shall trouble your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience but with one Objection, which may possibly be made against what I have hitherto said; that is this: Here, some one of these moderne, selfe-inspiring Teachers may say, Sir, you tell us of Ceremonies and Consecrations, and I know not what, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands; but either you have forgot your selfe, or wisely dissembled the vocation of the Apostles. Were not they without your formality of laying on of hands, without all this adoe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying orders, and the holy Ghost by fingers, immediately called by Christ? What imposition of hands went to change S. <hi>Peter</hi> from a Fisher-man into an Apostle? or what Bishops Ceremonies past to make S. <hi>Paul</hi> (in whose person you have all this while preacht against us) of a persecutor of the Church to become a Doctor of the Gentiles? Doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>To this I reply; first, As for the Apostles, 'tis true, indeed, we
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47537:22"/>
doe not read that they were consecrated to their Ministerie by such Rites and Imposition of hands, as were afterwards received and practised in the Church. Yet something answerable to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands went to their Consecration, before they were invested with full Authority to preach the Gospell to the world. For besides their first vocation by Christ to be his Disciples, from whom they learnt that Gospell which they afterwards preacht, what saies the Scripture? <hi>Tarry yee at Ierusalem,</hi> sayes Christ to them, after his Resurrection, <hi>till I send the promise of my Father upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>you, and yee be indued with power from above.</hi> And, pray, what was that promise, and what was this power? Certainly, that which you read of in the second Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where at the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt by Christ, the Holy Ghost descended on them. And how did hee descend? in a still, soft, secret, invisible perswasion of the Fancy? Or in the silent whisper of an unperceived Illumination? No such matter, <hi>Quod Episcopus aliis, Spiritus sanctus Apostolis,</hi> saies a learned man. The holy Ghost here supplyed the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, descended upon them in an audible rushing wind, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his election of them to the eare; And sate upon their heads in the shape of cloven Tongues of fire; which signified his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them to the eye. <hi>Hi ritus, haec impositio;</hi> These were his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, this his Imposition of hands, sayes that Author. So that all the difference betweene the Admission of the Apostles to the Ministery, and others, was onely this: In other Consecrations the Bishop onely granted the power to preach, but bestowed not the Guifts; Here the Holy Ghost bestowed both. He first by visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, outward signes, testified to the world whom hee had chosen, and to whom they were to hearken; And then furnisht them with Tongues, and Languages, and knowledge, and parts, fit to be the Guides and great Instructers of the world. Let these men make it appeare to me, that the Holy Ghost hath thus descended upon them, thus furnisht them with parts, and I will most willingly resign my place to them in the Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>Next, as for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 'tis cleare by the story of his Conversion, that he received not his Commission to preach from that which Christ spoke to him immediately from Heaven. But what saies the place? After he was fallen to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>must doe.</hi> When hee came into the City, a certaine Disciple named <hi>Ananias,</hi> pre-instructed by Christ in a vision, was sent to him, who putting his hands on him, saies the Text, said to him, <hi>Brother Saul, the Lord (even Iesus that appeared to thee in the way) hath sent me, that thou mightst receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</hi> Till his Imposition of hands, the holy Ghost was not bestowed upon him. And when he was bestowed upon him, yet he had not his full Commission; he was but yet a Disciple consecrated by a Disciple. To make him an out-right Apostle, a higher, second, and more solemne consecration past upon him, which you may read in the 13. Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where, sayes the Holy Ghost to the Trophets, and Teachers of the Church of Antioch, <hi>Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the worke whereunto I have called them,</hi> Ver. 2. And how were they separated I pray? The third Verse tells you, <hi>When the Prophets and Teachers</hi> (there mentioned) <hi>had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands on them,</hi> saies the Text, <hi>they sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> till then they wanted power. To which passage of this voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or calling to the Ministery, give me leave to adde this for his parts. That in a humane way of acquired Learning, hee was the greatest Scholler of his time, bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a great Doctor of Law, spoke more Tongues, attained by his owne Industry, then all the other Apostles, which had almost all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges instilled into them by infusion. In short, he was verst, and read, and studied, not onely in the Scripture, but in the highest parts of secular learning; In the writings of <hi>Menander, Epimenides,</hi> and <hi>Aratus,</hi> Heathen Poets. Which is sure signe to us, that studies, and learning, and parts acquired in Universities, ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> no hindrances, or impediments, if not helps to the Ministery. Lastly, as for that saying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that Lay-men may be Priests, hee tells you, in the following words, in what case this is to be understood. <hi>Ubi Ecclesiastici ordinis non est consessus;</hi> Where the condition of the time and place is such, that Ecclesiasticall orders cannot be had; If a Christian Lay-man should come into a Pagan Island, or into a Countrey of Heathen people, where there is no true Minister, here <hi>Tinguis, &amp; offers, &amp; sacerdos es,</hi> everie man is a Priest, and may baptize, and adminster the Sacrament, and preach as much of the Gospell as hee knowes. But where this necessity is not, to snatch the Sermon out of the mouth, or the Sacrament out of the hands
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47537:23"/>
or the child out of the armes of the true Minister, is certainly to to be in the number of those uncalled Teachers, of whom God complaines in the 23. Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> at the 21. Verse, where he saies, <hi>I have not sent these Prophets, yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>an; I have not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them, yet they prophecied.</hi> And farther then this I will not pursue the first thing I proposed to you; which was by occasion of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> calling to be an Apostle, to remove an errour of late taken into the minds of some, that crafts-men may exercise the place and function of a Priest.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I shall observe to you, is, the holy art and insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <note place="margin">The a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> insinua himself</note> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here useth to win upon the minds of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Though he professe, in the beginning of the next Chapter, that he came not to them with that part of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator about him, which consists in the excellency of speech, or the entising words of mans wisdome, (lest if he had done so, he might perhaps, have gained much glory to himselfe, but then his Master must have been in danger to lose his, and so the Gospell have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from his Eloquence; and his Epistles might, perhaps, have past for a good piece of Rhetorick, but not for good Sermons) yet he every where carried this other, equally prevailing part of a good Oratour with him, that by complying with the affections of those to whom he wrote, he first transformed himselfe into their shapes, and became all things to all men, that he might the better transforme them into his, and make all men become like himselfe. Thus to the Jewes he became as a Jew; and put himselfe a while with them under the Law, that by insensible degrees hee might take their yoke from them, and might beget their liking, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Gospell. And thus to the Gentiles, who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law, he became as a Gentile, without the Law too, that he might unite them to the Jewes. If I may speake of him, by his owne description of himselfe, (and certainly, in that descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himselfe, he was inspired to speake truth as well as in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings) as he was not chosen, like the rest of the Apostles, out of Fisher-men, or men unlearned, nor call'd to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell from mending Nets; But as there was a concurrence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, acquired, and infused abilities in him, which rendred him though not one of the twelve, yet of equall guifts and endowments to them all. Lastly, as his taske and patent to preach the Gospell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47537:24"/>
was much larger then the rest, as much larger, as the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was larger then the Nation of the Jewes; So in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his taske, he never failed to expresse all this. Like the beast, of which <hi>Pliny</hi> speakes, which puts on the likenesse of every thing next it, and showes like a flower before a flower, like a streame before a streame, and like a flame before a flame; so 'twas a piece of this Apostles (Art shall I say? or) holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to be <hi>all things to all men.</hi> Strong with the strong, and weak with the weake. To part with his Liberty to the scrupulous, and to use it with the indifferent. To eat all things wtth those that did eat all things, and with those that did not, to keep himselfe to herbes. Will you heare him in all these particulars expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Turne to the ninth Chapt. of this Epistle, and to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Verse, where setting downe the end, and aime, which hee proposed to all his holy Arts, he saies, <hi>Though I be free from all men,</hi> that is, no way obliged to doe as I doe, but for my Masters ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ice, <hi>yet have I made my selfe a servant to all, that I might win the more.</hi> Now if humility, and the casting of himselfe below himselfe; if to beseech, and entreat, and petition there, where he had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authority and commission to enjoyne and command, be to wear the forme of a servant; and if all discreet behaviours, complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and applications, take their measure, and use, and praise, from the good end to which they are directed, and the good successe which they are likely to procure, in all his Epistles I finde not this Apostle more expediently making use of his Art in the forme of a suppliant, then in this Text. For consider these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom he here applies himselfe, divided, and broken into Factions; and these Factions severally deriving themselves, some from him, others from <hi>Cephas,</hi> others from <hi>Apollos,</hi> (Names in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as holy, and great as his) and to have dealt imperiously with them, or to have used his Apostolicall power, and to have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to agreement, had not been to make peace, but to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and inflame that party which called themselves his side. It had been too, to call up opposition, and disdaine in the others, who were not of that side. Who citing <hi>Apollos,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> against him, and thinking it to be some confession of their error and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to yeeld first, or to go over to them who said they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> it being as reasonable that they should come over to them,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47537:24"/>
who said they were of <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> might have askt the same question which the striving Israelite askt <hi>Moses, Who made thee a Iudge over us?</hi> And might have seconded this question with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have askt him, how one interested, and ingaged, nay the head (as they conceived) of a Faction, could be presumed to be an impartiall reconciler? The better therefore, to establish a peace and concord among them, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chap. proceeds by three conducible waies of Reconciliation. At the 13. Ver. hee cleares himselfe from all interest and ingagement to a side; and equally blaming those who said they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> as those who said they were of <hi>Cephas,</hi> or <hi>Apollos;</hi> he askes them how it came to passe, that they dealt with the Gospell of Christ, which was entire and seamlesse, like his Coat, as the Souldiers did with his other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, divided it by a kinde of blind Lottery among them, and every one take his share? <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> Saies he. <hi>Was</hi> Paul <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for you?</hi> Or <hi>were ye baptized in the name of</hi> Paul? If you were not, why doe you raise a Sect, and Faction from him? VVhy doe you call your selves by way of marke and distinction, <hi>Paulists?</hi> And so turn the name of your Preacher and Apostle, into the name of a Schisme and side?</p>
                  <p>Next, as he well knew that the readyest way to reconcile all sides, was to manifest himselfe to be of none; so he well knew too, that he that would knit, and re-unite disagreeing mindes, was not to deale roughly, or magisterially with them, (for that were to lose both; and to turne the enmity and hatred which they held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselves, upon the Reconciler, who strived to make them friends) but was to quench such discords with soft language, and to cure such rents and wounds of the Church by pouring oyle into them. Though, therfore, being armed with the authority of Christ himselfe, he might, with justice enough, have made Decrees and Ordinances to bind them to agreement, yet he rather chooseth to reconcile them to one another with their owne consents. In a mild, and humble addresse of himselfe; therefore, not entitling himselfe more to one side then anonher, he equally beseecheth them all, that he might the more regardfully be listned to by all. And he beseecheth them for things which little concerned himselfe, but for their owne good. He petitions them that they would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and spends intreaties that they would vouchsafe to goe to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47537:25"/>
heaven. He requests them that they would not be worse Christians, that is, Schismatiques and Seperatists, then they were Heathens, that is, unanimous Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he begs of them that they would once more be a Church and City; that is, a place of communion, and society, and Christian conversation. And that hee might the more prevailingly obtaine this of them, he addresseth himselfe to them in a stile and compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greatest and gentlest perswasion to peace that can bee used, and calls them <hi>Brethren.</hi> A word, which to remove all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of better or worse, or of inferiour or superiour, (the usuail grounds of discord) not only signifies an equality between the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecher and the beseeched, and the beseeched among themsevles; (For <hi>Esse Fratres est relatio inter aequales,</hi> sayes the Lawyer as well as the Logician; to be brethren, carries a reference of equality to one another) but it implies all the naturall and religious grounds for which men ought to maintaine League and Agreement, and Peace with one another. For in calling them <hi>Brethren,</hi> he called them men of the same fociable kinde, equally descended from the same common Originall and stock, and equally wearing in their nature one and the same common Image of God. And therefore, for this they were not to disagree, or quarrell with one another: Since likenesse of kinde maintains agreement between savage beasts and Tygers. <hi>Leonum feritas inter se non dimicat, serpentum morsus non petunt serpentes;</hi> Who ever heard of a Lyon devovred by a Lyon? Or who ever heard of a Serpent stung by a Serpent? much lesse should men then, bite and devour, and prey upon one another.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in calling them Brethren, besides the naturall affinity that was between them as men, he put them in minde of their spirituall alliance, as they were Christians too. That is, men alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one another by one common Faith, one common Hope, one common Redemption, and therefore to meet in one common bond of Peace and Charity too. <hi>Rixari, &amp; se invicem convitiis lacessere Infidelium est;</hi> 'Tis for Infidells, and men not converted to the Faith, to provoke, or brawle, or quarrell with one another.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, lest all this sweetnesse of addresse and language should not prevaile, he joynes Conjuration to Petition, but vailes it in the stile and forme of a Petition too, and beseecheth them to unity by the name of his, and their Lord Jesus Christ. A name, by which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47537:25"/>
as he had before dispossest Devills, cured sicknesses, and restored the dead to life againe, so he repuests that he may dispossesse opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, cure divisions, and restore agreement by it too. It being that name into which they were all baptized, and to which they had all past their promises, and vowes. Lastly, a name by which they were all to be saved; and by which they, by whose names (to the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish and disparagement of this) they called themselves, were, with them, equally to be called, that is, Christians.</p>
                  <p>Here then, 'twere much to be wisht, that the Preachers of our times would deale with their disagreeing flocks, as this Apostle dealt with his: That is, that they would imploy their holy, and religious arts and endeavours, by sweetnesse of language, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of behaviour to all parties, to reconcile them. For since it may be truly said of Preachers, what was once said of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, that the people are the waters, and they the windes that move them; to be thus the windes to them, as to speak, and move, and blow them into waves and billowes, which shall roll, and strike, and dash, and breake themselves against each other; Or to be thus the windes to them, as to rob them of their calme, and to trouble the peacefull course, and streame of things well setled, and to raise a storme and tempest there, where they should compose and allay one, is not to act the part of an Apostle, or of a Preacher of the Gospell, but of an <hi>Erynnis,</hi> or Fury, who ascending from hell with a firebrand in her hand, and snakes on her head, scatters warres, and strifes, and hatreds, and murthers, and treasons, and betrayings of one another as she passeth. Every haire of her head hurld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people becomes a sedition, and serpent; and every sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of her Torch sets Villages, and Towns, and Cities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Empires in a Combustion.</p>
                  <p>Alas, my brethren, how many such furies, rather then Preachers, have for some yeares walkt among us? Men who speaking to the people in a whirle-winde, and breathing nothing but pitcht-fields, and sieges, and slaughters of their Brethren, doe professe no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be a Sermon, which rends not the Rockes and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines before it: forgetting that God rather dwells in still, soft voices. 'Tis true indeed, the Holy Ghost once assumed the shape of cloven Tongues of fire: But that was not from thence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Incendiaries of the Church; Teachers whose Doctrine should
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47537:26"/>
be cloven too; and which should tend onely to divide their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</p>
                  <p>If I should aske you, from whence have sprung our present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions? Or, who are they who keep the wounds of our divided Kingdome bleeding? Are they not certaine tempestuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable active men, who make it their work and businesse to rob men of the greatest temporal blessing of the Scripture, and to preach every man out of the shade of his owne Vine, and out of the fruit of his owne Fig-tree, and out of the water of his owne Cisterne? Are they not men who will stone you for your Vineyard, and then urge Scripture for it? And will take away your field, your posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, your daily bread from you, and then repay you with a piece of <hi>Esay</hi> or <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> or one of the Prophets, and call this melting, and reformation? Are they not men who doe onely professe to have the art not to heale, or close, or reconcile, but to inflame, and kindle sides? Men who blow a Trumpet in the Pulpit, and there breath nothing but thunder, and ruine, and desolation, and destruction, Whose followers call themselves <hi>Brethren,</hi> indeed, and boast much of their charity; But they call only such as are of their owne confederacy, Brethren: and make no other use of the word which was at first imposed by Christ, to bee the stile and marke of agreement and peace, then to bee the word and mark to know a faction by, and make no other use of their charity, which should extend it selfe to all men, even to their very enemies, but onely to keep themselves together in a separation and conspiracy.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, these are the men, who when they should strive to quench the present flame with their teares, do conjure as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the name of Christ to discord and confusion, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here in this Text doth to order and agreement. Men who call it prophecy, and edification, and building up of the people, when they breake and divide them into Sects and Factions. As zealously exhorting them to speake divers things, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> here exhorts them to speake all the same. Which is the next thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered; and the first step towards the reconciliation, and peace, here petitioned for, which is unity and agreement in compellations and names in these words, <hi>Now I beseech you Brethren, that yee all speak the same thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether the dispersion of men, after the building of the Tower
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47537:26"/>
of <hi>Babell,</hi> over the face of the whole earth, were a punishment or a blessing to mankinde, I shall not in this Auditory examine or dispute. Only thus much we learne from the History of that place, that the occasion of that dispersion and separation of men from one another, sprung first from the confusion which God threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and that confusion sprung from their diversity of speech. For as speech was at first bestowed upon us by God, that wee might hold league and society, and friendship with one another: so you may read in the 11. Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> that as long as all the world was of one language, and of one speech, they lived unanimously together like men of one family and house. One heart, one soule seemed to move in them all. But when they once ceast to be <hi>unius labii homines,</hi> men of the same lip and speech, when as many languages were throwne among them, as they afterwards possest Countries, then society, and co-habitation, and brotherhood ceast among them too. <hi>They were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth,</hi> saies the Scripture. They who were before children of the same common An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours, and derived themselves from the same common parentage and stock, as if they had been borne in the adverse Hemispheres of the world, or had taken their beginning from as many severall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as they afterwards found Islands, of one great Family and Kindred, became so many divided Nations.</p>
                  <p>As this diversity of Tongues at first broke the world into the severall crumbles and portions of men, who from that time to this have divided it among them; so there is not any one thing which hath so fatally divided Kingdomes, and States, and Churches against themselves, somtimes to an utter extirpation, many times to an eternall breach, and Irreconciliation, as diversity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I doe not meane when men speake divers tongues of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dialects, and significations, (as when they at the building of <hi>Babell</hi> spoke some of them Hebrew perhaps, some of them Greek) but my meaning is, that nothing more directly tends to the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a State, or Church, then for severall companies of men to distinguish, and divide and separate themselves from one another by certaine words and names of marke and difference, especially if they be words of disgrace, and scandall, and reproach, mutually imposed, and stuck upon each other; Or words of faction, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47537:27"/>
combination, assumed and taken by themselves. Then, if hatred of person, or difference of Religion doe accompany such words of distinction, that for the most part befalls them, which befell the men of the old world, they breake society and Communion, and crumble asunder; and of one people become so many divided Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Churches to each other. This is an Engine which the Devill and wicked Polititians have in all ages of the world made use of, to disturb the peace, and trouble the happinesse of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Common-wealths. Making holy, vertuous words and names, many times the partition wall of separation; And the device, and incitement, not onely to divide Kingdomes but Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and private Families against themselves. As long as the Jewes called themselves by one and the same common name of their Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> Israelites, they made but one State, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth among them. But when once ten Tribes ingrossed that name to themselves, and the other two for distinction sake called themselves by the name of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the most united, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest, neerliest allied people in the world, a people of one blood, as well as one language, fell asunder, and divided themselves, like <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> into two hostile, irreconcileable, never more to bee united Kingdomes. And this was the case of these disagreeing Corinthians, to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> directed this Text. As long as they called themselves by one, and the same common name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they made but one City, one Church, one place of Concord. But when they once began to distinguish themselves by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Teachers, when some said, <hi>We are of Paul,</hi> others, <hi>we are of Cephas:</hi> A third sort, <hi>we are of Apollos;</hi> And onely a fourth sort, more Orthodox then the rest, <hi>we are of Christ;</hi> Then, then indeed, as if Christ had been divided, or had beene the Author of severall Religions, preacht among them by severall Apostles, they became broken, and rent, and torne asunder, into severall Churches and Congregations. Where their usuall custome was, not onely to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Sermon against Sermon, and Gospell against Gospell, and Teacher against Teacher, but everie one in the defence of their owne Teacher, and his Gospell, thought it part of their Religion to extoll, and quote, and urge the purity and infallibility of the one, to the depression, and disgrace, and contempt of the other: Till at length it came to passe, (as I told you before) that that which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47537:27"/>
begun in Religion, proceeded to bad manners, and ill behaviour. Markes and words of distinction, and difference, grew to bitter invectives, and mutuall reproaches of one another. They who were the followers of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, called those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Apollos,</hi> by way of marke and infamy, <hi>Apolonists.</hi> And they who were the followers of <hi>Apollos,</hi> by way of retaliation, and brand, called the followers of Saint <hi>Paul, Paulists,</hi> though Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> preach both the same Doctrine. Hard censures flew between them in as hard language; who ever was not of a party, nor enrolled of a side, was thought to be without the pale of the Church. The gates of heaven were shut against him, and nothing but reprobation, and the lot of the damned, and hell fire were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be his portion.</p>
                  <p>Here then, my Brethren, let me make my appeale to eyery one of you, who heare me this day, hath not this been our verie case? I must with sorrow of heart confesse to you, that as often as I have for some yeares, made to my selfe a contemplative survey of this unhappie Kingdome, I have been able to discover no cause so pernicious for the many alienations of mind, or the many sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Congregation from Congregation, heightned at length into the tragedy of an over-spreading Civill War, as certain vain, ridiculous, empty words, and names of distinction among us; which have sprung from some mens stricter or looser carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their profession of the same Religion. They of the more free, and open carriage and behaviour, who call a severe regularity and strictnesse of life, precisenesse, and an abridgement of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty, have called those of a more reserved, and lockt up, and demure conversation, Puritans, and Round-heads, and I know not what other names of contumely, and reproach. And they of the more strict behaviour, have equally as faulty, called those of a freer, and lesse composed conversation, Libertines, and Papists; the usuall words of infamy made to signifie a Cavalier. These two words my Brethren, have almost destroyed a flourishing Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                  <p>To this, I cannot but adde one most pernicious cause of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent divisions more, which people have derived to themselves from making themselves followers too much of severall Teachers; and affecting too much to bee called after their names: whilest one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47537:28"/>
saies, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> a third, <hi>I am of Apollos,</hi> only a few neutrall men, <hi>We are of Christ.</hi> Nay, if we needs must goe severall waies, I could wish wee had such sacred names as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Apollos</hi> to divide us. I know not whether it will be seasonable for me to speake it in this Assembly: But we for some late yeares have chosen to our selves names more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, and fallible to divide our selves by; whilest some have said, <hi>We are of Calvin,</hi> others, <hi>We are of Arminius,</hi> others, <hi>VVe are of Socinus.</hi> These, to the blemish, and reproach of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been made names of strife and faction. Yet they have been great and learned names; though some of them, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, have been lyable to humane Errours. But if you consider the many rents and separations into which the ordinary sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have for some years divided themselves, either you will find no names at all for them, or names so unlearned, so obscure, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together mechanick, and unconsiderable, that it will be your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how such vulgar, rude, untaught Teachers should draw Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them. It would pose me very much to tell you by any Monument of learning, or piety, which he hath left behind him to be knowne by, who was the Father, or first bringer up of the Sect of the Brownists; or who was the first Author of the Sect of the Anabaptists. I know there were Anabaptists in divers of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers times; and I know too, that the Parent of that Sect then, though he were an Hereticke, yet hee was a Scholler. But as for the Author of the Sect of the Anabaptists of our times, I cannot well say what he was. One who hath written the History of their wilde proceedings at <hi>Munster,</hi> (where they begun with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church of Jesus Christ, and proceeded at length to three wives a piece) saies, hee was a Dutch Botcher; one who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paird old Germents under a stall at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the Low-Countries; Another sayes, he was a Garmane Cobler; A third, that hee was a Westphalia Needle-maker; But another controlls that, and saies he was a Westphalia Baker. But whatever hee were, have not we in our times seene Patriarches and Prophets, as vulgar and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, as unlearned and base as he? Men who have invaded the Pulpit. I will not say, from mending old breeches, or cobling old shooes, (pardon the homelinesse of the expression I beseech you, it is but the Historians Latine translated into my English) but from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47537:28"/>
Trades so meane, so dis-ingenuous, so illiberall, that I should defile your eares, and the Pulpit to describe them: And yet, have not these moderne shades of <hi>Muntzer, Iohn of Leyden, Rotman, Knippenburge, Knipperdolling, Melchior Hoffman,</hi> the great Enthusiasts, and disturbers of <hi>Germany,</hi> to the Astonishment of all Judging men, drawn Disciples after them, I wish I could only say, as meane, and base, and vulgar as themselves? Certainly, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, consider the parallel well betweene the inspired Troublers of our Kingdome, and those, who by their wild Doctrines did set <hi>Westphalia, Saxony, Munster,</hi> and all the noblest parts of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire in a flame, and you will finde, that in this sad Eclipse of Monarchy among us, there wants onely a <hi>Sarcinator,</hi> or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, to assume to himselfe the Crowne, and to be called by a <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or privy Councell of the like Trades, <hi>Rex Iustitiae, &amp; novae Ierusalem Imperator,</hi> King of Righteousnesse, and Emperour of the new Jerusalem, to make our case the very same with theirs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in this diversitie of Guides and pastors, (Pastors scarce fit to be Overseers of unreasonable Flocks) do we not also hear as great a diversity of language spoken? The Lay-Preacher accuseth the University-man with want of the Spirit; and we of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity doe backe again account such Lay-men mad. Nay among us Schollars, they who pretend to <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine, doe banish all those out of the state of salvation, who deny absolute Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Or hold not, that from all eternity without any respect of their workes or actions, whether they be good or bad, God hath past this sad irreversible sentence and decree, That some shall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be saved, others shall as necessarily be damned. They who thinke this a piece of Stoicisme, or a Doctrine brought into the world to drive People to despaire, doe equally banish those from the state of salvation, who thus uncharitably banish others. But what speake I to you of this Congregation of such high, schollarly dissentions? or discourse to you of disputes and controversies, not in the power of Scripture, Synods, or Generall Councells to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide? That which hath more troubled the peace of our distracted Kingdome, hath been a strife of words about things as small as Cummin, or Annise: And about that part of the Kingdome of heaven, which lies not wrapt up in an unsearchable Decree, or an eternall sentence of Gods concealed Will, but in a grain of mustard-seed: A little, sleight indifferent Ceremony, or piece of Church-Discipline. One hath called it an Idolatry to make an obeysance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47537:29"/>
in the Church; another hath call'd it a piece of Gods outward worship to doe so. One hath stiled the Crosse in Baptisme a signe of Superstition; another hath stiled it the marke, and badge, and embleme of his Christianity and profession. One calls all Pictures in Church windowes, Idols; another looks on them as so much holy story, brought into Imagery and Colours. The very garments we weare have not escaped contradiction. One calls the Surplice a Romish vesture; another calls it a white robe of Innocence, and Decencie. Nay our very Prayers and Devotions have not been free from quarrels. Whilst some have called the Lords Prayer, A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect forme, enjoyned by Christ to be said as it is; others most irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently have called it a Taylors Measure, fit onely to cut out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Petitions by.</p>
                  <p>In this miserable diversity of sides, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n, where Countrymen, and men of the same speech, doe so ordinarily speak divers languages, What way is there left to beget a peace and union among us?</p>
                  <p>Truly, my brethren, I know none so fit as that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here prescribes in this Text; a way, which if it were well practised, or if men would either have more charity, or lesse gall in them, would in time beget an union and agreement between all Churches; that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that we all speake the same thing.</hi> That is, first, that wee lay aside all those odious, hatefull names and words of reproach, which serve onely to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and engender strifes, and to beget a dislike of one mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with another; that the honest, strict, regular, heedfull, conscientious man, be no longer called a Puritane, nor his wife a holy Sister; Nor the free, sociable, affable, open, harmlesly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrupulous man, be any longer called a Papist, or Atheist, or by way of reproach, a Cavallier. I speak not now of the adulterous, swearing, riotous, lying, drinking, covetous man; these are such, that one of the wayes to reforme them, is to call them by their right names.</p>
                  <p>Next, that we no longer, as our interest, or affections, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, or education, or customes sway us, pin our beleefe or faith upon any one Particular Guide or Teacher, so irremoveably, as without comparison or examination to reject and despise al others. I am of opinion we should quickly make one Church againe, if those new-borne names and words of <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47537:29"/>
not divide us. And I am also Perswaded, that our severall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines and Doctrines have not kept the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at a greater distance with us, then the style and compellation of <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Papist</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that we Schollars, in those high mysterious poynts which have equall argument and proofe on both sides, and which both sides (for ought I know) may hold yet meet in heaven, doe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiously or peremptorily betake our selves to neither; But either lay them aside, as things of meere contemplation, not of practise or use; or else speak of them to the people, onely in that generall sense wherein all sides agree, and as that generall sense is laid downe to us in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that in matters of Ceremony and forme, things either altogether indifferent, or at most, neither enjoyned, nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Scripture, that our carriage and words be alwayes as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different: That we call not that scandalous which is decent; or that decent which is scandalous: That we presse not things as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which are meerly ornamentall; nor impose ornaments as things of necessity. That where no well-establisht Law is broken by it, both in Actions and Language, where ever we come, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our selves to the harmelesse (though to us unusuall) custome of the place: Herein imitating that sure example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by being <hi>strong with the strong,</hi> and <hi>weak with the weak,</hi> as neere as we can, to <hi>become all things to all men.</hi> In things meerly Ceremoniall, to part with our Christian liberty, and peaceably to yeeld to those, who, being otherwise perswaded, will contentiously refuse to part with theirs. And where our salvation, or the salvation of our neighbour is not concerned, charitably to comply, and sort with their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; neither crossing them by our practice, though perhaps the better, nor perplexing them with our disputes, though perhaps the more rationall: But if it be possible, as much as lies in us, not only to have peace with all men in words and speech, but in society, and conversation, and Church-Assemblies too: Which is the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Unity here petitioned for, that is, an unity of meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same house of God, set downe in these words, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you Brethren, that there be no divisions among you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I may the clearlier proceed in the interpretation of this <note place="margin">4. Unity of blies.</note> part of the Text, I shall desire you to observe, that the word which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47537:30"/>
we here in English doe translate <hi>Divisions,</hi> is in the Originall Greek (by which we are to order our exposition) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: A word which signifies not every kinde of rent, or division, or disagreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; but such a division onely as is accompanied with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, unreasonable deniall of society and communion together in the same Church. A division which carries with it an obstinate sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon unnecessary grounds. Which unnecessary separation upon weake, slight grounds, is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here in this Text, by way of difference and distinction from lighter Rents, calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Schismes. A sin, my Brethren, of which if I should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to you at large, and should shew you the hainousness of it, by its dangerous effects; I might tell you that it is not only a sin against the sociable nature of men, who are borne for Communion and Commerce, and the mutuall help of one another; but it is a sin directly against that unity and peace, which Christ, as his last Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy bequeath'd to his Church. A sin, which (besides the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinion which accompanies it, which is, that they who are separated from, must therefore be separated from, because they are wicked, deplorably wicked men, men reprobated, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost in the wayes of Errour, and with whom all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is destructive to our Salvation) doth not alwaies confine it selfe within the retired, sequestred limits of a bare separation. But that which at first began from a scruple, hath many times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a Tragedy and massacre. They who at first causelesly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themselves from their Brethren, because they were wicked, have many times, as their strength and numbers have encouraged them, and as the time hath favoured their Reformation (as they have called it) proceeded from the rectifying of mens Errors, to the lessening of their fortunes. And they only have at length been called the wicked, who have been rich, and have had estates to lose.</p>
                  <p>That onely which I shall further say to you of it, is this: Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a sin which hath alwaies veyl'd it selfe in the disguise of sanctity. Thus <hi>Montanus,</hi> and his followers broke off Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the whole Christian Church then in the world, because, forsooth, 'twas revealed to them by divine illumination, that the Holy Ghost was no where to be found but in their Conventicle. An Heresie, which beginning in Schisme proceeded at length to this monstrous conceit among them, That only the house of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47537:30"/>
was the true. Church, and that <hi>Montanus</hi> himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the Holy Ghost. Thus also the <hi>Donatists</hi> (an over-scrupulous Sect of men) divided themselves from the then Catholique Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not pure enough for such sanctified Communicants; nor complied with the inspired doctrines of the Father of that Sect. And this, it seems, was the fault of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in this Text; who having intitled themselves to severall Teachers, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by degrees to divide themselves into severall Churches and Congregations: every one of which challenging to themselves the true and right Religion, and charging the others with the name of the false, thought at length that no way was left to keep themselves pure and unspotted, but by breaking off all Religious, nay Civill Commerce and Communion with each other. Hence, for feare of infection, it was held a crime for any but the Righteous, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, or converse with any but the Righteous; or for any to meet together at a spirituall Exercise, but such who first agreed in the same purity of Opinions.</p>
                  <p>Here, then, if I may once more take the liberty to parallel one people with another; is not this our very case? Hath it not been the practice of many, many yeares, for those who call themselves the godly, the righteous, the children of the most High, to breake off society and communion, nay almost neighbourly civility, with those whom they call the wicked? As there were among the Jewes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine uncleane places, and things, and persons, which whosoever toucht were for that time uncleane too; so, hath not the like opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion past among us, that there have been certaine unholy, unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied places, and persons, which make those who touch, or approach neer them unholy too? Have not some Pulpits been thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified, because, forsooth, the Preacher hath been ungifted? And wherein, I pray, hath his ungiftedness appeared? Because hee hath not expressed himself in that light, fluent, running, passionate, zealous stile, which should make him for that time seem religiously distracted, or beside himselfe? Or because his Prayer or Sermon hath been premeditated, and hath not flowne from him in such an <hi>Ex-tempore</hi> loose careere of devout emptinesses and nothings, as serve onely to entertaine the people, as Bubbles doe children, with a thin, unsolid, brittle, painted blast of wind and ayre? Or because, perhaps, the sands of his Glasse have not fleeted for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47537:31"/>
two tedious houres together with nothing but the bold insolent defamation and reviling of his Prince?</p>
                  <p>Againe, have there not been some who have thought our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unholy, because the Common-Prayer Booke hath been read there? And have renounced the Congregation, where part of the Service hath been tuned through an Organ? Hath not a dumb Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in the window driven some from the Church? And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Oratories, have not some in the heat and zeale of their Separation, turned their Parlours, Chambers, and Dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roomes into Temples, and Houses of Prayer? Nay, hath not Christ been worshipt in places yet more vile and mean? In places, which have reduced him the second time to a Stable? If I should aske the people of both Sexes, who are thus given to separation, and with whom a Repetition in a Chamber edifies more then a learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Church, upon what religious grounds, or motives either taken from the Word of God, (which is so much in their mouthes) or from reason, (which is so little in their practice) they thus affect to single and divide themselves from others: I believe it would pose them very much to give a satisfying Answer. Is it because the persons from whom they thus separate themselves, are irreligious, wicked men? Men who are Christians onely in forme, and whose conversation carries nothing but evill example and pollution with it? If I should grant this to be true, and should allow them to be out-right what they call themselves, The Elect, and Godly, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones of the earth; and other men to be outright what they call them, The Reprobate, the wicked, the ungodly and prophane, yet is not this warrant enough to divide or separate themselves from them. Nor are they competent Judges of this, but God only, who by the mouth of his Son, hath told us in the Parable, that the wheat and corne is not to be separated from the chaffe and tares when we list, but that both are to grow together till the great harvest of the world. Till then 'tis a piece of the building of it, that there bee a commixture of good and bad.</p>
                  <p>Besides, let me put this Christian <hi>Dilemma</hi> to them: either the persons from whom they divide themselves are holy or unholy: If they be holy, they are not to separate themselves from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are like themselves; If they be unholy, they are in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to converse with them, that they may reforme and make them
<pb facs="tcp:47537:31"/>
better. Did not our Saviour Christ (and certainely his example is too great to be refused) usually converse with Publicans and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Did he forsake the Table, because a Pharisee made the Feast? Or did he refuse a perfume, because a harlot powred it on his head? Or did he refuse to goe up into the Temple, because buyers and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were there, men who had turned it into a den of Theeves? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely my Brethren, we may, like Christ, keep company with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and Hypocrites, and Publicans and Sinners, and yet retaine our innocence. 'Tis a weake excuse to say, I will never consort my selfe with a swearer, lest I learne to blaspheme: Or, I will utterly renounce all familiarity and acquaintance with such and such an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, or with such and such a Drunkard, lest I learne to commit Fornication from the one, or Intemperance from the other. In all such conversations, we are to imitate the Sun, who shines into the foulest puddles, and yet returnes from thence with a pure untainted Ray. If mens vices then, and corruptions, bee not a sufficient cause to warrant a separation, what else can be? Is it the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or Church, or the things done there, which hath made them shun our ordinary Congregations? Yes, say some, we have held it very unlawfull (as we conceive) to assemble in such a place, where we have seen Altars, and Windowes worshipped, superstitious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worne, and have heard the more superstitious Common-Prayer Booke read, that great bolster to slothfull Ministers, and twin-brother to the Mass, and Liturgie of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were this Charge true, (a very heavy one, I confess) had there been any among us so unreasonably stupid, as to spend their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on a pane of glass, or pay worship to the dumb sensless crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Painter, or adore the Communion-Table, the wooden issue of the Axe and Carpenter, (as I think there were none) had there (I say) been very Idolaters among us, yet unlesse they would have compelled them to be Idolaters too, I (after all the impartiall Objections which my weake understanding can frame) can see no reason why they should not communicate with them in other things wherein they were no Idolaters. I am sure, if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not kept company with Idolaters, we to this day (for ought I know) had remained Infidels.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, deceive not your selves with a fallacy, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry child is able to discover. If such superstitio ns had been publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47537:32"/>
practised among us, it is not necessary that every one that is a spectator to anothers mans sin, should presently be an offender. Nor are all offences so like the Pestilence, that he that comes within the breath and ayre of them, must needs depart infected. Thou seest one, out of a blind zeale, pay reverence to a picture, he hath the more to answer for. But why dost thou, out of a zeale altogether as blind, thinke thy selfe so interested in his errour, as to thinke thy self a partaker of his fault, unless thou excommunicate thy selfe from his conversation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, tell me thou, who callest Separation security; what seest thou in a Surplice, or hearest in the Common-Prayer Booke, which should make thee forbeare the Congregation where these are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? Is it the web, or matter, or colour, or fashion of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or is it the frame or forme, or indevotion of the Book which offends thee? Or art thou troubled because they have both beene borrowed from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> That indeed is the great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of exception; which under the stile of Popery, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most turned Religion it selfe out of the Church. But, then, it is so weake, so accidentall, so vulgar an Argument, an Argument so fit for none to urge but silly women, with whom the first impression of things alwaies takes strongliest, that I must say in replie to it, That by the same reason, that thou poore, tender-conscienc'd man, (who art not yet past milke, or the food of infants in the Church) makest such an innocent, decent vesture as Surplices, unlawfull, because Papists weare them, thou mayest make eating and drinking unlawfull, because Papists dine and sup. The subject is not high or noble enough to deserve a more serious confutation. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which I shall say by way of Repetition, is onely this: If to weare or do, whatever Papists weare or doe be unlawfull, as it will presently concerne us all to throw off our garments and turne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damites,</hi> so it will very neerely concern us too, to lay aside our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and betake our selves to fasting, as the ready way to famine. Then to reject the Common-Prayer Book, because some of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in it resemble the Prayers in the Romish Liturgie, is as unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as if thou shouldst make piety and devotion in generall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, because Papists say their Prayers. And so, in opposition to whatever they do, shouldst think thou art to turne Athiest, because most in that Church do confess there is a God.</p>

The time wil not give me leave to say much in the defence of that excellent Book; Or, if I should, tis in any thing, I presume, which can fall from my imperfect mouth, which wil be able to recover the use of it back again into this Church. Yet thus much, out of the just sense, and apprehension which I have of the wisedome, as well as piety, and devotion of it, I shall adventure to say. That I cannot think, that ever any Christian Church, since the time that that name first came into the world, had a publique forme of Gods Worship, more Primitively pure, more Religiously grave, and more agreeable in all points to the Scripture, then that is.</p>
                  <p>To which I shall only add this one praise of it more, that there is not any Ancient, Classically condemned Heresie, to be found in the Records of Councells, Church-Histories, or the Confutations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is not by some clause or other in that most Orthodox Book excluded.</p>
                  <p>Here, then, if there be any in this Assembly of that il-perswaded mind, that he would not at this present make one of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Common-prayers were read, let me once more ask him, what that great Antipathie between him, and that admirable Book is, which should make them quarrel one another out of the Church: Is it because it prescribes a Ring i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>not carefull to observe thee in this matter.</hi> But where no such things were enjoyned, where every one was left to the full use and exercise of his Christian liberty, where nothing was blameable among us, but the ridiculous, over-acted postures and gestures of some few busie, fantasticall men, whose Popery lay in makeing discreet men laugh, to see them so artificially devout, and so affectedly ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to divide, and separate, or to give us over for a lost Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Psalmes of <hi>David,</hi> after his own Musicall way, used to be sung to an Organ; As innocently, certainly, as if they had been tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through his own loud Cymball, or had more softly been sung, and vowell'd to his Harpe: Or to renounce our solemne Assemblies, for such sleight, indifferent things, as a piece of holy story in a glass win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or because the Minister wears white, or because marryed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come together by a Ring, or because the Lords Prayer is more then once repeated, is not only Schisme, and I may safely say, Schisme upon scandall taken, not giuen, but tis directly contrary to S <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, here in this Text; who is so far from tolerating any such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less divisions, and separations of presences and bodies, that he will not allow in the same Church and Congregation the least dissent or division of minds; But makes it the least part of his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his disagreeing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they would not only meet together in the same place of Gods Worship, but that they would be <hi>perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judg-ment,</hi> which is the last part of the Text. To which I shall only adde some brief Application of some things in this Sermon to you my hearers, and so commend you to God.</p>
                  <p>'Twas well said of one of the Philosophers, (which saying of his hath since almost grown into a Prouerb of truth) <hi>Nihil est in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectu,</hi>

                     <hi>quod non fuit priùs in sensu;</hi> That there is nothing in the understanding, or mind within, which was not first in the sense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Tis as great, and measured a Truth, that there is nothing in our speech, or words, or actions without, which was not first in our mind, or wil, or affections within. For what our Saviour Christ
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47537:33"/>
said, that <hi>Out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, murthers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, thefts, false witness, blasphemies,</hi> and the like; to every <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 1</note> one of which sins without, belongs some secret, invisible spring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. As, I say, to every Adultery without, belongs some hidden lust within; and the uncleannesse of the body is but the foul issue, and off-spring of the soul; And as to every murther without, belongs some secret envy, or hatred, or thirst of revenge within; and the rancour of the heart only clothes it self in the violence and bloud-shed of the hand: so we may say of our Divisions, and Disagreements too. All those odious words, and names of mutuall infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; all those perverse crossings, and thwartings, and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of speech; all this duell, and skirmish, and quarrelsomeness of language; Lastly, all this shunning and lothing of one anothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; all this separation, and denyall of communion, which we so ordinarily see exercised, and practiced without, are but so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian behaviours, which take their originall and birth from as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian grudges, and prejudices, and jealousies, and mis-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions within. Never man yet dissented from another in speech, but he first dissented from him in opinion: And never man yet separated from another in communion, but he first separated from him in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and will. To remove, therefore, the root and spring of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements, as well as the current and stream; and to beget a peace, and concord, and reconciliation without, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> like a skilfull Artist, who reserves the hardest part for the last, proceeds from mens words and actions, to their opinions and thoughts: and like those who set Watches, and Clocks, where the Hand upon the Dyall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, cannot move regularly, unless the weights and springs which guide it, move orderly within; the better to make us go all alike, and strike the same time, he endeavors to setle and compose those inward wheels, by which our words and behaviors without, are to be ruled and governed.</p>
                  <p>The thing then for which he here so earnestly Petitions, is Unity, and Agreement, and Consent of minds. Which, in plain terms, is to exhort us, that as we are all men of one and the same reasonable kind, formed and created like one another in the shape and figure of our body, so that we would approve our selves to be men of one and the same reasonable kinde, in the Musique and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47537:34"/>

Or, if he cannot do this by the strength and diligence of his own naturall Forces, that he would have recourse to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>dness and errour, and to make him not only speak, but conceive, and think the same things with him that taught him.</p>
                  <p>It was wel said of him, who compared our minds to Looking-glasses, or Mirrours; For certainly if we could but keep them open, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded, they carry this property of Mirrours with them, not only to return the images, and shapes, and truths of things, which pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as they are; but all minds in a clearer, or less clear degree, have a capacity to receive into them the truth of the same things alike. As a thousand Glasses, if they be true, successively lookt in, wil shew us the same faces: But then, as Glasses, if they be false, wil cast false resemblances; or if they be discoloured, wil transform all things which flow into them into their own die: So tis with us. I know not how it comes to pass, or whether I may ascribe the fault to Education, or Custome, or to our parents, or to our Affections, too much knit, and wedded to the Religion, or Doctrin, or Opinion, or Teacher, which most complyes with our Fancies; but there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ill-cut, false-reporting minds, which look upon men, and things, in another size and figure then they are. Other minds there are stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and died (as it were) with certain weak prejudices, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt opinions; through which, as through so many deceiving colours, they discern no truths which wear not that hue. As he that looks through a green Glass, takes all things for green; and he that looks through a blew Glass, takes all things for azure. And this was the very case of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in the Text. They first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themselves over-partially to severall Teachers; and from their severall Teachers, took in severall apprehensions, as they pleased to like or affect him above others, whose Disciples
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47537:34"/>
they called themselves. Some, though they did not well understand what they held, resolved (without any examination what they were) to be only of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> opinions: Others resolved to hold only what had been taught them by <hi>Apollos:</hi> Others resolved to hold only what had been preacht by S. <hi>Peter.</hi> All which three taught and preacht one and the same Gospell; yet that Gospel was not alike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by all hearers. Whilst some disliked it in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> because <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> (as himself complains) he was of an humble presence, and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful utterance. Others dislike it, perhaps, in the mouth of <hi>Apollos,</hi> because it came Rhetorically from him, and he was guilty of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying crime, forsooth, of being eloquent in the Pulpit. Others perhaps entertain'd it coldly from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> because he had not been bred up in the School of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> nor tasted of the finer Arts and educations of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short, one and the same saving Truth, for want of a little right judgment in the Hearers to compare it, comming from several mouths, past into divers opinions first; and then these opinions broke forth into divers factions. And is not this, my Brethereu, our very case? Do but consider the present distempers of our poor, divided King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and, pray, what hath been the true root and spring of so much variance, and hatred, and heart-burning among us? what hath crumbled us asunder, and turn'd one of the purest, and most flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Churches of the world, into a heap of Heresies and confusion? Hath it not been the very word of God it self? In which all minds, I confess, should agree, and which should be the rule to compose all our strifes; and before whose decisions the greatest Scholars Disputes, and the meanest mans Doubts, should fall down, and mutually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and kiss each other. How comes it then to pass, that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was ordained by God to be the oyl to cure our wounds, should prove only the oyl to feed, and nourish our combustions? Whence is it, that the Scripture, that Sword of the Spirit, should prove to us only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a two-edged sword, and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use should be made of it by us, but only to be the weapon of our Conflicts, by committing the edges, and making them enter duell, and combat with each other? Truly, my bretheren, all the reason that I can give you for this, is, That some (perhaps wel mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, but not of understandings either strong, or learned enough
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47537:35"/>
to reach the true sense and meaning of some places) have stept beyond their measure; and have presumed to interpret more then they have well understood. Others, of a more modest, but credulous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, have thought that only to be the right meaning of the Word of God, which they have heard from the mouth of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher which they most affect. Others, of a more dangerous policy, finding that the Scripture rightly expounded would extreamly make against the plot of their dark proceedings, and that the holy Ghost cannot be bribed to finde Texts to make covetousness, sedition, or the slaughter of their Brethren, or Rebellion against their Prince, lawfull; have, with some formall helps of piety, and zeal, put to their expositions, made the Scripture speak only those plausible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, which most complied with their ends, and the peoples Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Hence, the better to arrive to their Estates, by the distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their minds, they have dealt with them as cunning Anglers do with silly fishes, troubled the stream, and blinded them, and then made them their prey. The way to do this was to affront, and disgrace, clamour down all the primitive Truths for some Generations taught among them; and to recall from their sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, and dust, all the old, intricate, long since buried Opinions, which were the madnesse of their own times, and the Civill Warre of ours. With which opinions they have dealt, as the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> dealt with her Familiar, raised them up to the people clothed in a long mantle, and speaking to them in the shape and voyce of a Prophet. Hence come those severall acceptions, and interpretations among you, even in your ordinary discourses, of one and the same plaine, but sinisterly understood places of Scripture. One, following the practice of all the purest ages of the Church, thinkes the Sacrament of Baptisme is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to Infants. Others, (who would certainly be a strange fight to the Congregation, if they should appear the second time at the Font) of late are taught to thinke that none are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but such as are old enough to be their owne Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and can enter into Covenant with God, and promise for themselves. Some, because it hath beene called a binding of the spirit, to fetter their devotions in a set forme of Prayer, have banisht that Prayer, which Christ prescribed to his Apostles, out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47537:35"/>
their Closets, as well as Temples. Others, of as rectified a piety, think no Prayer so likely to finde acceptance with God, as that which was conceived, and put into forme by his Sonne. I should tire your patience too much to give you an exact Catalogue of all the rotten opinions which at this present swarm among us. One who hath computed the Heresies, which have sprung up in this Kingdome within these five years, sayes, they have doubled the number of those which were in Saint <hi>Austins</hi> time; and then they were very neer fourscore. One is a <hi>Chiliast,</hi> and holds the personall Reigne of Christ upon Earth. Another is a <hi>Corporealist,</hi> and holds the death of the Soul with the Body. Nay, as 'tis said in <hi>Africke,</hi> a Lyon will couple with a Tyger, from whence will spring a Libbard; so certain strange, unheard-of, double-sex't Heresies are sprung up among us: not able to understand what he would hold himselfe. You shall have an <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Sabellian</hi> lodged together in the same person. Nay, (which is yet worse) whatever <hi>Celsus</hi> spoke in scorn, and <hi>Origen</hi> in vindication of our Redeemer, Christ and his Mother, hath of late trodden the Stage again, and appeared to disturbe the World. One (I tremble to speak it) hath called the Virgin <hi>Maryes</hi> chastity into question; And others have spoken of the Saviour of the World so suspiciously as if he had been a thing, of a stoln, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Birth. In short, there want only some of those <hi>Munster</hi> men among us, of whom <hi>Sleydan</hi> writes, where one calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>God the Father,</hi> another <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> A third Paraclete, or <hi>God the holy Ghost,</hi> to make our Babel and confusion of wilde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions at the height. In this miserable distraction, then, where He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, and Errour, hath almost eaten up the true Religion; And where all the light of the Gospel, which shines among us, is but like that imperfect light at the Creation, which shined before the Sunne was placed in the firmament; A light creeping forth of a dark Chaos and blind masse, and strifefull heape of jarring Elements: In this thick fogge of strange Doctrines, I say, which hath condenst it selfe into a cloud, which hath almost overspread this whole Kingdome, from which Truth seemes to have taken flight, and made way for <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> to stile it selfe once more <hi>the Mother of devotion,</hi> what way is there left to reconcile our minds, or to beget one right knowledge, and understanding of the wayes of God among us? Truly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47537:36"/>
I know none but that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here prescribes in the Text; which is, that we endeavour as near as we can, to be <hi>of one mind, and of one judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how shall this be brought to pass, unless all judgments were alike clear, and unbiassed? Or, unless, laying apart all partiality, and affection to their own side, and all prejudice, and hatred against those from whom they differ, men would submit themselves to him, who is best able to instruct them; Or who can bring with him the most saving Truths into the Pulpit? Besides, (may some one say) if people should bring minds prepared to entertain the Truth, where is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor so infallible, or so opinionated of the strength of his own gifts and knowledg, that another pretending to the same Truth, may not challenge to himself the like infallibility? who shall be the Judg of Controversies? or who shall present Truth to us with such known marks and notes about it, that as soon as tis presented, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation (of what mean capacities soever) shall presently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and entertain it? Wil you, Sir, who have all this while thus bemoaningly pitied our divisions? we are bound to thank you for your charity to us; and should be desirous enough to imbrace a truth of your description. But you are a Scholar, whose parts and abilities lye in the humane modell, and building of your own secular studies. We are therefore bid to doubt very much, whether you have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and are told by some who profess themselves inspired, that all your Readings, and Studyings, and tyrings of your self over a difficult piece of Scripture, at midnight perhaps, when all others sleep, by a lone, solitary, dumb candle, are but so many labours in vain, Since tis impossible for any to understand the Scripture aright, but such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who have it revealed to them by the same holy Spirit that wrote it.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, what shall I say to you? Modesty, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg I have of my own imperfections, wil not allow me to say pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, that I have the Spirit of God. Or if I could distinguish his secret influences and assistances from the operations of my own soul, or could certainly say I have him, (which S, <hi>Paul</hi> himself durst not say definitively) yet 'twould not become me so to confine him to my frail, narrow parts, as to deny him to all others more learned then my self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47537:36"/>
For the setling therefore, and composing of your divided minds, I will not take upon me to be the Judge of Controversies, but you your selves shall be. Onely the better to enable you to peforme this charitable office to your selves, and for your better direction how not to be out in your judgement, as a sure clue to guide you through the perplext windings of that labyrinth into which some of you are falne, so falne, that they seem to me quite lost in a wood of mistakes, where every path is a guide, and every guide is an error, give me leave to commend to you that seasonable advice of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> which he delivers in the fourth Chapter of his first Epistle, at the first verse, where (as if he had prophecyed of our times) he sayes, <hi>Beloved, beleeve not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they be of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> In which words; you have two of the best Rules assigned you to go by, that can possibly be prescribed for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of minds.</p>
                  <p>First, be not too credulous; Doe not presently beleeve every man that sayes he hath the Spirit; nor suffer your selves to be tost and carried about with every wind of doctrine: For that is not the way to be all of one, but of as many severall minds as the art or cunning of severall Teachers shall please to work upon you. I am perswaded this easinesse of belief, this credulity, or (as the Apostle calls it) this admiration, this overvaluing of some mens persons, hath been one of the great parents of our present dissentions: whilst some weak, but yet well-minded people, building their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meerly upon the outward appearances of men, have mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the zeal and strict life of their Preacher for his sufficiency. And taking their Logicke from the precisenesse of his behaviour, have framed these charitable, but false conclusions to themselves: He is a man of a composed countenance, of a reserved speech, of a grave carriage, and of a devout elocution, therefore surely he is a holy man. And because he is a holy man, therefore whatever hee saies, shall be to us Oracle; as coming from the mouth of one, so much in the favour of God, that it is impossible he should deceive us, or speak that which is not right.</p>
                  <p>My Brethren, I have no designe or purpose to bring Holinesse into contempt; nor can I bee so injurious to piety or a good life, where ever I find it, as to expose it to the scorne of the licentious,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47537:37"/>
by not giving it its due. I am so farre also from lending encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the lives of vitious Teachers, (Teachers who are the shame of their Mother, and the scandall of their Flock) that I could wish that every Congregation in England were furnished with such an exemplary Minister, that his life as well as preaching, might be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the people. Nay, give me leave, I beseech you, to extend my charity yet one degree farther. I am so farre from disliking ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse either in Preacher or people, that I wish we all made but one united Kingdome of Priests. Or, if you will have me expresse my selfe in the words of one of the holiest and meekest men of the earth, I could wish that <hi>all the Lords People were Prophets.</hi> But, <note place="margin">

Nor hath God so annext the understanding of his Word to the unstudied, unlearned piety, or sober carriage of the Expounder, that he that is most zealous shall still bee most in the right.

And as the learned scandalous Preacher may be sometimes in the right; so it is possible that the ignorant, zealous, holy Preacher may be often in the wrong. How to know this, and how to distinguish them, therefore, you are to make use of the next Rule prescribed to you by Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> that is, when you heare an Exposition, or a Sermon, or a new Doctrine preached to you, not rashly, without distinction or choice to consent to it, till you have past the impartiall sentence of a cleare judgement on it; compared and weighed Sermon with Sermon, and Preacher with Preacher; called every Doctrine, every Proofe, every confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Assertion to the touch-stone, and measured it by some plaine evident place of Scripture; and examined whether the Holy Ghost, or his owne vaine, popular ambition, have for that time inspired the speaker; or whether his Sermon have had some dissembled, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end, or Gods glory for its marke. And this Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls, <hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47537:37"/>
of Truth, the Word of God; and make that, well considered, the scales to weigh his Doctrine in. Does hee preach charity, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish strife from his Pulpit? Does he not flatter Vice, though he find it clothed in Purple, nor speak neglectfully of Vertue, though he finde it clothed in rags? Does he strive to plant the feare and love of God in his Auditory, the forgivenesse of their enemies, and pity towards the poore? Dares he arraigne a publique sinne, though never so fortunate? or speak in defence of afflicted Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, though over-borne by oppression? Dares he maintaine his Christian courage in Tyrannicall, doubtfull times? And dares he call prosperous Sedition, but a more successefull mischiefe? Lastly, does he preach such Christian Truths for which some holy men have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to which he himselfe would not be affraid to fall a sacrifice? This, this man is to be hearkned to; this man is fit to bee obeyed. And this man speaking the same things which God himselfe doth in the Scripture, (whatever his gifts of pleasing, or not pleasing sick, fastidious, delicate fancies be) is thus at least to be thought of, That though he speake not by the Spirit, (as a thing entailed upon him) yet, for that time, the Spirit speaks by him, which ought to be all one to you. On the contrary, does the Preachers Sanctity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consist meerly in the devout composure of his looks and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? Does he strive to preach downe Learning, or does he call Study a humane folly? Does he choose his Text out of the Bible, and make the Sermon out of his Fancy? Does he reprove Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but preach up discord? Is he passionate against Superstition, but milde and calme towards Sacriledge? Does hee inveigh and raile at Popery, and at the same time imitate the worst of Papists, Jesuits, urge Texts for the Rebellion of Subjects against their Prince, and quote Scripture for the deposing, and Butchery of Kings? Does hee startle at a dumb picture in a Church-window, and at the same time preach all good order and right Discipline out of the Church? Does an Oath provoke his zeale, yet does he count lying in the godly no sin? Lastly, does hee preach separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon weake untemper'd grounds? Or does labour to divide the minds, which hee should strive to reconcile? Let him bring what demurenesse or composure of countenance he please into the Pulpit; Let him, if he please, joyne sanctity of deportment to earnestnesse of zeale; Let him never so devoutly bewaile the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47537:38"/>
of his Country, which he hath helpt to make miserable; Or let him weepe never so passionately over the Congregation, which he hath broken into factions; In short, how seemingly holy, how precise, how unprophane soever his behaviour bee; though the Scripture doe so continually over-flow in his mouth, that hee will neither eat, nor drinke, nor speake, nor scarce sleep but in that phrase, yet as long as he thus forgets his Charity, thus Preaches strife, thus Division, I shall so farre mistrust whether he have the Spirit, that I shall not doubt to reckon him in the number of those <hi>false Prophets</hi> which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayes <hi>are gone out into the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conclusion then of this Sermon shall be this. Men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I have with all the sincerity and plainnesse which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit your soules, preacht Truth, and Concord, and mutuall Charity to you. I have also for some yeeres, not been so sleepy an Observer, but that I have perceived some of you (who have thought your selves more Religious then the rest) to be guilty of the (I might say Crime, but I will rather say of the) mis-guided Zeale of these <hi>Corinthians</hi> here in my Text. There have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Divisions, and I know not what separations among you. I have farther observed, that certaine false, causlesse prejudices and aspersions have been raised upon our University, which to the grief of this famous Nursery of Gods Church at home, and the reproach of it abroad, are still kept waking against us by some of you, as if Conscience and Religion, as well as Learning and Gifts, had so far forsaken us, that all the Schools of the Prophets cannot afford you a set of able, vertuous men, fit to be the Lecturers to this soule-famisht Parish. How we should deserve to be thus mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by you, or why you should under-value those able Teachers which you have already, or refuse to take your supply from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Colledges which here stand present and ready to afford you choyce: or why you should supplicate to the great Councell of this Kingdome, in pitty to your soules, to send you Godly Teachers, (which, perhaps, is but a well-meaning Petition from you, but certainly 'tis agreat scandall, and Libell against us) I know not. But whatever the mysterious cause be, I am confident, that unlesse they will sleep over their infamy and reproach, it will alwayes be in the power of our despised University-Divines, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47537:38"/>
even to those whom you intend to petition, That this is but a zealous errour in you: And that they are as able to edifie you, certainly, as he, whose occupation it was to repaire the old shooes of the Prophets. I should shame some of you too much, who were the Disciples of that Apostle, if I should discribe him to you by a larger character.</p>
                  <p>Instead therefore of a farther vindication of the reproach throwne upon us, that which I shall say of more neere concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you, is this: If I have in the progresse of this Sermon, ript open any wounds among you, it hath not been with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to enlarge, or make them bleed, but to powre wine and Oyle into them, and to heale, and close them up.</p>
                  <p>Next, If I have cleared any of your sights, or inabled you at length to discerne, that the reason why the mote in your brothers eye seemed so big, was, because an over-scrupulous zeale had placed a beame in your owne; and that in contributing to the ruine of one of the purest Religions in the world, the reason why you have swallowed so many monstrous Camels, hath been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at first you made scruple, and strained at gnats, I have what I intended: Which was to let you see, that to divide and separate your selves from the communion of our Church, if it had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a mole or two, is as unreasonable, as if you should quarrell the Moon out of her Orb, or think her unworthy of the skies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she wears a spot or two writ on a glorious ball of light.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if I have said any thing in the reproof of discord, or the praise of charity, which may re-unite your minds, and make you all men of the same heart and beliefe, as well as of the same Citie and Corporation, I shall thinke I have done the work and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a just Divider of the Word of God towards you, and of a faithfull Servant and Steward towards my heavenly Master. Whose blessing of peace be upon you all, together with the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost. To which glorious Trinity, be ascribed all Honor, Praise, Dominion and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for ever.</p>

Who, as if he had been one of those Tutelar, changeable <hi>Deities,</hi> which used to be enticed, and called over from one side to another, they still entertained the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they who most zealously pretended to him, had him most. And that however he be the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> &amp; <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> among men, yet in favour of his owne <hi>Cause,</hi> he would for a while be content to change his <hi>nature,</hi> and become the <hi>God of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, Disorder,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>The better to worke this perswasion into the minds of the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> their first piece of policy was to draw the <hi>Prophets</hi> into their <hi>Faction.</hi> This is exprest to us in the 25. verse of this Chapter. Where 'tis said of <hi>Ierusalem, There is a conspiracy of her Prophets, in the midst thereof.</hi> And truely, 'twas a Conspiracy so unfit for <hi>Prophets</hi> that the resemblance of it was never yet found in any but those Men of a much unholier stile, of whom the Historian saies, <hi>Est aliquod etiam inter Latrones &amp; Sicarios foedus,</hi> that <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> hold League and friendship amongst themselves. For 'tis said in the following words of that verse, that 'twas a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy <hi>like the roaring of a Lion, ravening the prey.</hi> A <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> by which <hi>they devoured Soules, and took to themselves the Treasure, and pretious things of the Land.</hi> And because pillage of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Nature, could hardly be gained without the Death, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Owners,</hi> 'tis said in the close of that verse, That <hi>they</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47537:41"/>
                     <hi>made her many Widdows in the midst thereof.</hi> To which if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had added these two <hi>words</hi> of pitty, the <hi>Fatherlesse</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi> too, nothing could have beene added to the calamity of the Description.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there a much more favourable Character stuck by the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> upon the <hi>Priests</hi> of those times. For by that which is said at the 26. verse of this Chapter, (And 'tis well worth your marking) you may perceive that the <hi>Disorder</hi> to which things were brought in the <hi>State,</hi> sprung first from the <hi>Disorder,</hi> to which things were brought in the <hi>Church.</hi> For 'tis there said, That <hi>The Priests had violated the Law,</hi> and <hi>prophaned the holy Things; That they did put no difference between the Holy, and Prophane, nor made any Distinction between the unclean, and the cleane.</hi> In briefe, the Legall, well establisht <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of God was at a kinde of losse, and <hi>Indifferency.</hi> 'Twas referred to every mans <hi>Fansie,</hi> to make to himself his own <hi>Religion, Blemisht,</hi> and <hi>unblemisht Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> began to be sacred alike. And the <hi>Scripture</hi> of another <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> became quite altered; He that <hi>offered a Swine,</hi> was thought as religious as he that <hi>slew an Oxe;</hi> And he that <hi>

                        </gap>t off a Dogs neck,</hi> was thought as liberall a <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> as he that brought a <hi>Lambe</hi> to the <hi>Altar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, having taken the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> so far into their <hi>plot,</hi> as to mingle and confound the <hi>Services</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they made it one part of their <hi>policy,</hi> more, to make them lend Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to their proceedings in the <hi>State.</hi> This is plainly intimated to us, by that which is said at the 27. verse of this chapter, cohering with that which is said in the words of my Text. For there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of certaine <gap reason="foreign">

some men powerfull in the <hi>then State</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> were, there wanted not <hi>Prophets</hi> who <hi>dawbed them with untempered Morter; seeing vanity, and divining lyes unto them, saying, thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord had not spoken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words are a History of the worst <hi>Times,</hi> in the then worst <note place="margin">division.</note> 
                     <hi>State.</hi> In which we have these considerable parts. 1. An irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Compliance,</hi> or rather <hi>Collusion,</hi> of <hi>Spirituall</hi> men with <hi>Lay.</hi> Some there were, (as you have them described in the precedent verse) whose designe 'twas, to make their <hi>Countrey</hi> their <hi>Prey;</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there were, whose part twas, to make them seem <hi>Good patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,</hi> and <hi>Protectors</hi> of their <hi>Countrey.</hi> Some <hi>destroyed Soules</hi> in the way to their Ambitious <hi>Ends,</hi> Others made it their businesse to put <hi>Holy colours</hi> on their <hi>Slaughters.</hi> Or if you wil have me express my self in the Language of both Texts, some there were who did <hi>Shed bloud, that they might get to themselves Dishonest gaine;</hi> And some <hi>Prophets</hi> there, were, who to make their proceedings seem specious, did put religious <hi>pretences</hi> to them, and with these <hi>pretences</hi> did <hi>disguise,</hi> and <hi>dawbe</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Next, we have here, the <hi>Frailty,</hi> and <hi>Weaknesse,</hi> and <hi>Deceiveable nature</hi> of such <hi>pretences.</hi> How plausible soever they seemed to the deluded <hi>vulgar,</hi> and however they might a while, not onely serve to cover, and veile foule purposes, but to set them off with a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Lustre too, yet this could not be lasting. <hi>Dishonest projects</hi> thus adorned were but so many <hi>painted Ruines.</hi> And therefore, the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who thus disguised them, are here said to <hi>Dawbe them with untempered Morter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the effecting of this, we have here a very strange <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse</hi> of their <hi>Ministery</hi> and <hi>Function,</hi> set downe to us in three <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> having every one of them something of the <hi>Forme,</hi> but nothing of the <hi>Reality</hi> of a <hi>Prophet</hi> in them. First, they are here said to be <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ers.</hi> But as for the things they saw, they were of that foolish empty nature, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath not vouchsafed to call them <hi>Dreams.</hi> We may call them visions, perhaps; But such as <hi>Aene as</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi> saw among the <hi>Shades.</hi> So voyd of <hi>Weight,</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> so far from <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> that as the fittest word which could be found for them, they are here in this place called <hi>Vanity.</hi> Next, they are here said to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> or <hi>foretell.</hi> But 'tis added withall, that they foretold not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47537:42"/>
                     <hi>Things,</hi> but <hi>lyes.</hi> As many <hi>untruths</hi> as <hi>Prophecies</hi> fell from them. And their <hi>predictions</hi> had onely thus much of <hi>Divination</hi> in them, that some time was required for men to prove them false; And to perceive, that, contrary to all true <hi>predictions,</hi> they would never come to passe. Lastly, (which was the <hi>third,</hi> and great <hi>abuse</hi> of their <hi>office</hi> and <hi>function)</hi> they were not afraid to entitle <hi>God</hi> to their <hi>vanities</hi> and <hi>lies.</hi> As often as they were pleased to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was cited, and quoted, as the <hi>inspirer</hi> of the <hi>deceit.</hi> And this bold, insolent sin was committed against the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> that the vaine, foolish, groundlesse <hi>conjectures</hi> of the Prophets, were called his <hi>Inspirations:</hi> who, to make their falshoods take the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, still uttered them in the holy, Propheticall stile of <hi>Truths,</hi> saying, <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord had not spoken.</hi> All which contracted into a narrow room, the <hi>Irreligious Compliance</hi> of <hi>Spirituall men</hi> with <hi>Lay,</hi> the <hi>weaknesse</hi> of their <hi>pretences,</hi> the <hi>abuse</hi> of their <hi>Calling,</hi> by uttering their owne <hi>vanities</hi> for <hi>inspirations,</hi> and and their owne <hi>Fictions</hi> for <hi>Truths,</hi> together with the <hi>injury</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>God,</hi> by entitling <hi>Him</hi> to all this, shall be the <hi>parts</hi> on which I will build my future Discourse. In the ordering of which, I will begin with the <hi>Compliance</hi> or <hi>Combination.</hi> Some there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iews</hi> (as you have them decyphered in the former verse) who did <hi>shed bloud, that they might get to themselves dishonest gain;</hi> and some <hi>false Prophets</hi> there were, who, to goe <hi>sharers</hi> in that <hi>gaine,</hi> by the <hi>Holinesse</hi> of their <hi>Function,</hi> did disguise and <hi>dawbe</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>It was well said of a vertuous man in the praise of Vertue, <hi>Si</hi>

                  <p>Here then, should I once more grant the charge of these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> to be true (a very heavy one I confesse) that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> among us, had very farre taken wing, and had almost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed its place in this <hi>Island</hi> to the <hi>Romish Superstition.</hi> Nay, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (which is yet farre worse) that a great, and considerable <hi>part</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> had through the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the <hi>times,</hi> not onely relapst from the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in particular, but from the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in generall; suppose, I say, (which is the worst that can be supposed) that they who have so frequently of late been branded for <hi>Papists,</hi> had out-right turned <hi>Infidels,</hi> however in such a case, that <hi>Warre</hi> which fights against the <hi>Errours</hi> of men thus lost, and proposeth to it selfe no other <hi>end</hi> but their <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> may to some perhaps, seem to weare the <hi>Helmet</hi> of their <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Army</hi> which thus strives to save men by the <hi>sword,</hi> may to some seem an <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet I doe not finde that to come into the <hi>field</hi> with an <hi>armed Gospel,</hi> is the way chosen by <hi>Christ</hi> to make Proselites. The Scripture indeed, tells us of some who took the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> by <hi>violence;</hi> But of any, who by <hi>violence</hi> may have it imposed upon them, 'tis no where record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <p>You may read in the old Testament, that the <hi>Priest</hi> of those times, among his other <hi>Ornaments,</hi> wore two precious <hi>Stones</hi> in his <hi>Brest-plate,</hi> called the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> Through which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they did at times cast a <hi>bright,</hi> or <hi>dimmer lustre,</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his pleasure, or displeasure to the People; and spoke to them by the sparkle of a <hi>Iewell,</hi> as he did at other times by the <hi>mouth</hi> of a <hi>Prophet.</hi> You may read too, that after the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was set up. God had a <hi>Throne,</hi> or <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> placed for him, between the <hi>Wings</hi> of two <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which veiled it; from whence at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times he sent forth <hi>Oracles.</hi> Here then, let me put this case to you.</p>
                  <p>Suppose the <hi>Priest,</hi> who wore the <hi>Brest-plate,</hi> should have bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Iewels,</hi> and when the people came to enquire of him, should have interpreted a <hi>pale,</hi> for a <hi>bright Ray</hi> to the people; or suppose he should have taken out the <hi>true,</hi> and have placed two <hi>false coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Iewels</hi> in his <hi>Brest-plate;</hi> and should have taught them, by a kinde of secret <hi>conspiracie,</hi> not to sparkle by the certainty, and holinesse of their owne <hi>impartiall Fires,</hi> but according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and <hi>Plot,</hi> and <hi>Stratagem</hi> of the <hi>Consulters;</hi> had not this been plainly to set up an illegitimate <hi>Anti-urim,</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47537:52"/>
should have cast a <hi>false,</hi> as the other did a <hi>true</hi> lustre? Nay, had not this been to make God, who used to appeare, and reveale himselfe in these <hi>Iewels,</hi> as he did to <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Bush,</hi> in a flame of <hi>Fire,</hi> to become like one of those <hi>erraticall, uncertain, wandring night-fires,</hi> of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks in his <hi>Meteors; Fires,</hi> which <hi>shine</hi> onely to lead <hi>Travellers</hi> out of the way?</p>
                  <p>Once more put the case, that the <hi>Priest</hi> should have usurped the <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> of God, and when the people came to enquire, should have placed himselfe between the <hi>Cherubins,</hi> and should from thence have uttered such false, pleasing <hi>Oracles,</hi> as he knew would most suite, and comply with the <hi>humour,</hi> and <hi>Interest of the Inquirers;</hi> Had not this been most insolently, to thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the place of <hi>God,</hi> and for that time to depose him from his <hi>Sanctuarie</hi> or <hi>holy Place,</hi> and to assume his <hi>businesse</hi> and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar <hi>Office</hi> to himselfe? Nay, had not this been the way in time, to draw the same bad report upon him, which once passed upon the <hi>Oracle</hi> at <hi>Delphos, Apud Apollinem ut mihi videtur, mendacia emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> men paid for lyes at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and sacrificed to <hi>Apollo</hi> to be <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned</hi> and <hi>deceived?</hi>

                  <p>That this was the <hi>sinne</hi> of these <hi>Prophets</hi> here in the Text is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the words of it, and from their coherence with the rest of the Chapter. Who, (as if they had entred into the same secret <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi> with God, as they had with their other <hi>Complotters</hi> of those times) made no other use of their profession, but onely to humour <hi>great men,</hi> and to make <hi>Sale</hi> and <hi>Gaine</hi> of their <hi>Prophecies.

                        <p>THat a <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> in your handling should weare two <hi>faces,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it should bee made to looke one way, and the <hi>use</hi> of it another, is at all no wonder to me. But that pretending so much to <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> as you doe, you should thinke the <hi>Pulpit</hi> a fit place to revile me in, would hardly enter into my beleif, were not the <hi>Congregation</hi> that heard you on <hi>Sunday morning</hi> last at <hi>S. Maryes,</hi> my <hi>cloud of Witnesses.</hi> From some of which I am informed, that you solemnly charged me with <hi>imprudence</hi> and <hi>impudence,</hi> for publishing a late <hi>Sermon against false Prophets.</hi> SIR, Though <hi>report,</hi> and my <hi>name</hi> perfixt in the <hi>Title-Page</hi> might probably perswade you, that I am the <hi>Author</hi> of it; yet to assure you, that I caused it to be publish'd, or consented to the <hi>printing</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> will certainly require a more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible illumination,</hi> then, I presume, you have. Besides, if I should grant you that 'twas <hi>printed</hi> with my consent, (which yet I shall not) yet certainely the <hi>seasonableness</hi> of it in a <hi>time</hi> where <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is made the <hi>engine</hi> to arrive to so much <hi>unlawfull gaine,</hi> will excuse me from <hi>imprudence,</hi> though perhaps not from an <hi>unthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> in your sense, <hi>want</hi> of <hi>policy.</hi> And as for the <hi>impudence</hi> you charged me withall, I am confident that all they who heard <hi>you</hi> with impartiall <hi>Eares,</hi> and have read that <hi>Sermon</hi> with impartiall <hi>Eyes,</hi> have, by this time, assigned that want of <hi>modesty</hi> a place in a more capable <hi>forehead.</hi> I heare farther that having in a kinde of <hi>pleasant disdaine</hi> shuffled <hi>pipes, Surplices, pictures in Church-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, Liturgy, and Prelacy</hi> together in one period, and stiled them the <hi>musty Relickes</hi> of an at-length-banisht <hi>Superstition,</hi> you were pleased out of that <hi>heape</hi> to select <hi>Images,</hi> and to call them <hi>Idolls,</hi> and then to charge me as a <hi>defender</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p>SIR, Had you done me but the ordinary Justice to pluck my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47537:58"/>
                           <hi>Sermon</hi> out of your <hi>pocket,</hi> as you did the <hi>Practicall Catechisme,</hi> and had faithfully read to your <hi>Auditory</hi> what I have there said of <hi>Images,</hi> I make no question, but they would all have presently discerned that I defend not <hi>Pictures</hi> in <hi>Church windowes</hi> as they are <hi>Idolls,</hi> or have at any time beene made so, but that 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable to banish them out of the <hi>Church</hi> as long as they stand there meerly as <hi>Ornaments</hi> of the <hi>place.</hi> From which innocent use having not hitherto digrest, for you to call them <hi>Idols,</hi> and then to charge me as if I had made them <hi>equall with God,</hi> by my defence of them so <hi>formallized,</hi> will I feare, endanger you in the <hi>mindes</hi> of youre <hi>Hearers,</hi> and beget an <hi>Opinion</hi> in them, that you are one of the <hi>Prophets</hi> who use to <hi>see Vanity.</hi> I heare farther, that when you had traduced me as a <hi>Defender</hi> of the fore-mentioned <hi>musty Relicts of Superstition,</hi> you said, that <hi>this was the Religion to which I profest my selfe ready to fall a sacrifice.</hi> Certainely, <hi>Sir,</hi> This is not faire dealing. For if, once more, you had pluckt my <hi>Sermon</hi> out of your <hi>pocket,</hi> and had read to the <hi>Congregation</hi> that passage of it which endeavours to prove that 'tis not lawfull to <hi>propagate Religion,</hi> (how pure soever it be) by the <hi>sword,</hi> they would have heard from <hi>your mouth,</hi> as they once did from <hi>mine,</hi> that the <hi>Religion</hi> to which I there professe my self ready to fall a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> is that <hi>defamed, true, Protestant Religion,</hi> for which the <hi>holy Fathers</hi> of our <hi>Reformation</hi> died before me. In saying, therefore, that I professe my selfe ready to fall a <hi>sacrifice</hi> in the defence of <hi>Surplices,</hi> the <hi>Common Prayer Booke,</hi> or <hi>Church Ornaments,</hi> (things which I have alwayes held not <hi>necessary,</hi> unlesse made so, by <hi>right Authority)</hi> you have incurred one danger more, which is, not only to be thought to <hi>see Vanity,</hi> but to be guilty of the <hi>next part of the Text.</hi> I am farther told, that to deliver your selfe from the number of the <hi>false Prophets</hi> there preacht against, you <hi>prophecyed</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> and chose for the <hi>subject</hi> of your <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> a thing which is possible enough for you to bring to passe; which was, that you <hi>will have my Sermon burnt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir I have, for your sake, once more severely consider'd it. And can neither finde <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> or any other <hi>Poland Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> there which should deserve that <hi>doome.</hi> But if it must die like <hi>Bishop Ridley</hi> or <hi>Hooper,</hi> for its <hi>adhaesion</hi> to the <hi>best Religion</hi> that this Kingdome ever enjoyed, I must repeat the <hi>words</hi> of my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47537:58"/>
                           <hi>Sermon,</hi> and tell you, that (without the fear of being thought by you a <hi>Pseudo-Martyr)</hi> I shall account it one of the <hi>happiest pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> to be dissolved to <hi>ashes</hi> with it in the same <hi>fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pile.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, <hi>Sir,</hi> having, with all the <hi>sober detraction,</hi> which might probably beget a dislike in the <hi>mindes</hi> of your <hi>Hearers,</hi> of me and my <hi>Sermon,</hi> sufficiently <hi>defamed both,</hi> I heare you did beat up a <hi>Drumme</hi> against me in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and ehallenged me to a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like dispute</hi> with you. If by a <hi>dispute</hi> you meant a <hi>pen-combate,</hi> I shall be as ready to enter the lists with you, as you have beene to summon me to it, if you will grant me two things. The one is, that, if we engage our selves in a <hi>Conference</hi> of that nature, you will confine your selfe to the <hi>particulars</hi> in my <hi>Sermon</hi> which you <hi>quarrell'd</hi> at; and not use your <hi>strange, wilde Art</hi> of multiplying <hi>Questions</hi> upon <hi>Questions;</hi> or like another <hi>Hydra,</hi> what ever the <hi>Hercules</hi> be, make <hi>three heads</hi> spring up in the place where you finde <hi>one convincingly</hi> lopt of. The other is, that, when you have made your <hi>Charge,</hi> and I my <hi>Resistance,</hi> you will consent that the <hi>debate</hi> of every <hi>question,</hi> thus <hi>disputed,</hi> may bee made publike and <hi>printed.</hi> But if by a <hi>Dispute,</hi> you meant that I should fight a <hi>Duell</hi> with you upon the same <hi>stage,</hi> and in the same <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> before whom you, and <hi>Mr. Yerbury</hi> played your <hi>prize,</hi> I doubt very much, if I should accept of your <hi>Callenge</hi> in that <hi>sense;</hi> whether all discreet men would not count this a spice of the <hi>phrenzy</hi> in me, which you complained of in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> for being imputed to you by <hi>Him</hi> that wrote the <hi>Conference</hi> at your late <hi>Scruple-House;</hi> and say I deserved to be cured by the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> and <hi>Physicke</hi> of a <hi>darke roome.</hi> To deale freely with you, Sir, I by no meanes can approve of an <hi>English Disputation</hi> in a <hi>University.</hi> But because you shall not loose your <hi>challenge,</hi> nor I be thought to desert the <hi>cause,</hi> which I professe to defend, so you will choose the <hi>Divinity Schoole,</hi> and <hi>Latine weapons,</hi> I shall not refuse (as well as God shall enable me) to give you a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and to sustaine the <hi>Answerers</hi> part in the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>lawfulnesse</hi> of <hi>white Surplices, Church Ornaments;</hi> the <hi>Common-Prayer Booke,</hi> and <hi>Prelacy;</hi> which are the <hi>particulars</hi> in my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> which you called <hi>Relicts of Superstition.</hi> To one of these two offers I shall patiently expect your <hi>answer;</hi> unlesse without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47537:59"/>
troubling me any further, you will let me quietly retire backe againe into the <hi>shade,</hi> from whence you have too importunately called me: Who, neuer the less, have learnt so much <hi>Charity,</hi> as to pray <hi>God</hi> to forgive you the <hi>wrong</hi> which you intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</p>

                  <p>To this <hi>letter</hi> (in which (as briefly as the <hi>lawes</hi> of a <hi>Letter</hi> would permit) I indeavour'd to wash out the <hi>spots,</hi> with which <hi>M. Cheynell</hi> in his <hi>Sermon</hi> strived to <hi>defile</hi> and <hi>sully mine,</hi> and withall to comply with him in any sober way of <hi>Dispute,</hi> which might befit two <hi>University-men)</hi> after two dayes was returned an <hi>Answer:</hi> First, <hi>strange</hi> for the <hi>messenger's</hi> sake that brought it, which was <hi>One Iellyman</hi> (some say) a <hi>preaching Cobler;</hi> who from repairing the <hi>decayes</hi> of <hi>University-mens shooes</hi> was now thought fit to have a part in the conveyance of their <hi>disputes.</hi> Next, for the <hi>double Superscription</hi> of it, which without, on the side of the first paper that enclosed it, was as faire and full of Candor as the <hi>whited sepulcher</hi> in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and was directed, To D. MAYNE AT CHRIST-CHURCH. But this outward stone was no sooner rolled away, but another <hi>Inscription,</hi> very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the first appear'd, which ran thus. FOR M. JASPER MAYNE (ONE OF THE NEVV DOCTORS) STUDENT AT CHRIST-CHURCH. By which <hi>parenthesis,</hi> it seemes <hi>M. Cheynell,</hi> thought it an <hi>errour</hi> in the <hi>University,</hi> to make me a <hi>Doctor.</hi> And truely (if I may be believed upon my owne report) as often as I compare my <hi>unworthiness</hi> with my <hi>degree,</hi> I am of <hi>his opinion;</hi> and thinke I am a <hi>Doctor,</hi> fit only to stand in a <hi>paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis;</hi> and, without any iniustice done me, to be left out of the <hi>sentence.</hi> This second <hi>Superscription</hi> was underwritten with a kind of a <hi>preamble Letter</hi> to the more <hi>inward Letter;</hi> with the <hi>lock</hi> and <hi>guard</hi> of a <hi>scale</hi> upon it; and ran thus.</p>
                  <p>SIR, I have sent severall times to your lodging <hi>this day</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your challenge <hi>yesterday;</hi> if you cannot meet to <hi>morrow,</hi> let me understand your minde to <hi>night.</hi> For I have a great deale of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47537:59"/>
business, since the <hi>University</hi> was <hi>silenced</hi> for your sake.</p>
                  <p>What kinde of <hi>meeting</hi> was here meant, or whether I (having I thanke God, the <hi>use</hi> of my <hi>understanding)</hi> could consent to it, will appeare by the <hi>Letter</hi> it <hi>selfe;</hi> which (being an <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>mine)</hi> was <hi>verbatim</hi> this.</p>
                  <p>SIR, I use to spend my <hi>morning thoughts</hi> upon a better <hi>subiect</hi> then a <hi>pot</hi> of dead drinke, that hath a litle <hi>froth</hi> at <hi>top,</hi> and <hi>dreggs</hi> at <hi>bottom;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SIR, It appeares by your <hi>Letter,</hi> that you doe not understand my <hi>Text,</hi> and the <hi>learned Scribe,</hi> or <hi>Intelligencer,</hi> did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my <hi>plaine,</hi> very <hi>plaine English Sermon.</hi> I am not at leisure to repeat every <hi>Sermon</hi> that I <hi>preach,</hi> (preaching soe often as I doe sometimes <hi>twice,</hi> and upon just occasion <hi>thrice</hi> a day) to every one that is at leisure to cavill at that which thay heard but at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand; yet to shew how much you are mistaken, I will give you a breife, but satisfactorie account.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Text</hi> stands upon record, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 25. the <hi>Doctrine</hi> I raised from the words, was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>There is no creature in heaven, or earth, like God in all things, or equall to God in any thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first <hi>Corollarie</hi> I deduced from <hi>thence,</hi> when I came to make <hi>application,</hi> was breifly <hi>this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>no picture can be made of God, because there was nothing like him in heaven or earth.</hi> All <hi>nations</hi> are less then <hi>vanity</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of <hi>God;</hi> to whom then will ye liken <hi>God,</hi> or what <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> will ye compare unto him? <hi>Isay.</hi> 40. 17. 18. The Prophet urgeth this <hi>Argument,</hi> against all manner of <hi>images</hi> which are made to represent <hi>God,</hi> who sitteth upon the <hi>circle</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> and stretcheth out the <hi>heavens</hi> from the 19. <hi>v. of the same chap. to the</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> and he enforceth this Argument <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>have yee not knowne—have ye not understood?</hi> &amp;c. as if he had say'd, yee are <hi>ignorant sotts, irrationall,</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate men,</hi> if yee apprehend not the <hi>strength</hi> of <hi>this Argument.</hi> Now, <hi>SIR,</hi> be pleased to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your <hi>strong reasons,</hi> and overthrow, if you can, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or the <hi>Corollary.</hi> Your, <hi>Intelligencer</hi> was (if not a <hi>false Prophet</hi> yet) a <hi>false Historian,</hi> when he told you that I accused you of making <hi>images equall with God.</hi> SIR, I said, that <hi>images were not like unto God;</hi> and <hi>thereupon</hi> wondered that you tooke upon you to pleade for the retaining of those <hi>images</hi> which have beene too
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47537:60"/>
often turn'd into <hi>idolls,</hi> not by the <hi>piety;</hi> but <hi>superstition</hi> of <hi>former times.</hi> You say, that by the same reason there should be no <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>firmament.</hi> Whence I collect, that you will be forc'd to maintaine, that <hi>images</hi> are as <hi>necessary</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>heaven;</hi> be pleased to read the 22. page of the <hi>false Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, you plead for <hi>Copes,</hi> and for those <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer Booke</hi> which were borrowed from <hi>Rome, pag.</hi> 21, 22. The <hi>Uisitors</hi> will ere long enquire, whether there hath not beene a <hi>Superstitious use</hi> of <hi>Copes</hi> at <hi>Christ-Church?</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did not make any such enquirie in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> but as a <hi>Freind</hi> I give <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your adherents</hi> timely notice of it, because I believe you had need <hi>study</hi> for an <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You maintaine, that <hi>some things in the excellencies and height of the Doctrines of Christian Religion depend for their credit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of their truth upon the authority of Christs miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed along in tradition and story, pag.</hi> 16. and <hi>therefore</hi> I say your <hi>Religion</hi> leanes too <hi>hard</hi> and too <hi>heavy</hi> upon <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You are offended that I spoke not distinctly concerning <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> you may (if you please) try your <hi>strength,</hi> and endeavour to <hi>prove</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath put the <hi>sole power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> in the hand of a <hi>Prelate.</hi> 2. You may (if you can) <hi>justifie,</hi> that <hi>no Church that ever the Sun look'd upon hath been more blest with purity of Religion for the Doctrine of it, or better establish'd for the Government and Discipline of it, then the Church of England, pag.</hi> 7. if you believe this confident assertion, you may proceed and <hi>justifie</hi> all the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which were <hi>publikely countenanced,</hi> or <hi>approved;</hi> all the <hi>superstitious practises,</hi> and <hi>prelaticall usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> nay, the <hi>delegation</hi> of the <hi>Prelates, usurped power</hi> to <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi> and all the Tyranny of the <hi>high Commission,</hi> together with all the corruptions and innovations introduced into the <hi>State, Church, University</hi> from the yeare 1630. till 1640. by a <hi>prevailing faction,</hi> who were not the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>University,</hi> but the <hi>disease,</hi> indeed the <hi>plague</hi> of both. If you dare not undertake so sad a taske, you cannot justifie the 17. 18. 22, 23. 27. 35. <hi>pages</hi> of the <hi>False Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Christiani non nascuntur sed fiunt.</hi> Sir, the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth not defame nor will they suppress the true <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and therefore if you fall in this <hi>quarrell,</hi> I said, that you must be sacrificed in the defence of <hi>Tyranny, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, Popery:</hi> if you put not <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Copes, Images, Prelates,</hi> or <hi>Service-Booke, quorsum haec perditio?</hi> why doe you talk of being Martyr'd? say, that (if the King will give you leave) you will burne your <hi>Copes</hi> and <hi>Surplices,</hi> throw off the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer Booke,</hi> you'l break your windowes, and take the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and make it evident that you are and ever will be of the <hi>Kings Religion;</hi> for you hold none of these things necessary now, (whatever you have said heretofore) <hi>unless they be made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary by right Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, if I made any prediction, it was that your <hi>Sermon</hi> would be confuted, before it was burnt; you know <hi>Paraeus</hi> was burnt before he was confuted; and if you be not guilty of any <hi>doctrine</hi> received in <hi>Poland,</hi> I wonder, First, why you did endeavour to incense an Officer of this <hi>Garrison</hi> against me, because I had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted M. <hi>Yerburies blasphemous errors.</hi> 2. Why you did maintaine those <hi>damnable Doctrines</hi> on the last <hi>Sabbath:</hi> forgive me this injurie, for I heare you did but vent them, and were no way able to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I acknowledge that I doe contend for the restitution of the true <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and contend for the <hi>civill right</hi> which we have to exercise the true <hi>Protestant Religion:</hi> we were in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest danger to lose our right, by the force and violence of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Enemies,</hi> whereupon the high Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> judged
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47537:61"/>
it fit to repell <hi>force</hi> by <hi>forces:</hi> be pleased to shew how the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> doth hereby <hi>canonize</hi> the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> or declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be of the <hi>Mahumetan perswasion;</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> will not compell you to be happy, onely take heed that you do not compell them to make you miserable. Though you renounce all <hi>Doctrines</hi> that M. <hi>Yerberie</hi> maintaines, yet I thinke you are too great a <hi>friend</hi> to the <hi>Rebels</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> you contend for a <hi>Vorstian liberty,</hi> not for a <hi>liberty</hi> of conscience, for you desire a <hi>liberty for</hi> men that have no conscience, such as turne from being <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants to be Infidels.</hi> There is one of M. <hi>Yerburies</hi> opinion, who saith, that the righteous are at liberty, <hi>[he that is righteous let him be righteous still]</hi> and the wicked are at liberty, <hi>[he that is wicked let him be wicked still,]</hi> but you are of a more dangerous opinion, the wicked as (as you think) are at liberty to kill and slay, but the godly are not at liberty to defend themselves by the power of the highest <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> from illegall and unjust oppression, violence. I am convinced by many passages in your <hi>Sermon,</hi> especially the 15, 16, 17. <hi>pages,</hi> that you think we ought not to fight against the <hi>Rebells</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> because it is part of their <hi>Religion</hi> (as it was of your brethren the <hi>Cavaliers)</hi> to put all <hi>Roundheads</hi> (as you terme them) to the sword; <hi>missajam mordet,</hi> the <hi>Mass</hi> may be armed, but the <hi>Gospel</hi> must not: What thinke you of the <hi>War</hi> fore-told in the book of the <hi>Revelation?</hi> Sir, you abuse your betters when you talk of the <hi>Scruple-house.</hi> You are not worthy to carrie the books of those Reverend <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> after them, nor could your <hi>Carfax-Sermon</hi> have ever si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the <hi>ungifted Preachers;</hi> you would have found them <hi>gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Disputants:</hi> if you think otherwise try one or two of them in some of their beaten points; Sir, I speake thus freely, because I was not present at the <hi>famous meeting, Novemb.</hi> 12. but I see you can cite one of your owne <hi>Prophets, Poets</hi> I should say, but he is no truer a <hi>Prophet</hi> then you are like to prove a <hi>Martyr,</hi> a <hi>Cretian Prophet.</hi> Sir, the knowledge of my Brethrens worth, and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous pride and self-conceitedness hath provoked me to let my pen loose, that I might disabuse and humble you.</p>
                  <p>It seems you are unwilling to come upon the <hi>stage</hi> (though that be a fitter place for you then the pulpit) to appear before a <hi>Theater</hi> of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women:</hi> Sir, you love the <hi>stage</hi> too well, take heed you doe not love <hi>women</hi> too ill, there is a friend of yours
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47537:61"/>
that doth entreat you to beware of dark rooms and sight women; for though a great <hi>Physitian</hi> doth advise you to the use of such pleasing <hi>physick,</hi> yet the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> will assure you, that it is not wholsome for the body, and the <hi>English</hi> can assure you, that it is not good for the soul; your kind of <hi>phrenfie</hi> must be cured by more severe remedies, your <hi>devill</hi> will be better cast out with prayer and fasting. You are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed when you say, that I did beat <hi>up my drum.</hi> No Sir, you did sound a charge and made a challenge, my acceptance of it was but the eccho which answered the 17. and 21. <hi>pages</hi> of the <hi>False Prophet.</hi> In the 17. you seem prepared to enter into dispute presently with the greatest <hi>Champion</hi> that appeares for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> Sir, one of the meanest that appears for them, takes up that <hi>Gantlet</hi> which you threw forth with so much scorn and confidence.</p>
                  <p>In your 21. <hi>page</hi> you threaten to press us in a rationall logicall way; Sir, doe your best, you shall find that we have neither lost our <hi>reason</hi> nor our <hi>logick.</hi> We can distinguish between <hi>demonstration</hi> and <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and truly Sir, if you had not put more <hi>Poetry</hi> then <hi>Logick</hi> into your <hi>Sermon,</hi> though your <hi>Sermon</hi> might have been longer, yet your <hi>Libell</hi> would have been shorter; if you please to blot out those few places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which you have abused by misapplication and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent insertion of them into so prophane and wild a stamp, you may do well to turne your <hi>Libell</hi> into <hi>Verse,</hi> and then it may pass currant amongst the <hi>Balladmongers</hi> for a triobolar <hi>Ballad,</hi> and you will be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the number of those who are reputed the most excellent <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> next to them that write in <hi>Prose.</hi> If you are offended that I did not shew you so much respect, as I have shewed towards the learned <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Practicall Catechisme,</hi> consider the difference, nay, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwen his person, education, learning, civility, writings and yours, and you will see a very sufficient and satisfactory reason. Sir, if that <hi>Author</hi> did overlook your <hi>Letter,</hi> I believe he did advise you to contend onely for the <hi>lawfulness of Prelacy, because I see that is interlined,</hi> and he was present at the sad debate at <hi>Uxbridge;</hi> if that learned <hi>Doctor</hi> hath any thing to object against me, he knowes my <hi>mind, habet aetatem,</hi> he is able to speake for himselfe, the <hi>Oratour</hi> needs not borrow eloquence of so prophane a <hi>Poet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You are unwilling to dispute in <hi>English,</hi> to which I answer:</p>
                  <p>First, your <hi>Sermon</hi> is <hi>English.</hi> Secondly, many of the persons whom you have abused and deceived by your <hi>printed Sermon,</hi> understand not <hi>Latine.</hi> Thirdly, you have been too much addicted to <hi>English</hi>

                     <hi>Playes,</hi> and <hi>English Verses,</hi> and you have with a pleasant kind of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> shuffled them (with other <hi>Verses</hi> published in more learned <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages)</hi> in the same book printed by the <hi>University-Printer,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe you are most able, and most ingaged to dispute in <hi>English,</hi> for the disabusing &amp; undeceiving of those whom you have seduced by a <hi>Sermon</hi> preacht and printed in <hi>English.</hi> Be pleased to performe that task to morrow at two of the clock at S. <hi>Maries Church,</hi> where your <hi>Sermon</hi> was preacht, and I will meet you; and if you dare examine your <hi>Sermon</hi> by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> I shall be the <hi>Opponent,</hi> because you have chosen to be the <hi>Respondent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If when the <hi>Doctor of the Chaire</hi> comes home, you please to dispute in the <hi>Divinity Schools,</hi> let us agree upon the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>questions</hi> in controversie, and I will accept your <hi>challenge</hi> at your owne <hi>weapon,</hi> which will I feare have more <hi>false Latine,</hi> then <hi>true steele.</hi>

Next, because the greatest part of the <hi>Auditory</hi> would have consisted of such a confluence of <hi>Townsmen</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> as understood good <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Replies</hi> as little as they do <hi>Latine;</hi> and so the issue of this <hi>Disputation</hi> would probably have been the same with the former: where M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> was thought to have the better by <hi>one Sex,</hi> and M. <hi>Yerbury</hi> by the <hi>other.</hi> Loath, therefore to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

                           <hi>clearness</hi> of your <hi>matter,</hi> that 't was possible enough for me not to <hi>understand it.</hi> I doe, therefore, acknowledge it as a <hi>favour</hi> from you, that you will let me no longer wander in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or write to you upon the <hi>mis-report</hi> of a <hi>fallible Intelligencer;</hi> but will <hi>your selfe</hi> be my <hi>Clue</hi> to guide me to what you said.

                        </p>
                        <p>As for your <hi>Text,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> built upon it, at whom soever it was <hi>shot,</hi> I shall not quarrell with it.

                        </p>
                        <p>Sir, had you a minde to deal <hi>pertinently</hi> or <hi>ingenuously</hi> with me, you would witness for me, that though I speak in defence of the <hi>Ornamentall use</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> yet I in no passage of my <hi>Sermon</hi> do defend any <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>pourtraicture</hi> made of the <hi>Deity.</hi> Sir, 'tis not your saying, That <hi>no picture can be made of God, because there is nothing like him in Heaven or Earth,</hi> or the following <hi>proofs</hi> of your <hi>letter</hi> (which I conceive to be a <hi>piece</hi> of your <hi>Sermon</hi> at <hi>St. Maries,</hi> which because I came not to <hi>it,</hi> you in charity have sent home to <hi>me)</hi> that perswades me that any such <hi>picture</hi> is <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: Nature,</hi> as well as the numerous places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which you have quoted to prove that which I never yet denied, have long since taught me, that to <hi>make,</hi> or <hi>draw</hi> any <hi>picture,</hi> or <hi>Image of God</hi> is not onely a <hi>breach</hi> of the <hi>second Commandement,</hi> which is built upon the <hi>invisibility</hi> of his <hi>Essence,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> but that the <hi>Attempt</hi> would be much more <hi>vain,</hi> then if a <hi>Painter</hi> should endeavour to limn a <hi>soul</hi> or <hi>minde,</hi> which not affording any <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>resemblance</hi> to his <hi>fancy</hi> to be taken by, cannot possibly by him

As for those <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer-booke,</hi> which I doe not say were <hi>borrowed</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> (as you impose upon me) but are to be found in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> if I had said they had been <hi>borrowed</hi> from that <hi>Church,</hi> yet <hi>you</hi> have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove, that upon <hi>this supposition</hi> 'tis <hi>Popery</hi> to use those <hi>Prayers</hi> in <hi>Ours.</hi> Foreseeing, I beleeve, that if you had offered to maintaine that what ever is in the <hi>Popish Lyturgie</hi> is <hi>Popery,</hi> that is, <hi>superstitious,</hi> and fit to be <hi>proscribed</hi> out of the <hi>Church,</hi> you would (meeting with a <hi>good Disputant,</hi> and one not addicted to <hi>Poetry)</hi> have been compelled to confess, that the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Davids Psalmes</hi> are <hi>Popery</hi> too, (though the one were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Christ,</hi> the other by <hi>one</hi> who lived long before <hi>Antichrist)</hi> because they are bound up in the same <hi>volumne</hi> with the <hi>Masse.</hi> Sir, if this be your <hi>Logick,</hi> 'tis <hi>Socrate ambulante coruscavit,</hi> and will be a <hi>false fire</hi> to lead you for ever out of the way. But here, Sir, though I need not take the paines to <hi>confute</hi> the <hi>Nothings</hi> you have said against me, in <hi>this particular,</hi> yet whenever you shal call upon me to make good my <hi>undertaking,</hi> I doe promise to make it evident to you, that all the <hi>ancient parts</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer-booke,</hi> which I <hi>plead</hi> for, I doe not plead for because they are used by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but because they were part of the <hi>Lyturgie</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> which were thought <hi>primitively pure,</hi> and not <hi>superstitious,</hi> and were in the world long before <hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Antichrist</hi> was borne. I must, therefore, for ought you have yet said to alter my <hi>opinion,</hi> still stand to my <hi>former conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which is, that by the <hi>same reason</hi> that either the <hi>whole,</hi> or <hi>any</hi>

                     <hi>Detraction, Convitia spreta exolescunt,</hi> and though I have alwaies thought that to enter <hi>combate</hi> with a <hi>Dunghill</hi> is the way to come off more <hi>defiled,</hi> yet finding my self <hi>engaged</hi> (like one of the <hi>poeticall Knights errant)</hi> with an Adversary that will not onely <hi>provoke</hi> me to <hi>fight,</hi> but, whos <hi>best weapon</hi> is to defile me out of the field, I shal for once apply as good <hi>perfume</hi> to the <hi>stench</hi> you speak of, as can possibly in such times make me walk the <hi>streets</hi> in my <hi>own Oxford, uncondens'd</hi> not by <hi>you</hi> made <hi>foggy, Ayre;</hi> And shall make it evident, first to <hi>your self,</hi> next to the <hi>world,</hi> (if you will consent that what thus <hi>secretly</hi> passeth between <hi>us</hi> shall be made <hi>publike,</hi> and <hi>Printed)</hi> that you are not onely <hi>fallible</hi> in your most sad, and melancholy considerations, but in those more <hi>pleasant, mirthful chymes</hi> of <hi>quibbling,</hi> for which I before placed you in the <hi>Chaire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, sir, you bid me read over my <hi>two Sermons</hi> and the <hi>two letters</hi> which I have sent you, <hi>as if they were yours, and then impartially tell you, whether I am not to pass sentence upon them as you do;</hi> That they are <hi>Difficiles Nugae, Elaborate Follies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which my Reply is; First, that there is so much <hi>loyalty,</hi> and so little <hi>self-interest</hi> in them, that my imagination can never be strong enough to Suppose them to be <hi>yours,</hi> Next, That what <hi>Folly</hi> soever betrayes it self in your <hi>expressions,</hi> yet the <hi>matter</hi> is built upon such sure <hi>rocks</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that 'tis not all the <hi>waves</hi> or <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest</hi> which you can raise against them, wil be able to reduce them to the <hi>fate</hi> of a <hi>House built upon the Sand.</hi> Thirdly, (since all <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,</hi> as wel as <hi>wit,</hi> are like a <hi>Rest Kept up at Tennis,</hi> where <hi>good players</hi> do the <hi>best</hi> with the <hi>best Gamsters)</hi> I do sadly promise you, that when ever you shal either <hi>write</hi> or <hi>urge</hi> to me such <hi>Arguments</hi> of <hi>serious Consideration,</hi> that I shal not have reason to think <hi>St. Pauls</hi> saying verified in my <hi>Expressions,</hi> that my <hi>Foolish things</hi> are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>confound,</hi> and <hi>bring to nought</hi> your <hi>wise;</hi> I wil lay aside the <hi>Folly</hi> you tax me withal. In the mean time, if you think my <hi>Letters</hi> to you (By what <hi>Glass</hi> soever my <hi>Sermons</hi> were made) are <hi>elaborate,</hi> pray compare the <hi>Dates,</hi> and <hi>Receipts</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> with the <hi>No-dates,</hi> and uncertain <hi>Receipts</hi> of <hi>yours;</hi> And you wil find that the <hi>longest letter,</hi> I have yet written to you, was but the <hi>creature</hi> of <hi>two days,</hi> when your <hi>unelaborate answer</hi> to it back again was the <hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Travell</hi> of a whole week.</p>
                  <p>Having said this, Sir, by way of <hi>Answer</hi> to your <hi>ungospel-</hi>like <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> I shal next, (confining my self once more to your own <hi>method)</hi> address my self to the <hi>examination</hi> of the rest of your <hi>letter.</hi> A hard
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47537:76"/>
task, I confess; It being so much a <hi>Twinn-brother</hi> to your <hi>former</hi> where your <hi>evasions,</hi> and <hi>little escapes</hi> are so <hi>many,</hi> and your true substantiall, solid <hi>disproofes</hi> of any one thing which I have sayd either in my <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Letters,</hi> so <hi>few,</hi> that, to deal freely with you, my <hi>Conflict</hi> with you hitherto hath been (and for ought I yet foresee is like to prove) like the <hi>Fight</hi> between <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the <hi>River Achelous;</hi> which when 'twas foyled in one <hi>shape,</hi> could tire the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and presently provoke him to a fresh encounter <hi>in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Sir, I could wish (without your strange endless multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Questions)</hi> you would assume to your self some <hi>constant figure,</hi> wherein I might say, I grappled with a bodyed <hi>Adversary.</hi> But changing <hi>Form,</hi> as you do, and putting me stil to <hi>prove</hi> that which you have not yet so much as seemingly <hi>confuted,</hi> pardon me (I beseech you) if I say, that my <hi>combate</hi> with you is not only like the <hi>combate</hi> of <hi>Hercules</hi> with that <hi>River,</hi> but like his, who thought he had entered <hi>Duell</hi> with a <hi>Gyant,</hi> and after much toyl found himself encountred by a cloud.</p>
                  <p>First, you <hi>conceive,</hi> that I <hi>preacht in defence of all Images set up in any Chappell within this Vniversity.</hi> Sir, This is but your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,</hi> of which <hi>you,</hi> not <hi>I</hi> am guilty. My sermon, if you mark it, is not so confined either to <hi>Vanlings Draughts,</hi> or any other mans <hi>pencil,</hi> as to defend what ever their <hi>Irregular Fancies</hi> shal draw, or not to defend what ever, either heer, or any where else, they shal <hi>regularly</hi> limb. But if your <hi>conceipt</hi> were true, what doth your <hi>Logick</hi> infer, That because some <hi>Chappels</hi> are adorn'd with the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi> of some of the <hi>persons in the Glorious Trinity, therefore I must acknowledg all Images of that sort ought to be taken down?</hi> Pray, Sir, how long hath the single-<hi>Topick</hi> of your meer <hi>Assertion</hi> been of such forcible Authority, that without any other proofe, you should think me obliged to hold such <hi>Images</hi> worthy of expulsion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you say they are? Had you either from <hi>Scripture</hi> (the most perfect <hi>Rule</hi> for the Decision of <hi>Controversies)</hi> or from <hi>Reason,</hi> (Though in your esteem but a peece of <hi>nature corrupted)</hi> urged any one <hi>necessary Argument</hi> to prove them <hi>unlawful,</hi> or things which deserve to be called the <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superstition</hi> of the <hi>place,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being a <hi>servant</hi> to <hi>Demonstration,</hi> (though a <hi>favourite</hi> of the <hi>muses)</hi> I should have been one of the first that should have cryed out for <hi>Reformation.</hi> But this not being done by <hi>you,</hi> nor indeed, possible to be done by <hi>any other,</hi> though my sermon speak not of any <hi>Image</hi> of any <hi>person</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> yet I conceive all <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which shal strive to prove, that no picture of any <hi>person</hi> in

the <hi>Trinity</hi> ought to be the <hi>Ornaments</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Chappell Window,</hi> will be as frail and brittle as the <hi>Glass</hi> in which they stand. Sir, I have said in my last <hi>Letter,</hi> and shal repeat it in this, that 'tis not <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>numerous places of Scripture,</hi> which forbid to make any <hi>picture</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (either taken for the <hi>Divine essence</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the <hi>three persons,</hi> or for the person of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the other <hi>two)</hi> which perswade me that any such <hi>picture</hi> (besides the <hi>impossibility)</hi> is <hi>unlawfull.</hi> And therefore you need not have put your self to the unnecessary trouble to hang your <hi>Margin</hi> with <hi>quotations</hi> taken out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or <hi>Aquinas;</hi> since all such <hi>quotations</hi> applyed to that which I have said and you have cited, which is, That <hi>all pictures of God are a breach of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> do strike me no more, then if I should enter conflict with those dead <hi>Arras-Captains,</hi> which in <hi>hangings</hi> threaten to assault the spectatour with <hi>imaginary, woven Lances.</hi> Much less need you so superfluously have called S. <hi>Paul</hi> from the <hi>third heaven</hi> to prove, that (because he once quoted this <hi>Greek Hemistick</hi> out of <hi>Aratus</hi>

                  <p>In answer to your next <hi>Paragraph,</hi> I shall most readily grant, That 'tis a <hi>high fault to picture God.</hi> Because, any such <hi>Draught</hi> not being possible to be made of him, but by resembling of him to <hi>something</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Tradition,</hi> which you your self, in your seventh <hi>paragraph,</hi> tllow to be the <hi>Constant and universal Report of the Church)</hi> before he Testimony of the <hi>Spirit, speaking in the Word to the Consciences of private men,</hi> am more <hi>profane</hi> than <hi>he.</hi> Heer, sir, you must not take it ill, if I expose you to the censure of being deservedly thought guilty of a double <hi>mistake.</hi> The one is, that if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> were in an <hi>Errour,</hi> and if I had out-spoken him in his <hi>Errour,</hi> yet the Laws of <hi>speech</hi> will not allow you to say, That in an <hi>unprofane</hi> subject, either of us is <hi>profane;</hi> more <hi>heretical,</hi> or <hi>mistaken</hi> you might perhaps have said: and this, though a false Assertion, might yet have past for right Expression. But to call him <hi>positively,</hi> and me <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively more profane,</hi> because we both hold, That a <hi>Drop</hi> is more liable to corruption then the <hi>Ocean,</hi> or the <hi>testimony of al ages</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is a fuller <hi>proof</hi> of the meaning of a <hi>text</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> then the <hi>solitary Exposition</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> who can perswade none but himself, is as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, as if you should say, that because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wrote but <hi>three Volumns,</hi> and <hi>Abulensis</hi> twelve, therefore <hi>Abulensis</hi> was a greater <hi>Adulterer</hi> then <hi>He.</hi> Your other <hi>mistake</hi> is, That you confound the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God speaking in the <hi>Scripture</hi> with the <hi>private Spirit</hi> (that is) <hi>Reason, Humour,</hi> or <hi>Fancie</hi> of the <hi>person</hi> spoken to.

                     <hi>that no Prophesie of the Scripture is of private Interpretation.</hi> That is, so <hi>calculated,</hi> or <hi>Meridianized</hi> to some select <hi>minds</hi> &amp; <hi>understandings,</hi> that it shall hold the <hi>candle</hi> to them <hi>only,</hi> and leave <hi>All others</hi> in the <hi>Darke.</hi> But, if you will consent to the Comment of the most primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> on that <hi>Text,</hi> The meaning of it is; That as <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>Spirit</hi> did at first dictate the <hi>scripture,</hi> so he dictated it in those thingswhich are <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> intelligible to all the world of Men, who will addict their minds to read it.

                        <p>since at length I understand you, that by agreeing upon the <hi>true state of the questions before we dispute them,</hi> you mean that we should <hi>agree</hi> upon the <hi>termes</hi> in which they are to be <hi>held,</hi> I am very ready to comply with you in that <hi>reasonable</hi> particular. But to accept of any, either of your <hi>eleven English,</hi> or your <hi>three La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine questions,</hi> in the <hi>terms</hi> in which you have <hi>formed</hi> them, I can by no meanes consent. First, Sir, Because I find a piece of Artifice in the <hi>Web,</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> of them, which hath something of a <hi>Trap,</hi> and <hi>Snare,</hi> and <hi>Engine</hi> in it. Which is, that by making them as <hi>Popish questions</hi> as you can, (especially one of them) where you insert the words <hi>Missall, Breviary,</hi> and <hi>Pontificall)</hi> words <hi>odious</hi> to the people, and part of the <hi>dismall spell</hi> which for six yeares hath raised the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>discord</hi> to walk among us; if I should hold it <hi>affirmatively</hi> under these <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>hatred,</hi> 'tis possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it may beget an opinion in the minds of those that know me not, that, though I have more then once profest my selfe ready to <hi>fall a sacrifice</hi> in the defence of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> yet that this was but a <hi>disguise</hi> which concealed my <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> 'till provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked I were put to defend the <hi>superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Sir, I know upon what <hi>lesser grounds</hi> then this, <hi>some</hi> in our <hi>credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times</hi> have been unjustly called <hi>Papists.</hi> Next, Sir, if I should hold them <hi>affirmatively,</hi> with their <hi>faces</hi> thus <hi>looking</hi> towards <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> and should bring them thus clothed in your <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> into the <hi>Divinity Schoole,</hi> I doubt very much whethet the <hi>publickness</hi> of the <hi>Defence</hi> may not draw an aspersion not onely upon <hi>me,</hi> and the <hi>Moderator,</hi> (if he will vouchsafe to sit in the <hi>Chaire</hi> whilst we quarrell) but upon the <hi>whole</hi> already too much <hi>defamed University,</hi> which <hi>such</hi> as <hi>you</hi> have from numerous <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi> called long since <hi>Popishly affected;</hi> But if it should allow of such a <hi>Dispute,</hi> 'twould lend <hi>fuell</hi> to your <hi>calumnies,</hi> and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47537:83"/>
to be no longer thought <hi>Popish,</hi> but out-right a <hi>Papist.</hi> Thirdly, Sir, your <hi>first</hi> and last <hi>Question</hi> (if they were purged of their <hi>odious termes)</hi> cannot <hi>publiquely</hi> be maintained without some affront to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who by one <hi>Ordinance</hi> have put down the <hi>Common-prayer-book,</hi> by another <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, under your <hi>termes,</hi> I should <hi>publiquely</hi> stand up in defence of them, you had need procure a third <hi>Ordinance,</hi> which when I have done may keep me safe. Yet, Sir, to assure you that this is no <hi>evasion</hi> in me to decline a <hi>dispute,</hi> because my <hi>Sermon</hi> was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of your <hi>challenge</hi> of me in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and of this <hi>private conference</hi> betweene us since; Since also you allow me the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>alteration,</hi> and to adde my <hi>stroke</hi> to the <hi>Anvill</hi> on which the <hi>questions</hi> to be disputed on between us are to receive the last <hi>form,</hi> and <hi>shape,</hi> in which, with least <hi>offence,</hi> and <hi>scandall,</hi> they may walk into the <hi>publique.</hi> Lastly, since the three Latine <hi>Questions</hi> you sent me are <hi>three passages</hi> of my <hi>Sermon,</hi> but so <hi>corrupted</hi> from <hi>themselves,</hi> as shew them to have been once purely <hi>Protestant,</hi> but passing through your hands have <hi>degenerated,</hi> and <hi>clothed</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a to-be-suspected <hi>robe</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> the nearest way I know for us to agree upon their <hi>true state</hi> is to deale with them as the <hi>Bishops</hi> at the <hi>Reformation</hi> dealt with the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, purge them from their <hi>corruptions,</hi> and restore them to the <hi>Primitive rule</hi> from whence they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grest. Which <hi>Rule,</hi> being my <hi>Sermon,</hi> (if you read it with open eyes) presents you with your <hi>three questions,</hi> in this more <hi>genuine forme.</hi>

At which time the <hi>Sword</hi> of both <hi>Nations</hi> lodged peaceably in the <hi>Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd)</hi> and though upon the perusall of it since, I finde it the same in all points with ours, but only in the contraction of the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>Administration</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and so for the matter of it as <hi>defensible</hi> as <hi>ours,</hi> yet having been turned out of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> as solemnly as it was at first introduced, that is, by an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> To whose birth the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Houses</hi> concurred,, for me to have disputed <hi>publiquely</hi> for the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it, had been the way not only to raise a <hi>Northern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of men against my self, (who would, doubtless, have thought it a very <hi>bold piece</hi> of <hi>insolence</hi> in me to disallow in a <hi>publique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,</hi> the <hi>proceedings</hi> of a whole <hi>State)</hi> but of such <hi>Northerne Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> too, whose <hi>zeale</hi> upon the first reading of that <hi>innocent Lyturgie,</hi> mistook it for the <hi>Mass booke,</hi> and thereupon conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Ioynt-stools,</hi> upon which they sate, into <hi>Weapons,</hi> with which they invaded the <hi>Reader,</hi> and chaced him, with his <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Popery</hi> in his hand, out of the <hi>Church.</hi> These <hi>Reasons</hi> being layed to those other, which in my last <hi>letter</hi> but one, produced to shew how scandalous, as well as unsafe, it would in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, prove both to the <hi>University</hi> and <hi>my self,</hi> if I should <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely</hi> maintaine a <hi>question</hi> which carryed so much <hi>danger</hi> with it, I prest M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> with the <hi>intimation</hi> which he gave me in his <hi>last letter,</hi> which was, to stand to that <hi>frame</hi> of <hi>Questions</hi> which the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Chaire</hi> should contrive for us. To whose <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> of the <hi>terms</hi> of his first <hi>Question</hi> if he would submit, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him to accept of his <hi>other two;</hi> (though in the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Chaires</hi> opinion, the <hi>termes</hi> of his <hi>third Question</hi> were something hard) in that <hi>unaltered forme</hi> into which he had cast them. To this his reply was, that after the Words <hi>populo obtrusa,</hi> in his <hi>first Question,</hi> he would allow me to insert these two words of <hi>Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ut fertur.</hi> Whereto my answer was, that this <hi>addition</hi> would so litle deserve the name of a <hi>Mitigation,</hi> that it very much
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47537:86"/>
increast my burther, and hung more <hi>weights</hi> upon me. Since here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I obliged my self, not only to stand up for the <hi>Re-admission</hi> of the <hi>Scotch Lyturgie;</hi> which could not be done without an <hi>affront</hi> offered to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>State</hi> that banisht it, but for the <hi>Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all the <hi>unknown practices</hi> of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> who had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of that <hi>Lyturgie,</hi> against the <hi>Sinister reports,</hi> and <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the <hi>incensed people.</hi> Who, as for some yeares, they have been falsely taught to thinke the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishops Antichristian,</hi> so looking upon their <hi>persons</hi> through the <hi>mist</hi> cast by some <hi>False Prophets</hi> before their eyes, it ought to be no wonder if their <hi>best Actions</hi> have seemed <hi>Popery.</hi> The <hi>Conclusion</hi> of all was this. M. <hi>Cheynell</hi> at length, without any farther <hi>Clouds</hi> of <hi>discourse,</hi> told me plainly, that to any other <hi>alterations</hi> then <hi>this</hi> he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; being <hi>bound up</hi> by his <hi>instructions</hi> to hold this <hi>Question</hi> only in the <hi>latitude</hi> &amp; <hi>sense,</hi> which was signified by the <hi>termes</hi> in which he had <hi>Arrayed</hi> it. Whereupon, the long expected <hi>scene</hi> between us closed, and the <hi>Curtaine</hi> to this <hi>Controversie</hi> was let fall. And <hi>we,</hi> after some mutuall exchanges of <hi>Civility, parted,</hi> I hope like <hi>two Divines,</hi> in <hi>perfect Charity</hi> with <hi>one another.</hi>

beare that <hi>Name.</hi> But alas, Sir, you your selfe know, that these are <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which were so farre from being <hi>practised,</hi> that they have not yet been <hi>faigned</hi> among us. 'Tis true, indeed, certain <hi>dark Iealousies</hi> were cast among the people, as if some <hi>Evill Counsellors</hi> about the King had had it in their designe to introduce an <hi>Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But these were but <hi>Iealousies,</hi> blown by those, whose plot 'twas to make the <hi>popular hatred</hi> their engine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move those <hi>Counsellors,</hi> that by their <hi>ruine</hi> they might raise a <hi>Ladder</hi> to their own <hi>Ambitions.</hi> For if the Calamity of <hi>these times</hi> have not quite blotted out the memory of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> people cannot but remember, that no <hi>Nation</hi> under Heaven, more freely enjoyed the Blessing of the <hi>Scripture</hi> then <hi>we; every one secure under the shade of his own Uine.</hi> perhaps a grape or two <hi>extraordinary</hi> was gathered for the <hi>publique.</hi> But if any did refuse to contribute, I doe not find that like <hi>Naboth,</hi> they were stoned for their <hi>Uineyard.</hi> If therefore, the Gentleman your <hi>friend</hi> understand <hi>Liberty</hi> in this sense, the most he can say for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> is, that they have taken up Armes against their <hi>King,</hi> not because he <hi>was,</hi> but because he possibly <hi>might</hi> be a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> Which <hi>feare</hi> of theirs being in it selfe altogether <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and therefore not to be satisfied, could not but naturally endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (as we find by sad experience it hath done) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>Once more therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must aske your <hi>Friend</hi> what he meanes by <hi>Liberty.</hi> I hope he doth not mean an <hi>Exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from all <hi>Governement;</hi> Nor is fallen upon their <hi>wilde O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> who held that there ought to be no <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or <hi>superior</hi> among <hi>Christians.</hi> But that in a <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> we are to live together like men standing in a <hi>Ring,</hi> or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47537:94"/>

This Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as 'twould quickly reduce the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons;</hi> so 'twould in time reduce the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> to the same levell with the <hi>Common people.</hi> who being once taught that <hi>Inequality</hi> is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> would quickly be made <hi>Docile</hi> in the entertainment of the other <hi>Arguments,</hi> upon which the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> did here to fore set all <hi>Germany</hi> in a flame. Namely, that Christ hath not only bequeathed to Men, the <hi>liberty</hi> of his <hi>Gospell,</hi> but that this <hi>liberty</hi> consists in ones not being greater then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. It being an <hi>Oracle</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> that we are all borne <hi>Equall;</hi> That these words of <hi>Higher,</hi> and <hi>Lower, superiour,</hi> and <hi>Inferiour,</hi> are fitter for <hi>Hills,</hi> and <hi>Vales,</hi> then for <hi>men</hi> of a <hi>Kind;</hi> That the names also of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subject, Magistrate</hi> and <hi>People, Governours</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> are but so many stiles <hi>Vsurpt.</hi> Since in Nature for one Man to be borne <hi>Subiect</hi> to another, is as much against Kinde, as if men should come into the World with <hi>chaines</hi> about them; or as if Women should bring forth Children with <hi>Gyves,</hi> and <hi>shakles</hi> on. Which Doctrine as 'twould naturally tend to a <hi>Parity,</hi> so that <hi>Parity</hi> would as naturally end in a <hi>Confusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, therefore, I will understand your <hi>Friend</hi> in the most favourable sence I can. That by the <hi>Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of the <hi>Peoples Liberty,</hi> he meanes the maintenance of some <hi>Eminent Rights</hi> belonging to the <hi>Subiect,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in manifest danger to be <hi>invaded,</hi> and taken from them, could not possibly be preserved but by Armes taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>invader.</hi> But then, granting this to be true, (as I shall in fit place shew it to be false) yet the <hi>King</hi> being this <hi>invader</hi> (unlesse by such an <hi>Invasion</hi> He could cease to be their <hi>King,</hi> or they to be his <hi>subiects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> I cannot see how such <hi>Rights</hi> could make their <hi>Defence lawfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the clearer <hi>Demonstration</hi> of this, I shall desire you;

Sir, not to think it a digression in me, if I deduce things somewhat higher then I at first intended, or then <hi>your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> requires me; Or, if to cure the <hi>streame,</hi> I take the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> course, and cast <hi>salt</hi> into the <hi>spring;</hi> And examine first, How farre the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> (who is <hi>truly</hi> a King, and not one only in <hi>Name)</hi> extends it selfe over <hi>Subjects.</hi> Next, whether any such Power doe belong to <hi>our King;</hi> Thirdly if there doe, How farre 'tis to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> and not <hi>resisted.</hi>

                  <p>The Originall of <hi>Regall power</hi> as it took beginning from the People, you have most lively exprest to you by S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 13. v. of the 2.

                  </p>
                  <p>In which words I shall desire you to observe. First, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> as well as other <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> is there called <gap reason="foreign">

that a <hi>King</hi> thus chosen is <hi>Major singulis, superiour</hi> to any <hi>One,</hi> yet he is <hi>Minor vniversis, Inferior</hi> to the <hi>whole.</hi> Since all the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>power</hi> which makes him shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>People,</hi> being but their <hi>Rayes</hi> contracted into his <hi>Body,</hi> they cannot reasonably be presumed so to give them away from themselves, as that in no case it shall be lawfull to call for them back againe.</p>
