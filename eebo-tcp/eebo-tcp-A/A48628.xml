            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have given the Council of State an account of our ſeveral Proceedings, ſince the time that by their Commands we left <hi>London;</hi> and having had nothing which I thought worthy your knowledge, I have refrained hitherto from giving you that trouble; but now think it my duty to acquaint you how the good Hand of Providence hath lately appeared in an Engagement betwixt your Forces and the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Upon the Lords day laſt, the two Regiments of Foot which marched from <hi>London,</hi> with the Horſe under the Command of Col. <hi>Swallow,</hi> and Major <hi>Creed</hi> (being in all Nineteen Troops) united at <hi>Drayton</hi> in the County of <hi>Salop.</hi> But by reaſon of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99717:3"/>
weak condition of the Gariſon of <hi>Staſford</hi> (the ſafety whereof I judged very conſiderable) I ſent back the <hi>Militia</hi> Troop under the command of Capt. <hi>Backhouſe</hi> thither: Alſo, to the aſſiſtance of your Friends in <hi>Derbiſhire</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> Troop of that County, and Capt. <hi>Sabbertons;</hi> and with the reſt I marched to <hi>Namptwich</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> on Monday laſt, where we ſtaid two days, till four Companies of Col. <hi>Biſcoes</hi> Regiment, and one Troop of my Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came up to us, and three Troops more of Col <hi>Lilburns,</hi> and two Companies of Col. <hi>Aſhficias,</hi> were advanced as far as V<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>xeter.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday morning, although it proved very unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Rain, yet judging your ſervice required expedition, and finding a great reſolution in the Soldiery to encounter all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to former reſolution upon full debate with the Superior Officers, resting upon the Providence of God we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards <hi>Cheſter;</hi> and being marched about five miles, we had certain intelligence, that the enemy, with about four or five thouſand horſe and foot, were marched towards N<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rthwi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h; which cauſed us to alter our reſolutions, and to march directly toward the Foreſt of <hi>De la More,</hi> over which they were to paſs; and being arived thither, we had notice that they were about three miles before us.</p>
            <p>Your Forces marched with that cheerfulneſs, that had we had day enough, we ſhould in all probability have ingaged them before they had reached <hi>Northwich,</hi> but doe what we could, we only gained a view of their Reer-guard in the duske of the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and took three or four priſoners. That night they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at <hi>Northwich,</hi> and we at a ſmall Village called <hi>Weeverham;</hi> from whence the next morning we advanced very early towards them, and before we had march't a mile we diſcover<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d them both Horſe and Foot, half a mile on this ſide <hi>No<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thwich</hi> drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Incloſures, where it was impoſſible for Horſe to doe ſervice, and not without difficulty for the Foot to break through. We preſently engaged them, and after a ſhort diſpute they quitted their grounds, and retreated from hedge to hedge, yet in that order as they ſuffered very little damage, it being impoſſible for our horſe to ſall in amongſt them, and at length came to <hi>Wining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-bridge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99717:3"/>
behind which they retreated, without any other loſs than that of Reputation, and diſcouragement in meeting with thoſe whom they found of equal courage, but engaged in a better Cauſe. Their next endevour was to ſecure that Bridge, which they had good reaſon to hope for, conſidering the Advantages they had both in regard the River was unfordable, the Bridge narrow, flanker'd with a ſtrong ditch on the Farr end, and a high Hill, up which no Horſe could paſs otherwiſe than along the ſide in a narrow path. But the Forces having their former courage en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by ſeeing the preſence of God with them, fell on as if they had been upon equall Terms; and after a ſhort diſpute, the Enemy having ſpent two or three good volleys, our men ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing upon them, they quit their ſtation, and gave way for both horſe and foot to march over. Our horſe, which hitherto had been uſeleſs to us, advanced over the Bridge, together with ſome Foot. The horſe made towards a party of theirs, which I judged was of their choiceſt, and came to ſecure the Retreat of their Foot; and the Foot ſcrambling up the Hill after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating Colours, our Horſe charged, but by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the way, in ſmall parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To ſpeak truth, that of the Horſe was performed on both ſides like Engliſhmen; but ours got the better, and the Enemy turned their backs. We had the purſuit of them above a quarter of a mile, where they again made Head, but were routed, and thereupon their Horſe and Foot fted on all hands, and our work was only to give them Chaſe. Moſt of their Foot got into Incloſures, and eſcaped, our wearied Foot not able to overtake them, nor poſſible for the Horſe to get to them. Their Horſe divided, ſome towards <hi>Chester,</hi> and ſome towards <hi>Warrington;</hi> we had the purſuit as far as <hi>Frodſham</hi> and <hi>Warrington</hi> where they could proceed no further, the latter being garriſond with four Companies of Foot and a Troop of Horſe.</p>
            <p>The Enemy had left this while in <hi>Northwich</hi> two Companies of Foot and two Troops of Horſe; which when I underſtood, I ſent the Adjutant-General, with Capt <hi>Evanſon's</hi> Troop and a Troop of Dragoons, who advancing up to the bridge and firing upon them, the Enemy drew off in good order, but not being able
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99717:4"/>
to make their retreat, was routed and purſued within two or three miles of <hi>Manchester.</hi> And though I cannot ſay your Victory was great in reſpect of priſoners or men ſlain, yet I judge it a total Rout, or which by the providence of God may be improved to ſo much. I cannot hear that we have above one man ſlain out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and not above three dangerouſly wounded: Of the Enemy not above thirty ſluin; of priſoners I have no full account as yet, but I ſuppoſe about three hundred, whereof moſt Horſmen, and ſome Field Officers of quality: I ſhall upon better information give you an account thereof. The Enemy reported themſelves to be above Four thouſand, but to our view there never appeared above Two. The ſervice done by the Foot, was chieſfly perform'd by Col. <hi>Hewſon's</hi> Regiment. The ſame day we march'd with the Foot back to <hi>Northwich,</hi> where upon conſideration of your affairs, we have determined to divide your Forces; Col. <hi>Aſhfield</hi> with his four Companies, Lieut. Col. <hi>Duckenfield</hi> (who ſhewed himſelf a worthy Servant this day to you and his country) with part of Col <hi>Hewſon's</hi> Regiment, and a convenient number of Horſe, to march for <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where, if there be any Root left for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing this Rebellion, I judge it lies. I have likewiſe writ to Col. <hi>Lilburn</hi> who is with ſome Horſe and Foot about <hi>Wakefield,</hi> to unite with them if they ſee cauſe. The other part of your Forces I intend to march towards <hi>Cheſter,</hi> having received this day a Meſſage from Col. <hi>Crexton,</hi> Governor of the Caſtle, by one of his Soldiers who ſwam the river and came to me, That he cannot for want of Victuals hold out longer. I have likewiſe ordered Col <hi>Jerom Zankey</hi> with the Iriſh Forces, who by common fame I hear is landed at <hi>Beaumarris,</hi> to advance with all ſpeed towards <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and to expect further Orders there in proſecution of the reducement of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> (which if your occaſions may not require them elſwhere, I deſire you will pleaſe to confirm.) The Enemie left there four Companies of Foot, a Troop of Horſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what eſcap'd thither from the Fight neer <hi>Northwich,</hi> and what that diſaffected City will afford in Townſmen.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here take the boldneſs to repreſent to you the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Soldiers by want of Pay, we being to iſſue that ſmall portion we had after the rate of ſix pence a day, and already
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99717:4"/>
well nigh ſpent, ſo as Shoos, Stockings, and other Neceſſaries in their long and dirty marches cannot be provided for. Your former care in this aſſures me I need ſay no more, and therefore ſhall break off this diſcourſe, wherein (may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have mentioned many particulars not worthy your notice, and ſhall beg of God that he will direct your Counſels to ſuch things, as may be for his glory, and ſuitable to theſe great mercies beſtowed upon you: Aſſuring you, that what may further concern your ſervice in theſe parts, ſhall be diligently performed by</p>
