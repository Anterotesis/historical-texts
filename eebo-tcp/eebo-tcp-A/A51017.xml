            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both Univerſities, all the Caſuiſts in Chriſtendom and the Eſtates of Parliament, having firſt cleared and concluded the queſtion diſputed,) had duly interdicted the further debates concerning thoſe matters; The Obligation of an Oath, (in which God is immediately concerned,) we think we may ſay with confidence) is not inferiour to the moſt weighty of theſe caſes; and no man can or will deny Diſputation is directed by God and nature, and uſed and allowed by all Men and Nations (the Barbarous <hi>Turk,</hi> and in caſes of Religion only excepted,) as the only ready and rational means to diſcover truth, and diſperſe ſuch clouds as darken the ſame; Confutations of <hi>fury and falſe witneſs</hi> are regiſtred Comments on the ignorance and impietie of <hi>Stephens</hi> Antagoniſts; and of <hi>fire and force</hi> is the high diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, the ſame better beſeeming the wilful, malitious, obdurate Jew, and blind, bloody Papiſt, then the Rational Religious Chriſtian, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtant: whoſe onely Honourable warfare, hath been ever managed (unto good ſucceſs) by Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enforced by Prayers, and Tears as their onely Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>The matter of Mr. <hi>Croftons</hi> Political Arguments hath been propoſed to the Conſideration of the Learned in the Law, and they ſee not any Crime or Capital Offence to be in them, any of them, or all of them put together; much leſs can they charge it to be <hi>Treaſon,</hi> the which the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition doth only puniſh with a <hi>Premunire</hi> ſince the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> 1661.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> approved; He is indeed againſt <hi>Papal Hierarchie,</hi> and that Epiſcopacy which was the <hi>ſtep</hi> and ſeemeth the <hi>ſupport of the man of ſin,</hi> but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the utmoſt, his Oppoſition is <hi>purely Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and is but ill reſiſted with <hi>Rage and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>

               <hi>No Biſhop no King</hi> may be a maxim of State, but we have not known it to be a Principle in our Law, we have not heard of any Statute which hath ſo conjoyned the <hi>Mitre</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> as that a diſ-reſpect to that, muſt needs be reputed, and puniſhed as a <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt this; We hope we ſhall not offend if we ſay that is a ſad Government which pretendeth to Divine Right, and yet hath no up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or guard but <hi>Violence and Oppreſſion of Reaſon,</hi> urged againſt it, and cannot ſilence a Diſputing Antagoniſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by a cloſe Priſon.</p>
            <p>We have heard a third cry, Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> Preached againſt the Biſhops, and provoked the oppoſition of them by <hi>fire and blood</hi>; to this we anſwer,</p>
            <p>We heard the laſt Sermons this math did Preach, and can give the true account thereof, wherein we deſire it may be noted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He went not out of his way to fly in the faces of the Biſhops; He had purpoſed a full expoſition of the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> in his Lectures at <hi>Antholins London,</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit whereof, he proceeded ſo far as to the laſt words of the ſecond Chapter; And obſerved the <hi>Lord Jeſus was the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls:</hi> In the Explication of this Poſition, he enquired <hi>how? and by whom the Lord Jeſus Chriſt did Execute this his Paſtorall charge, and Epiſcopal Office, in and towards his Church? And</hi> Reſolved and Aſſerted, <hi>the Lord doth execute this Paſtoral charge and Epiſcopal Office by his Miniſters, all, equally Authorized, and without any ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſtanding function of an Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum</hi>; The which having demonſtrated by conſiderable evidence, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers

to Objections, he did preſs on his people, as a truth conſiderable to be underſtood, as relating to <hi>Chriſts Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as <hi>King of his Church,</hi> and cloſed with this Obſervations in theſe expreſs Terms, <hi>There ſeemeth unto me an Emphaſis in thoſe words,</hi> Rev. 11.7. <hi>Relating to the two Witneſſes,</hi> when they ſhal have finiſhed their Teſtimony: <hi>Theſe words ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late no leſs to the matter, then the time of theſe witneſſes Propheſie,</hi> (viz.) <hi>That they muſt bear witneſs to the laſt punctilio of Chriſts Paſtoral charge, and Epiſcopal Office, before they were ſlain: we all know this Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls, to work out our Salvation by his threefold Office of Prophet, Prieſt and King: And I cannot but obſerve each of thoſe (beſides the general aſsault and oppoſition of the whole) hath had a particular and ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in the World, and hath conſtrained an open and Publique Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, from Chriſts Church in the fire and with their blood</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the firſt Age of Chriſtianity the great and ſpecial Queſtion was concerning Chriſts</hi> Prophetical Office, <hi>whether the Scriptures or the Oracles of Apollo, Traditions of the Jewes, and Deluſions of Impoſtors and Haeretiques ſhould be received obeyed? and we well know in what fiery Tryals and with what fearful ſufferings the Sheep of Chriſt did hear his voyce, decline strangers, and witneſse against them: this Office was no ſooner reſcued from violence, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the World by the blood of the Primitive Martyrs; but Chriſts</hi> Prieſtly Office <hi>was by the working of the man of ſin denied and darkened, the great controverſie in the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the one Mediator, and High Priest, the one Sacrifice once onely offered; or others made coequal with him, if not preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and how long and bloudy conflicts were under-gone in the ſame the Hiſtories of our Progenitors and Smithfield Flames do plainly ſhew: this Office was ſcarcely reſcued from violence before Chriſts</hi> Kingly Office <hi>cometh on the Stage, and calleth for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the Saints that the Government is on his ſhoulders ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministered by his own Officers, and Ordinances; and this muſt be attested in the greateſt Tribulation; ſaddeſt Sufferings in fire and bloud that can befall us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this whole Diſcourſe Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> mentioned not <hi>fire and bloud,</hi> in any ſence but paſſive, as doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Ye have not reſiſted unto bloud, Heb.</hi> 11.4. and diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all actions unto <hi>fire and bloud,</hi> which at any time were or ſhould be attempted on the pretence of <hi>Chriſts Kingly

Office,</hi> declaring his deteſtation of that Mad, Treaſonable Rebellion of <hi>Fenner</hi> and his Fellow real Phanatiques, which had lately paſſed to the ſcandal of the true Religion: theſe things our ears heard, and therefore do we teſtifie the ſame, yea and ſome of us wrote the ſame from his mouth (in characters) as they were by him ſpoken. Had Pagan or Popiſh Prieſts heard this Doctrine, and cryed out <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> it had not been ſtrange; but the out-cry of Chriſtian, and Proteſtant Biſhops doth make us admire, and ſtand amazed.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, we humbly offer it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Juſt and Prudent men</hi> ſincerely affected to his Majeſties Government, whether Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> (what ever hath been ſuggeſted or clamored againſt him) hath done any thing worthy of death, or of bonds? and whether his enlargement, and reſtitution will not much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unto the honour of his Majeſties Government, then the continuance of him in bonds, to the undoing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, wife, and ſeven ſmall children, by the expence of his poor Eſtate already waſted; and the real prejudice of his health, and ruine of many ſouls which might be ſaved by his Miniſtery? the liberty of the Subiect being fully ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by many Ancient and later Laws.</p>
