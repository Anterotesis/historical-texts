            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Earl of <hi>Dorset</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Having had the Honour to have liv'd so many years in Your Lordships favour, and to have been always exceedingly oblig'd by Your Lordship, ought to be glad of any opporttunity of Publishing my Gratitude. And the offering this Comedy to Your Lordship may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be thought an improper occasion of doing it; for the first Act of it was written at <hi>Copt-Hall;</hi> and Your Lordships Approbation of it (whose Wit and Iudgment have ever been unquestion'd) encourag'd and inspir'd me to go on: When I had finished it, which was in a Months time, Your Lordship, upon the perusal of the whole, was pleas'd to say that you thought it a true, and diverting Comedy.</p>
            <p>This, I must confess, made me hope for success upon the Stage, which it met with, but so great, as was above my expectation (in this Age which has run mad after Farces) no Comedy, for these many years, having fill'd the Theatre so long together: And I had the great Honour to find so many Friends, that the House was never so full since it was built, as upon the third day of this Play; and vast numbers went away, that could not be admitted.</p>
            <p>This extraordinary success the more emboldens me to lay the Play at Your Lordships Feet; in whose service, I should be glad to employ my whole Life.</p>
            <p>I shall not, according to the Custom of Dedications, make a long Panegyrick to Your Lordship, 'tis superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:61835:3"/>
and impertinent, to praise him whom all men speak well of, and of whom I never heard any man speak ill: Your Lordship is the Favourite of Mankind; and You deserve to be so, for You are ever obliging, and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out occasions of doing good, and exerting Your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Generosity, in which You never lose a day.</p>
            <p>I must acknowledge my self infinitely oblig'd to Your Lordship every way; but particularly, that I have the freedom of being receiv'd as one of Your Family at <hi>Copt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi> where not only the excellence of the Air, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulariy of Living contribute to my Health, but I have the Honour of enjoying the conversation which in all the World I would chuse.</p>
            <p>It is to me, and it must needs be to all who wish Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship well, an extraordinary satisfaction to observe that You have laid so certain a foundation of solid happiness, for all the remaining part of Your Life; in retiring from all the unsatisfying pleasures, and noisie troubles of the Town, to so sweet a place, with so admirable a Lady, who in Beauty is exceeded by none, and has all those qualities of mind besides, which serve to make an excellent Lady, an extraordinary Governess of a Family, and an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wife; whose Fruitfulness is like to bless Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with a Beauteous, Noble and Numerous Issue. And may Your Lordship and She long enjoy one another, and all the Blessings You Your selves can imagine or desire. <hi>I am,</hi>

            </head>
            <l>HOw have we in the space of one poor Age,</l>
            <l>Beheld the Rise and Downfal of the Stage!</l>
            <l>When, with our King restor'd, it first arose,</l>
            <l>They did each day some good old Play expose;</l>
            <l>And then it flourish'd: Till, with Manna tir'd,</l>
            <l>For wholesome Food ye nauseous Trash desir'd.</l>
            <l>Then rose the whiffling Scribblers of those days,</l>
            <l>Who since have liv'd to bury all their Plays;</l>
            <l>And had their issue full as num'rous been</l>
            <l>As <hi>Priams,</hi> they the Fate of all had seen.</l>
            <l>With what prodigious scarcity of Wit</l>
            <l>Did the new Authors starve the hungry Pit?</l>
            <l>Infected by the <hi>French,</hi> you must have Rhime,</l>
            <l>Which long, to please the Ladies ears, did chime.</l>
            <l>Soon after this came Ranting Fustian in,</l>
            <l>And none but Plays upon the fret were seen:</l>
            <l>Such Roaring Bombast stuff, which Fops would praise,</l>
            <l>Tore our best Actors Lungs, cut short their days.</l>
            <l>Some in small time did this distemper kill,</l>
            <l>And had the savage Authors gone on still,</l>
            <l>Fustian had been a new Disease i'th' Bill.</l>
            <l>When Time, which all things trys, had laid Rhime dead,</l>
            <l>The vile Vsurper Farce reign'd in its stead.</l>
            <l>Then came Machines, brought from a Neighbour Nation,</l>
            <l>Oh how we suffer'd under Decoration.</l>
            <l>If all this stuff has not quite spoyl'd your taste,</l>
            <l>Pray let a Comedy once more be grac'd:</l>
            <l>Which does not Monsters represent, but Men,</l>
            <l>Conforming to the Rules of Master <hi>Ben.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Our Author, ever having him in view,</l>
            <l>At humble distance would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his steps pursue.</l>
            <l>He to correct, and to inform did write:</l>
            <l>If Poets aim at nought but to delight,</l>
            <l>Fidlers have to the Bays an equal right.</l>
            <l>

               <p>Well: And what do you think of our way of living here? Is not rich generous Wine better than your poor Hedg-Wine stum'd, or dull <hi>March</hi>-Beer? Are not delicate well-bred, well-dress'd Women better than Dairy-Maids, Tenants Daughters, or Barefoot Strumpets? Streets full of fine Coaches, better than a yard full of Dung-Carts?

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Has your Wives Brother done by you in his Will, as you would have had him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Truly yes: He has made me sole Executor, and left my two Sons 5000 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, to be paid at each of their days of Marriage, or at my Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Well Brother, you are a happy man; for Wealth flows in upon you on every side, and Riches you account the greatest happiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>I find that Wealth alone will not make happy. Ah Brother, I must confess it was a kindness in you, when Heaven had blest you with a great Estate by Merchandize, to adopt my Younger Son, and take him and breed him from his Childhood: But you have been so gentle to him, he is run into all manner of Vice and Riot; no bounds can hold him; no shame can stop him; no Laws nor Customs can restrain him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>I am confident you are mistaken: He has as fair a Reputation as any Gentleman about <hi>London:</hi> 'Tis true, he's a good fellow, but no Sot; he loves mirth and society, without Drunkenness: He is, as all young Fellows I believe are, given to Women; but 'tis in private; and he is particular: no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Whore-master: and in short, keeps as good Company as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Your over-weening makes you look through a false Glass upon him. Company! why he keeps Company for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61835:12"/>
Devil: Had you come a minute sooner, you might have seen two of his Companions; they were praising him for Roaring, Swearing, Ranting, Scouring, Whoring, beating Watches, breaking Windows: I but ask'd one of em if he knew him, and said I had somewhat to say to him; the Rogue, the most seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrible of the two, told me, If I had any thing to say to Squire <hi>Belfond,</hi> he would give me satisfaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>What kind of fellow?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>He came out of <hi>White-Fryers</hi>: He's some <hi>Alsatian Bully.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis impossible; he never keeps such Company.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>The Rogue drew upon me: bid me <hi>Lugg out,</hi> call'd me <hi>Old Prigg, Country Put</hi>; and spoke a particular Language which such Rogues have made to themselves, call'd Canting, as Beggars, Gipsies, Thieves and Jayl-Birds do: But I made his Bullies go away very tamely at the sight of my drawn Sword.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>I am sure he keeps no such Company: it must be some other of his Name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>You make me mad to excuse him thus: The Town rings of him; You have ruin'd him by your Indulgence: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he throws away Money like Dirt; his Infamy is notorious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Infamy: Nay there you wrong him; he does no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentleman-like things: Prithee consider Youth a little: What if he does Wench a little; and now and then is somewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in Wine? Where's the great Crime? All young fellows that have mettle in em will do the first; and if they have wit and good humour in em, in this drinking Country, they will sometimes be forc'd upon the latter: And he must be a very dull phlegmatick Lump, whom Wine will not elevate to some Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance now and then.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Will you distract me? What are Drinking and Whoring no faults? His courses will break my heart; they bring Tears into my Eyes so often.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>One would think you had been Drinking and were maudling: Think what we our selves did when we were young fellows: You were a Spark, would Drink, Scour and Wench with the best o'th' Town.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but I soon repented, married and settled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>And turn'd as much to the other extreme: And now

perhaps I mislike these faults, caus'd by his heat of Youth. But how do you know he may not be reclaim'd suddenly?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Reclaim'd? How can he be reclaim'd without seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? You should Cudgel him, and allow him no Money: make him not dare to offend you thus. Well, I have a Son whom by my strictness I have form'd according to my heart: He never puts on his Hat in my presence; Rises at second Course, takes away his Plate; says Grace, and saves me the Charge of a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. When ever he committed a fault, I maul'd him with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: I'd fain see him once dare to be extravagant: No, he's a good Youth, the Comfort of my Age; I weep for joy to think of him. Good Sir, learn to be a Father of him that is one: I have a Natural Care of him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>You are his Father by Nature, I by Choice: I took him when he was a Child, and bred him up with gentleness, and that kind of Conversation that has made him my friend: He conceals nothing from me, or denies nothing to me. Rigour makes nothing but Hypocrites.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps when you begin late; but you should have been severe to him in his Childhood: abridg'd him of Liberty and Money: and have had him soundly whipp'd often: he would have blest you for it afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Too much streightness in the minds of Youths, like too much lacing the Body, will make em grow Crooked.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>But no lacing at all, will make them swell and grow Monsters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>I must govern by Love. I had as leive govern a Dog as a Man if it must be by fear: This I take to be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a good Father to Children, and a harsh Master over Slaves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and see what your government is come to; his Vice and Prodigality will distract me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Why should you be so concern'd? He is mine, is he not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, by Adoption, but he is mine by Nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis all but Custom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Mine is a tender Care.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Your passion blinds you: I have as tender care as you can have: I have been ever delighted with him from his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61835:13"/>
Childhood: He is endear'd to me by long custom and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have had all the pleasure of a Father, without the drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of getting a Son upon a damn'd Wife, whom perhaps I should wish hang'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And will you let him run on in his Lewdness and Prodigality?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>He is mine: If he offends, 'tis me: If he squanders away Money, 'tis mine; and what need you care? Pray take care of your own: If you will take care of this too, what do you but take him from me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>This you come to always! I take him from you: No, I'd not be troubled with him. Well, let him run on, and be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd, hang'd and and damn'd— I'll never speak word more about him. Let him go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>This heat of youth will be allay'd e're long I warrant you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, let him go on, let him go on; I'll take care of my own at home: and happy were this Rake-hell if he would take Example by his Brother: But I say no more; I ha done; let him go on.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are angry, your passion runs away with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>No no, I have done; what would you have more?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Let us go and see him: I'll lay my life you'll find him perusing some good Author; he ever spends his whole morning in study.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>I must into the City, the first thing I do, and get my Bills accepted; and then if you will we'll see him: and no doubt but we shall find him perusing of some Whore or other, instead of a Book.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>I am not of your Opinion: I at I'll carry you in my Coach into the City, and then bring you back to him: He is of so good a disposition: So much a Gentleman: And has such worth and honour, that if you knew him as well as I, you'd love him as well as I do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, I hear you Sir: I must send for my Son Post: I'll show you a Son. Well, Heaven bless him, I should be weary of this wicked World: but for the Comforts I find in him: Come along, I'll shew you a Son.

               <p>Shame of our Family; you behave your self so like a Mad-man and a Fool, you will be begg'd: These fits are more extravagant than any thing he can be guilty of. Do you give your Son the words of Command you use to Dogs?</p>

               <p>Pray use me better, or I'll assure you, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see one another. Besides, I shall entail my Estate for want of Issue by this Son here, upon another Family, if you will treat me thus.</p>

Well Brother I ha done: His lewdness distracted me! Oh my poor Boy in the Country; I long to see him, the great support of my declining Age.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>A Blockhead! When he comes the World shall judge which of us has been the wiser in the Education of a Son: A Blockhead? Why he knows a sample of any Grain as well as e're a fellow in the North: Can handle a Sheep or Bullock as

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>He knows no Vice, poor Boy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>He will have his turn to know it then; as sure as he will have the Small Pox; and then he'll be fond on't, when his Brother has lest it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will</speaker>
               <p>I defy the Omen: he never Whores, nor Drinks hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but upon design, as driving a Bargain, or so; and that I allow him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>So: Knavish and designing Drunkenness you allow; but not good fellowship for mirth and conversation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Now Brother, pray what have you made your Son good for, with your breeding you so much boast of? Let's hear that now: Come on, let's hear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>First, I bred him at <hi>Westminster-School,</hi> till he was Master of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues; then I kept him at the University, where I instructed him to read the Noble <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and what use can he make of the Noble <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> but to prate like a Pedant, and shew his parts over a Bottle?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>To make a man fit for the Conversation of Learned Gentlemen is one noble end of Study: But those Authors make him wiser and honester, Sir, to boot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Wiser! Will he ever get Six-pence, or improve or keep his Estate by em?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Mean Notions: I made him weil vers'd in History.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>That's a pretty study indeed: How can there be a true History, when we see no man living is able to write truly the History of the last week?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>He by the way read Natural Philosophy, and had insight enough in the Mathematicks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Natural Philosophy! knows nothing: Nor would I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61835:19"/>
give a sart for any Mathematician, but a Carpenter, Bricklayer, Measurer of Land, or Sailor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>Some moderate skill in it will use a man to reason closely.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Very pretty: Reason! Can he Reason himself into six Shillings by all this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>He needs it not: But to go on; after three years I remov'd him from the University (lest he should have too strong a tincture of it) to the <hi>Temple</hi>; there I got a modest learned Lawyer, of little practice, for want of Impudence; and there are several such that want, while empty impudent fellows thrive and swagger at the Bar: This man I got to instruct my Son in some old Common Law Books, the Statutes, and the best Pleas of the Crown, and the Constitution of the old true <hi>English</hi> Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Does he get a Shilling by all this? But what a Devil made you send him into <hi>France,</hi> to make an arrant vain Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb of him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>There he did all his manly Exercises; saw two Campaigns; studied History; Civil Laws, and Laws of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; the Language he spoke well e're he went. He made the Tour of <hi>Italy,</hi> and saw <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Low Countries, and return'd well skill'd in Foreign Affairs, and a Compleat accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd <hi>English</hi> Gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And to know nothing of his own Estate, but how to spend it: my poor Boy has travell'd to better purpose: for he has travell'd all about my Lands, and knows every Acre and Nook, and the value of it: There's travel for you! Poor Boy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>And he enjoys so little of that Estate he sees, as to be impatient for your Death: I dare swear mine wishes my Life, next to his own. I have made him a Compleat Gentleman, fit to serve his Country in any Capacity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Serve his Country! Pox on his Country: 'Tis a Country of such Knaves, 'tis not worth the serving: All those who pretend to serve it, mean nothing but themselves. But amongst all things, how came you to make him a Fiddler, always Fluting or Scraping? I had as leive hear a Jews-Harp.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Edw.</speaker>
               <p>I love Musick: Besides I would have young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have as many helps to spend their time alone as can be;
<pb facs="tcp:61835:20"/>
most of our Youth are ruin'd by having Time lye heavy on their hands, which makes them run into any base Company to shun themselves.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And all this Gentlemans Education is come to Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whoring and Debauchery.

               <p>'Tis time now to take up, and think of being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World: See then, my Son, tho thou shouldst not be over busie, to side with Parties and with Factions, yet that

               <p>Be sure to know the humour of the Woman; you run a mighty hazard: But if you be valiant enough to venture, (which, I must confess, I never was.) I'll leave it to your own choice: I know you have so much honour, you will do nothing below your self.</p>

Gentle, Complaisant, Assable, and Liberal, at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: The World speaks well of you; Mankind embrace you; your Son Loves you, and wishes your Life as much as he can do his own.

               <p>Rather look on him as a Dislocated one, and get him Set again: By this time you see, Severity will do nothing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him back to you by Love. In short, give him his Liberty, and a good allowance: There now remains no other way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him; for like a Stone-horse broke in among the Mares, no Fence hereafter will contain him.</p>

Methinks 'tis strange, that places so near the Kings Palace should be no parts of his Dominions: 'Tis a shame to the Societies of Law to Countenance such Practices: Should any place be shut against the Kings Writ or <hi>Posse Comitatus</hi>? Take them away and those two Witnesses.

            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Mountfort.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>YE mighty scowrers of these narrow Seas,</l>
            <l>Who suffer not a Bark to sail in peace,</l>
            <l>But with your Tire of Culverins ye roar,</l>
            <l>Bring 'em by th' Lee, and Rummidge all their store;</l>
            <l>Our Poet duck'd, and look'd as if half dead,</l>
            <l>At every Shot that whistled o're his Head.</l>
            <l>Frequent Engagements ne're could make him bold,</l>
            <l>He sneak'd into a corner of the Hold.</l>
            <l>Since he submits, pray ease him of his fear,</l>
            <l>And with a joynt Applause bid him appear,</l>
            <l>Good Criticks don't insult and domineer.</l>
            <l>He fears not Sparks, who with brisk dress and meen,</l>
            <l>Come not to hear or see, but to be seen.</l>
            <l>Each prunes himself, and with a languishing Eye,</l>
            <l>Designs to kill a Lady by the by.</l>
            <l>Let each fantastick ugly Beau and Shape,</l>
            <l>Little of Man, and very much of Ape,</l>
            <l>Admire himself, and let the Poet scape.</l>
            <l>Ladies, Your Anger most he apprehends,</l>
            <l>And is grown past the Age of making Friends</l>
            <l>Of any of the Sex whom he offends.</l>
            <l>No Princess frowns, no Hero rants and whines,</l>
            <l>Nor is weak Sense embroyder'd with strong lines:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61835:49"/>No Battels, Trumpets, Drums, not any dye;</l>
            <l>No Mortal Wounds, to please your Cruelty;</l>
            <l>Who like not any thing but Tragedy.</l>
            <l>With fond, unnatural extravagancies,</l>
            <l>Stolen from the silly Authors of Romances.</l>
            <l>Let such the Chamber-maids diversion be,</l>
            <l>Pray be you reconcil'd to Comedy.</l>
            <l>For when we make you merry, you must own</l>
            <l>You are much prettier than when you frown.</l>
            <l>With charming smiles you use to conquer still,</l>
            <l>The melancholly look's not apt to kill.</l>
            <l>Our Poet begs you who adorn this Sphere,</l>
            <l>This Shining Circle, will not be severe.</l>
            <l>Here no <hi>Chit chat,</hi> here no <hi>Tea Tables</hi> are.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Cant</hi> he hopes will not be long unknown,</l>
            <l>'Tis almost grown the language of the Town.</l>
            <l>For Fops, who feel a wretched want of Wit,</l>
            <l>Still set up something that may pass for it.</l>
            <l>He begs that you will often grace his Play,</l>
            <l>And lets you know <hi>Munday</hi>'s his visiting day.</l>
