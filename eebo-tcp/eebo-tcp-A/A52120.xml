            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

formerly Writ two
excellent Almanacks, called
Country Almanacks, which
were Printed, and eſteemed by ſeveral
Members of the Royal Society very
uſeful, eſpecially for Country Affairs, but
meeting with ſome Diſcouragements
from ſuch as knew not how to judge of
the Authors worth, he gave over that
undertaking, contrary to the deſires of
many Ingenious Men.</p>
            <p>And having ſince Writ a little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Survey, in which he hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
as well as Theory, and being
willing to have the Approbation or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of others, that it might either be
<pb facs="tcp:33569:6"/>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Title ſufficiently informs thee in general
of my Deſigns: But I confeſs I owe thee a
a more particular Account, not only of that, but
ſeveral other things which I ſhall briefly give thee.</p>
            <p>1. I have obſerved that the Country aboundeth
with ſuch, as by their Inclination and Intereſt are
prevailed with to take pains in meaſuring Land,
that for want of better Inſtruction uſe ill divided
Chains and tedious Methods of Computation,
which makes their work intolerable troubleſom,
if exactneſs be required. And ſome for want of
skill in the Fundamentals of Geometry, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
prodigiouſly falſe Principles, as this for one,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Content of any Cloſe, of what Figure ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
may be found by Squaring a quarter of the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter.</hi>
Mathematical-Schools, where better things
might be learned, are very rare, and an able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
to inſtruct one in private is hard, and charge
able to be procured. Excellent Books indeed
there are in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, Written by our
Famous <hi>Rathborn, Wing, Leybourn,</hi> and <hi>Holwell,</hi> to
which may be added Induſtrious Mr. <hi>Atwells</hi>
Treatiſe, and ſome part of Capt. <hi>Sturmy</hi>'s: But
thoſe I rather eſteem fit to be read byan able Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
(towards his perfecting) than by a new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner,
for in the beſt of thoſe Books he will find
the moſt uſeful and plain Rules ſo intermixed
with others that are leſs neceſſary, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
(though very excellent for their proper
ends) and ſo many Curioſities touching Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
Tranſmtation of Figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:33569:7"/>
his buſineſs never calls for, that for want of judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
to pick out that which fits his preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and to ſtudy higher Speculations afterwards,
he is apt to be confounded and diſcouraged;
whereby it accidentally comes to paſs that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
makes him poor.</p>
            <p>Beſides, three of theſe ſix Books are in Folio,
another in Quarto, and the other two (though
Octavo's) too large for ordinary carrying in a
Pocket, and in that regard not ſo convenient for
one that hath much occaſion to be out of his own
Houſe; to ſay nothing of their Price, which to
ſome poor Youths is not the leaſt diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>I have therefore made my Book ſo little, that
the Price can neither much empty the Pocket, nor
the Bulk overfill it. And yet ſo plain, that I doubt
not to be underſtood by very ordinary Capacities.
My Method is fitted to my Deſign: Beginning with
the Principles of the Art, and ſo proceeding <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datim</hi>
till I have ſhewed how all ordinary Figures
may be Meaſured, Protracted, and Caſt up, without
any other Inſtrument of charge but Chains, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
and Scales. Afterwards for ſuch as deſire
higher Attainments, I have endeavoured to ſpeak
ſo fully (in a little compaſs) of the <hi>Plain Table,</hi> and
given ſuch hints, applicable not only to it, but alſo
to the <hi>Peractor, Theodolite,</hi> and <hi>Semicircle,</hi> as that an
Ingenious Perſon may make great uſe of them.</p>
            <p>But as touching the Doctrine of Triangles, and
Tranſmutation of Figures into others equipollent,
with the large Tables (referring to the former) of
Logarithms of Numbers, Sines, and Tangents, I
thought it improper to cumber this ſmall Manual,
or the unlearned Reader with them, having (as I
<pb facs="tcp:33569:7"/>
humbly hope) ſufficiently inform'd him how to
find all his Sides and Angles by Inſtruments, and
alſo the Content of any Figure without ſuch
tranſmutation, reſerving ſuch Curioſities and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others touching Drawing and Painting of Maps;
Meaſuring of Ways, and Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a Second
Part, which I may perhaps hereafter Publiſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
due encouragement, but if I do not, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
may find themſelves good ſtore of work
in the Authors even now quoted.</p>
            <p>2. It may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that in referring
to the Figures, I ſometimes uſe Words ſeeming
to imply that the Figure I ſpeak of is in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Page, and ſo it was in my Copy, but the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Gravers have otherwiſe contrived them
for convenience in Copper Cuts by themſelves.
And to give them their due they are generally
done with great accuracy, and none of them hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any ſuch error as is like to beget trouble or
miſtake to the Reader, ſaving only that fig. 19
hath D inſtead of O at the Center, and the Line
OL in the Margin of <hi>Fig.</hi> 14. ſhould be of the
length from L to the uppermoſt o in the Scale,
and the Figures on the ſide ſhould be made 1 leſs
than they are, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 ſhould be 1, 3 made 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, as to the <hi>Errata,</hi> though I have not
been ſo anxiouſly careful, as to correct every <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
miſtake,</hi> I have very diligently peruſed all from
p. 1 to p. 224 incluſive, and hope I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
reſtored the Senſe to the places wronged,

               <p>I. A <hi>Point</hi> is that which hath no
parts, either of longitude or
latitude, but is indiviſible, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
expreſſed with a ſmall
prick, like a period at the end
of a ſentence.</p>
               <p>II. A <hi>Line</hi> hath length, but no bredth nor
depth, whoſe limits or extremities are Points.
This is either <hi>right</hi> or <hi>crooked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33569:14"/>
III. A <hi>right Line</hi> lies ſtraight, and equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
its extreme points, being the ſhorteſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
between them; the <hi>crocked</hi> or <hi>circular</hi>
not ſo.</p>
               <p>IV. A <hi>Superficies</hi> hath length and bredth, but
no depth; of this Lines are the limits.</p>
               <p>V. A <hi>plain Superficies</hi> is that which lieth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
(or evenly) between its Lines.</p>
               <p>VI. An <hi>Angle</hi> is the Meeting or two Lines in
one point, ſo as not to make one ſtraight Line,
and if drawn on paſt that point, they will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect
or croſs one another. This is vulgar <hi>Engliſh</hi>
may be called a <hi>Corner;</hi> of which there be two
ſorts, one <hi>right,</hi> the other <hi>oblique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. A <hi>right Angle</hi> is that which is made by
two right lines, croſſing or touching one another
perpendicularly, (or ſquarely) like an ordinary
Croſs, or Carpenters Square.</p>
               <p>VIII. An <hi>oblique Angle</hi> is that which is either
greater or leſs than a right Angle, and this is
of two ſorts, <hi>obtuſe</hi> and <hi>acute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. An <hi>obtuſe Angle</hi> is greater than a right
Angle, like the left and right Corners of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
X.</p>
               <p>X. An <hi>acute Angle</hi> is leſs than a right Angle,
like the higheſt and loweſt Corners of the ſame
Letter.</p>
               <p>XI. A <hi>Figure</hi> is that which is comprehended
under one line or many: Of this there are two
kinds, a <hi>Circle</hi> and a <hi>right-lined Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XII. A <hi>Circle</hi> is a perfect round Figure,
ſuch as is drawn with a pair of Compaſſes, the
one Foot being turned round in a point, and the
other wheeled about it. The point in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

middle is called the <hi>Center;</hi> the round line,
the <hi>Circumference</hi> or <hi>Peripheri;</hi> a line going
through the Center, and divide the Circle into
two equal parts, is called the <hi>Diameter;</hi> half of
that line is a <hi>Somidiameter,</hi> or <hi>Radius;</hi> half the
Circle is ſtiled a <hi>Semicircle;</hi> the quarter, a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant;</hi>
any portion of it, cut off by a right Line

<hi>Triangles</hi> or <hi>Triangulate,</hi> that is, ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

               <p>XIV. <hi>Triangles</hi> are Figures comprehended
under three right Lines, and (as <hi>Ramus</hi> thinks
for a Reaſon that he gives, <hi>lib. 6. pr. 6.)</hi> might be
better called <hi>Trilaterals;</hi> but the name <hi>Triangle</hi>
from the number of the Angles hath obtained.</p>
               <p>Alſo from the nature and Quantity of their
Angles theſe Triangles are diſtinguiſhed into
three ſorts: 1. <hi>Rectangled,</hi> having one right
Angle; 2 <hi>Obtuſe-angled,</hi> having one obtuſe Angle;
and 3. <hi>Acute-angled;</hi> having all acute Angles;
for no Triangle can have more right or obtuſe
Angles than one, becauſe by by an old Rule (eaſie
to be demonſtrated) no Triangle upon a plain
Superficies can conſiſt of three greater Angles
than ſuch, as being jointly taken are equal to
two Right.</p>
               <p>Theſe three ſorts of Triangles may, according
to the length and proportion of their ſides, be
ſubdiſtinguiſhed into ſeven; for each of them
may have either two equal Sides or none, and
the Acute-angled may have all three Sides or
lines equal: To all which kinds, learned Men

               <p>XVII. <hi>Parallellograms</hi> are Figures that are
bounded with parallel Lines, that is, ſuch lines
as are every where of the ſame diſtance one from
another, ſo as if they were infinitely extended
they would never meet, like the upright lines of

of a Diamond on the Cards, or the moſt ordinary
Cut of Glaſs in Windows) whoſe opoſite An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles

               <p>XXIII. The <hi>Rhomboides</hi> is (as it were) a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<hi>Rbombus,</hi> for if from any ſide of a <hi>Rhom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>

               <p>XXIV. The <hi>Trapezium</hi> is a Figure that is

apply one Leg of ſuch a Square to any Line, ſo
as the Angle of the Square may touch the end of
the ſaid Line, or any other Point where the

other Leg draw the Perpendicular. In like ſort
to let fall a perpendicular from a point aſſigned
you need only to apply one Leg of the Square to

the perpendicular, by that Leg that toucheth

given line, and then by applying the Leg of
your Square to that part of the perpendicular

Now each of theſe Triangles being parted into
two Right-angled Triangles by their Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
then it is plain to the Eye (and from
the nature of Diagonals, which ever divide a
Parallellogram into equal parts) that the two
new Triangles OPD and OPC, which make
up the firſt of the given Triangles, are equal to
the Triangles DAO and OBC, which make
up the remainder of the Parallellogram
ABCD. Therefore that Parallellogram is
double to that Taiangle, which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated:</p>
               <p>In like manner it is evident, that the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lellogram

               <p>But now methinks I ſee (as it were) my
Country Student ſcratching his Head,<note place="margin">☞</note> and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for an opportunity) to propound two doubts
to me.</p>
               <p>1. Why I called the Numbers correſpondent
to my Lines by divers denominations, as Inches,
Feet, Yards, Rods; and ſometimes by none at
all but propounding the Numbers abſtractly.</p>
               <p>2. How I came to know how many of thoſe
Meaſures (whatever they be) are repreſented
by the Lines given, and perpendiculars found.</p>
               <p>To the former I anſwer, I am not yet teaching
how to meaſure Lines (that work is preſently
to follow) but what Lines of Figures are to be
meaſured, and the meaſures of thoſe Lines
being known (or ſuppoſed) how the Content
upon thoſe real (or ſuppoſed) Grounds may be
found, and to this purpoſe I might call the
Numbers repreſented by the Lines, Inches, Feet,
Yards, or any other Meaſures, at pleaſure,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33569:25"/>
provided I called the Squares, to which the <hi>Area</hi>
is equal, by the ſame names; for an Inch in
length bears the ſame proportion to a ſquare Inch
(having length and bredth) that a Mile in
length bears to a ſquare Mile. For this reaſon
I profeſs not in the Title of this Chapter to
teach how to meaſure Figures, (much leſs how
to meaſure the Lines of ſuch Figures) but how
to find the Content, the Lines being given.</p>
               <p>And then to take away the ſecond doubt, know
that the Numbers repreſented by the Lines,
were either given by thoſe Learned Artiſts from
whom I borrowed the Figures, or ſuppoſed by
my ſelf as grounds to go upon (as in ſuch caſes
is ordinary) or, laſtly, found out to be agreeable
thereto by ſome Scale of ſmall equal parts,
which he is yet ſuppoſed ignorant of. But now
I am going to ſhew him the nature and uſe of
two or three plain and cheap Inſtruments, by
the help whereof he may with much exactneſs,
1. Meaſure the length of any Lines bounding
Right-lined Figures upon the ground. 2. Draw
Lines and Figures upon paper proportionable
thereunto (which we call protracting). 3. Find
upon his paper-figures the true length of all
the deſired Perpendiculars, which ſhall alſo be
proportionable to thoſe on the Ground, but
much more eaſie to be obtained. And withal,
I intend to give him ſuch farther Inſtructions
and Cautions for the application of the general
and more particular Rules of this Chapter to
his peculiar uſe, as will render them (eſpecially
ſome of them) ſingularly advantagious.</p>

bearing the Names of their Inventors, Mr. <hi>Rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gunter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wing,</hi> all of them
Ingeniouſly divided, and uſeful in their kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
but my brievity will give me leave only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
one, and that ſhall be Mr. <hi>Gunter</hi>'s, being
moſt in uſe, and eaſie to be procured.</p>
               <p>This Chain contains in length four Statute-Poles
or Perches, each Perch containing 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Feet and a half, or 5 Yards and a half; ſo
that the whole Chain is 66 Feet, or 22 Yards
long.</p>
               <p>This whole Chain is divided into 100 equal
parts or Links, whereof 25 are a juſt Pole or
Perch; and for ready counting, there is uſually
a remarkable diſtinction by ſome Plate or large
Ring at the end of every 25 Links, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at the preciſe middle of the Chain, which
ſhould differ from the reſt in greatneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſneſs.
Alſo at the end of every tenth
Link 'tis uſual to hang a ſmall Curtain-Ring
and if there be at every five Links end a piece o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wire made like the bow of a Link, with a
little ſhank an Inch or leſs long, (or ſome ſuch
diſtinction) 'tis ſtill better.</p>
               <p>When you are to meaſure any Line by this
Chain, you need to regard no other Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33569:26"/>
but only Chains and Links, ſet down
with a prick of your pen betwixt them, <hi>e. g.</hi>
If you found the ſide of a Cloſe to be 6 Chains
and 35 Links long, it is thus to be put down
6. 35.</p>
               <p>But if the Links be under 10, a Cypher muſt
be prefixed; ſo 7 Chains 9 Links muſt be thus
ſet, 7. 09.</p>
               <p>In the uſing of this (or indeed of any) Chain,
care muſt be taken, both to go ſtrait, and to
keep a true account; for which purpoſe, it is
good that he which goeth before carry in his
hand a bundle of Rods, to ſtick down one at the
end of the Chain which leads, having firſt ſtretched
it well, and that he which follows do not only
gather up the Rods to keep the Accompt, but
alſo at every remove, mark whether he ſee the
Leader directly between his Eye and the Angle,
or other Mark he aims to meaſure to; and if
need be, call to the Leader to move towards the
right or left hand, till he ſee him in a direct
Line to it.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Compaſſes</hi> are ſo well known, that I need
not deſcribe them; only they ſhould be of Braſs,
with Steel Points ſmall and neatly wrought, nine
or ten Inches long from the Joint to the points,
turning ſo truly upon the Rivet that they may
be eaſily opened; and yet ſtand ſo firmly, that
an Arch or Circle may be without their ſhrinking
deſcribed upon a large <hi>Radius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the form, I would commend above all,
thoſe that have large Bows, ſo contrived, that
by preſſing them with the hinder part of the
Hand, they will gently open, and by the Thumb
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33569:27"/>
and fourth Finger be put together (as others
will) ſo that they are manageable by one hand,
which is a great convenience for one that at the
ſame time ſhould hold his Rule with Scales in
the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe might alſo be contrived with a Screw
to take out one of the points, to place in the
room (upon occaſion) a Black-Lead pen, or any
pen to draw Circles, with either black or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
coloured.</p>
               <p>And for a Man that would be an Artiſt indeed,
it were convenient he were furniſhed with divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Campaſſes, beam Compaſſes, and trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
ones, for ſeveral uſes not here to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
but a Country Surveyor may make a
good ſhift with ſuch a plain pair as I firſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
which Mr. <hi>Wynn,</hi> over againſt the <hi>Rolls</hi> in

                     </gap>-lane,</hi> will help him to, with the Chain
and Scales, for a ſmall matter.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Scales</hi> are certain Lines divided into equal
parts, upon plates or broad Rules of Braſs or
Box, and they are of two ſorts, 1. Plain; 2.
Diagonal.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Plain Scales</hi> are made up of two ſmall
Lines parallel to one another at a little diſtance,
and theſe are divided into great equal parts,
which ſignifie Tens, and are noted 10, 20, 30,
40, 50, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the length of the
Lines.</p>
               <p>They may be of any convenient length, but
theſe great diviſions are ſeldom more than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or leſs than third parts a piece.</p>
               <p>Again, one of the great Diviſions (or parts)
is ſubdivided into ten equal parts by ſhort Lines,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33569:27"/>
whereof that in the middle ſtanding for 5 is
longer than the reſt.</p>
               <p>According to the Numbers of theſe little
parts contained in an Inch, the Scale is named
<hi>A Scale of</hi> 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, &amp;c. <hi>in an
Inch.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fi. </seg>13</label> That ſhort one which I give you the
Figure of at A is of 10 in an Inch, ſo noted at
the top, according as is uſual upon Rules, and
Indices of plain Tables. The Line marked OQ,
ſeparates Unites and Tents; Unites being
taken upward from that Line, and Tens down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
mixt Numbers both ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 is the extent of the Compaſſes upon the
Scale A from the Line OQ to K; 30 is their
extent from the Line ſo marked to OQ; and
27 is their extent from the Line 20, to the ſhort
Line K aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Here note, that you muſt not expect to find
the Letters OQ or K upon the Scales which
you buy, being only marks uſed at pleaſure, to
make my meaning plain; and likewiſe that this
Scale of 10 in an Inch, and others that are ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
(all being compoſed after the ſame manner)
are uſually made for more convenient uſe, ſo
long as to contain nine or ten (the more the
better) of the great Diviſions, ſignifying Tens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though the Figure at A being deſigned for no
other uſe than to help your conceptions, extends
but a little beyond 30, that length being ſufficient
for my purpoſe in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:33569:28"/>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fi. </seg>14</label>
Theſe plain Scales, eſpecially the ſmaller
ſorts of them (ſuch as 24 or 30 in an Inch) are
very proper for drawing Figures upon paper,
where the Numbers repreſented by the Lines
are not above 100 (for then every Diviſion
may be counted as it is upon the Scale) or above
upon a long Scale.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the ſurveying of Foreſts, Chaſes,
and great Commons, where the Lines are vaſtly
long, and the miſtake of a few Links (yea, of
half a Pole) is not conſiderable, they may be
conveniently uſed, accounting the Tens and
Unites to ſignifie ſo many whole Chains, and ſo
eſtimating the parts of a Chain with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
upon the ſmall Diviſions, which a ſagacious
Man may do very near upon one of the larger
Scales. But it were much better, in my opinion,
for ordinary meaſuring, if the grand Diviſions
on the Scale were two Inches a piece, as I have
one upon the Index of my plain Table) for
then the ſmaller Diviſions being of five in an
Inch, would be ſo large as to be ſubdivided into
five apiece, which repreſents 20 Links; and
then the half of one of thoſe ſmaller Diviſions
ſignifying 10 Links, and the quarter 5, a very
ordinary judgment may come very near to the
truth by eſtimation.</p>
               <p>2. But the <hi>Diagonal Scale</hi> is ſo well known to
every Mathematical Inſtrument-maker, ſo eaſie
to be procured, and every ways ſo fitted to <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Chain, and our Countryman's uſe, that I
cannot but highly commend it.</p>
               <p>Of theſe Diagonal Scales, there are two ſorts,
the Old and New.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33569:28"/>

By the Old one, I mean ſuch as is to be
found in Mr. <hi>Leybourn</hi>'s Book, whereof I ſhall
preſent you with a fragment, with ſuch a deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
as may enable you to underſtand the
whole.</p>
               <p>1. It is made (as appears by the Figure B)
upon eleven parallel Lines equidiſtant, ſo as to
include ten equal ſpaces, which are all cut at
right Angles by Tranſwerſe Lines dividing them
all into four equal parts.</p>
               <p>2. One of theſe Tranſverſe Lines <hi>(viz:</hi> PR)
where it toucheth the firſt and laſt Lines, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
between the Hundreds (or whole Chains)
and the Tens, (repreſenting 10 Links apiece)
the Chains being numbred <hi>downwards</hi> on the left
hand from P only to 3, but on the Inſtrument
it ſelf they may go on to 9 or 10, (the Rule
being a Foot long) but the Tens (or Decads)
<hi>upward</hi> from P to 10.</p>
               <p>3. From the Points of Diviſion into Tens
upon the firſt Line beginning at P, to the like
Points beginning at R in the laſt Line, are nine
Diagonal Lines drawn, the firſt beginning at P,
and ending at the firſt Diviſion above R. The
ſecond beginning at the firſt Diviſion above P,
and ending at the ſecond above R. In a word,
they are all drawn from one Diviſion leſs from P,
to one more from R; by which it comes to paſs,
that every Diagonal, by that time it hath paſſed
from the firſt Line to the eleventh is a whole
tenth part of an Inch (which anſwers to ten
Links of the Chain) farther diſtant from the
Line PR, than at the Point upon the firſt Line
whence it was drawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:33569:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fi. </seg>14</label>
4. Every one of theſe Diagonals is divided
into ten equal parts by the long parallel Lines
running through the whole Scale, and numbred
on the top from 1 to 9. Whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Interſection of any of the nine
parallel Lines that are numbred at the head with
any Diagonal, muſt be farther diſtant from the
Line PR, than the Interſection of the Line
next before it with the ſame Diagonal by
of that is, by which anſwereth
to a ſingle Link of your Chain.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, and inſpection of
the Figure B, theſe things plainly follow, which
as ſo many clear inſtances will help you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it fully.</p>
               <p>1. The diſtance from PR to the ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
below it anſwereth to two Chains.</p>
               <p>2. The diſtance from PR to the eighth Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upward being taken (with Compaſſes) upon
the firſt Line of the eleven from P to 8, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to 80 Links.</p>
               <p>3. Conſequently the extent of the Compaſſes
from the ſecond grand Diviſion below P to the
eighth of the leſs Diviſions upward, is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to 2 Chains 80 Links.</p>
               <p>4. The diſtance from PR to the firſt Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
being taken upon the parallel Line noted
with 9 above anſwereth to 9 Links: Where
note, that the firſt Diagonal is not that which is
noted with 1, but that which is drawn from the
point P.</p>
               <p>5. The diſtance upon the ſame Line from PR
to the Diagonal that is marked with 7, is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to 79 Links.</p>
               <p>

6. The extent of the Compaſſes from the

the ſame Diagonal, anſwereth to 3 Chains 79
Links.</p>
               <p>Briefly whole Chains may (by Analogy) be

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 0 Acres, 1 Rood, 7 Perches, as here
is plain.</p>
               <p>There be other ways of Computation by
Scales, Tables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that this is ſound and
demonſtrative, I come now to ſhew by theſe
following Steps.</p>
               <p>1. It is evident, that in this way of Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
the Product is ſquare Links; for every
Chain being 100 Links, it is all one to multiply
7.25 by 7.25, or 725 by 725 without pricks,
for the pricks ſignifie ſomething as to Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but nothing at all in Operation. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
therefore of the firſt Example was really
525625 Links.</p>
               <p>2. Every Chain being 4 Perches long, it
follows, that 5 Chains (or 20 Perches) in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33569:32"/>
length, and 2 Chains (or 8 Perches) in bredth,
make an Acre, or 160 ſquare Perches; for 20
being multiplied by 8, gives 160.</p>
               <p>3. From hence it plainly followeth farther,
that there are exactly 100000 ſquare Links in an
Acre; for 5 Chains multiplied by 2, is the
ſame with 500 Links by 200, which makes
100000. And he deſerveth not the name of an
<hi>Arithmetician</hi> that is ignorant of this old plain
Rule, <hi>When the Deviſor conſiſts of 1 and Cyphers,
(as</hi> 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, &amp;c.) <hi>cut off
from the right hand ſo many Figures of the Dividend
as the Deviſor hath Cyphers, accounting them the
Remain; ſo ſhall the reſt on the left ſide be the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</hi>
It is plain then that 525625 ſquare Links
make 5 Acres, and 25625 ſquare Links over.</p>
               <p>Thus I have made it clear to a very ordinary
capacity, that as far as concern Acres, the
Rules for Computation are good. Now for
Roods and Perches, though I might turn off
my Reader with that known Rule in Decimal
Arithmetick: <hi>Multiplying Decimal Fractions by
known Parts, gives thoſe known Parts in Integers,
due regard being had to the ſeparation.</hi> I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in my plain way thus: If 25625 ſquare
Links, which remain above an Acre, do contain
any quarter or quarters of an Acre; then if they
be multiplned by 4, and divided by 100000,
(that is, five cut off from the Product) they
will contain ſo many Acres as now they do quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(or Roods), for any number of quarters
multiplied by 4, muſt needs produce the like
number of Unites or Integers, and the Diviſion
doth only reduce them into the right denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33569:33"/>
Now 25625 being multiplied by 4, and
five Figures being cut off from the product, the
reſult is, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>02500, that is an Acre and above;
which ſhews it was above a quarter before it
was multiplied by 4.</p>
               <p>And to find how much, (that is, how many
ſquare Perches are contained in this laſt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
you muſt conſider this 2500, not as ſquare
Links remaining above the Rood or Quarter,
but as fourth parts or quarters of ſquare Links;
or (which is all one) as the true number of
ſquare Links multiplied by 4, and conſequently
being multiplied by 40, (the fourth part of ſquare
Perches in an Acre) it muſt as often contain
100000 ſquare Links (or an Acre) as the quarter
of this number 2500, <hi>viz.</hi> 625, ſignifying
ſquare Links, containing ſquare Perches; and
ſo it doth, for 100000 divided by 160 (the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Perches in an Acre) gives 625 as anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to 1 Perch; and 2500 multiplied by 40,
gives 100000, or 1 Acre; the five Cyphers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cut off as here is manifeſt.</p>

beforegoing to meaſure a plece of
land, to plot it, and to caſt up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p>All Cloſes, or parcels of land, are either ſuch
as need not to be plotted for finding out their
true meaſure, but the Chain alone doth the
Work; or ſuch as cannot be conveniently mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
without plotting or protraction.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt ſort are the Square and long
Square, known before-hand to be ſuch, or found
ſo to be by ſuch Inſtruments as I have not yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33569:34"/>
deſcribed, or by meaſuring all the Sides and
Diagonals. Theſe Squares and long Squares (I
ſay) need no protracting, for you need only
to multiply the Chains and Links of the length,
by the Chains and Links of the bredth, and ſo
proceed as in the firſt and ſecond Examples of
the fifth Chapter: But all others, whether
Triangles or Triangulate, are to be protracted.
I ſhall give Examples therefore in the 3 ſorts
of Figures, triangular, quadrangular, and mult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to particular Inſtances,
let me adviſe the young Practitioner thus:
Remember,</p>
               <p>1. To begin at ſome notable Angle of the
Field, where there is ſome Houſe, Gate, Stile,
Well, or the like; or if there be none, then
to dig up a Clod, drive down a Stake; or at
leaſt, to obſerve what quarter of the Heavens
it pointeth towards, whether Eaſt, Weſt, North,
or South, and on your Paper mark it with the
Letter A, or any other.</p>
               <p>2. To go parallel to the ſide of the Field, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Pits, Buſhes, or the like, hinder not, (and if
they do, to allow for it) accuſtoming your ſelf
to go either <hi>cum Sole,</hi> that is, with your left
hand towards the Hedges, Walls, or Pales; or
<hi>contra Solem,</hi> with your right hand towards them;
and when you go contrary to your uſual cuſtom,
note it on your paper by ſome mark known to
your ſelf.</p>
               <p>3. To ſet down the Chains and Links of every
ſide as you meaſure them, and not to truſt your
memory. A Black lead pen will be very proper
for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:33569:34"/>
4. To take heed (if you have more Scales
than one upon your Rule) leſt you confound your
ſelf by taking lines off of ſeveral Scales, or
meaſuring perpendiculars upon wrong ones;
for every line of the ſame Figure muſt be made
by the ſame Scale, and the perpendiculars mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by it.</p>
               <p>5. To make uſe of a Scale of larger Diviſions
when you meaſure ſmall Cloſes, and of ſmaller
when you meaſure great ones.</p>
               <p>6. To make your lines and points where An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
meet, ſmall, pure, and neat.</p>

               <p>1. How may the Center be found? 2. How
may ſuch a portion of Land be truly protracted
and computed?</p>
               <p>To the firſt I anſwer, that the moſt exact and
artificial way is by making a Mark any where
in the Arch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Point C; and then (by a Problem
known not only to every Surveyor, but to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Carpenters and Joyners, for finding the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Circle, whoſe Circumference will paſs
through 3 given points that are not in a right
line as ACB) to find the Center O. But if you
know not how to do it ſo, croſs the Line AB in
the middle, as here it is done by the Perpendicular
OC, ſo you may by a few trials find both the
due extent of your Compaſſes, and the point in
the Perpendicular that will fit your purpoſe near
enough; for if a little errour be committed in
making up the Sector, the moſt of it goes off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the ſubſtraction of the Triangle.</p>
               <p>II. For the latter you may take this ready
courſe: Meaſure the length of both your Lines,
(the Chord and the Arch) and their diſtance at
the middle of them both. Then when you
come to protract, firſt take the length of your
right Line from the Scale, and having laid it
down, croſs it in the middle at right Angles
with a dry Line as in the laſt Figure, ſo ſhall it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33569:38"/>
interſect the Line AB in the point E; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>19</label> then
from the ſame Scale take the meaſured diſtance
between the two lines in the middle, and ſet it
upon that dry line from the Interſection at E to
the point C. Then by trials find a due place in
the dry line OEC, and ſuch a diſtance with
your Compaſſes, that the one Foot reſting in
that line, the other may deſcribe the Arch ACB,
and the Section is protracted.</p>
               <p>Theſe few hints are as much as I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for my Country Practitioner concerning
circular lines; but if he think otherwiſe, there
are large Treatiſes enough, and particularly thoſe
I mentioned, whoſe Rules (though ingenious,
ſound, and fit to be known by every one that
intends to plunge deep into Mathematical Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
will not (I think) be of that uſe to him
in ordinary meaſuring, that I ſhould tranſcend
the intended bounds of brevity to tranſcribe

               <p>WHereas the Statute-Perch or Pole is 16
Feet and a half, and no more, there be
Poles of larger meaſure uſed in many places, as
of 18, 20, 21, 24, and 28 Feet, yea in ſome
22 Feet and a half. It were therefore very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that our young Surveyor were furniſhed
with a Chain fitted to the cuſtomary meaſure of
the Country where he lives, as I uſe to make
Chains for my ſelf and Scholars of 21 or 24
Feet to the Pole for <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> where
thoſe Meaſures moſt obtain. But becauſe theſe
are too large and cumberſome for ſmall Cloſes,
it is very convenient, inſtead of one Chain of
100 Links, to make two of 2 Poles apiece,
each Pole divided into 25 Links as that of 100
is, which two half Chains may in meaſuring
large Fields be tied together by the Loops with
Pack-thread, or joyned by a buttoning Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for more ſpeedy diſpatch; but in ſmaller
we may uſe the half Chain of 50 Links, only
taking care that we count not half Chains for
whole ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33569:39"/>
And in theſe caſes where the Poles are large
and the Cloſes ſmall,<note place="margin">☜</note> it were ſtill more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
if you had a Chain of 2 Poles only, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into 100 Links: Only you muſt then take
notice, that whereas working by whole Chains
and Links, the firſt Multiplication, after five
cut off, gives the Content in Acres and Parts.
The like work by half Chains and half Links
will give the Content in Roods or quarters of
Acres, and parts of ſuch Roods.</p>
               <p>But though it is no hard matter (for one that
can find out the length of a Link by dividing the
number of Feet in a Chain by 100, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
himſelf of good Iron-wyre, and Curtain
Rings to make it of, and a ſharp edged File,
and round noſed Plyers to make it with) to be
furniſhed with ſuch a Chain; yet becauſe every
one cannot do this, I ſhall ſhew you how you
may eaſily and yet very truly reduce Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure
into cuſtomary, that ſo the Chain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſcribed may do your buſineſs all <hi>England</hi>
over.</p>
               <p>Know therefore (for a ground to go upon)
that Acres bear proportion to one another, as
the ſquares of their Poles; and therefore if you
multiply 33, the number of half Feet in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-pole
by it ſelf, which gives 1089, and alſo
multiply the number of half feet contained in a
Pole of that meaſure you would reduce into; in
the ſame manner you may by the Rule of Three
reverſe obtain your deſire, making to that
purpoſe 1089 the firſt number, the Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure
the ſecond, and the ſquared half-feet
of the Pole given the third. As for example:

before I cut off any Figures, I

But if the lines on the land had been mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
according to our cuſtom here, of 24 feet to
the pole, and the Content muſt have been found
according to Statute meaſure; then I muſt have
multiplied the product by 2304, and have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that latter product by 1089<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in the
ſame method you may proceed in all or any of
the reſt. But the truth is, that though this way
be very exact, plain and comprehenſive, ſuting
all the cuſtomary meaſures before-mentioned
without fractions, which for my Learners ſake
I ſtudiouſly avoid, and for that reaſon reduced
my poles to half-feet: It is ſomething tedious
except he knows how to relieve himſelf by a
large Table of Logarithms, or at leaſt a ſet of
<hi>Nepair</hi>'s-bones, which I cannot ſtand here to treat
of: Therefore to contract the work a little,
take notice, that all the cuſtomary poles before
mentioned, (ſaving only thoſe of 20 and 28
feet, which I ſuppoſe are ſomewhat rarely uſed,
becauſe I never heard nor read of them (to my
remembrance) ſave only in Mr. <hi>Holwel;</hi> all
the reſt I ſay, are capable of being divided into
half-yards: And therefore if inſtead of ſquaring
the half-feet you ſquare the half-yards of both
poles, and work with them, you will attain the
ſame end without any regardable difference,
the ſmall diverſity that there is being uſually in
the uſeleſs remainders, not at all affecting the

               <p>If I had ſquared 11, the number of half-yards

               <head type="sub">How a man may become a ready Meaſurer
by Practice in his private Study, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ones aſſiſtance or obſervation, till
he deſign to practice abroad.</head>
               <p>THis Art above all parts of the Mathematicks,
is burdened with two Inconveniences to the
young Practitioner: The neceſſity of having
one to aſſiſt him in meaſuring his Lines with the
Chain, as oft as he would practice his skill, or
get more, and the expoſing of his unreadineſs
to the view of meddleſom people, while he is
yet raw and unexperienced, as every one muſt
needs be at firſt: Both which may in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
be avoided by this eaſie knack.</p>
               <p>Take a ſmall Packthread, and by knots about
half Inch aſunder divide it into an 100 parts, as
<hi>Gunter</hi>'s Chain is divided; So ſhall theſe ſmall
diviſions between the knots anſwer to Links;
and if they be not exactly of one length, the
matter is not very weighty, but the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
and ſhort they are, the better. Having
this String thus prepared, and marked with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and ſhorter pieces of thread tied in the
knots, ſo as you may readily ſee where is the
middle, and where your diviſions of 25 Links,
and the ſmaller diviſions of 10 links begin and
end; make all ſorts of Figures in your Study or
Chamber, by marking places, or ſticking Knives
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33569:46"/>
or Bodkins at pleaſure for Angles, accounting
the ſtreight lines betwixt them for ſides, and ſo
meaſure the Figures by your knotted ſtring, and
caſt up the Content by a Scale. This Work
you may manage with your own hands in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and ſo make your ſelf very quick and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
when you begin to meaſure for good and all;
as I once made a full experiment, and it was
thus:</p>
               <p>When I firſt began to inſtruct Youths in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Learning in <hi>Warrington,</hi> ſome of my
Boys Parents deſired a ſenſible demonſtration of
their Sons proficiency in ſomewhat that they
themſelves could in ſome meaſure underſtand;
and particularly pitched upon meaſuring a Piece
of Land: Whereupon I took four or five of my
Scholars to the Heath with me, that had only
been exerciſed within the Walls of the School,
and never ſaw (that I know of) ſo much as a
Chain laid on the ground: and to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spectators, and eſpecially of a skilful
Surveyor then living in the Town, they went
about their work as regularly, and diſpatched it
with as much expedition and exactneſs, as if they
had been old Land-meters.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <head type="sub">How to meaſure a piece of Land with any
Chain of what length ſoever and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
divided; yea with a Cord or Cart-Rope,
being a good Expedient when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
are not at hand of a more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
make.</head>
               <p>IF you can procure a Chain, and find it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
as before hath been ſhewed, but into
Feet or quarters of Yards, or any ſuch vulgar
diviſions, make no reckoning of the diviſions at
all, but meaſure it as exactly as you can to find
out the true length of the whole Chain, and if
it fit none of thoſe lengths mentioned in the 8th
Chapter, nor any of their halfs, make it to fit, by
taking off a Link or two, or piecing it out with
a ſtring; then dividing the length of that Chain
by 100, or the half of it by 50, find the true
length of a Link according to our artificial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
and having got a long ſtick or rod, ſet as
many of thoſe link-lengths upon it as it will
hold; Then may you meaſure all the whole
Chains by your regulated Chain, and the odd
links of every line by your divided ſtick or rod,
as is manifeſt in this Example following.</p>
               <p>Being far from mine Inſtruments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
by a Friend to meaſure him a Cloſe, I
procure a pair of Compaſſes, an ordinary Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
Rule of two foot, divided into Inches and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33569:47"/>
quarters, and meeting alſo with a piece of an
old Chain ſeemingly divided into feet, I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
it by the Rule, and finding it to be 45 feet
long, and ſome odd meaſure, I piece it out with
a pretty ſtrong Cord that will not ſtretch much,
to 48 feet exactly; then it will ſerve me for half
a Chain of 24 feet to the Pole: This 48 I mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
by 12 (the number of Inches in a Foot)
and that product being 576, I divide by 50, the
number of links in half a decimal Chain, and the
Quotient is 1166-50 Inches, or 11 Inches and an
half, and an trifle over: So then dividing a long
ſtick throughout into ſuch parts, each containing
11 Inches and an half, beſides the breadth of the
nicks, I am provided of Tools to meaſure Lines
to a Link with exactneſs enough.</p>
               <p>In like manner would I proceed with a Cord
or Rope, having fitted them to ſome known
length or other. And then for protraction it
were eaſie with the Compaſſes to make a plain
Scale of a large ſort, either upon Paper, or an
even piece of Wood; this for once may ſerve a
mans turn well enough.</p>
               <p>Beſides there is a way of meaſuring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars
of Triangles and Trapezia`s upon
the ground it ſelf, ſo as to prevent the neceſſity
of a Scale; for if you have a little Square with
an hole in it, to turn upon the head of a little
ſtick, which you may fix where you pleaſe, as
you are meaſuring the Baſe of a Triangle, or the
Diagonal of a Trapezium, you may by a very
few trials find the place where the one Leg will
be juſt in the Line which you are meaſuring, and
the other point at the Angle from which the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33569:47"/>
Perpendicular falls on it, and then the ſpace
between your Stick and that Angle truly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
is the Perpendicular.</p>
               <p>If you have not ſuch a Square, a ſquare Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
or any end of a Board that hath one right
Angle, and two true ſided, will ſupply the want
of it.</p>
               <p>And now that I am mentioning this way of
meaſuring,<note place="margin">☜</note> I ſhall make bold to add, that this is
a good way, (and as ſuch ordinarily uſed by
that general Scholar and reverend Miniſter Mr.
<hi>Samuel Langley</hi> of <hi>Tamworth</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> whoſe
ancient acquaintance I have long eſteemed both
mine happineſs and honour) to meaſure a
Trapezium thus, though it be protracted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
for by meaſuring the Perpendiculars as
aforeſaid, and obſerving at how many Chains
and Links end the ſaid Perpendiculars meet the
common Baſe, the whole Trapezium may be
truly protracted, without going about it; this
little Square competently ſupplying the place
of an Inſtrument, which is uſually called a Croſs
or Square, made up (as it were) of two ſmall
Indices, like thoſe for a Plain-Table (but much
leſs) with fore-ſights and back-ſights, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one another at right Angles, put together,
and having an hole at the Center, like thoſe
things which here in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> we call <hi>Yarndles,</hi>
being uſed by Country Houſewives in winding
of their Yarn.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning dividing of Land Artificially
and Mechanically.</head>
               <p>WEre it ſutable to my Deſign or Humour to
be copious or curious, I had here a fait
opportunity; for four or five modern Survey-Books
of the beſt Accompt lying open before me,
would tempt me to tranſcribe abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
things; but for reaſons often hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I ſhall confine my ſelf to a few plain things
that will competently do this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>1. To divide a Triangle into any parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
divide the Baſe as the Demand imports;
then ſhall Lines drawn from the Points of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the oppoſite Angle finiſh the Diviſion of
the Triangle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fi. </seg>20</label> AC, the Baſe of the Triangle ABC, being
divided into 12 equal parts, a Line drawn from
the Angular point B to the point 6 divides the
Triangle into two equal parts. 2. Lines drawn to
4 and 8 divide it into three equal parts. 3. Lines
drawn to the Points noted with 3, 6, and 9, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
it into four equal parts; and ſo Lines drawn
to 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, divide it into ſix equal parts.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is very obvious, that if the ſame Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
were ſo to be divided, that the one part
ſhould be double to the other; a Line drawn
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33569:48"/>
from B to 4 or 8, doth the work. Or if it be
required to divide it into two parts, ſo as the one
ſhall be triple to the other, a Line drawn from
B to 3 or 9, compleats the Work. So alſo a
Line from B to 2 or 10 divides it into two parts,
whereof the one is quintuple (or five-fold) to
the other, and a Line from B to 1 or 11, divides
it into two parts, whereof the one is 11 times
as large as the other.</p>
               <p>Further yet, if it were required this Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
ſhould be ſo divided, that the two parts
ſhould in quantity bear proportion, as 5 and 7,
a Line from B to 5 or 7, doth that feat.</p>
               <p>But to deal plainly with you, I muſt confeſs
that ſometimes the Diviſion will be a little more
intricate than thus, yet not ſuch, but that the
ſeeming difficulty may be eaſily overcome, by
obſerving the method wherein I ſhall ſatisfie
the following demand.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a large Triangle of common Land
be to be divided amongſt three Tenants A, B,
and C, according to the quantity of their Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
A having 19 Acres of Land to his Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
B13, and C7, the Baſe of the Triangle
being found by meaſure to be 17 Chains and 27
Links; and the Dem and is, where the Points of
Diviſion muſt be placed in the Baſe, ſo as Lines
drawn from thence to the oppoſite Angle, ſhall
truly limit each mans part?</p>
               <p>To anſwer this, let us add 13 and 07 to 19,
(as in the Margin) and they give 39: So is the
work plainly reduced to the Rule of Fellowſhip;
and therefore to find every mans diſtinct por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we need only to multiply the Baſe by his

From theſe Operations it is plain, that if we
ſet off from the Angular point where the Baſe
begins, 8 Chains 41 Links, and a little above
the third part of a Link upon the Baſe for A,
and where that ends, 5 Chains and 75 Links and 2/3
of a Link for B, and conſequently leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this ſecond diviſion and the other end of
the Baſe 3 Chains and almoſt 10 Links for C;
Lines drawn from thoſe points of diviſion to the
oppoſite Angle, will give each man his due.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid touching the diviſion of
Triangles upon their Baſes,<note place="margin">☜</note> will with a little
variation ſerve for the dividing of all ſorts of
Parallellograms, whether Square, Long-ſquares,
Rhombus's, or Rhomboides's: all the difference
is, that in ſtead of drawing Lines from Points
in the Baſe to the oppoſite Angle, you muſt draw
parallel Lines from Points in one oppoſite ſide
to another, as will be ſufficiently plain by this
one Inſtance.</p>

of the ſecond Chapter to repreſent a Cloſe of ſix
Acres, and I am to cut off an Acre at the ſide
AC, having ſet off the 6th part of the Line CD,
from C towards D, and alſo from A towards N,
a Parallel drawn between thoſe Points, takes
off exactly a 6th part, or an Acre.</p>
               <p>If it be not thought convenient (as in ſome
caſes it is not) to cut off a piece ſo long and
narrow, you may by the Rule of Three find
what other length of any greater breadth will
limit an equal quantity to it. Or you may mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
the breadth by 2, 3, or any other, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the length by the ſame number that you
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33569:50"/>
multiplied the breadth by. Or laſtly, if you
ſet out a double proportion that is 2/6 or 1/3, from
C towards D, and from the Point where it
falleth, draw a Line to the Angle A, you will
have a Triangle equal to 1/6 of the Square
ACDN.</p>
               <p>But to return to Triangles, (the moſt ſimple
and primitive of all Rectilinears, and therefore
the moſt conſiderable in this caſe of partition, as
giving Laws often to the reſt:) It may fall out,
that a Triangle muſt be divided (convenience
ſo requiring) by a Line from ſome Point in a
ſide, ſo as that Line may either be parallel to
ſome other ſide, or not parallel to any. For the
former caſe take this Example following out of
Mr. <hi>Wing. Lib. 5. Prob.</hi> 5.</p>

Laſtly, from E draw the Line ED. So ſhall

               <p>I have now done with the Diviſion of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles,
when I have added theſe three Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements.</p>
               <p>1. You muſt be ſure to take very exactly the
diſtance of every point, where a dividing line
cutteth any ſide, to one of the ends of the ſame
ſide, as in this laſt Figure, the diſtances BE and
AD, which diſtances being applied to the
Scale by which the Triangle was protracted,
will ſhew at how many Chains and Links-end
you are to make your dividing Line on the Field
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. The proportions by which you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
are not always ſo formally given as in the
former examples, but are ſometimes to be found
out by Arithmetical working, as in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a Triangular Field of 6 Acres, 2
Roods, and 31 Perches, muſt be divided, ſo as
the one of the two parts ſhall be 4 Acres,
3 Roods, and 5 Perches, and the other (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently)
1 Acre, 3 Roods, and 26 Perches,
reduce both meaſures into Perches, and the one
will be 765, and the other 306. Their Sum is
1071, which by their common meaſure being
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33569:51"/>
reduced into their loweſt terms of proportion
in whole Numbers, will be 5, 2, and 7, which
ſhews that the Triangle being divided into 7 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts, the one muſt have 5 of thoſe 7 parts,
and the other 2. And obſerve, that it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to find the common meaſure between the
Sum of the terms and either of the terms; the
method whereof is ſhewed in every Arithmetick
Book for reducing Fractions into their loweſt
terms.</p>
               <p>But if my unlearned Reader cannot skill of
that work, he may multiply either of the parts;
(as ſuppoſe 765) by the length of the Baſe,
which we will ſuppoſe to be 8 Chains and 75
Links, or 875 Links: and that product divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by 1071, (the Content of the whole Cloſe
in Perches) gives by the Rule of Three direct,
625 Links, or 6 Chains and 1 Pole, the true
diſtance from either end of the Baſe, that his
mind or occaſions may direct him to begin with,
to the point of Diviſion; for the Diviſion muſt
be not only for proportion or quantity, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as to poſition or ſituation of parts upon the
Paper, as it is required to be on the Ground.</p>
               <p>3. In theſe and all other diviſions of Land,
where a ſtrict proportion in quantity is to be
obſerved, you muſt have reſpect to the Rules
hereafter following, concerning meaſuring of
uneven Ground, <hi>Chapter</hi> 15. eſpecially if one
part prove much more uneven than another:
and if there be any uſeful Pond or Well to draw
your Line of Diviſion through it; but if it be
an unuſeful Pond, Lake or Puddle; or if there be
an boggy or barren ground, that muſt be caſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33569:51"/>
out in the diviſions; meaſure that firſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
it from the Content of the whole Cloſe,
and then lay the juſt proportion of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on that ſide that is free from it, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may have its juſt part alſo, beſides that
which is uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>What hath been ſaid, with an ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of diſcretion, may ſufficiently inſtruct a
young Artiſt to divide Triangles, Parallello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams,
and regular Polygonials, in an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
way: but becauſe many Cloſes and open
Grounds are Trapezia's, and many irregular
Polygons, and even thoſe that are regular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
may fall under an irregular diviſion, in
regard of the quality of the Land, Woods upon
it, or Quarries in it: Or the conveniences of
ways, Currents of Water, ſituation in reſpect
of adjacent Lands, &amp;c. I ſhall propoſe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which though it hath ſomewhat of the
Mechanick in it, will be ſingularly uſeful in ſuch
caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>23</label> Let ABCD be a Trapezium to be divided
betwixt a young Heir and his Mother, ſo as his
part may be double to hers. Having by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal
BC divided it into two Triangles, I
find the Content of the Triangle ABC to be
138550 ſquare Links, and the Triangle BCD
to contain 103468, in all 242018 ſquare Links,
which if reduced, as hath been formerly taught,
would amount to 2 Acres, 1 Rood, and 27
Perches: (for which ſee <hi>Chap. 5.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to my preſent Work, they are in a

two therefore of thoſe third parts muſt contain
161353 and 1/3, which 1/3 being inconſiderable, I
regard not.</p>
               <p>Then reſolving to lay out the double part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Line BD, I ſtrike at adventures the
Line EF, and meaſuring the Trapezium boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by that Line, and the oppoſite ſide BD, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Interjacent parts of the Lines
AB and CD, I find it to contain 119140
ſquare Links, but becauſe it ſhould have been
161353, I ſubſtract 119140, out of 161353,
and their difference is 42213, and perceiving
that the Lines AB and CD are very near pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
and finding their diſtance where they
are cut by the Line EF, to be 326 Links, or
3 Chains and 26 Links, I divide 42213 by 326,
and the quotient is 129 Links and almoſt half,
at which diſtance I draw the Line GH parallel
to EF; ſo ſhall the Trapezium GBDH be
the Heirs part.</p>
               <p>Another way whereby this may be preformed,
is thus: Finding the Triangle ABC, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
138550 ſquare Links, ſubſtract it out of the
Heirs part, <hi>viz.</hi> 161353, the difference 22803,
ſhews how many ſquare Links muſt be taken
out of the Triangle BCD, and added to the
Triangle ABC: Which to perform with all
neceſſary exactneſs; ſuppoſe the ſide or line
BD to be the Baſe, which by meaſure proves
to be 344 Links, or 3 Chains and 44 Links.
Say by the Rule of Three direct, If the whole
Content of the leſſer Triangle, <hi>viz.</hi> 103468,
give 344; what ſhall 22803 give? ſo will the
reſult be 75 links, and ſomewhat more than 4/5 of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33569:52"/>
a Link; for 22803 multiplied by 344, gives
7844232, which being divided by 103468, the
Quotient is 75 84132/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>03468; or (according to
decimal Diviſion) 75.8131, which is (as I
ſaid before) ſomewhat more than 75 Links and
4/5, wherefore extending your Compaſſes upon
the Scale to almoſt' 76 Links, ſet that diſtance
upon the Line BD, from B to I, and draw
the Line CI: ſo ſhall the Trapezium ABIC
be double to the Triangle ICD, within ſo ſmall
a matter as is not worth regarding, though
the Land were a rich Meadow.</p>
               <p>I hope I need not ſtand to tell any man of
ſenſe, that if he pleaſe he may begin with the
leſs part, and take out that: or if there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Partners, he may divide betwixt any one
and all the reſt, (putting their parts together)
and then by the ſame method ſubdivide amongſt
them till each hath his due ſhare; nor to ſpend
many words in telling him he muſt ſubſtract
where he hath by a ſeparating Line at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or by chooſing, out a Triangle, taken too
much. as I added, when I took too little. Nor
laſtly, that theſe methods are not only applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

whatſoever, whether regular or irregular.</p>

I ſhall take occaſion to deſcribe unto him the
Plain-Table, which with Mr. <hi>Wing</hi> I account
the beſt of all fixed Inſtruments: This Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
conſiſts of ſeveral parts.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Table</hi> it ſelf, which is a Parallellogram
of Wood fourteen Inches and an half long, and
eleven Inches broad, or thereabouts, and for
neceſſity may be made by an ordinary Country-workman
of one Board: but for neatneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of carriage, and freedom from warp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is uſually made of three little Boards joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together ſide-ways, with a ledge at each
end to hold them faſt together, and upon the
middle Board a Socket of Braſs fixed with three
Screws, and with a fourth to be faſtned on the
head of a three-legged Staff; of which anon.</p>
               <p>2. A Frame of Wood fixed to it, ſo as a
ſheet of Paper being laid on the Table, the
Frame being forced down upon it, ſqueezeth
in all the edges, and makes it lie firm and even,
ſo as a Plot may be very conveniently drawn
upon it: this is uſually made with Joynts for
more eaſie carriage, but a plain one may ſuffice.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33569:54"/>
Upon one ſide of this Frame ſhould be equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
for drawing parallel Lines both longwiſe
and croſs-wiſe (as occaſion may require) over
your Paper, and on the other ſide the 360 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of a Circle projected from a Center of
Braſs conveniently placed in the Table.</p>
               <p>3. A Box with a Needle and Card, to be fixed
with two Screws to the Table, very uſeful for
placing the Inſtrument in the ſame Poſition upon
every remove.</p>
               <p>4. A three-legged Staff to ſupport it, the
Head being made ſo as to fill the Socket of the
Table, yet ſo as the Table may be eaſily tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
round upon it, when 'tis not fixed by the
Screw.</p>
               <p>5. An Index, which is a large Ruler of wood,
(or rather braſs) at the leaſt ſixteen Inches
long, and two Inches broad, and ſo thick as to
make it ſtrong and firm, having a ſloaped edge,
(by which we draw the Lines) called uſually
the fiducial edge, and two ſights of one height,
(whereof the one hath a ſlit above, and a thread
below, and the other a thread above and a ſlit
below) ſo ſet in the Ruler, as to be perfectly of
the ſame diſtance from the fiducial edge. Upon
this Index 'tis uſual to have many Scales of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
parts, and there might be a Diagonal Scale
if the Inſtrument-maker pleaſe, and Lines of
Chords of ſundry lengths: but if you have ſuch a
Scale as I before deſcribed; you need not to have
them here.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Protractor</hi> is an Inſtrument ſo well
known, and ſo eaſie to be made and procured,
that I ſhall be very brief in the deſcription of it.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33569:55"/>
As it is uſually made, it conſiſts of two parts, a
Scale and a Semicircle, but the Scale is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
part of it, but ſerving (if you be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
provided) for other uſes before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the caſe of Plain-Scales.</p>
               <p>But the Semicircle is more eſſential, and it
may be made of Braſs or other Metal of any
convenient ſize, as four Inches (more or leſs)
for the ſtraight ſid, this Semicircle being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as all others are by two Lines, the one right
or ſtrait, the other circular.</p>
               <p>The right Line is divided in the preciſe middle
by a Point which is in the Center, upon which
the Circular boundary is drawn, and two other
Arches concentrial with it.</p>
               <p>The Center, when the Semicircle goes alone
without the Scale, ſhould be guarded with two
little lips, on each ſide one, or a little loop, for
more convenient turning of the Inſtrument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
upon a Pin fixed in a Paper.</p>
               <p>The arched or circular edge is divided into
180 Degrees or equal Parts numbred by Tens
upon the upper Concentrick Arch, from 0 to
180, and in the lower from 180 to 360. So that
by applying the ſtraight edge of the Protractor

upon a Pin fixed in the Line) that is, with the
Semicircle firſt above it, and then below it,
or contrarily, you may draw a whole Circle by
the guidance of the Arch, or ſet out any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Degrees, as will appear more plainly
hereafter.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Line of Chords</hi> is a Line divided into 90
unequal parts, whereof 60, and the Radius upon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33569:55"/>
which the Circle was drawn, are equal, and the
Diviſions upon that Line are equal to the next
Extent in a right line, of ſo many Degrees from
the beginning of the Quadrant as anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>When lines of Chords are cut upon wood,
'tis both uſual and neceſſary that there be two
Studs of Braſs, the one at the beginning, and
the other at 60 Deg. with little holes for the
feet of the Compaſſes, when you take the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Radius, to preſerve the line from
being wounded by the Compaſſes; and being
thus fenced, it will for need do the work of a
Protractor, but not altogether ſo commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>

               <head type="sub">How to take the true Plot of a Field by the
Plain-Table, upon the Paper that covers
it, at one or more Stations.</head>
               <p>THere are three ways or methods for doing
this work, two more uſual and ordinary,
the third more unuſual and extraordinary, though
now pretty well known to moſt Surveyors, and
in late Books publiſhed. The firſt performs
the work by meaſuring every line from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
to every Angle, and is a very ſure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
way where it can be done, as it ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
may in moſt Cloſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:33569:56"/>
The ſecond doth it by meaſuring only the
Station or the Diſtances, and is very quick, but
not ſo ſure and exact as the other; yet if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by a skilful Artiſt, that knows how to
plant his Inſtrument, ſo as to avoid making acute
Angles unneceſſarily, it will come near enough
the matter in many caſes; as in meaſuring for
Workmen, that take the Mowing or Reaping of
Fields by the Acre, or when Tythes are let at a
ſmall value <hi>per</hi> Acre, as in poor barren Pariſhes
they uſually are.</p>
               <p>The third is the way of Circuition or Peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
the Inſtrument being oft to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Plot to be meaſured about, by
which not only difficult Cloſes, but even the
thickeſt Woods, yea Bogs, Meres, and Pools
of Water, may be plotted, which by neither of
the other methods can be performed.</p>
               <p>In all theſe Methods, two things are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:</p>
               <p>1. At every Angle where there is no perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Mark already, as a Tree, Buſh, Stile,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> one muſt be placed, as a white Paper, or
ſuch like; or elſe ſome one muſt go from Angle
to Angle, and remain there as your Mark to
look at, till you bid him remove to another:
only when Angles are very near you, this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
may be ſpared.</p>
               <p>2. When ever you have occaſion to plant
your Inſtrument more than once, (as it will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fall out in the firſt Method, and ever in
in the two latter) you muſt be ſure it ſtand juſt
as it did the firſt time for ſituation, for which
your Needle if well touched and hung, will be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33569:56"/>
good direction, but is not thought ſufficient
without back ſight and fore-ſight, (by ſome
practical Surveyors:) I ſhall therefore in due
ſeaſon ſhew you that knack. Now for the firſt
Method.</p>
               <p>I. When you go about to plot your parcel
of Land, find ſuch a place in it if poſſible, from
whence you can ſee all the Angles, and in that
place plant your Inſtrument covered with a
ſheet of Paper, and turning it about till the
Needle playing at liberty, hang over the Flower-de-luce,
(or any other notable place that you
make choice of) ſcrew it faſt. Then chooſing
any convenient place in your Paper for a Center,
and to repreſent your ſtation (or place where
you fix your Inſtrument) make a prick with the
ſmall point of your Compaſſes, to which prick
applying the fiducial edge of the Index, (which
is eaſily done if you keep the Point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
reſting in it) direct the Index by the
ſight to all the Angles, and when through the
ſlit or long ſight, you ſee the oppoſite Thread
cut the Mark in the Angle, draw a neat dry
line along the fiducial edge to or from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
then meaſuring from the Inſtrument to
every Angle, ſet the meaſure by a Scale and
Compaſſes from the Center towards the Angle,
upon the line that points at it, making a prick
in the line where the Chains and Links (reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
from the Center) do truly end: then ſhall
Lines drawn by a ſtraight Rule from prick to
prick, give you the perfect plot upon your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which you may divide (as hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhewed) into Trapezla's and Triangles, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33569:57"/>
to find the true Content. To make which plain,
mark this <hi>Example.</hi>

having planted my Plain-Table as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
at a convenient advantage, ſo as to ſee
all the Angles, (as at I) I make a prick to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
my ſtation in the little Circle ☉ marked
with I, upon which laying the fiducial edge of my
Index, and directing the Sights to all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
I draw dry lines toward A, and all the
reſt of the Angles in order from the Center;
and then meaſuring upon the ground from the
Inſtrument to the Angle A, I find it to be 3. 45,
which I ſet (by the help of my Scale) from the
Center to the Point A, and ſo upon all the reſt
according to their due meaſures, and then black
lines drawn from Point to Point, as from A to
B, from B to C, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> limit the true Figure of the
Field according to the Scale I uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> of 400
in an Inch.</p>
               <p>And now before I paſs to further varieties,
let my Reader take notice of theſe following
things.</p>
               <p>1. From henceforth I ſhall forbear (for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
ſake) to take any notice of the meaſures
of lines meaſured from the Inſtrument to the
ſeveral Angles, having ſo often ſhewed how to
meaſure by a Scale.</p>
               <p>2. When I ſpeak of meaſuring from or to
the Inſtrument, I always mean from or to that
part of ground that is perpendicularly under
the head of the Inſtrument, where you are to
draw your Plot, which will ever be encloſed
with the three Legs of your Staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:33569:57"/>
3. That it's uſually the quickeſt way to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
firſt from the Inſtrument to the firſt Angle,
and then back from the ſecond Angle to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
and ſo the reſt in order, ſtill one from
the Inſtrument, and the other to it.</p>
               <p>4. It is no matter at all whether your Plain-Table
be placed towards the middle of a Field,
as was repreſented in this Figure, or at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
as will appear anon.</p>
               <p>5. In all workings by this Inſtrument, you
muſt have a care that the Inſtrument be not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of its due place, till you have finiſhed
the work of the preſent Station; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
caſt your eye now and then upon your
Needle, obſerving whether it continue to hang
directly over the ſame point you ſet it at when
you began your work, and to rectifie your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
if you ſee cauſe. But becauſe all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
have not Needles, and where Needles are,
they are not accounted over-truſty, make uſe of
the following help.</p>
               <p>When you have planted your Inſtrument, and
made a point or prick in your paper, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
your ſtation, ſet the fiducial edge of your
Index to it, and turning it ſoftly about till you
find one remarkable thing or other upon one
ſide of the Cloſe, and another on the oppoſite
ſide as you look through the ſights of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
(which we call fore-ſight and back-ſight)
draw a remarkable Line with Ink, or rather
with a Black-lead Pen quite over your Paper,
which in this Figure is repreſented by the
black line KL: and then if you ſuſpect that by
any accidental jog, or other caſuality, the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33569:58"/>
is any thing removed, you may eaſily try
and rectifie it, by applying the fiducial edge to
the ſame Line, and making uſe of fore-ſights
and back-ſights again, upon the ſame Marks
which you before obſerved upon the oppoſite
ſides of the Cloſe.</p>
               <p>But if there be no convenient place for the
placing of your Inſtrument, whence you may
ſee all the Angles of the Field, more ſtations
muſt be made uſe of thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Fig. </seg>25</label> Let ABCDEFGHIKLMN be a
Field whoſe Angles cannot be all ſeen from any
one Angle, or other place in it: I plant my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
at the Angle A, and if it have a Needle,
I mark what Degree of the Chord it cuts, or
turn about the Table on the head of the Staff,
till the Needle hang over over ſome remarkable
place; (as ſuppoſe the Flower-de-luce) and
ſcrew it faſt; then ſetting up a Stick with a
white paper or cloath on the head of it, where
I intend my ſecond Sation (as here at Q.) I
make a prick or point in my paper, to ſignifie
the point A upon the paper on the Table: to
which point I apply the fiducial edge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,
and when I ſee the white at Q, ſo as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the ſlit, I ſee the thread, cut it, I
draw the Line OP quite through my Paper
with a Black-lead Pen, and then keeping the
fiducial edge ſtill upon the ſame point, and
turning it round by degrees, I look at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
BCDEFLMN, ſtill drawing dry
Lines with the points of my Compaſſes, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the Meaſures from the Station A to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Angle meaſured to or from, as I did in the
laſt Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:33569:58"/>
Then I remove the Inſtrument to the place
of my ſecond ſtation, having ſet up a mark at
A, and laying the fiducial edge to the Line OP,
I turn about the Table upon the head of the
Staff, till through the ſlit of the back-ſight, I ſee
the thread cutting the mark at A, and then
ſcrew it faſt, ſo will my Needle, if a good one,
hang directly over the ſame point that it did
at the firſt ſtation; but however that be, fore-ſight
and back-ſight will do the buſineſs; for
which purpoſe it is good to take back-marks as
well as fore-marks at every ſtation, as was
taught in the Example of a ſingle ſtation, only
taking notice that the back-mark when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
is planted in an Angle, muſt needs be
out of the Field; as ſuppoſe here at O. But to
proceed.</p>
               <p>Having meaſured the diſtance between the
firſt and ſecond ſtation, and finding it to be
7. 10, I ſet it upon the Line OP, from A to Q,
where I make another point to repreſent the
ſecond ſtation, and turning about my Index with
the fiducial edge upon that point, and ſo look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the ſights at the Angles GHIK,
I draw Lines towards them on my Paper, and
having meaſured between every one of thoſe
four Angles, and the Inſtrument, I ſet thoſe
Meaſures as I did the other, with my Scale and
Compaſſes, from Q towards every Angle upon
his proper Line: and then having drawn the
black bounding-lines from A to B, from B to C
and ſo round about the Cloſe, the Protraction
is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>But here to make this Figure yet more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33569:59"/>
let me (according to my uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod)
add ſome Advertiſements.</p>
               <p>1. Sometimes a Station is ſo taken, that you
may meaſure towards two Angles at once, (as
here from Q to G and H) in which caſe you
are to ſet down the Chains and Links where the
firſt Angle falleth, but ſtill be proceeding to
the further Angle, cauſing the remainder of the
Chains at the fore-end to advance beyond the
former Angle, ſo going on with whole Chains
ſo far as you can, to which the odd Links at the
end are to be added.</p>
               <p>2. If at any of your Stations (as ſuppoſe A)
you can ſee an Angle (for example E) to which
you cannot meaſure in a direct Line without
paſſing the boundaries of your parcel of Land
given to be meaſured; you may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
take in that Angle by a ſtrait meaſured
Line, as I have done, provided it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
done without treſpaſs, and conveniently
without troubleſom paſſing of Fences, otherwiſe
it muſt be taken from another ſtation.</p>
               <p>3. I here took one of my Stations at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and the other within the body of the Field,
to ſhew the variety of working taught by other
Authors, and that 'tis no great matter where
you make your Stations, ſo you can ſee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles:
elſe it had been full as convenient to have
taken my firſt Station alſo within the body of
the Field, as ſuppoſe at R.</p>
               <p>4. Though this Figure repreſenteth to
your eye only two Stations, A and Q, your
fancy may multiply them at pleaſure, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Angle H could not have been ſeen from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33569:59"/>
A or Q, how eaſie had it been to have ſet up a
Mark at S, and then to have removed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
thither, obſerving the ſame directions

very much) and the Explanation of that will
ſufficiently help to the underſtanding of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſhall a little explicate the meaning of it in
theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>1. From the firſt Station taken acording to
former directions, I ſee the Angles ABCD
FGK, and acordingly draw Lines upon my
Paper towards them from the point repreſenting
that Station, by the fiducial edge of my Inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
with the point of my Compaſſes.</p>
               <p>2. Having removed my Inſtrument to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Station, (and in ſo doing, obſerved the
Rules before given, touching ſuch removals)
I thence ſee the Angles ABDEFGHIK<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and draw Lines upon my Paper towards them
from the point repreſenting the ſecond Station.
And now viewing my Work, I find upon my
Paper Interfections for the Angles ABDF
GK, but only ſingle Lines toward the Angles
CEHI: therefore.</p>
               <p>3. Removing the Inſtrument regularly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to a third Station, I thence ſee thoſe four
Angles CEHI, and drawing Lines towards
them, I have interfections for them alſo; ſo that
having drawn the Lines AB, BC, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from
one Interfection to another,<note place="margin">☞</note> I have the Field
perfectly protracted. For theſe bounding-lines
from Angle to Angle, do not only ſignifie the
Boundaries of a piece of Land given to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
limiting the Figure or ſhape thereof,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33569:60"/>
(and are to that purpoſe given in this and all
other Survey-books) but alſo are the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
by a Scale from Angle to Angle for the
Plot upon the Paper: I mean by the ſame Scale
by which the ſtationary diſtances were laid down
upon their own lines. And this holds true in
all kind of true plotting, whether in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
or any other.</p>
               <p>III. The third Method is that of Circuition,
and this hath ſeveral varieties, according to
theſe three following Caſes.</p>
               <p>1. When the diſtance from Angle to Angle,
(without any exception) is meaſured quite
round the Plot, either within or without.</p>
               <p>2. When the diſtance is taken only between
ſome more notable Angles, and the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of the reſt meaſured as you paſs along
their Baſes, within the Plot, proper for plain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
ground.</p>
               <p>3. When the like is done without the Plot,
as in the caſe of Plotting thick Woods, Meres,
Pools, Bogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is very eaſie, conſiſting in
nothing but planting the Inſtrument at every
Angle (either within or without, as neceſſity
and convenience determine it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) obſerving the
former directions for planting and removing
the inſtrument; and alſo for meaſuring the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary-lines
on the ground, and protracting

               <p>Then ſetting up a Mark at A (if there was

laying the fiducial edge to the Line AB, I turn
about the Inſtrument upon the Saff, till through

at A, and my Needle (if I have one) directly
over the ſame point, that it was when it was
planted at A, and ſo ſcrew it faſt.</p>
               <p>My next work is to lay the fiducial edge to
the point B, and direct the ſights to C, drawing
a dry Line towards it, and ſetting the diſtance
BC meaſured by the Chain from B to C.</p>
               <p>In this manner I proceed, ſurrounding the
Cloſe till I come at laſt to A, where I began, by
planting the Inſtrument at every Angle, uſing

               <p>There are I confeſs divers other ways of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Work, but none more ſure or plain,
eſpecially if the ground be uneven; for in that
caſe, if you protract according to the length of
Lines meaſured from your Station to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
you will put your Cloſes into unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
ſhapes, except you reduce Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſal
Lines to Horizontal, by inſtruments or
otherwiſe (which is ſomewhat troubleſom:)
and the like may be ſaid when you Plot with
the Chain only. Indeed the Method of meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only the ſtationary diſtances were very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for ſetting out the Figure of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cloſe, provided the diſtance of the ſtations
be large, and taken (if poſſible) upon pretty
even ground, (which ſometimes may be done,
though moſt of the Cloſe be uneven) and the
Work ſo ordered, as not to make too acute An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles:
but becauſe this requireth skill and care,
I rather adviſe my young Artiſt to uſe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling
way, as ordinarily moſt commodious in
my poor judgment, (but not prejudicing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men's that may differ from me in opinion)
and where need requires let him obſerve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in the 17 <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But which way ſoever you go to work,<note place="margin">☞</note> there
is one very neceſſary Rule to be obſerved. If
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33569:63"/>
the Ground be uneven conſiderably, you muſt
not give up the Content by meaſuring the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Perpendiculars of the Triangles on
the Paper by your Scale; but you muſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Lines correſpondent to them on the
Ground, and caſt up the Content according to
that meaſure. And if it be deſired that you
ſhould adjoyn to your Plot (as is uſual) a Scale
of Chains to meaſure diſtances by; you muſt
either by making the Forms of Hills erect and
reverſe, or ſome other Note in writing, mark
out your uneven Ground, leſt thoſe that try it
by the Scale, judge your work erroneous: for
though you make that Scale exactly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
to that you protracted by (as you
ought to do) the Hills and Dales in the ground
truly meaſured, may make a conſiderable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is convenient when you plant your Table
that the Needle hang juſt over the North-point
of the Compaſs under it in the Box; then may
you by the Lines overthwart the Frame of the
Table, eaſily draw two Lines quite through the
Plot, cutting one another at right Angles, the
one pointing at North and South, and the other
at Eaſt and Weſt. And if your skill ſerve you
to make the Two and thirty Points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
upon the place where they interſect, and
to draw the Forms of the Houſes, Woods, and
other remarkable things upon the Demeſn, and
the courſe of Brooks and Rivers running through
it, it will add to your commendation.</p>
               <p>And ſo it will alſo, if you take in ſuch parcels
of Land bounding it, whether common or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33569:64"/>
to other men, as will make your Plot to
look handſomly, like a perfect Square or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
But however that be, you muſt be ſure
to protract truly all Lanes going into it, or
through it, and all Cloſes of other mens mixed
with it; and alſo all conſiderable Ponds, Ways
and Outlets, with the Names of the Cloſes and
quality of the Ground, whether Meadow, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,

               <p>Your judgment will eaſily inform you, that
in ſuch weather we ſhall hardly ſtand to make
our Table neat and formal, but any thing (how
rude ſoever) that we can underſtand, doth the
feat. A Welſh Slate with a ſharp Style, (or
for want thereof, a Black-lead Pen and a ſmooth
end of an hard Board like a Trencher) is more
convenient at ſuch a ſeaſon than Pen, Ink and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
But of all I would commend for expedition
a Red-lead Pen,<note place="margin">☜</note> whereby you may mark out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Angle neatly with one touch upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it ſelf, juſt where it toucheth the Frame, by
help of the fiducial edge, and cloſe by it the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33569:69"/>
length of the Line from the Center to that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle:
All which may be eaſily cleared off by a
wet Sponge or Cloath ſo ſoon as you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.
Or if through the ſpongineſs of the
wood, the head of the Table (which we uſe to
cover with paper) were made a little reddiſh,
what great harm were that? We are forced to
do it more real wrong by the points of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
in the ordinary way.</p>
               <p>Now to protract our Obſervations: I draw
upon a paper the Line AF at adventures, ſo
it be long enough, and ſtick a Pin in it at pleaſure
for the Center O, upon which I place the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Protractor, ſo as the ſtraight ſide (or
Diameter) of the Protractor may juſt lie upon
the Line AF, the Limb or Arched-ſide being
upwards towards B, by help whereof I make
a prick or point on the paper at 76 Deg. 15
Min. for B, and at 157 Deg. 35 Min. for C, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the numbers neareſt to the Limb.</p>
               <p>Then turning the Protractor about on the Pin
with the Arch or Limb down towards D and
E, till the Diameter lie again juſt upon the Line
AF, I number downwards from the right hand
towards the left, by that rank of Figures that
are nearer to the Center, beginning 190, 200,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and over againſt the places where 225 Deg.
20 Min. and 278 Deg. 50 Min. fall, I prick
the Paper at the ſide of the Limb, and
through thoſe four points I draw ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lines, (having laid aſide the Protractor)
upon which and alſo upon the Line AO, I
mark out by Points the true meaſure of every
Line (by a Scale) from the Center, and from
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33569:69"/>
thoſe points drawing the Lines AB, BC, CD,
DE, and EA, I have the true Plot of the
Field.</p>
               <p>Where note by the way, that we eſtimate
Minutes as well as we can both upon the Frame
of the Plain-Table, and the Protractor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
half a Degree, 30 Minutes; a third part,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0; a fourth part, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though by this
means it is impoſſible to avoid ſmall errours, 'tis
eaſie to avoid ſenſible ones; and the like may
be ſaid when we protract by a Line of Chords,
of which I now come to treat.</p>
               <p>Having proceeded in the Field as before, and
made my Table for Lines and Angles, or done
that which is equivolent by a Red-lead Pen, I
draw the Line AF, and having extended my
Compaſſes to the Radius (or 60 Degrees) on
a Line of Chords, I ſet one Foot towards the
middle of the Line AF, and with the other I
deſcribe a Circle like that in this Figure of a
five-angled Field, but much larger, according
to the length of the Radius: Then extending
the Compaſſes from the beginning of the Line
to 76 Deg. 15 Min. I ſet one foot in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection
of the Circle by the Line A, and with
the other foot make a mark in the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Circle upwards towards the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
and through it draw the dry Line BO.</p>
               <p>In the next place I ſubſtract the angle 76. 15
from 157. 35, where the Index cut for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
C, and there reſteth 81 Deg. 20 Min.
which I take off the Line as before, and ſet it
upon the Circumference from the Interſection
by BO, towards the end of the Diameter marked
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33569:70"/>
with F, and through the Point were it falleth,
draw the dry line CO.</p>
               <p>In like manner I ſubtract 157 Deg. 35 Min.
from 225 Deg. 20 Min. and the difference is 67
Deg. 45 Min. which I ſet from the Interſection
by the Line CO downwards paſt the prime
Diameter AF, and through the point where it
falleth, draw the Line DO.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Having ſubtracted 225 Deg. 20 Min.
from 278 Deg. 50 Min. there reſteth 53 Deg.
30 Min. which muſt be ſet downward towards
the left-hand from the Interſection by DO, and
through the point where that falleth, I draw
the Line EO. And now when I have ſet the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Meaſures upon every Line, and drawn
the Boundary lines, as I muſt have done if I had
uſed a Protractor, the Plot is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>But for better aſſurance that I have done my
Work well, I take the meaſure of the remaining
Angle AOE upon its proper Arch, <hi>viz.</hi> from
the Interſection of the Circumference by AF, to
the Interſection by EO, and applying it to the
Line of Chords, I find it to be 81 Deg. 10 Min
as it ought to be, for it ſhould be the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 276 Deg. 50 Min. to 360, and
ſo it is,</p>
               <p>And for further ſatisfaction, I ſum up
the Degrees and Minutes of all the five
Angles, which for plainneſs ſake I have
noted in every one of them on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of the Circle in the Figure ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
referred to, and their ſum is 360,
as it ought to be, and as here is evident.</p>

My Reader may now perhaps expect that I
teach him how to take a Plot at two or more
Stations, when all the Angles cannot be ſeen
from one: But becauſe this is ſo eaſie from the

and in part rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>red unneceſſary by the Method
preſently following, I ſhall content my ſelf to
give this general hint.</p>
               <p>When you have from one Station taken in all
the Angles you can ſee from thence, and then
are to remove to your ſecond Station, do juſt as
you would do if the Table were covered with a
Paper; only it is at your choice, whether you
would guide your ſelf for back-ſight by a Line
that may be rubbed off, drawn upon the Table
it ſelf from the Center to the Degrees on the
Frame along the fiducial edge, or by noting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what Degrees it cuts on either ſide of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the edge paſſing through it, that by the
help thereof and the Needle, the Inſtrument
may be placed in the ſame Line and Situation
as before, for taking in the reſt of the Angles,
if it can be, if not, another Station muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after the ſame manner. But now to my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

This being done, I
haſt under Covert,
and by Subtraction
find 116 Deg. 30 M.
for the Angle B. 137
Deg. 30 M. for C. 67
Deg. 15 Min. for D.
129 Deg. 35 Min. for
E. and 89. Deg. 10 Min. for A, as you find
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33569:71"/>
them on the Figure, and in this Table toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the length of the Lines.</p>
               <p>Note, that there is a way to find the Angles
without Subtraction, if at every Station you
lay the fiducial edge over the Center, and the
Diviſions 180 and 360, turning about the head
of the Inſtrument upon the Staff, till through
the Sights you ſee one of the Neighbouring An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,
for the Index turned upon the Center to
the other Angle, will give you the quantity of
the Angle you are at, but this exact planting
at every Angle is more tedious than the other,
and therefore not ſo fit for wet weather. But
now to protract this Plot:</p>
               <p>Firſt, by my Scale, Rule, and Compaſs, I
draw the Line AB in length 3 Chains, 73
Links, ending at the pont B: then laying the
Center of my Protractor upon the Line AB,
ſo as the Center of it be upon the Point A, and
that end of the Diameter from which the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are reckoned on the Arch or Limb to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
B, I make a point for the Angle A at 89
Deg. 10 Min. by the guidance whereof and the
point A, I draw the Line AE, which according
to my Scale, muſt be 2 Chains, 29 Links.</p>
               <p>In like manner placing the Diameter upon
AE, juſt as it was upon AB, and the Center
upon the point E, I mark out by the Limb (for
the Angle E) 129 Deg. 20 Min. by which I
draw the Line ED, 6 Chains, 64 Links.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I bring the Center of the
Protractor to the point D its Diameter, lying
on the Line ED, and its Limb towards A, by
which I prick out 67 Deg. 15 Min. for the Angle
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33569:72"/>
at D and draw the Line 1 Chain, 88 Links.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Center being at C, and the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
upon the Line DC, in ſuch manner as
before at other Angles, I prick out by the Limb
or Arch 137 Deg. 30 Min. and draw the Line
CB, for at B my Plot ſhould cloſe, and if
rightly done, the Angle at B will be 116 Deg.
30 Min. and the ſide BC 4 Chains 91 Links,
which by meaſure I find ſo to be.</p>
               <p>But if I plot by a Line of Chords, I am not
bound to this Order, but may go from A to B,
and ſo round that way if I pleaſe, which I could
not ſo well do with a Protractor, without reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
my Numbers backward, yet it muſt be
granted that a Line of Chords neither doth the
work ſo quickly nor conveniently, for this is
the way.</p>
               <p>When I have drawn the Line AB of a right
length, I ſet the Compaſſes to the Radius, and
placing one Foot of the Compaſſes in the point
B, and with the other deſcribe an Arch of a
competent length, beginning at that ſide of the
Line AB, that is deſigned to be the inward-ſide,
and upon this Arch, 116 Deg. 30 Min. muſt be
ſet, but becauſe my Line of Chords gives me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
90, I ſet them firſt on from the Line AB,
and then take off the remainder 26 Deg. 30 Min.
I joyn them to the 90 upon the Arch, making
a Point, through which the Line B muſt be
drawn of a due length. In the like manner muſt
I do at CE, but the Angles at A and D need
no ſuch piecing, being capable of being meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out by a Line of Chords at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:33569:72"/>
Nor do your Angles only give you trouble in
this kind of work, but oft-times your Lines will
be found too ſhort to receive the touch of an
Arch upon the Radius, eſpecially if the Line of
Chords be large and your Scale little, and ſo
it may often fall out when you uſe the Protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
upon ſuch ſhort lines as AE and CD of
this laſt Figure: In which caſe a Rule muſt be
applied to them, and they muſt be extended to
a due length that the Arches may meet them
without the Figure. And if thoſe Extenſions
of lines and deſcribing of Arches ſpoil the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your Plot, the matter is not weighty, 'tis
ſo eaſie to be retrieved, for if you lay it on a
clean paper and prick through every Angle,
lines drawn between thoſe points will give you
the Plot neat and perfect.</p>
               <p>One thing more before I cloſe this long
Chapter; the Artiſt ſometimes loſeth his labour
of Protraction through ſome error in the Field,
ſo as his Plot will not cloſe: 'tis therefore
good to know before we begin that work, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will or no; for which purpoſe if we take
a Number leſs by two than the number of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
in the Plot, and thereby-multiply 180,
that Product being found to be equal to all the
Angles, the Plot will cloſe, and ſo it appears
by our Plot in this preſent work: the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier
being 3, becauſe the Angles are 5, and
the Multiplier muſt be two leſs than the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Angles.</p>

               <p>This kind of tryal is grounded upon two
principles of <hi>Euclid</hi> and <hi>Ramus</hi> mentioned in the

that in all plain Triangles, all the Angles taken
together, are equal to two right Angles, and
that the ſides (conſequently the Angle alſo) of
every triangulate Figure, are more by two than
the Triangles of which it conſiſteth: But I think

make the caſe more plain to an ordinary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:
Suppoſe the Line AC to be the unknown
breadth of a River, over which a Bridge of
Boats is to be laid, and the General (that he
may inform himſelf what ſtore of Boats and

me to tell him the true diſtance from A
where he is at preſent, to C a little Boat-houſe
on the other ſide the water.</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie his demand, I plant my Table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a paper at A, cauſing one to ſet me
up a mark at B at a good diſtance from me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

choſen a point to repreſent A, and laid the

C and B, and ſtrike lines towards them. Which
done, I ſet up a mark at A, and from thence
meaſure to B, (6 Chains, 32 Links) and ſo plant
my Inſtrument at B, laying the fiducial edge to
the line AB, and turning about the head of the

my Scale, and ſet it on the Line AB, from A to
B, and laying the fiducial edge to the point B,
from thence direct the ſights to C, and draw
the Line BC, meeting or cutting the Line AC
in C: So ſhall the ſpace AC meaſured on the
Scale <hi>(viz.</hi> 8 Chains, 29 Links be the diſtance
deſired: and becauſe the Chain is 22 Yards long,
if I multiply 8. 29 by 22, the Product is 182 Yards

But perhaps it will be ſaid, that though in
this and all other matters foregoing, I agree
well enough with the learned Authors before
mentioned, and others that have writ of theſe
Subjects; yet in my Country-Almanack for the
Year 1677, the Fourth <hi>Problem</hi> agrees neither
with them, nor what I have here written, but
apparently claſheth with them.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this Charge had been very juſt, had
that <hi>Problem</hi> been deſigned for the <hi>ſame</hi> end, and
produced a <hi>different</hi> effect: (for in ſuch a caſe
to differ is to contradict.) But foraſmuch as in
my very entrance upon it, I began thus. <hi>There
is a</hi> Problem <hi>in ſome Learned mens Works, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the ſame importance with this, but indeed much
different both in the Deſign and Effect:</hi> And after
in anſwering Objections ſhow wherein the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
differs; I cannot but admire the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
of that able Artiſt, who was ſo much at
leiſure as to prove with a great deal of Pomp,
that mine will not attain the end for which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it was never deſigned, as clearly as words
can utter it. A Sword may be a very good one,
yet a very bad Inſtrument to fell Trees with:
But I hear he is dead, and I ſhall rather lament
the loſs of him, and divers other famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
(which Death hath of late depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us of) than unneceſſarily to expoſe the
impertinence of his Paper to the Publick View;
or ſo much as name him to the prejudice of his
Memory. But from henceforth I expect from
all ingenious perſons, that they neither take
for granted what I profeſſedly deny and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove;
nor urge mine Objections againſt my
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33569:87"/>
ſelf, without taking notice of mine Anſwers.</p>
               <p>For underſtanding of what follows, it were
very convenient to have inſerted herein the
whole Diſcourſe in the Country-Almanack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this buſineſs; but becauſe this little Paper
cannot afford it room, I ſhall only point briefly
at the Deſign and Management; and anſwering
all the Objections I ever met with of any ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Importance, make things as clear as I can
in ſo narrow a compaſs. The Deſign was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs
in plain language (ſuitable to Country-mens
underſtanding) this practical Queſtion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are oft concerned; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be
more advantage for the Lender to receive for
100 <hi>l.</hi> in hand, Compound Intereſt at 8 <hi>per cent.
viz. 71 l. 7 s. 7 d. 3 q.</hi> at the end of ſeven years
above the ſtock of 100 <hi>l.</hi> ſuppoſing it can be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
aſſured (as in <hi>Ireland</hi> it may, and in <hi>England</hi>
by equivalence in Goods or Lands, without
mentioning Intereſt) Or to enjoy a Farm for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years in conſideration of 100 <hi>l.</hi> that will
clear him juſt 20 <hi>l. per annum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Anſwer was, that the former was the
better Bargain (and conſequently the higher
Rate of Intereſt for the whole Stock during the
whole term) for which I gave in theſe grounds
under the feigned perſons of <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>A</hi> is to receive (as is ſaid) 171 <hi>l.7 s. 7 d.
3 q.</hi> and if <hi>B,</hi> who takes the Farm, receive not
equivalent, his rate of Intereſts is lower.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>B</hi> receives only 140 <hi>l.</hi> by 20 <hi>l. per annum;</hi>
only he hath the advantage to improve the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
payments from the time they grow due, to
the end of the term.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:33569:88"/>
3. Theſe muſt be computed at ſome certain
rate of Compound Intereſt: For to Compute
them at no rate of Intereſts, or at Simple Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
or one taken up arbitrarily, will not ſute
the caſe.</p>
               <p>4. The Rate tolerated by the Statute, <hi>viz. 6
per cent.</hi> under which none will take, and above
which none dare expreſly bind any to give, and
at which any reſponſible man may be fitted, is
to be preferred before any other.</p>
               <p>5. At this Rate the 7 payments will amount
but to 167 <hi>l. 17 s. 6 d. q.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe 5 Pillars, the 132, and 5 th, were
never attempted to be ſhaken by any that I know
of: What aſſaults have been made againſt the
other two, or deſign of the whole Fabrick, I
ſhall briefly conſider; and I find them (beſides
thoſe anſwered when I firſt publiſhed that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem)
to be theſe three:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ob.</hi> The Queſtion is not at all, how the
Receiver improves his Payments, but what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
was made in the Debtors hands, and
the ſame Rate carried on?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are agreed that the Rate is not
to be computed according to what the Uſurer
actually makes of it. If he gives away, loſes, or
lends freely all the ſeveral Payments: Or if he
make new Bargains more oppreſſive than the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
one; the true value of the loan of ſo
much Mony for ſuch terms, is one and the ſame.
But I utterly deny that it is to be reckoned, as
if the ſame Rate muſt be carried on, and that for
unanſwerable Reaſons (as I ſuppoſe them to be)
laid down in my former diſcourſe, or eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
from it.</p>

1. The Laws of our Nation prohibit upon
ſevere Penalties, the taking of more than 6 <hi>per
cent</hi> therefore that is the utmoſt of the legal
worth, which he that exceeds, runs (as I take it)
the hazard of all, and a great fine.</p>
               <p>2. If he can evade the penalty, no reſponſible
man needs to give more than 6 <hi>per cent.</hi> and few
are willing to give more than they need.</p>

               <p>To make all this plainer (if poſſible) than I
made it at the firſt Publication; Let us for once
ſuppoſe a rare caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>B</hi> a <hi>Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>

hand he could ſo let it: and <hi>A</hi> his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Friend thus accoſts him; <hi>I wonder to bear you
are grown ſuch an Extortioner, as to receive</hi> 20 l.
per annum, <hi>ſeven years together for</hi> 100 l. <hi>B</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
Before you find fault with the Mote in
mine Eye, take the Beam out of your own: You
have bought the <hi>Reverſion</hi> of a piece of Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſeven years for 100 <hi>l.</hi> for which I will <hi>bona
fide</hi> give you 172 <hi>l.</hi> at the time of your Entrance
upon it; which I find by the Rules of mine Art
to be 12 <hi>s. 4 d. 1 q.</hi> above Compound Intereſt
at 8 <hi>per cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> replies, Learned men, ſay ſuch a Bargain
as yours will clear 9 <hi>l. 3 s. 4 d. per cent.</hi> and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>B</hi> rejoyns, 'Tis true they do ſo, but
then they ſuppoſe the ſame Rate to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(for none will ſay, that if the Payments
lie by unimproved, or be let out at an under
Rate, that in ſuch caſes that Rate of Intereſt
can be anſwered) and this ſuppoſition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
impracticable; or (to ſay the leaſt) that
which a rational man cannot depend upon. I did
accidentally meet with this Bargain from the
hands of a weak man, which yet I durſt not
have accepted (the Laws are ſo ſtrict) if it
had been a Rent-charge in Money. And will
you undertake to find me Fools that ſhall at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
years end, take off the ſeveral Payments, yea
and all the increaſe of them as they grow due
upon the ſame terms that I put out the 100 <hi>l.</hi>
upon, and to let me Land for it? If you think
you can, I will make you a great Bargain, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know you to be a punctual reſponſible
man) you ſhall receive the firſt yearly Payment,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33569:90"/>
and at the end of the ſecond year, pay me ſimple
Intereſt for it at 6 <hi>per cent.</hi> as the Statute allows,
and I will inſtantly return it you, together with
the ſecond 20 <hi>l.</hi> which we will joyn into one
Sum, and you ſhall take it at the ſame rate: and
thus we will do every year to the end of the
term, ſtill adding that years growth to what
was before, and ſo keep up all the Accounts to
6 <hi>per cent.</hi> and if you can make any more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
uſe of it, much good may it do you, and I
will heartily thank you to boot, for helping me
ſo readily to place out my ſmall parcels without
loſs. But if you dare not do this, let ingenuity
mollifie your charge, and I ſhall not quarrel
with you about your rate of 9 <hi>l. 3 s. 4 d.</hi> which
perhaps you borrowed (or ſome one for you:)
from Dr. <hi>Newton,</hi> his <hi>Trigonometria Britannica,
P.</hi> 37. for I acknowledge it is that and ſomewhat
more, though not much; but I ſay (which I
deſire you to obſerve) that I receive no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Intereſt after that rate, but only ſimple:
and that not for the whole Sum during the
whole term (as you do compound Intereſt for
all your Stock) but only for the whole 100 <hi>l.</hi> for
the firſt year: for you know that if at the end
of that year 20 <hi>l.</hi> be ſubtracted from 109 <hi>l. 3 s.
4 d.</hi> all the Intereſt is paid, and ſo much of the
Stock as brings it down to 89 <hi>l. 3 s. 4 d.</hi> This
89 <hi>l. 3 s. 4 d.</hi> being computed at the ſame rate
of Intereſt, 20 <hi>l.</hi> abated from it, clears the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
again, and brings down the Stock much
lower: and ſo year by year the Stock is dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled

the Rate were abſolutely exact, as it is near)
