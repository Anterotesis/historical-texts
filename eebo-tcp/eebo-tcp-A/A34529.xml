            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So long as the people are oppressed, they will be discontented: and so long as they are disconteuted, they will fall into Divisions, and so long as they are devided, the easier destroyed. And to this end was the reins cast upon the neck of all corrupt Committee men to cheat by thousands, and hundreds of thousands, and then hire Clarks to Coppy out their Books, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over their cheating, but these were of the better sort of them; for they had some fear in them: but the rest of them hath gone on with as little fear as they had honesty.

truly, when the new overturn shall come, I think the wisest man alive cannot say what party shall be undermost. but this I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of, that Christ will be uppermost; for Antichrist hath had his day, and the Sun thereof is a setting, and the day of Christ is a dawning; therefore let all the Agents of Antichrist know, that they will suddenly know that all their labor is in vain, although they have digged deep to hide their Councel, from the Lord, yea even to the bottom of Hell it self; yet let them know that God is there, and that nothing can he hid from his All-seeing eye: and the woe that God hath denounced against them, shall assuredly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake them speedily: and I cannot but wonder at their blindnes that they do not see the hand of the Lord stretched forth against them, and how he hath made good his promise, that no weapon formed against him shall prosper; for if it could, certainly we had been swallowed up long since.

            <p>Is the Popes Emissaries, would seriously consider the mighty wonders that God hath wrought since these troubles began, it would make them cease to indanger themselves, and to perplex us; for though they have an excellent faculty in fomenting, and continuing divisions amongst us: yet I must tell them, that they do begin their work at the wrong end, for their divisions reacheth but to the creature: and so long as the Creator is not devided, the Trinity is still in unity; for the Father is not against the Son, nor the Son against the Spirit, nor the Spirit against the Father: but they are all one, and do set themselves to carry on one design, which is to advance the Son; therefore until they can work a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision in the Deitie, it is impossible that they should ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their design, and Iam sure God can never be devided in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

            <p>My Lord, the hearts of the people are much rejoyced, to see that greatness could not prevail with you to stifle Iustice for the blood of one innocent man, and doth fil them with hope that you wil not suffer the blood of an hundred thousand men to go unexpiated. The Spirit of God never spake any thing but truth, and that hath told us, that oppression maketh wise men mad, and some of this generation who is so mad as to act to their own destruction, did for a time cease, and would have ceased totally, if they could have seen justice established, but for want thereof did fall to their mad actings again, and were cut off. I do not read throughout the Scriptures, where there are greater promises made to any thing then to works of Justice and Mercy, nor greater Iudgments denounced against any thing than iniustice and oppression: Oh! that thou wouldst hearken to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of thy God! then shal thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the Sea, and thy name shal not be cut off, nor destroyed from before the Lord, but the Lord wil do his pleasure upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his arm shal be upon the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and although the oppressor or the oppressing Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Babylon</hi> should mount up to heaven, and fortifie her self in the heighth thereof, yet from me shal spoylers come unto her, saith the Lord, and the violence which she hath done to <hi>Sion,</hi> and the blood of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shal be upon the inhabitants of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and God wil plead <hi>Sions</hi> cause, and <hi>Babylon</hi> shal become heaps, &amp;c. Oh therefore I beseech you slee out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and deliver thine own soul, and be not cut off in her iniquity, for the time of the Lords vengeance is at hand, and he wil render unto her a recompence; therefore get thee into thine own countrey, for her Iudgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kies, and the Lords device is against <hi>Babylon,</hi> to destroy it. Oh my Lord! I beseech you consider that I desire nothing of you, but what God and this Nation calleth for at your hands, the doing whereof wil so indeer the hearts of the Nation to you, that it wil secure you for the future, the neglect thereof wil set

               </gap>d I am confident that there never was so much sighing and crying of the poor and needy unto the Almighty in any age in the world, as there is at this day. Some may object and say, that I am mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, &amp; that there can be no such discoveries made out, because there hath been several Committees appointed, and little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be made to appear. To which I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Popish An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>And now honored Senators, if there be any love unto Jesus Christ in you, or any longing for his glorious appearing, then put on bowels of compassion towards the poor and miserable oppressed of this Nation; for whatsoever is done unto any of the Members of CHRIST, he taketh it as done unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And I beseech you remember, that your own Posterities are concerned in it, and must ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
