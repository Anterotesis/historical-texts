            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To conclude, It is an <hi>Antidote</hi> of such a <hi>transcendent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> that being <hi>rightly applyed, according to the ensueing Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> it will <hi>translate</hi> a <hi>Creature out of the kingdom of darkeness, into the kingdom of Gods dear Son;</hi> and also <hi>cause</hi> him <hi>there</hi> with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> to <hi>walk with God.</hi>

               <hi>O King, Silver and Gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee;</hi> I <hi>give</hi> it thee <hi>freely, dispose</hi> of it <hi>at thy pleasure, for freely through mercy I received it,</hi> it cost me <hi>nothing that was worth the keeping, I parted not</hi> with so much as one <hi>Mite for it, but that</hi> which for some time was my <hi>daily insupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> which at length <hi>grew so ponderous,</hi> that <hi>it weighed me down,</hi> even to the <hi>very brink of Hell,</hi> the <hi>Horrour whereof, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius-like,</hi> caused me to <hi>forsake my meat,</hi> and also my <hi>sleep to pass from me,</hi> it being a <hi>Mountainous confused Lump</hi> of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, Transgressions and Sins,</hi> the <hi>fruits of my labours</hi> from my <hi>Cradle some forty years</hi> in the <hi>Devils slavery, in which</hi> I was <hi>led captive by him at his will; the parting with which</hi> was my <hi>great gaine,</hi> not only by <hi>lightning my burthen,</hi> but by an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the eyes of my understanding,</hi> to the <hi>beholding</hi> and <hi>lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on him who is invisible.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> O King, <hi>through Grace</hi> I became a <hi>Fannatick,</hi> or <hi>a mad man,</hi> as some call me.</p>
            <p>And now let me <hi>beg thee, O King;</hi> First, <hi>Neither to slight the Gift for the meanness of the Giver,</hi> nor the <hi>Potion, because not compounded by the direction of a Colledge of Phisitians,</hi> that

            <head>An After-Writing TO THE KING.</head>
            <p>MArvel not, O King, at my single-hearted Conclusion, in that I said, I shall neither <hi>Swear</hi> nor <hi>Fight for Thee,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude me <hi>peremptorily Peevish,</hi> nor <hi>factiously Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, because I am so plain:</hi> But by the way know, That in <hi>Conclusion,</hi> Thou wilt find him to be Thy <hi>truest Friend, that dealeth plainliest with Thee,</hi> for <hi>one Dram of down right honesty,</hi> is of more <hi>true worth,</hi> than a <hi>whole Pound of fawning flattery;</hi> for mine own part, although I am by Trade an <hi>Upholdster,</hi> yet know, O King, I come not to <hi>sow Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows under thy Elbows,</hi> I fear thou hast <hi>Artificial Work-men at that work already, and too many too, for thy future good;</hi> but what I have received of the Lord, in the singleness of my heart, and in plainess of speech, I declare unto Thee, Take it as Thou <hi>wilt,</hi> and do <hi>with me for it as Thou pleasest,</hi> the <hi>meaning</hi> of it <hi>I yet understand</hi> uot, but sure I am, I have <hi>more than a common impulse to the Work,</hi> however it will fare with me I matter not, I <hi>both Hope</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> it may <hi>prove</hi> of good <hi>use to Thee:</hi> Therefore I shall beg Thee in Gods fear, to <hi>consider seriously</hi> what Thou <hi>dost,</hi> when Thou shalt <hi>force men to Swear;</hi> for he that will <hi>Fight</hi> for Thee, and he that will <hi>Swear</hi> for Thee, <hi>being thereto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,</hi> will be as ready, <hi>if it stand with his own interest,</hi> both to <hi>Swear</hi> and <hi>Fight against Thee;</hi> for men generally make <hi>little Conscience of keeping constrained Vowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O King, Thou hast been Tutored by <hi>Experience,</hi> the <hi>best Master;</hi> and I need not tell Thee, that <hi>Coustraint</hi> and <hi>Restraint</hi> are two <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streams,</hi> and therefore <hi>dangerous to deal withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Voluntarily</hi> some there are, but others <hi>being thereto forced,</hi> have <hi>already</hi> to <hi>their hearts trouble Sworn against Thee:</hi> And now, if thou shalt again <hi>compel them to Swear for thee,</hi> what is it less than to <hi>ravish their Consciences,</hi> and to <hi>force them most abominably to forswear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? A ready way to pull down Gods Judgements upon the Nation;</hi> for
<pb facs="tcp:44940:6"/>
so saith the Prophet, <hi>Jer. 23. 10. For because of Swearing the Land mourneth:</hi> So also saith another Prophet, <hi>Hos. 10. 4. They have spoken Words, Swearing falsly, in making a Covenant: Thus</hi> Judgement spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up as Hemlock in the furrows of the Field.</p>
            <p>And lest I be found guilty of such a <hi>heinous sin,</hi> I shall <hi>resolve</hi> to <hi>trust</hi> a man upon his <hi>bare word,</hi> rather than <hi>force</hi> him to <hi>Swear;</hi> for he that <hi>for his own Benefit</hi> will not regard <hi>the keeping</hi> his word passed <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to Man,</hi> will for his own <hi>advantage</hi> be as <hi>careless</hi> both <hi>of God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in <hi>slighting</hi> his <hi>unwilling Vow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>in this, O King,</hi> be perswaded to <hi>leave men to their Liberties;</hi> and know, that <hi>Englands Subjects</hi> will be <hi>sooner won</hi> by their <hi>Kings Kindness,</hi> than <hi>brought under by his cruelty:</hi> It is the <hi>Love of Christ that constrains his;</hi> So let thy <hi>Lenity allure thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And be entreated to shake off all <hi>slavish carnal fear,</hi> and cast thy <hi>care</hi> and <hi>burthen upon him,</hi> who <hi>hath hitherto taken such care for thee, Render thou but to him according to his Benefits bestowed upon thee,</hi> and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent I am, that the Keeper of <hi>Israel,</hi> who <hi>neither slumbreth nor sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> will <hi>watch thy Subjects hearts, So,</hi> as that they <hi>shall be kept close to thee; for when a mans wayes please the Lord, he will make his Enemies to at Peace with him.</hi> Prov. 16. 7.</p>
            <p>And think not to make thy <hi>self strong,</hi> by <hi>forcing</hi> thy Subjects to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear themseves,</hi> in <hi>sweariug for thee,</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is <hi>another Reason, O King,</hi> why I <hi>cannot Fight for thee:</hi> And I being a <hi>Branch</hi> in that <hi>Vine,</hi> of which the <hi>Root and Off-spring of David</hi> is the <hi>Root,</hi> and from <hi>whom onely I dayly</hi> through mercy receive <hi>sap, vigour and fresh supplies of Grace,</hi> for the <hi>strengthening</hi> and <hi>supporting</hi> of my <hi>inward man, dare not</hi> have so much as a <hi>thought</hi> to <hi>Swear</hi> thee to be <hi>Supream of that Body</hi> of <hi>which Christ is the Head;</hi> and because the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 9. saith thus, <hi>At what instant I shall speak concerning</hi> a <hi>Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Kingdom,</hi> to <hi>Build and to Plant it;</hi> if it do <hi>evil</hi> in my sight, so that it <hi>obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good wherewith I said I would Benefit it:</hi> This is also another <hi>Reason, O King,</hi> why I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Swear</hi> nor <hi>Fight for thee; for if thy Actings</hi> shall nor <hi>answer Gods End (if his Word be true)</hi> thou must then expect a <hi>removal,</hi> and a <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>

            <p>And by the way know, That <hi>these Resolves</hi> were not <hi>intended to thy self only,</hi> but <hi>also to those</hi> that were <hi>in Power after</hi> thy <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>before thee,</hi> were these things manifested; as by my Declaration in the End of this Book, is evident.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O King, if thou shalt seem to <hi>Counter-mand</hi> my <hi>Loyalty</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> who <hi>bought</hi> me at so <hi>dear a price,</hi> as the <hi>shedding of his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Blood,</hi> Acts 20. 28.

            </p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>O King,</hi> having (I hope) given thee a <hi>Rational account,</hi> of my <hi>down</hi>-right <hi>and single-hearted Conclusion of my Epistle to thee De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated;</hi> I shall now tell thee <hi>in the faithfulness of my Soul,</hi> that by the <hi>Law of the same Law-giver,</hi> I am bound not onely to <hi>pray for thee,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2. but also to <hi>obey thee in all Civil things, that are agreeable to the Mind of God, revealed in his Scriptures of Truth;</hi> and also to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Tribute, Custome, Fear</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> both to thee, as God hath set thee over us, <hi>and to all others sent by thee,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. 1 Pet. 2. 13. <hi>Whose Obedience upon the word of a Christian,</hi> without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>And this is that which was the destruction of <hi>King Herod,</hi> Act. 12. 21. for saith the Text, <hi>On a set day, Herod arrayed in Royal apparel, sate upon his Throne and made an Oration unto his Subjects;</hi> who upon the hearing thereof, began to flatter him; for saith the Text, <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gave a shout, saying, It is the voyce of a God, and not of a Man; and immediatly the Angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the Glory; and he was eaten of Worms, and gave up the Ghost:</hi> had not his subjects <hi>given</hi> him that <hi>flattering Applause, he had not robbed God of his Glory,</hi> and so the <hi>Angel had not smitten him.</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Ahaz</hi> (his Father) <hi>Reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, but he did not that which was Richt in the sight of the Lord, like David his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Chap. 28. 1. for he <hi>walked in the wayes of the Kings of Israel</hi> (which were the wayes of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat, who made Israel to sin) And also,</hi> or over and above their abominations, <hi>he made molten Images to Balaam,</hi> v. 2. <hi>And burned Incense in the valley of the son of</hi> Hinnom, <hi>and burned his Children in the fire, after the manner of the Heathen,</hi> v. 3. <hi>He Sacrificed also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>and into the hands of the Kings of</hi> Israel, <hi>who smote him with great slaughter,</hi> v. 5. Whence we may note, That when <hi>Kings, Rulers</hi> or <hi>Governours, Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of God, God raiseth up Adversaries against them,</hi> as once he did against <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 11. 14. And as <hi>Ahaz continues his mis-actings,</hi> so God <hi>encreaseth his Adversaries;</hi> for the <hi>Edomites also came and smote</hi> Judah, <hi>and carried away Captives,</hi> v. 17. Yet for all this, <hi>Ahaz returned not to bim that smote him; Therefore the</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines <hi>also had invaded the Cities of the Low-Countreyes, and had taken several Towns and Villages, and came and dwelt in his Land,</hi> vers. 18. Whereupon <hi>Ahaz</hi> sends out for help to suppress his Enemies, but all in vain, so long as he <hi>continues an Enemy to God by wicked works. For at that time</hi> Ahaz <hi>sent to the Kings of</hi> Assyria <hi>to help him,</hi> v. 16. <hi>To whom</hi> Ahaz <hi>gave gifts out of the Lords House, and out of the Princes Houses; but they helped him not,</hi> v. 21. <hi>but distressed him,</hi> v. 20. Whence we may further note, That whilst men <hi>continue wicked,</hi> their <hi>Blessings become Curses,</hi> and their <hi>hoped for helps, hindrances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>thus</hi> whilst <hi>Ahaz</hi> is under the sin-revenging hand of God, the saying of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> is in him made good, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will revolt yet more and more.</hi> For <hi>with our first Parents in the Garden,</hi> Gen. 3. 8. <hi>Ahaz runs surther from his God, and returneth not</hi> to <hi>him that smote him.</hi> And with the <hi>fierce dog earnestly snaps at the stone that is thrown at him, little considering</hi> the <hi>hand that threw it.</hi> And <hi>thus</hi> whilst men are <hi>quarrelling at second causes,</hi> they loose both the <hi>Benefit</hi> and the <hi>Blessing</hi> of <hi>Gods chastising hand;</hi> And therefore cannot with <hi>David</hi> (that man after Gods own heart) say, as once he did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 67, 71. <hi>It was good for him</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44940:11"/>
               <hi>that he was afflicted, for before he</hi> was <hi>afflicted he went astray; but now</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have kept thy word. Thus</hi> whilst <hi>David</hi> is making a <hi>Right improvement of Gods chastising hand upon him,</hi> he is made <hi>sensible of Gods faithfulness towards him;</hi> which causeth him thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the same; and to say, v. 57. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me:</hi> He now sees the dealings of God herein towards him to be such, as that he makes that <hi>Sanctified use of it,</hi> as once <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of the Lord <hi>required of Israel,</hi> Deut. 8. 5. <hi>Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a Father chasteneth his Son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.</hi> And so saith our Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5, &amp;c.—<hi>My son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord—For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men lie under the <hi>Chastising hand of God, as Wax and Clay</hi> in the <hi>heat of the Sun,</hi> whose <hi>heat</hi> so <hi>Mollifieth</hi> the <hi>Wax,</hi> as that it becomes <hi>plyable</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> for the <hi>Impression</hi> of the <hi>Seal;</hi> Whilst the <hi>Clay</hi> (though before soft) yet is thereby <hi>hardened,</hi> made <hi>stiff,</hi> and so <hi>brittle,</hi> that it will <hi>rather break,</hi> than in the <hi>least conform</hi> to the <hi>Seal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, it fares with King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> he grows <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse; for in the time of this distress, did he Trespass yet more and more,</hi> saith the Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 28. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>For he Sacrificed to the Gods of Damaskus, which smote him; and he said, Because the Gods of the Kings of Syriah helped them, Therefore will I Sacrifice to them, that they may help me, vers.</hi> 23. <hi>Thus whilst men forsake the true God, they trust on them which by nature are no Gods: And so</hi> become as <hi>senseless,</hi> and as <hi>sottish as they. For they that make them, are like unto them; And so are all they that put their trust in them, Psal.</hi> 115. 8.</p>
            <p>And as if these <hi>mis-actings</hi> of his were not enough to make <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>People sufficiently Miserable;</hi> he <hi>Crowns,</hi> as it were all his former Evlls, with this <hi>tripple Crown</hi> of <hi>Abominations;</hi> First, <hi>he cut in pieces the vessels of the Lords House.</hi> Secondly, <hi>he shut up the Doors of the Lords House.</hi> And Thirdly, <hi>he sets up a false worship in every Corner of Jerusalem, to burn incense unto other Gods, v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Thus whilst men <hi>relinquish</hi> their <hi>knowledge of the true God,</hi> they are <hi>given up</hi> to <hi>blindness</hi> of <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>hardness</hi> of <hi>Heart;</hi> To <hi>commit all Abominations</hi> with <hi>greediness;</hi> for so saith our Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28, 29. <hi>And as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which were not convenient,</hi> being <hi>filled with all unrighteousness,</hi> &amp;c. And thus whilst <hi>Ahaz</hi> is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting sin</hi> with <hi>greedilness, Ahaz</hi> is made <hi>partaker</hi> of its <hi>wages;</hi> for the <hi>wages</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> is <hi>death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. And seeing <hi>Ahaz</hi> will thus

Gods severity against those that have been careless therein: <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Servants of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. who but for <hi>smiting</hi> the Rock, when they should have <hi>spoken to</hi> it, died in the Wilderness, and were not suffered to carry <hi>Israel</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as we may fully understand by comparing the eight verse with 11, 12, 23. to 29. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 12. to 15. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.

And <hi>Joshua</hi> said, Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day; and all <hi>Israel</hi> stoned him, his Sons and his Daughters, his Oxen and his Asses, and his Sheep, and burned them with fire: <hi>The Lord give thee,</hi> O King, <hi>an understanding heart, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider things aright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, <hi>Hezekiah doth</hi> not onely stir up the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> but <hi>also all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and wrote Letters,</hi> Chap. 30. 1. <hi>and made a Decree, and made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that they must come up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>to keep the Passeover unto the Lord; for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
            <p>Whence we may note, That in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Reformation, he <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not</hi> according to what had been their <hi>custom of a long time,</hi> nor to what his <hi>Father before him did;</hi> but according <hi>as it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> according <hi>to the Law of God:</hi> And this is that which <hi>makes</hi> the Work to <hi>thrive</hi> in his <hi>hands;</hi> when he doth <hi>Gods Work in Gods Way.</hi> Therefore let me beg thee, <hi>O King, as thou tenderest thine own good,</hi> now thou art upon thy <hi>Reformation,</hi> to <hi>take Hezekiah</hi> for thy <hi>Pattern,</hi> have the <hi>Word of the Lord for thy Warrant,</hi> see thou do it according to the <hi>written Law of God; for such a Reformation onely will stand, and thou with it:</hi> But if thou do it according to the <hi>former customs,</hi> and what thy <hi>Father did before thee,</hi> thou sawest <hi>that fell, and him with it:</hi> for what is of man, will come to nothing, but if it be of God, it cannot be overthrown, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 38, 39.</p>

               <hi>admired-at giving out of the Spirit,</hi> Acts 2. 14, 15. We are not <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks</hi> or <hi>mad men,</hi> as ye <hi>suppose</hi> in so saying; <hi>but this is that</hi> which was spoken of by the Prophets, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Many shall run to and fro, and Knowledge shall encrease;</hi> for saith the Prophet, <hi>Haba.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The Earth shall be filled with the Knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea:</hi> Therefore be sure, O King, thou have, <hi>Thus saith the Word of the Lord,</hi> for thy <hi>Warrant;</hi> for God is a jealous God, and will not be served with any thing, but <hi>what is of his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>this did Hezekiah throughout all Jndah, and wrought that which was good,</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> and <hi>truth before the Lord his God; and in every work that he began in the service of the House of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandments, to seek his God, he did it</hi> with all his heart; and saith the Text, <hi>He prospered,</hi> Chap. 31. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Whence we may note, <hi>That whilst Hezekiahs heart was upright to God, God prospered him;</hi> and thus we find in Holy Writ, <hi>That whilst men with a perfect heart, have a careful eye in all their undertakings to please God, God hath a tender eye over them to prosper them:</hi> And thus whilst <hi>Joseph</hi> is answering his lustful Mistris, with a <hi>How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?</hi> Gen. 39. 9. Though <hi>Joseph</hi> by her revengeful malice be cast into Prison, <hi>yet God is with him, v.</hi> 21. <hi>And God gives him favour in the eyes of the Prison-Keeper, insomuch that the Prison-keeper looked not after any thing that was under his hands;</hi> and the Reason is added, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>Because the Lord was with him; and that which he did,</hi> the Text saith, <hi>The Lord made it it prosper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus whilst <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Babylonish captivity, is <hi>resolved in his heart not to defile himself with a portion of the Kings Idolatrous Meat, nor of his wine,</hi> God <hi>bringeth Daniel iuto</hi> Favour <hi>and</hi> tender Love <hi>with the Prince of the Eunuches,</hi> Dan. 1. 3, 9. <hi>Insomuch that</hi> the Eunuch <hi>will venture his head to the King</hi> his Master, rather than <hi>Daniel</hi> shall <hi>want that food he desires,</hi> V. 10, 14.</p>
            <p>A good encouragemant for the People of God in the very worst of times, even to take up a Resolution, to <hi>eye God in what he would have them to do in all things, and not</hi> at all to <hi>fear the faces of men, though never so great;</hi> for if <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> will not bow to <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, but keep themselves <hi>close to their God,</hi> God will <hi>keep as close to them; and one like the Son of Man shall walk with them in that seven times hot fiery Furnace, to preserve them,</hi> Dan. 3. 16, 25. Will <hi>Daniel</hi> Petition <hi>no other but the true God, though against the Decree of the King? that God will send his Angel, to shut</hi>

            <p>Theresore suffer me to bespeak thee and thy People, O King, in the Language of <hi>Azariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Obed,</hi> which he once uttered to King <hi>Asa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 1.

            <p>And let not the King be angry, if one that is counted a Fannatick speak once more to him, not in his own Language, but in the words of the Spirit of the Lord, in the Prophet <hi>David</hi> to his Son, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of thy thoughts; if thou seek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</hi> Thou knowest, O King, thou hast <hi>had a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off,</hi> and that <hi>that</hi> casting off may not be for ever; be perswaded to turn to thy God <hi>with all thy heart.</hi>

            <p>We usually say, That he that would <hi>move another to weep,</hi> must <hi>first cry</hi> himself, he must <hi>first begin the passion;</hi> thus God hath done, God hath <hi>begun a Work,</hi> God hath <hi>first troden a Path</hi> for thee, O King, to walk in, God hath made a <hi>Return</hi> to thee <hi>most miraculously,</hi> and far (I presume) beyond thine own <hi>Expectation,</hi> or the <hi>Imagination</hi> of <hi>many</hi> others; therefore, O King, <hi>Prepare to meet thy God,</hi> have a care thou walk not in any <hi>By-Path,</hi> but <hi>onely and alone in that Path of Returning,</hi> which God hath <hi>troden for thee;</hi> and as God hath been <hi>Miraculous</hi> in <hi>his Returning to thee,</hi> O be thou as <hi>Eminent in thy returniug to him; this</hi> is that which I am confident the <hi>Lord looketh for</hi> at thy hands; for so saith the Lip of Truth it self, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. <hi>For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required;</hi> and the <hi>same voice</hi> hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord in my Text, <hi>But Hezekiah rendred not again according to the Benefits bestowed upon him; therefore wrath fell upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that I may come to the handling the words themselves, I shall briefly shew what God did <hi>for Hezekiah,</hi> that caused him to look for so <hi>suitable a return from Hezekiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After these things, and the establishment thereof,</hi> Chap. 32. 1. That is, After the <hi>Reformation that Hezekiah</hi> had made, as I have in part laid down, and as in the three foregoing Chapters is more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered; <hi>Aster these things, and the establishment thereof, Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi>

               <hi>King of Assyria, came and entered into Judah, and Encamped against the fenced Cities, and thought to win them to himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may note, That though men <hi>walk</hi> never so <hi>close with God,</hi> yet they cannot be <hi>exempted</hi> from the <hi>malicious endeavours of wicked men: David</hi> we know, is Recorded in holy Writ, to be a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> who in the <hi>Confidence of his Soul,</hi> sometimes can say, The <hi>Lord is on his right hand,</hi> he <hi>shall not be moved,</hi> Psal. 16. 8. And <hi>anon</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 8. he begs of the Lord, to <hi>hide him under the shadow of his Wings,</hi> from the <hi>wicked that oppress him,</hi> and from his <hi>deadly Enemies: Now he will not fear what man can do unto him;</hi> And <hi>anon,</hi> he <hi>cryeth out, That one day he shall fall by the hand of Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good men are at an uncertainty of quietness,</hi> or <hi>tranquility, on this side the grave:</hi> If the Sons and Daughters of God had <hi>too much Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Peace in this life,</hi> they would <hi>then</hi> begin to <hi>settle upon the Lees,</hi> and <hi>satisfie</hi> themselves with that which <hi>cannot profit: God knows what is fitter for his, than they do themselves;</hi> and therefore it is that he <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> his <hi>dearest Children</hi> to <hi>undergo great Tryals,</hi> and that for several Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, for the Tryal of their Faith, according to that of <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>I will not,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>drive out any of the Nations which Joshua left when he died;</hi> and the Reason is added: That <hi>through them</hi> I may <hi>prove Israel, whether they will keep the Way of the Lord, to walk therein, as their Fathers did keep it:</hi> therefore saith the Text, <hi>The Lord left those Nations, without driving them out hastily, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered he them into the hands of Joshua,</hi> V. 23. according to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>That the Tryal of your Faith being much more precious than of Gold that perisheth, though it be tryed with fire, may be found unto Praise, and Glory, and Honour, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second Reason may be, for the <hi>encrease of their Graces,</hi> according to that saying of the Apostle, <hi>James</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Knowing that the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of our Faith worketh Patience;</hi> and therefore the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>glory in Tribulations, knowing that Tribulation worketh Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience Hope; and Hope,</hi> saith he; <hi>maketh not ashamed,</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>A third Reason may be, because <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> being <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved,</hi> worketh good to a Soul to <hi>Eternity;</hi> and so saith our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>For our light Affliction, which are but for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh for us a far more Exceeding and Eternal weight of Glory; whilst we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44940:18"/>
               <hi>not seen; for the things which are seen, are Temporal; but the things which are not seen, they are Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further, God by these Actings keeps a Soul <hi>close to himself,</hi> and thereby gives it opportunities continually, either <hi>to Pray,</hi> or <hi>to Praise him, for Deliverances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this <hi>Invasion,</hi> together with the <hi>abominable Blasphemies</hi> of <hi>Sennacherib, drives Hezekiah to his God;</hi> and so saith the Text, <hi>For this cause, Hezekiah the King, and the Prophet Isaiah, Prayed</hi> and <hi>cryed to Heaven,</hi> vers. 20. <hi>Men that walk close with God in time of Prosperity, can with boldness go to God in time of Adversity, with an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured confidence of a gracious Answer:</hi> Hezekiah <hi>and</hi> Isaiah <hi>no sooner Pray, but Speed;</hi> and <hi>another opportunity is now put into their hands, to return again with Praises in their mouths, to the Throne of Grace; for the Lord sent an Angel to cut off all the Mighty men of Ualour, and the Leaders and Captains in the Camp of the King of Assyria: So he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with shame of face to his own Land; and when he was come into the House of his god, they that came out of his own bowels, slew him there with the Sword,</hi> V. 21.</p>
            <p>Whence we may note, <hi>That when Gods People cry to him, there is no staying the raising an</hi> Army <hi>or</hi> Money, <hi>or the Making or Providing Ammunion;</hi> but when they are in a <hi>Suffering condition,</hi> they <hi>dispatch</hi> a <hi>Messenger to Heaven</hi> in a <hi>moments time,</hi> to the <hi>Captain of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> who <hi>himself was made perfect through Sufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. And such a <hi>Messenger who can</hi> neither be stayed by the way, nor his <hi>Message intercepted,</hi> even the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> who will tell the truth of <hi>their Cause,</hi> and help their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and <hi>express</hi> their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with groans that cannot be uttered;</hi> and he that searcheth <hi>the heart, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 26, 27. <hi>God is a free Agent, and cannot be limitted to any means, but acteth how, when, and which way he pleaseth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Isaiah no sooner Pray, but an Angel is as soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched into the Camp of Sennacherib;</hi> (<hi>for are they not all Ministring Spirits sent forth to Minister for those who shall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14.) And this Angel destroyes his Mighty men, Captains and men of Valour: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> we see spake truth, when he <hi>encouraged the People, saying, Be not dismayed at the King of Assyria; for there is more with us than with him; with him there is an Arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord</hi> our God, to help us and <hi>to fight our Battels,</hi> ver. 7. and 8.</p>
            <p>Happy it is <hi>then</hi> with the People of God, <hi>when</hi> they can <hi>trust God for their Deliverance;</hi> and observe that Word of Command from the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44940:19"/>
Captain of their Salvation, Mat. 24. 6. <hi>Then when they shall hear of Wars, and rumours of Wars, Nation against Nation, and Kingdom, against Kingdom, that then they be not troubled;</hi> but can take that <hi>good Advice</hi> that once <hi>Moses</hi> gave to <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 13. Even <hi>to stand still</hi> and see <hi>the Salvation of God, which he will work for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Angel finisheth his work with <hi>speed,</hi> which causeth <hi>Sennacherib</hi> with <hi>shame</hi> &amp; <hi>Confusion of face,</hi> with speed to return into his own Land.</p>
            <p>Whence we may note, That whilst men <hi>depend</hi> upon an <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>flesh,</hi> upon every Defeat, their spirits are more or less <hi>dejected:</hi> whilst he that <hi>trusteth in the Lord, is not afraid</hi> of <hi>evil Tidings;</hi> for <hi>his heart</hi> is <hi>fixed,</hi> Psal. 112. 7.

many times maketh their nearest Relations to become their greatest Enemies: for it is in <hi>vain</hi> for men to <hi>fight against Christ;</hi> it is hard for them to <hi>kick against the pricks;</hi> yet <hi>thus inconsideratly do all those that fight against his People,</hi> and <hi>he looketh upon it as done to himself;</hi> for so saith the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> Acts 9. 4.

            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> in a most miraculous manner, &amp; <hi>without effusion</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> God, on <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> part, <hi>delivered Hezekiah</hi> &amp; the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and guided him on <hi>every side: And thus God hath done for thée, O King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was one <hi>great Cause why God expected</hi> an <hi>answerable Return</hi> from <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and to me it seems as a Reason, <hi>Why thou, O King, shouldst render to the Lord according to his Benefits bestowed on thee;</hi> seeing God <hi>thus,</hi> or in such a <hi>miraculous manner,</hi> hath wrought such a <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> for <hi>thée</hi> and <hi>thy Friends,</hi> without <hi>blood-shed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that God did for <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was, He <hi>recovered</hi> him from a <hi>mortal distemper;</hi> for so saith the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>In those dayes Hezekiah was sick to the death, and he prayed unto the Lord, and he spake unto him,</hi> and he gave him a Sign. This Text is but an abstract of what we have fully laid down to us, in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 1. The which Texts we must have some recourse to, if we intend to have a full discovery of what God did for <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in 1 Kings 20. 1. The Text saith, <hi>In those dayes Hezekiah was sick unto death, and the Prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thy House in order, for thou shalt dye, and not live;</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah turned his face towards the Wall, and prayed unto the Lord, and said, Remember now O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight; and Hezekiah wept sore. And it came to pass after Isaiah was gone out into the middle Court, that the Word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of my People; thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy Father, I have heard thy Prayers, I have séen thy Tears; Behold, I will heal thee, on the third day thou shalt go up to the House of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many things there are in this Passage worthy Consideration;</hi> and the first thing that I shall <hi>take notice of,</hi> is, <hi>That Hezekiah was sick unto Death, and he must</hi> set his House in order, for he <hi>must dye,</hi> and <hi>not live;</hi> yet <hi>Hezekiah prayed</hi> unto the Lord, and he <hi>healed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may note, That <hi>many</hi> of the <hi>Resolves</hi> of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sons and Daughters of men, are not <hi>absolutely peremptory,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44940:20"/>
but many times <hi>conditional;</hi> for yet forty dayes, and <hi>Nineveh shall be destroyed;</hi> yet when <hi>Nineveh repents,</hi> God <hi>repents</hi> of the evil he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against them, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 4, 5, 10. And thus saith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy</hi> it; <hi>if that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil; I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> And <hi>at what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to Build and to Plant it; if it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the Good wherewith I said I would Benefit them.</hi> So also saith the Lord to <hi>Ely</hi> (upon the misdemeanor of his Sons) by that man of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. <hi>I said indeed, that thy House, and the House of thy Father should walk before me, for ever; but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me;</hi> for them that <hi>honour me, I will honour;</hi> and they that <hi>despise me,</hi> shall be <hi>lightly esteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now know, O King, that God is about to <hi>Re-build</hi> and to <hi>Plant Thee and thy People again,</hi> and if thou and they shall <hi>answer God in acts of Obedience,</hi> and do that which is well-pleasing in his sight, he then will <hi>go on</hi> to perfect what he hath <hi>begun:</hi> but if Thou and thy People, and in especial this <hi>proud, Prodigal, vain-glorious,</hi> and <hi>most voluptuous City,</hi> that hath all this while sate as a Queen, and known no sorrow, shall not <hi>answer God in his Expectations;</hi> then be it known to <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> that God will <hi>repent</hi> him of the <hi>good</hi> he intended both to <hi>thée</hi> and <hi>them;</hi> and as he <hi>overturned</hi> thy <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>those that overturned him,</hi> and hath been for some considerable time, <hi>overturning, overturning, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning</hi> in this Land of thy Nativity; so know, O King, that he is as able to <hi>overturn thée</hi> as <hi>them,</hi> without thou and they make to him suitable Returns; <hi>for of a truth, God is no respecter of Persons, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation,</hi> he <hi>that feareth him and worketh Righteousness,</hi> is <hi>accepted of him,</hi> Acts 10. 34, 35. Therefore in Gods fear consider thy Actings.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayes, and God heals: And thus whilst the <hi>Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, the Prayer of the upright is his delight,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. <hi>And Hezekiah turned his face to the Wall, and said, Remember I beseech thee, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He onely</hi> is likely to thrive at the Throne of Grace, <hi>who</hi> in his appeals to God can plead the uprightness of his heart, and the sincerity of his Soul; and whilst some are questioning, <hi>how God doth know, and whether there be Knowledge in the Most High?</hi> Psal. 73. 11. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is earnestly begging the Searcher of all hearts, <hi>before whose eyes all things are naked and open,</hi> to remember the Actings of his former dayes. Happy it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44940:21"/>
with thy Soul, that in his <hi>sickness,</hi> can plead with God <hi>the good Actions of his health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whilst <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is praying to the Lord, the Lord shews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be what in the Scriptures of Truth he is Recorded to be; even <hi>a God hearing Prayers,</hi> Psal. 65. 2. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> must experience him to be such a one; <hi>For saith the Lord, Go, tell Hezekiah the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of my People, I have heard his Prayers, I have seen his Tears.</hi> God is a tender-hearted God, and when his People are moved to <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> upon a right account, he then shews himself a <hi>compassionate</hi> God to them, and this he did to <hi>Israel</hi> of old, when they were in <hi>Egypt</hi> under their hard Task-masters; for <hi>the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my People which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry, by reason of their Task-masters; for I know their sorrows, and I am come down to deliver them,</hi> Exod. 3. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>God is not onely said to <hi>hear the Prayers, and see the Tears of Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> but he is as ready to <hi>help;</hi> for so is his Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me</hi> in the day of trouble, <hi>I will deliver</hi> thee, <hi>and thou shalt glorifie me. A good refuge for all Gods People to flie to in time of distress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here note, God doth not onely raise <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from his Bed of sickness, but he also promiseth to adde fifteen years to his dayes. <hi>Thus he giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he encreaseth strength; even the youth shall faint and be weary, and young men shall utterly fail; but they that wait on the Lord, shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings of an Eagle; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not be faint.</hi> Isai. 40. 31.</p>
            <p>And seeing it is so then, O King, be perswaded to <hi>wait upon God,</hi> that so it may be a <hi>lengthening out</hi> of thy <hi>Tranquility;</hi> question with thine own Soul, <hi>whether God hath not added to thy dayes;</hi> remember with thankfulness <hi>the Hollow Oak, with all Gods Transactions towards thee in that juncture of time, when an Arm of flesh failed thee at</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester; not forgetting <hi>thy safe Passage in that little Vessel that Rides in thy constant view;</hi> and when thou lookest on that, suffer me to be thy Remembrancer, to perswade thee, that with <hi>thankfulness</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> thou <hi>remember whence thy Deliverance came;</hi> and that thou give to God a suitable return, for that I am confident God expects from thee; and withall seriously to consider the <hi>sad Consequences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:</hi> For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rendred not again according to the Benefits bestowed upon him, but his heart was lifted up; <hi>therefore wrath was upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God doth not onely promise to <hi>heal Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>to add fifteen years to his dayes;</hi> but further he <hi>giveth him</hi> (according to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44940:21"/>
a <hi>Sign,</hi> and such an one, the like of which neither before nor since was known; for <hi>most miraculously</hi> he <hi>alters</hi> the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> for the <hi>Sun who like a Bridegroom coming out of the Chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to run a Race,</hi> Psal. 19. 5. is by the great Power of God <hi>called back again</hi> fifteen Degrees.</p>
            <p>Whence we may take notice of the <hi>great Condescention of the great God,</hi> for the <hi>satisfying</hi> his <hi>faithful ones.</hi> And this was his dealing with <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judges 6. who <hi>requires a Sign, that the Angel talked with him,</hi> v. 20. <hi>And the Angel put forth</hi> the end of his <hi>Staff that was in his hand,</hi> and touched the flesh, and the unleavened cakes that <hi>Gideon</hi> had provided, <hi>and there arose fire out of the Rock,</hi> and consumed them.</p>
            <p>And again, when <hi>Gideon</hi> by Gods Appointment was to relieve <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> from the hands of the <hi>Midianites, Amalekites,</hi> and the Children of the East, that were gathered together in the Valley of <hi>Jezrecl,</hi> Judges 6. 33. <hi>Gideon</hi> requires a <hi>Sign,</hi> if God would deliver <hi>Israel</hi> by his hands, ver. 36. And <hi>Gideon</hi> also propounds his own satisfaction; Behold, saith he, v. 37. <hi>I will put a Fleece of Wool in the Floor, and if the Dew be on the Fleece onely, and it be dry upon all the Earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said;</hi> and saith the Text, <hi>It was so,</hi> v. 38. <hi>For he rose up early in the morning, and thrust the Fleece together, and wringed out of the Fleece a Bowl full of water:</hi> Yet this will not fully satisfie <hi>Gideon,</hi> but he must come to the Lord, as once <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when he petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned for <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 18. <hi>with an once more;</hi> for <hi>Gideon</hi> said unto God, Let not thine anger <hi>be hot against me, I will speak but this once; let me prove I pray thee but this once with the Fleece; let it now be dry one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Fléece, and upon all the ground let there be Dew; And God did so that night;</hi> for it was wet upon all the ground. <hi>It is good then for S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ls to be single-hearted to God, that God may be satisfactory to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having particularly discovered the manner of Gods <hi>merciful dealings</hi> towards <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> I shall now come to the words of my Text; wherein is briefly discovered <hi>Hezekiah's unthankful behaviour to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Hezekiah rendred not again according to the Benefits bestowed upon him, but his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath was upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because the main drift of the Spirit in the Text is, to discover <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> neglect, <hi>in not rendring</hi> to God, and the sad Consequences thereof; I shall therefore first consider what <hi>Rendring is,</hi> before I come to draw any teachable Conclusions from the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rendring,</hi> then simply so considered, is none other, but a <hi>giving</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44940:22"/>
               <hi>to God or Man that which is their due;</hi> for so saith the Spirit, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Render</hi> therefore to all men their <hi>dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour;</hi> as if he should say, <hi>Give freely to God and Man that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them,</hi> according to the saying of the Lord Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Give to Cesar the things that are Cesars, and to God the things that are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is also a <hi>Rendring</hi> spoken of in Scripture, <hi>by way</hi> of <hi>Requital, for some Benefit bestowed,</hi> or <hi>Injury done;</hi> and this is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Rendring,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Recompencing</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting,</hi> as in that of <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 12, 14. <hi>When thou makest</hi> a <hi>Dinner, or a Supper, call not thy Friends, nor thy Brethren, nor thy Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor thy rich Neighbours, lest they also bid thee again, and a Recompence be made thee;</hi>—<hi>But call the Poor, the Maimed, the Blind, and the Halt, and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence or Requite thée;</hi> and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. where Children and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews are required to <hi>requite</hi> their Parents; and 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 15. where it is the Advice of the Spirit, that <hi>no man should render evil for evil to any man.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>And this is that <hi>Rendring</hi> in my <hi>Text</hi> that God expecteth from <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that as he had been a <hi>bountiful</hi> and a <hi>full-handed</hi> God to him; so he expected that <hi>Hezekiah, though a King,</hi> should have had his <hi>mouth filled with his Praises.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rendred not again according to his Benefits bestowed upon him, but his heart was lifted up; therefore wrath fell upon him, and upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

            <p>And first of the duty of a <hi>Subject</hi> to his <hi>Prince;</hi> a <hi>Subject</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said <hi>duely</hi> to <hi>render</hi> unto God, when according to the saying of the Lord Christ, Mat. 22. 20. <hi>He doth give</hi> to <hi>Cesar the things that are Cesars, and to God the things that are Gods;</hi> when he doth that in the <hi>Worship of God</hi> that is <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Mind of God,</hi> revealed in that <hi>plain Directory,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth:</hi> And when accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Rule also he doth <hi>render</hi> to his <hi>Prince Tribute, Custom, Fear</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> according to the direction of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7.

               <hi>God,</hi> when he doth also <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>same Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Directory;</hi> who saith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>He that Ruleth over men, must be just, Ruling in the fear of God.</hi> This <hi>fear of God,</hi> is that which made good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he was <hi>appointed Governour over the Land</hi> of <hi>Judah, neither he nor his Brethren not to eat the Bread of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> Nehamiah 5. 14.

               <hi>Pritnces, Rulers, Governors</hi> and <hi>Magistrates then,</hi> are required to do <hi>tha work</hi> for which they are set up, for they are Gods Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, set up by him for the <hi>due Administration of Justice,</hi> and <hi>not to be a terrour to good works, but to the evil; and are</hi> continually <hi>to attend upon that very thing,</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 3, 4, 6.</p>

            <p>Be <hi>careful</hi> therefore, I beseech thee, O King, of the <hi>Actions</hi> of thy <hi>Subjects,</hi> it stands thee in hand <hi>so to do;</hi> for a <hi>fruitful Land God turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein,</hi> Psal. 107. 34. Yea, and thou maist fare the worse for it too; <hi>For</hi> the <hi>Transgression of a Land, many are the Princes thereof; But by a man of understanding and Knowledge, the state thereof shall be prolonged,</hi> saith the Wisest of the Sons of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28, 2. <hi>O then, in the fear of him that accepteth not the person of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more then the poor,</hi> Job 34. 19. <hi>In the fear of him that leadeth Princes away spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and overthroweth the strength of the Mighty; that poureth contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Princes, and weakneth the Mighty;</hi> that <hi>taketh away</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of the <hi>Chief of the People</hi> of the <hi>Earth, aud causeth them to wander</hi> in <hi>a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, where there is no way,</hi> Job 12. 19, 21, 24. <hi>In the fear of him</hi> that bringeth <hi>Princes</hi> to <hi>nothing, and maketh the Judges of the Earth, as vanity,</hi> Isai. 40. 23. <hi>In the fear of that God, that hath done such great things for thee,</hi> be perswaded for thine own good, to render to him according to his Mercy bestowed, in seeing the <hi>due Administration of Justice without respect of persons;</hi> that so thou mayest <hi>Relieve</hi> the <hi>poor oppressed of thy People,</hi> that of a long <hi>time</hi> have <hi>groaned</hi> under the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Male-Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And know, O King, that as thou art to do <hi>justly;</hi> so thou art required to love <hi>Mercy,</hi> it is that which God accepteth before Sacrifice; for so saith the Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 6. For <hi>I desired Mercy, and not Sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than Burnt-offerings;</hi> for by <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth Iniquity is purged, and by the fear of God men depart from evil,</hi> Prov. 16. 6.

               <hi>Mercy; findeth Life, Righteousness and Honour,</hi> Prov. 21. 21. <hi>A good man is Merciful and lendeth, and his Seed shall be blessed,</hi> Psal. 37. 26. Yea, <hi>Blessed are the Merciful, for they shall obtain Mercy,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. But <hi>he shall have Iudgement without Mercy, that hath shewed no Mercy; And Mercy</hi> rejoyceth <hi>against Judgement,</hi> James 2. 13. The neglect of <hi>shewing Mercy,</hi> is that which caused the wrath of God to burn hot against <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 9. For <hi>thus spake the Lord of Hosts, saying, Execute true Judgement, and shew Mercy and Compassion</hi> every <hi>man to his Brother, and oppress not the Widow, nor the Fatherless, the stranger, nor the Poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his Brother in his heart: But they refused to hearken, and plucked away the shoulder, and stopped their ears that they should not hear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of Hosts,</hi> V. 12.</p>
            <p>Then be perswaded, O King, to <hi>shew Acts of Mercy,</hi> thou hast Objects <hi>enough to exercise it upon;</hi> and know, That <hi>pure Religion and undesiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the Fatherless and Widows in their Affliction,</hi> James 1. 27. <hi>Not to make Fatherless and Widows, to bring them to Affliction.</hi> And in thy shewing Mercy, take the Advice of the Spirit of God, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. <hi>To do it readily, and with Cheerfulness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou hast begun already to tread in this Way, in thy Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, let not the malicious endeavours of any, though never so great, pervert thy steps; for it is one of <hi>Zions</hi> Paths.</p>
            <p>A third thing that is required of thee, O King, is, That as thou art <hi>to do Justly,</hi> and <hi>to love mercy;</hi> so <hi>also,</hi> to <hi>walk humbly with thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it may be demanded, when a person may be said to <hi>walk humbly with God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Answer; A man may <hi>then</hi> be properly said, to <hi>walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with his God, when</hi> he goeth not <hi>before God,</hi> or <hi>without God</hi> in his Actions; but that in all his undertakings, he doth that which is <hi>required of him by God,</hi> in order to his <hi>humble obedience to God,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the <hi>Worship and Service of God,</hi> or in his <hi>Actings towards men:</hi> Thus <hi>Enoch walked with God three hundred years,</hi> Gen. 5. 22. And <hi>Enoch</hi> walking with God, God was so well pleased therewith, as that he <hi>exempted him from the Pangs of Death;</hi> for so saith the Text, V. 24. <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God, and was not; for God took him: Enoch</hi> walked with God <hi>faithfully; for without Faith it is Impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. II. 6. And we find him so <hi>Recorded</hi> in <hi>that Catalogue</hi> of <hi>faithful ones,</hi> Heb. II. 5. <hi>By faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; and</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44940:24"/>
               <hi>before he was translated, he had this Testimony, That he pleased God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Noah</hi> also <hi>walked with God,</hi> Gen. 6. 9. And when a <hi>World of wicked Men and Women,</hi> for their <hi>ungodliness must be drowned; the Lord said unto</hi> Noah, <hi>Come thou, and all thy House into the Ark; for thee have I seen Righteous before me in this Generation,</hi> Gen. 6. 1.</p>
            <p>Thus also <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Father and Mother of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> who walked with God, Luke 1. 5, 6. <hi>who were both righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blameless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I say, To <hi>walk humbly with God,</hi> is to <hi>follow God fully</hi> in <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Laws, Statutes, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Appointments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People of God,</hi> are required to be <hi>Followers of God, as dear Children,</hi> Eph. 5. 1. That as <hi>Children</hi> are to <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Directions</hi> and <hi>Appointments</hi> of their <hi>Earthly Parents;</hi> so <hi>Gods People</hi> should <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Directions</hi> and <hi>Appointments</hi> of their <hi>Heavenly Father;</hi> and should <hi>walk</hi> in the <hi>foot-steps</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> of God, <hi>gone before;</hi> who run <hi>neither before</hi> nor <hi>without God;</hi> but with the Prophet <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. 32. in the <hi>Laws, Statutes, Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Appointments</hi> of God: <hi>Thus they walked humbly with their God.</hi> So that this is that which I would willingly lay before thee, O King; and also beg and entreat thee for thine own good, seriously to consider of, That to <hi>walk humbly with God,</hi> is <hi>not to walk in any way,</hi> but in <hi>that which is well-pleasing to God; in that way which is</hi> by <hi>himself directed, for his to walk in;</hi> for persons <hi>cannot</hi> be said <hi>to be no more Forreigners</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By which means <hi>onely, they grow up an Holy Temple in the Lord, in whom they also are builded together for an Habitation of God, through the Spirit,</hi> ver. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Then consider thy standing, O King, and with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> purge out the filthiness of thy Holy Things, in order to thy walking <hi>humbly with thy God;</hi> in order to thy <hi>Rendring duely to God,</hi> for thy great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received, considering the <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>not Rendring.</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rendred not again according to the Benefit done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for his heart was lifted up; <hi>therefore wrath was upon him, and upon Iudah and Ierusalem.</hi>

            <p>It is good for men <hi>then</hi> in all their undertakings, to do <hi>to others,</hi> as they <hi>would have others to do unto them:</hi> And this is that <hi>golden Rule,</hi> that the Lord Christ himself layes down, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them; for this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> And that he might the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak his People to a strict Observation of this Lesson, he requires them in the first and second verses, <hi>Not to judge, lest they be judged,</hi> for saith he, <hi>with what judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye met, it shall be measured to you again:</hi> The perfect Law of Retaliation.</p>

            <p>Whence I would have all <hi>persecuting spirits</hi> to take notice, That if <hi>Christ at that great day will be so strict upon men, for omitting the doing of that good, that they might have done to the People of God; that he will be far more stricter with them, for doing Acts of violence against them;</hi> for God is very tender of his People, however men esteem of them; and so saith the Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his eye.</hi> God hath been Eminent in his Judgements of late dayes: And therefore let all <hi>persecuting spirits, hear,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>tremble,</hi> for the Lord will appear mightily for his People.</p>
            <p>But to return to our matter: King <hi>Saul</hi> being fully Commissionated for this work of <hi>Amaleks</hi> destruction; and being perswaded to the faithful performance thereof by <hi>Samuel,</hi> upon the account of what Benefits God had done for him; <hi>yet Saul rendred not according to the Benefits bestowed upon him;</hi> and therefore he was looked upon as a <hi>Rebel astainst God,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. in that he saved the best of the Sheep and Oxen, and King <hi>Agag</hi> alive; and this caused God to rend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him, v. 28. And this is that, together with his going to the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> that also cost him his life; for so saith the Text, 1 <hi>Chron. 10. 13. So Saul died for his transgression, which he committed against the Lord, even against the Word of the Lord, which he kept not; and also for asking Counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it:</hi> So that in <hi>Saul</hi> also we see the <hi>Assertion</hi> made good, That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires suitable returns for Benefits bestowed, though from the greatest of Men or Nations; upon the neglect whereof, God punisheth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of Persons.</p>

Go, saith the Lord, and tell this People, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not; make the heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and convert, and be healed.</hi>

of <hi>Nations;</hi> and that not onely upon the account of <hi>multitude,</hi> but also the <hi>greatest Priviledged Nation under the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not spend time to lay down the Reasons of the Point; but in a word shall say what the Lord Christ saith, <hi>Luke 12. 48. To whom much is given, of him shall be much required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I shall come to some Uses, that may be made of the Point.</p>
            <p>For, as Practice is the very life of Profession, So the Uses of a Sermon, being well applyed, become words spoken in season; which the Wise Man saith, Are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 11.</p>
            <p>And seeing it is so, that God requires suitable Returns for Benefits bestowed; upon the neglect whereof, <hi>God punisheth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This then may serve for a Use to great ones; and first, to thy self, O King, to Exhort thee in the Name and Fear of Cod, seriously to consider particularly what God hath done for thee, how God hath preserved thee both abroad and in this Land of thy Nativity; and let me humbly beg thee once again; seriously to consider the <hi>Hollow Oak,</hi> and that little Vessel which rides in thy constant view, and those that were acting in and by them, for thy personal preservation (the which, if report be true, thou hast in a great measure already done, which is very commendable) But this is that, O King, that I am chiefly pleading for, that thou wouldst endeavour to look <hi>through and beyond them, even to the Finger and Power of that God that wrought in and by them;</hi> not only for thy Temporal, but also (if thou beest not wanting to thy self) for <hi>thy Eternal preservation,</hi> if thou dost make <hi>suitable Returns to him;</hi> that so <hi>wrath may not follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpose, consider <hi>every one of thy Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Intentions,</hi> and examine them <hi>before</hi> thou put them into <hi>action,</hi> see whether they tend to a <hi>suitable Returning to God,</hi> for such great Benefits <hi>received from God,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>this, O King,</hi> be the <hi>bent</hi> of thy <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>thy continued practice,</hi> I can <hi>assure thee</hi> from the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> that it will be a <hi>lengthning out of thy Tranquillity;</hi> for so saith the <hi>wisest of men,</hi> by the <hi>assictance</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Spirit, Prov. 16. 7. When a mans wayes please the Lord, he will make even his Enemies to be at peace with him;</hi> and not <hi>onely so,</hi> but thou <hi>shalt also</hi> have a <hi>Benefit hereafter,</hi> and that to <hi>Eternity;</hi> for so saith the Lord by the <hi>mouth</hi> of a King, <hi>Psal. 50. 23. Whoso offereth praise, glorifieth me, and to him that ordereth his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation aright, will I shew the Salvation of God.</hi>

            <p>And secondly, O King, seeing <hi>many Great Ones</hi> in this Nation have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44940:29"/>
had a great share in the Benefits God hath bestowed upon thee; this may serve for a Use of <hi>Exhortation</hi> also to them, to perswade them to consider seriously what God hath done for them in doing for thee; and further to examine what suitable Returns they have already made, and what Rendrings they intend to make to God for such great Benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.</p>
            <p>I desire to urge this the rather, because I see many of their Coaches standing daily, where I fear they cannot duly Render to God according to such Mercies bestowed; and therefore I shall desire to discharge my Conscience to them, in letting them know, That without Holiness no man shall see the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and without Faith it is impossible to please God, <hi>Heb</hi> 11. 6. Which Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 17. and not by Hearing <hi>scurrility</hi> in <hi>Stage-playes, May-games</hi> and <hi>Pastimes:</hi> Consider O ye Great Ones, that are guilty of such actings; and know, that God requires other things from you; and make suitable Returns to God, lest God Return his Judgements with Indignation, and so the last be worse than the first: for we usually say, that Relapses are dangerous, and many times prove worse than the first Distemper.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seeing God requires suitable Returns for Benefits bestowed, though from the greatest of Men or Nations; upon the neglect whereof, God punisheth without respect of Persons.</p>
            <p>This then may also serve for a Use of <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> to this Nation, <hi>considered as a Nation:</hi> And as some have said, <hi>They</hi> (to wit) <hi>the Nation</hi> was a <hi>Body without a Head;</hi> meaning, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>a King;</hi> for the King is the Head, or Supream, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>Samuel</hi> also to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 17. And <hi>Samuel</hi> said to <hi>Saul,</hi> When thou wast <hi>little</hi> in thine <hi>own sight,</hi> wast thou not made the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Tribes of Israel?</hi> And the Lord anointed thee <hi>King over Israel,</hi> &amp;c. So that now, O <hi>England,</hi> thou canst not so Complain, for by a <hi>miraculous hand</hi> thy <hi>Head</hi> is restored to thee again; examine thy self now what <hi>Benefit</hi> thou <hi>hast received;</hi> and also, how thou art <hi>bettered thereby:</hi> Dost thou render to God according to his Benefits bestowed? Art thou grown more Holy than thou wast? Or rather, art thou not grow <hi>openly prophane,</hi> out of a <hi>sense</hi> of Gods <hi>Great Love to thee?</hi> Dost thou rejoyce before the Lord with <hi>trembling?</hi> Or rather, is not thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing such, as that it would and doth, even make a truly Regenerate Soul <hi>tremble to behold it?</hi> Art thou <hi>rendring</hi> to God, for bringing this great Design about without <hi>shedding of blood?</hi> Or rather, is not thy <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> such, as suddenly may cause God to open another <hi>vein</hi> to the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44940:29"/>
Effusion of thy Bloud, even to the Confusion of thy face? Art thou <hi>rejoycing,</hi> that the <hi>Sword</hi> in all visible probability is now <hi>sheathing</hi> again? And is not that <hi>rejoycing</hi> such, that may justly cause God to Command it to run thorow thy <hi>Borders</hi> a second time?</p>
            <p>Art thou <hi>humble</hi> before thy God, O <hi>England,</hi> out of a Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thine <hi>own unworthiness,</hi> and of Gods great <hi>love to thee</hi> in these things? Or rather, art thou not grown more <hi>haughty?</hi> And may not the Lord take up a <hi>Complaint</hi> against thee and thy Daughters, O <hi>England,</hi> as once he did against his People of old? <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 16. and say to <hi>England,</hi> and in special to <hi>London, Because thy Daughters are haughty, and walk with stretched out Necks, and wanton Eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet; therefore the Lord will smite with a</hi> Scab <hi>the</hi> Crown <hi>of the</hi> Head <hi>of the</hi> Daughters of <hi>England; And the Lord will discover her secret parts in that day:</hi> Or when the Lord shall say so to <hi>England,</hi> Then will he take away the <hi>bravery</hi> of their <hi>tinkling Ornaments about their feet,</hi> and their <hi>Cauls,</hi> and their <hi>round Tiers like the Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Braslets,</hi> and the <hi>Mufflers,</hi> the <hi>Bonnets,</hi> and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Leggs,</hi> the <hi>changeable suits</hi> of fantastical Attire; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of their <hi>sweet Powders, a stink;</hi> instead of a <hi>Girdle, a Rent;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of their <hi>crisped and well-set Hair, Baldness;</hi> and instead of a <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macher, a girding of Sack-cloth;</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> instead of <hi>Beauty;</hi> and cause a <hi>second time</hi> their <hi>Men to fall by the Sword,</hi> and their <hi>Mighty in War;</hi> for <hi>England</hi> is full of Distempers; so that God may justly say of her, as once he said of <hi>Israel,</hi> Isa. 1. 6. <hi>From the sole of the foot, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the head, there is no soundness in it, but mounds, and bruises; and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified sores; they have not been closed, neither bound up, nor mollified with Ointments;</hi> for the <hi>Judgements</hi> nor the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>allured</hi> nor <hi>restrained</hi> them from their Iniquities, but to this very day she hath her <hi>Tinpenny of Pride,</hi> being also full of the <hi>Dropsical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> of all Abominations; and yet in a deep Consumption of all <hi>true Piety, Pitty, Penitency, Patience</hi> and <hi>Purity;</hi> by which means she is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very <hi>Perverse, Peevish, Prophane</hi> and <hi>Pittiless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, O <hi>England,</hi> Consider what God after all his <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi> requireth of thee; and for the time to come, meet thy God with suitable Returns, lest God meet thee again, in some or all his three fierce Judgements, <hi>Sword, Pestilence</hi> or <hi>Famine;</hi> either to thy speedy rooting out, or thy Consuming lingring Ruine. Consider what I say, and the Lord make thee wise.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, Seeing it is so, That God requires suitable Returns for Benefits bestowed, though from the greatest of Men or Nations, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:44940:30"/>This then may serve for a Use of <hi>Reproof</hi> to all, from the Highest to the Lowest, from him that <hi>sitteth upon the Throne,</hi> to him that <hi>grindeth at the Mill,</hi> even to the <hi>Hewer of Wood</hi> and <hi>Drawer of Water;</hi> to all that have <hi>received,</hi> and have not duly <hi>rendred,</hi> to such who like the Swine under the Acorn Tree, have greedily swallowed down all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that comes <hi>from,</hi> God, never so much as once looking <hi>to</hi> God, nor to him that sends them; And to say truth, it fares generally with men as with those Leapers, <hi>Luk</hi> 17. 17. where ten were cured, &amp; but one found to return Praise: And indeed it is ten to one, whether men generally know it really to be their duty, or not; therefore I shall commend this Use to all that have not Rendred, and shall let them know in the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> the wise, <hi>That he is in the way of Life that keepeth knowledge; whilst he that refuseth reproof, erreth,</hi> Prov. 10. 17. <hi>For he that hateth reproof is brutish,</hi> Prov. 12. 1. <hi>And shame shall be to him that refuseth Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whilst he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured,</hi> Prov. 13. 18. And therefore I shall desire all, seriously to consider the danger of not Rendring.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rendred not again according to the Benefits bestowed upon him, but his heart was lifted up; <hi>therefore wrath fell upon him, and upon</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>And so I shall pass to the next Teachable Observation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That many times God <hi>punisheth a People</hi> for the <hi>misactings</hi> of their <hi>Governours,</hi> whether in <hi>Church, State,</hi> or <hi>particular Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Proof of which Point, let us consider King <hi>David,</hi> who as to the integrity of his inward-man, was upright before God; therefore we have this Testimony of him, <hi>That he was a man after Gods own heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 14. Yet this integrity of his was accompanied with some imperfections, which caused <hi>Gods wrath to burn hot against his People,</hi> as we may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. For King <hi>David</hi> by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that Enemy of mankind, was moved to <hi>number his People,</hi> by which means the <hi>wrath of God</hi> was kindled against <hi>Israel;</hi> for so saith the Text, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>And again the Anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel;</hi> and <hi>He</hi> moved <hi>David</hi> against them to say, <hi>Go number</hi> Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But here it may be asked, How I prove this to be done by the perswasion of that Evil One, seeing the Text doth not in so many words say so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To which I Answer; The Text in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 41. 1. nor in any other part of the Chapter, doth not in so many words prove it; but if according to the teaching of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 13. <hi>We compare</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44940:30"/>
               <hi>Spiritual things with Spiritual;</hi> the Holy Ghost will make a clear Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; for compare this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. with, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. we shall find this, He that moved <hi>David</hi> in this, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. is that Enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that Evil One, or Satan; for so saith the text, 1 <hi>Chron,</hi> 21. 1. <hi>And Satan stood up against</hi> Israel, <hi>and provoked</hi> David <hi>to number</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But here it may be farther demanded, <hi>What was</hi> Israels <hi>sin? seeing</hi>

                  </gap>, what had</hi> Israel <hi>done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer; <hi>Israel</hi> was not at this time (as we read of) acting in any gross or known sin; yet <hi>Isràel</hi> must be punished: Which proves our Assertion to be true, <hi>That God many times punisheth a People for the misactings of their Governours, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What then was</hi> Davids <hi>sin, may some say?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer; <hi>Davids</hi> sin lay in numbring the People; for so saith the text, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 7. And God was displeased at this thing; therefore he smote <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Was the numbring of the People then the only Cause, that moved God to slay with the Plague threescore and ten thousand? as we read, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, so saith the text, <hi>v.</hi> 17. For <hi>David</hi> said unto God, <hi>Is it not I that Commanded the People to be numbred? Even I it is that have sinned and done evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as for these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be on me and on my Fathers House, but not on thy People, that they should be punished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is it so dangerous a thing then to tell over, or number the People, may some say?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer; That to tell over or number the People, simply so considered, is not sin; for then it were a sin for <hi>Joshua</hi> to number the People, <hi>Josh.</hi> 8. 10. Or to number the Eleven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 26. who were numbred; <hi>For they gave forth the Lots, and the Lot fell upon</hi> Matthias, <hi>and he was numbred with the Eleven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to number the People, so as to put Confidence in an Arm of Flesh; to number the People so as to depart from the Lord, this is an accursed thing; for so saith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his Arm; and whose heart departeth from the Lord:</hi> And <hi>this</hi> I humbly conceive might be <hi>Davids</hi> sin; for if we cast our eye but into 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. we shall find <hi>Joab,</hi> the Captain of <hi>Davids</hi> Host, destroying the Country of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Rabbah,</hi> and slaying <hi>three Giants</hi> in three several Overthrows of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> and the Devil knoweth right well how to make his Advantages.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We may see this Assertion farther proved in the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in those <hi>ten Plagues</hi> that came upon them, for the <hi>hardness of the heart of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh their King;</hi> What <hi>misery</hi> did they <hi>endure in that weeks time of the waters of the Rivers being turned into Blood?</hi> Exod. 7. 20, 27. <hi>What did they endure by reason of the Plagues of Froggs, Lice and Flies?</hi> Exod. 8. 3, 17, 24. in those <hi>Plagues of Murrion</hi> and <hi>Hail?</hi> Exod. 9. 2, 10, 23. in those <hi>Plagues of Locusts,</hi> and <hi>Darkness?</hi> Exod. 10. 4, 22. and in the <hi>Death of all their first-born, both of Man and Beast?</hi> Exod. 12. 29.</p>
            <p>The like we may see threatned against <hi>Israel</hi> of old, by reason of the <hi>misactings</hi> of their <hi>Princes, Judges, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> Micah 3. 9. <hi>Hear, I pray you</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>ye Heads of the House of Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Princes of the House of Israel, that abhor Judgement,</hi> and <hi>pervert all Equity,</hi> v. 10. <hi>That build up Zion with Blood,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem with Iniquity,</hi> v. 11. The <hi>Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Priests thereof teach for Hire, and the Prophets thereof Divine for Money;</hi> like the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>England at this day;</hi> and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>as those of old,</hi> will <hi>lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us, no evil can come upon us?</hi> But though they say thus; What saith the Prophet? <hi>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a Field,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem shall become heaps,</hi> and the <hi>Mountain of the Lords House, as the high places of the Forrest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we may see, That for the mis-actings of Church-men, that teach for Hire, and Divine for Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Zion,</hi> or the Church, shall be <hi>punished, yea plowed as a Field, and laid waste, and the Mountain of the Lords House become as the high places of the Forrest;</hi> As well as for the perverting of Judgement and Equity by the Princes and Judges, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or the Kingdom, shall become heaps; for <hi>there will be a scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Sheep, for the negligence of the Shepherd;</hi> yea, so saith the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>For the Pastors are become brutish, &amp; have not sought</hi>

               <hi>the Lord; therefore they shall not Prosper, and all their Flock shall be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> And so saith the Lord Christ by <hi>John</hi> the Revelator, speaking to the Angel, or the Pastor of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Revelation 2. 5. <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he) <hi>from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy first work, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>As if he should say, Thou art the Light of the Church, and the Feeder of the Flock; the Church or People, are the Candlestick that upholds thee, and the Flock that employes thee, and unless thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thy <hi>deadness,</hi> thy <hi>dulness,</hi> thy <hi>drowsiness,</hi> thy <hi>coldness,</hi> thy <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,</hi> and thy <hi>carnality; I will suddenly remove thy Candlestick, I will soon disperse the flock;</hi> And then, what will become of thee? <hi>who wilt thou feed? who wilt thou light?</hi> Thy <hi>Talent</hi> will <hi>then be under a Bushel, and not on a Candlestick, to give light to those that are in the House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Assertion</hi> we may also see made good in or upon <hi>private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God many times punisheth a People for the misactings of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, whether in Church, State,</hi> or <hi>particular Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Abraham</hi> was journying <hi>into Egypt</hi> with his Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven thither by a Famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. he said unto <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, v. 11, &amp;c. <hi>Behold now, I know that thou art a fair Woman to look upon; therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his Wife, and they shall kill me, but they will save thee alive; say I pray thee, thou art my Sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, that my Soul may live because of thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence by the way we may note; First, That <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>outward distresses</hi> possibly may <hi>attend the dearest of Gods Children;</hi> for we see <hi>Abraham that friend of God,</hi> was driven into <hi>Egypt</hi> by reason that the <hi>Famine was grievous in the Land,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p>And secondly, That <hi>the fear of the loss of life, may stand with the nature of true Faith; for Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of the Faithful,</hi> said, When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> shall see thee, they will say, this is his Wife, <hi>and they will kill me;</hi> therefore say, thou art my Sister.: And <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, a faithful Soul, whose life being laid wait for, <hi>was let down by the Wall in a Basket,</hi> Acts 9. 25. Yea, the <hi>Lord Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self refused to walk in Jury, but walked in Galilee, because the Jews sought to kill him,</hi> John 7. 1.</p>
            <p>But to our Matter, upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> saying, that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his Sister, vers. 19. and upon the Commendations of <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44940:32"/>
Princes, <hi>Sarah</hi> was taken into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> House, and <hi>Abraham</hi> was well entreated by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for <hi>Sarahs</hi> sake, v. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet the Lord Plagued Pharaoh and his house with great Plagues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Sarah, Abrahams Wife,</hi> v. 17. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> sins, and that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly too, in taking <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife into his House; for so saith the Text, v. 18. For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> called <hi>Abraham,</hi> and said, What is this that <hi>thou hast done</hi> unto me? <hi>Why didst thou not tell me she was thy Wife? Why saidst thou she is my Sister? So I might have taken her to me to Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Pharaoh sins,</hi> I say, and <hi>that ignorantly too,</hi> as it is clear he did; yet <hi>his House must be plagued with great Plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence by the way, I would have all to take notice, That <hi>it is not ignorance that will excuse or shroud, neither the meanest nor the greatest of men, from the sin-revenging hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And secondly, That God takes special care for his faithful ones, so as that <hi>he will not respect persons when they evilly entreat them;</hi> for so saith the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 14, 15. <hi>He suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings. for their sake;</hi> saying, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus as <hi>Abraham</hi> was travelling towards the South Countrey, whilst he so journed in <hi>Gerar,</hi> the Lord reproved <hi>Abimelech</hi> also, King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> for his sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. For <hi>Abraham</hi> (again) said of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, she is my Sister; and <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar</hi> sent and took <hi>Sarah,</hi> v. 2. <hi>But God came to Abimelech in a Dreame by night, and said unto him, Thou art but a dead man,</hi> (a sharp Reproof indeed) And he gives him a Reason for his so saying, <hi>For the Woman</hi> (saith he) <hi>which thon hast taken is a mans Wife,</hi> v. 3. Yet saith the Text, <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech had not come near her,</hi> v. 4. <hi>And Abimelech said, Lord, wilt thou stay also a Righteous Nation? Said he not, she is my Sister? and she, even she her self said, He is my Brother; in the integrity of my heart, and innocency of my hands have I done this,</hi> v. 5. <hi>And God said unto him in a Dream, yea I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart, for I also withheld thee from sinning against me; therefore suffered I thee not to touch her,</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p>Whence I would note also by the way; First, That he who is the Searcher of the heart, and Tryer of the reins, takes a <hi>perfect account</hi> of the <hi>bent of the spirits of the Sons and Daughters of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And secondly; That <hi>accordingly he either restrains Souls from sinning against him,</hi> or else <hi>gives persons up to commit sin with greediness;</hi> for so saith the Text, And as they did not like to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; therefore God gave them up to a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44940:32"/>
But this is that in the seventh verse, that makes the Assertion good; <hi>Now therefore</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>restore the Man his Wife, for he is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store her not, know thou, that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that thou hast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like we may see made good in <hi>Achans</hi> Family, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. That when <hi>Achan</hi> had taken of the accursed things, that goodly Babylonish Garment, the Silver, and the Wedge of Gold; the Judgement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not onely to the punishment of himself, but also to his whole Family, and all that was his; for so saith the Text, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>And Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan</hi> the Son of <hi>Zerah, and the Silver, and the Garment, and the Wedge of Gold, and his Sons,</hi> and his <hi>Daughters,</hi> and his <hi>Oxen,</hi> and his <hi>Asses,</hi> and his <hi>Sheep,</hi> and his <hi>Tent,</hi> and <hi>all that he had:</hi> And v. 25. <hi>They burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Lord Christ saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 16. That in the mouth of two or three witnesses every Truth shall be established; and I having proved each Particular in the Assertion by two witnesses at the least; That God many times punisheth a People for the misactings of their Governours, whether in <hi>Church, State,</hi> or <hi>particular Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, lest I make my lines too numerous, I shall forbear to lay down any Reasons of the Point; but shall proceed to some Uses that may be for our present benefit.</p>
            <p>And seeing it is so, That God many times punisheth a People for the misactings of their Governours, whether in Church, State, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Families:</p>
            <p>This then may serve for a Use of Exhortation to thee, O King, to thee, and to all Kings, Princes, and Governours of Nations, Pastors, and Elders of Congregations, and Masters of Families, as they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own good, and the good of those that are under them, that they walk before the Lord, and go in and out before their People in singleness of heart, and in the sincerity of their Souls, as in the sight of God, having a single-eye to the Glory of God, and the good of the Souls that are under their charge, carefully watching over all their thoughts, words and actions, so as that they bring not the Judgements of God upon their people by their misactings; and to be often with the Lord in Prayer, that so they may have his Direction and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all their Enterprises and Undertakings, to the comfort of their own Souls, and the Peace, Benefit and Well-being of those that are under them.</p>
            <p>And secondly, This may also serve for a U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of Exhortation to all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44940:33"/>
Subjects, though they be Pastors, or Elders of Congregations, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families, as well as Members of Churches, or Children, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in particular Families, that they be often at the Throne of Grace in the behalf of their Kings, Princes and Governours; and in special, that <hi>Englands</hi> Subjects be often with the Lord in the behalf of their KING, who from his long Exile and Restraint, is brought again into this Land of his Nativity, which is so full of <hi>Licentiousnes, Luxury</hi> and <hi>Lasciviousness, Revilings, Rendings</hi> and <hi>Tearings, Roarings, Rantings</hi> and <hi>Swearings,</hi> with those <hi>Abominations</hi> of <hi>Stage-Playes, May-games</hi> and <hi>Pastimes, Pride</hi> and <hi>Prodigality,</hi> that God in Mercy would be pleased to direct his Heart so, as that he be not won <hi>either to own,</hi> or <hi>allow of them;</hi> but to <hi>disown, diswade</hi> and <hi>discountenance them:</hi> And that God would farther <hi>strengthen</hi> both his Heart and Hand, to <hi>prosecute</hi> that <hi>lovely, laudable, prudent, pious, Conscientious</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> that <hi>truly Noble</hi> and <hi>most Heroick Princely PROCLAMATION,</hi> by Him issued forth at his first coming amongst us again, and fince by him seconded by another; that so <hi>England,</hi> though <hi>now even a sink of Abominations,</hi> may by the good hand of God upon us, by his <hi>industry, become</hi> as it shall be once said of <hi>Jerusalem, to be a Praise of the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that God would direct him so to consider of his Holy Things, as that he present nothing to God, but what is Commanded by God, that so God may not only <hi>Crown</hi> him with a Crown of Gold here, but also with that Crown of Glory, which shall never fade away.</p>
            <p>And that he be <hi>thus</hi> found Rendring to the Lord, considering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the neglect thereof.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rendered not again according to the Benefits bestowed upon him, but his heart was lifted up; <hi>therefore</hi> wrath was upon him, and upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Thirdly, This may serve for a Use of Exhortation, to Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congregations, and Children, and Servants of particular Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; that they be also constant in this Duty of Prayer, in the behalf of their respective Pastors, Elders, Fathers or Masters, that they may be so directed by divine Assistance, <hi>that as under their Prince,</hi> so likewise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>them,</hi> they may lead a peaceable, a quiet, and a godly life, in all godliness and honesty.</p>
            <p>And so I shall passe to my Third and last Teachable Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That outward Enjoyments do many times so affect the Heart of man, as that they lift them up, even to the forgetting of God, to their own ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44940:33"/>The great <hi>Jehovah</hi> knowing right well the <hi>nature of things,</hi> as he was the <hi>Maker of thom;</hi> and the <hi>temper of Mans Heart,</hi> as he was the <hi>Former of it;</hi> when he caused <hi>Moses</hi> to let <hi>Israel</hi> know the particular Priviledges they should enjoy in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Deut. 8. he giveth them this Caution, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>That when they had eaten and were full, and had built goodly Houses, and dwelt therein, when their Heards</hi> and <hi>Flocks,</hi> their <hi>Silver</hi> and their <hi>Gold</hi> was <hi>encreased,</hi> that then their <hi>heart should not be listed up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the truth of this Assertion we may see verified in <hi>Belshazzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for when <hi>Daniel</hi> was sent for to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Interpret</hi> the <hi>Haud-writing</hi> on the <hi>Wall, to Belshazzar,</hi> Dan. 5. 18. he said, <hi>O King, the Most High God gave unto thy Father a Kingdom, and Majesty, and Glory, and Power; and for the Majesty he gave him, all People, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; whom he would he set up, and whom he would he put down;</hi> as thou dost now, O King: <hi>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardned in Pride, he was deposed from his Kingly Throne, and they took his glory from him, and he was driven from the Sons of Men, and his heart was made like the Beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild Asses, they fed him with grass like Oxen, and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven, till he knew that the Most High Ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may note, That as his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardned in Pride, so it was upon the account of his <hi>high en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,</hi> to the forgetting of God, who dispensed them to him; which we see was the Cause of his casting down.</p>
            <p>The like we may see in <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 1. who after the death of <hi>Amaziah</hi> his Father, was made King of <hi>Judah, And he Reigned in Jerusalem fifty and two years, and he did that which was right in the fight of the Lord:</hi> And V. 5. <hi>He fought God in the dayes of Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah, who had understanding in the Visions of God,</hi> and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to prosper; <hi>And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the Wall of Gath, and the Wall of Jabneh, and the Wall of Ashdod; and God helped him against the</hi> Philistines, and <hi>against the</hi> Arabians; <hi>and the Ammonites gave gifts to him, and his Name spread abroad, even to the entring in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly, and he built Towers, both in Jerusalem and in the Desert; and digged many Wells, for he had much Cattel, both in the law Countrey, and in the Plains; Husbandmen also,</hi> and <hi>Vine-dressers: Moreover, he had an Host of fighting men, that went out to War in Bands;</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:44940:34"/>
               <hi>his chief men or Captains of War, were two thousand and six hundred:</hi> And vers. 15. <hi>He made in Jerusalem Engins of War, made by cunning Work-men, to be on the Towers, and on the Bulwarks, to shoot Arrowes and great Stones withal; and his Name spread far abroad, for he was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously helped, till he was strong: But when he was strong,</hi> V. 16. <hi>his heart was lifted up to his destruction; for he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the Temple of the Lord; and burned Incense upon the Altar of Incense.</hi> And he was struck with Leprosie, and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus whilst Uzzia sought the Lord,</hi> V. 5. <hi>God made him to prosper: But when his heart was lifted up, aud he forgat God,</hi> God left him, and <hi>punished</hi> his sin with a <hi>Disease, that to him proved mortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we note, That when <hi>Uzziah</hi> separates himself from his God, hy forgetting him; God by that Leprosie separated him from the Priviledges of his House, and the Society of men, and <hi>from all things that were the Cause of his hearts lifting up;</hi> for so saith the Text, ver. 21. <hi>And Uzzia the King was a Leper until the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a Leper; for he was cut off from the House of the Lord:</hi> And <hi>Jotham</hi> his Son was over the Kings House, Judging the People of the Land.</p>
            <p>And thus we see the Lord had a Controversie with the Prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> against whom he gave out a Commission to the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. saying, <hi>Son of Man, say unto the Prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord, Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a god, I sit in the Seat of God, in the midst of the Seas; yet thou art a Man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God.</hi> And the reason of the lifting up of his heart is rendred in the fourth and fifth verses, which proves our Assertion fully; for saith vers. 4. <hi>With thy Wisdom and with thy Understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten Gold and Silver into thy Treasuries.</hi> And v. 5. <hi>By thy great Wisdom, and by thy Traffick hast thou encreased thy riches, and thy heart is lifted up, because of thy riches.</hi> V. 7. <hi>Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the Nations; and they shall draw their Sword against the beauty of thy Wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.</hi> And v. 8. <hi>They shall bring thee down to the</hi> Pit, <hi>and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas.</hi> And vers. 10. <hi>Thou shalt die the death of the Uncircumcised, by the hand of Strangers; for I have spoken it saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whilst mens hearts are lifted up, and they forget God in the Enjoyment of outward things; and with the rich Man in the Gospel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. begin to live to themselves, and to sing a <hi>Requium</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44940:34"/>
their Souls; the Lord we see brings them down with a, <hi>Thou Fool, this night shall they require thy Soul from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we see the Point also fully proved. <hi>viz.</hi> That outward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, many times do so affect the heart of man, as that they lift it up even to the forgetting of God, to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>Several Uses might be made hereof, the which for brevity sake I shall here omit. And shall onely this say,</p>
            <p>That we see by common Experience, That they that are hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, when they come to their full of Diet, they run upon it with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, like <hi>Israel</hi> of old, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>Who flew upon the Spoil, and took Sheep and Oxen, and Calves, and slew them on the ground, and the People did eat them with the Blood:</hi> Which was contrary to the Law of God, and which <hi>became their sin.</hi> Even so hunger-bit Souls many times eat with that eagerness, that they do not onely sin in their <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi> but also <hi>Surfeit</hi> themselves to the loss of their lives.</p>
            <p>This then may serve for a Use of Caution to thee, O King, that of a long time hast been a Stranger to this Land of thy Nativity, and hast been forced to wander from one Kingdom to another Nation, from one Language to another People, in <hi>penury</hi> and <hi>want;</hi> and now being come to three Kingdoms of thine own, flowing with Milk and Honey, and yet abounding in all manner of Excess of Riot; let me Caution thee in the fear of the Lord, that thou <hi>surfeit not</hi> thy self upon the <hi>profits</hi> nor <hi>pleasures</hi> thereof; nor, let thy Men of Valour, neither Domestick nor Forreign, that are lately come over to thy assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, cause thee to put thy confidence in an Arm of flesh; <hi>lest thy heart be lifted up,</hi> and <hi>so thou forget thy God to thine own ruine: Neither surfeit thy self with too much blood-shed, lest</hi> thou make thy self <hi>Blood-guilty,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> God <hi>begin a new Inquisition;</hi> but rather shew <hi>Pitty</hi> and <hi>Compassion, Love</hi> and <hi>Lenity,</hi> and rather <hi>Lament</hi> than <hi>Launce;</hi> and rather Triumph over the <hi>killing thy Corruptions</hi> than thy <hi>Subjects;</hi> and resolve to refer thy will to the Lord, who saith, <hi>Uengeance is mine, and I will repay it,</hi> Rom. 12. 19. I would here be understood in a good sence; for I do not desire the <hi>Obstruction of the due Administration of Justice,</hi> but that it may be so admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, that <hi>Mercy</hi> may be <hi>intermixed therewith;</hi> and also that <hi>Relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and not <hi>Exaltation</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity, be in the</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>For I know, That it is an Ordinance of God; <hi>For Magistrates are set up for the punishment of Evil doers,</hi> Rom. 13. 3, 4. For the Law is not made <hi>for the</hi> Righteous man, but for the <hi>Lawless</hi> and <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> for the <hi>Ungodly</hi> and for <hi>Sinners,</hi> for <hi>Unholy</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi> for

            <p>And seeing the Apostle saith, <hi>That in many things we offend all,</hi> James 3. 2. <hi>For if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8.</p>
            <p>O then, be perswaded to bring thy self to the <hi>Bar of Gods Justice,</hi> and there <hi>Arraign, Judge, and condemn thy self;</hi> for, saith our Apostle, 1 Cor. 13. 31. <hi>If we would Judge our selves, we should not be Judged; but when we are Judged,</hi> we are <hi>chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this, O King, is the <hi>readiest way I know of, to render duely to God, and to keep thy heart from being lifted up, that so wrath fall not upon thee and thy Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech thee then in the fear of the Great Jehovah, <hi>consider what I say;</hi> and the Lord in <hi>Mercy make thee Wise;</hi> that as thou art an Heir to <hi>a Crown of gold here,</hi> so thou mayest he made partaker of <hi>that Crown of Righteousness which never fadeth away;</hi> which, saith the Apostle, <hi>The Lord the Righteous Judge shall give to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </hi> If by endeavouring a tolleration of all miscarriages in things Ecclesiastical, the Assertors intend amongst our selves in our own Assembles: we shall answer them, as in the presence of God, the searcher of all hearts; That we are so far from any such Toleration, as that we at this very day go under a reproach by that people we formerly walked withal, because in the reallity of our souls, and the integrity of our hearts, we cannot allow of some things, that we judge to be of that nature amongst them; we well knowing, that the Lord Christ requires a perfect observation of, and a universal obedience to all things whatsoever he commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. And that as well to what hath been laid down by his Apostles, given in by the incomes of that Spirit that was to lead them into all truth, and to shew them things to come, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13. which are also the commands of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 37. as to those that were laid down by himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 12, 15. So that we positively say, that if we shall allow of any miscarriages either in Doctrine or Discipline amongst our selves, to 'thwart the mind of Christ revealed in his Scriptures of truth, we can expect no better answer from him, than a Proclamation of our Worship to be a vain Worship, as once he declared against the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 9. And therefore if miscarriages rise amongst us, we are to bring such miscarriages to the the touch-stone of Gods word, and so weigh them in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and finding them either too heavy or too light, that is, either adding or diminishing from or to the mind of Christ,

They would then finde themselves to be the Libertines, and not we; and therefore we shall earnestly desire all that are unacquainted with the true Discipline of the Church of Christ, well to weigh, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider these Statute Laws of Christ, in that case provided, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 12, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 15. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 9, 11.

And that our Heavenly Father doth exercise his long-suffering to the whole bulk of man-kind, <hi>not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9.

But either to procure or maintain our own or others Liberties by force of Armes, or the least violence, we can find no warrant from the Scriptures of truth in the least, which is that only and alone Rule that we walk by, for all the remedy that we find there recorded is, that if they <hi>persecute us in one City, we may flee into another;</hi> and this we see acted by our Saviour himself, <hi>John</hi> 7. 1. and by his Parents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 14. and the Apostle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 12. 17. and Saint <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. 25, 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 33. And to follow our Master, and to tread in the footsteps of the Flock of God gone before us, we judge it very safe; but to resist by force of Armes, or use the least violence, we judge unwarrantable.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To this we cannot but answer, that so to do we judge were not so much as common Humanity, much less Religion or Christianity; but our Religion is, <hi>pure and undefiled before God and our Father,</hi> which is,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44940:38"/>
to <hi>visit the Fatherless and widdows,</hi> not to make fatherless &amp; widdows; and to visit them in their afflictions, not to murther and destroy their Relations, to bring them under Afflictions: But to this we further answer, that this and the 4th Particular we judg seem to contradict one another, for murthering and destroying for difference in matters of Religion, and Liberty of Conscience cannot stand together, nor in the eye of Reason can they be charged against one and the same persons; for murthering and destroying for difference in matters of Religion, destroyes Liberty of Conscience; and Liberty of Conscience swallows up and drowns murthering, and destroying for difference in matters of Religion; so that it argues, that the Assertors of these things are yet in Babylon, and Confusion, with those our Apostle writ of, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. not <hi>knowing well what they say, nor whereof they do affirm;</hi> yet notwithstanding seeing we are therewith charged, in order to the discharging our selves of this confused burthen, we shall in the singleness of our souls yet farther discover our real judgments, as to the main intent of the Charge, which is murthering and destroying; and add this further, that we read of a threefold Sword in Scripture.</p>

            <p>The first of these we are required to take to us, and <hi>put on,</hi> Ephes. 6. 11, 13, 17. and <hi>thus</hi> to be <hi>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> whose might was evidenced once, again and again, by using this Sword skilfully, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 9. <hi>For it is mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it self against the knowledg of God, and bringing into captivity,</hi> &amp;c. and having in a readiness to <hi>revenge</hi> all <hi>disobedience,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5, 6. and is <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furnished unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. <hi>for we wrastle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers, the Rulers of the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As for the Sword of Justice, or the Magistrates Sword, we are to be subject to it, as we have fully declared, and not to resist it, which Sword

takes revenge on no man before he be apprehended, charged, heard, and by good evidence convicted, and sentence according to the fact proved, given, and then an immediate Commission given to an Executioner, according to the Fact and Sentence, for the putting this Sword in execution.</p>
            <p>But the Sword of slaughter, without examination or due consideration, is many times put in execution to the slaying and destroying of friends as well as enemies; witness those slaughters, and woundings in this City, in the late Insurrection.</p>
            <p>And for our acting in this Sword, we can find no warrant from Scriptures in the least, for that sword being once procured by <hi>Peter,</hi> and another of the Disciples, and that by an immediate Commission from Christ, the work being finished for which it was intended, we find an immediate and peremptory command for the sheathing it again; and this reason rendred from the lip of truth it self, <hi>for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,</hi> Matth. 26. 52. <hi>for whosoever will save his life shall lose it,</hi> Matth. 16. 25. and we find no tolleration in Holy Writ to the people of God for the drawing it again in the least, neither by Precept or Example.</p>
            <p>But lest this countermand should not be looked upon to be a sufficient warrant for its continuance in its place, by the People of God for the time to come, the Lord Christ, amongst several other weighty things, sent to the seven Churches in <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By all which we judge, that Caution was intended chiefly to us <hi>upon whom the ends of the world is come;</hi> and lest we should not be so mindful of our Duties as he would have us, he makes as it were a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, to bespeak our better attention to what he intendeth, &amp; saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 9, 10. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear let him hear; he that leadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity; he that killeth with the sword, shall be killed with the sword.</hi> Here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints, that whilest others are leading into Captivity, and killing with the Sword, to pull down, or set up this or that Power, Man, or Government; to give a deadly Wound to Kingly Power, or to heal that deadly Wound again, that then the People of God should in their <hi>Patience possess their souls,</hi> and in the midst of these Revolutions, exercise their Faith, as once that Prophet did, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17. and faithfully to depend upon God for his Preservation and Protection, keeping themselves pure and undefiled from leading into Captivity, or killing with the Sword, lest they themselves be led into captivity, &amp; killed by the sword; thereby evidencing themselves to be the <hi>peaceable Flock of Christ, chosen out of the world,</hi> Joh. 15. 19. and following their <hi>Master the Lord and Prince of Peace,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 16. being regulated by his requirements in the <hi>Gospel of Peace, Romans</hi> 10. 15. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 6. 5. having received from the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> Rom. 15. 33. Rom. 16. 20. 2 Cor. 13. 11. that <hi>Spirit,</hi> whose <hi>fruits</hi> is <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, long-Suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meckness and Temperance, against which there is no Law;</hi> that as they are Christs, so they should evidence that they have <hi>crucified the flesh with the affections and iusts,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23, 24. But lust being not crucified, it breaks forth into wars and fightings; for when <hi>men lust and have not,</hi> then they <hi>kill and desire to have,</hi> James 4. 1, 2. and when the People of God shall act thus, the Spirit of God brands them with those Ignominious Names of Adulterers, and Adulteresses, informing them, that what they are fighting for, is enmity against God; and that if they obtain it, they are enemies to God, <hi>James</hi> 4. 4. and we well knowing, that whilest we are Friends to the world, we are Enemies to God; dare not in the least have to do in the world, so as to set up our selves, or to side with any, either in setting up, or pulling down; And how can a mans love to the world be evidenced more, than in venturing his life for it? according to that saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 15. 13.</p>
            <p>And we further Declare, That as we are to be <hi>a peaceable People</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Action, so we look upon it to be our Duty, to keep our selves from Oaths, Engagements, and Covenants, either <hi>For</hi> or <hi>Against</hi> this or that Person, Government, or Persons whatsoever: <hi>For because</hi>

And saith the same Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 3, 4. <hi>They have spoken words,</hi> SWEARING <hi>falsly, in making a Covenant;</hi> THUS <hi>Judgement springeth up as Hemlock in the furrows of the field;</hi> and we not knowing what the Cabinet Counsel of God is in this our day, upon the account of Government, dare not in the least have so much as a thought to Engage in any such thing, <hi>lest we be found Fighters against God;</hi> according to the saying of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> though in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother case, <hi>Acts.</hi> 5. 39.</p>
            <p>And therefore do Declare our Resolution herein, That we shall not (God assisting us) enter into any Engagement whatsoever, upon any such account; Yet shall this say again, That we shall not violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Imposers of any such Engagements, but shall patiently suffer the penalty of our non-obedience, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And we further Declare, as in the presence of God, who is the searcher of all hearts, That as it hath been some of our great trouble for a long time, to see some of those that are in the same Faith and Order with us, so acting; so it is now become even an overwhelming burthen upon our Souls, to see them generally running such a precipitant course; by which actings of theirs, the mouths almost of all men are opened against them, and that Truth they profess, most ignominiously branded and reproached.</p>
            <p>And therefore we further Declare, That in the sight of God, Angels, and Men, that we bear our Testimony against them in their present act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and cannot stand by them, nor have Communion with them therein, nor with those that strengthen their hands in standing by them; and must tell them in the words of our Savior, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55. <hi>That they know not what Spirit they are of;</hi> for, <hi>the Son of Man</hi> (their Master) <hi>came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi> The Premises considered, we shall Appeal to the Judgement of all Rational men, whether we are guilty of what we are Charged withal, or not; Yet if they shall still go on notwithstanding to use us Reproachfully, for the Name of Christ, we shall be so far from Endeavouring or Desiring a Revenge, as that in the words of Christ, we shall in our Requests at the Throne of Grace, cry out and say, <hi>Father, Forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>

Alleyn, <hi>regulated by Scripture Record:</hi> in which, with other things, a Gospel-Believer, or a true Church of Christ, upon a Gospel account, is intended to be stated; the which is hoped will be so plain, that it may prove Instrumental to the Undeceiving of some that are under a Deceipt, by means of that, and such deceitful Discourses as that is; In which Answer it is farther hoped, That those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with our tearm <hi>Without,</hi> in our Answer in our Declaration to the Fourth Particular, may receive also good satisfaction; and in the mean time we desire all to take notice; That though we thus speak, yet we have good thoughts of those Friends that go under those Denominations, and do own them, and all others, of all other Opinions whatsoever, in Union, so far as they own God, Christ, and their Truths; but to own the best of men to be Members of that Body, of which Christ is the Head, and so to have Communion with them, either to make them our mouth in Prayer to God for us, or Gods mouth in speaking forth his Truths to us, or in Breaking of Bread at the Table of the Lord, we cannot own them in the least; Our Reasons, we hope, will be fully laid down in the Answer to the said Book.</p>
