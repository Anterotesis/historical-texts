         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Oration.]</bibl>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. HOW <hi>Frail</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
is the <hi>Life</hi> of
Man, I wish, if it had
pleased God, we
might have learned
some <hi>other</hi> way, than by this present
spectacle. Yet must we not lament
<hi>overmuch</hi> the death of this excellent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57521:4"/>
Person, whose <hi>happiness</hi> we cannot
doubt of, being well assured of his
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue;</hi> one, to whom no
part of <hi>felicity</hi> is wanting, but that of
<hi>Virginius Rufus,</hi> to have another <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi>
to give him a Funeral Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
As for me, whilst I behold this
concourse of <hi>Scholars</hi> at other times
<hi>pleasant</hi> to me, now upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>sad,</hi> and call to mind the Royal
tears of <hi>Xerxes</hi> poured forth at the
view of his numerous <hi>Army,</hi> I cannot
choose but mourn and sigh, having
before my eyes, as in a glass, the
image of <hi>your</hi> Mortality also.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For, who is there that in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of <hi>Learning,</hi> Wisdom, and
Virtue, can far extend the hope of
<hi>Life,</hi> when the inexorable power
above hath not pleased to spare this
great <hi>propugnator</hi> of the Orthodox
Religion, notwithstanding the <hi>tears</hi>
of our <hi>Mother</hi> the University, and
the importunate Prayers of the <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
Church? Certainly, if those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable</hi>
riches of the <hi>mind,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perishable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57521:4"/>
Graces, could impart their
efficacy to the <hi>Body,</hi> and give strength
and vigour to it, <hi>Reynolds</hi> had still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
here; not according to his own
desire, who preferred <hi>Heaven,</hi> but
ours, who would enjoy him: he had
<hi>lived</hi> so as never to <hi>dye,</hi> to grow old,
or to be sick.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But to the great loss of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
it falls out contrary, that the
more any man hath enriched his mind
with those Divine Ornaments of
<hi>Learning and Wisdom,</hi> so much the
more hastily does the <hi>Soul</hi> it self,
weary of her earthly Tabernacle, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to a higher dwelling, and the
<hi>Body</hi> having spent all the spirits in
those noble, but laboursome studies,
fail and decay. This was the Reason
why <hi>this Learned Man,</hi> after so many
Scholastick Victories and triumphs,
his strength of Body being wasted,
breathed forth his glorious Soul, and
left us to lament his departure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he hath lived long enough for
<hi>himself,</hi> long enough for <hi>Fame,</hi> (which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57521:5"/>
yet he could not have out-lived:) but
not long enough for the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
which hath need of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a pattern of all Virtue; not for
the <hi>University,</hi> which wanteth that
Light of Learning now extinguished;
not for the Common Interest of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which being deprived of such a
Patron is liable to danger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For although he hath pull'd off
the <hi>disguise</hi> from the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry,
and expos'd it to the hatred of God
and Man; although he hath almost
cut the throat of the <hi>Antichristian</hi>
Monster; though he hath transfixed
the very <hi>heart</hi> of Popery through the
sides of <hi>Hart,</hi> yet <hi>Sanders</hi> is still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd:
but he hath felt the hand of
God in the <hi>Irish</hi> Mountains, where he
wandred; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is not quite
broken; <hi>Baronius</hi> his frauds are not
all discovered (not to speak of our
growing <hi>Adversaries:</hi>) In the midst
of so much work, how could such a
man find the <hi>leisure to dye,</hi> the Harvest
being so great, and the Labourers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57521:5"/>
so few, scarce any at all like unto
him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is matter of Lamentation
to the <hi>Church,</hi> whereof she is so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as if she seemed ready to faint
at the Death of <hi>Reynolds.</hi> But our
Mother the <hi>University</hi> hath a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
more sorrowful (if more may
be) and all bedewed with her tears.
She thinks upon nothing but her <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
seemeth still to see her <hi>Reynolds,</hi>
to hear <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and to embrace his
shadow. I cannot deny, that our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<hi>Mother</hi> hath, in this Age, so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
an <hi>off-spring</hi> of Learned Sons,
that she may rather rejoyce in her
<hi>fruitfulness,</hi> than complain of her
<hi>loss,</hi> and (if ever) now take up that
speech of <hi>Brasidas</hi> his Mother: Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidas
<hi>indeed was a Worthy and Valiant
man, but</hi> Sparta <hi>hath many more such:</hi>
Nevertheless I cannot choose but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and excuse her <hi>pious tears</hi> and
just grief, when I consider she hath
lost a <hi>person,</hi> who (let not <hi>Envy</hi> hear)
so far outshined the rest of her <hi>Sons,</hi>
               </p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57521:6"/>
               <p n="8">8. Now let that foul impudent
Railer <hi>Weston</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Duacens. Praef. ad Lib. de triplici Hom. officio.</note> go vomit
forth what scurrilities he
will, and accuse our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>slowness,</hi> and of
<hi>pretending Sickness.</hi> He thinks us all
very <hi>dull,</hi> who held such a person in
so high <hi>Veneration,</hi> and believed him
to be <hi>sick,</hi> whom (alas!) we see <hi>dead.</hi>
And yet, <hi>Weston</hi> himself, when he so
inveighed against the <hi>Heads</hi> of our
University, that, even for being <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi>
some of them he by name ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
of wickedness, could not find
so much as one act to be reprehended
in the whole life of this most <hi>Holy</hi>
man.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But he was far off: what did
they that stood at nearer distance?
They all dearly <hi>lov'd</hi> the man, they
lov'd his manners and integrity. And
if perhaps his resolute severity and
stiffness of mind, without favour and
partiality, might be <hi>blamed</hi> in him; or
if any thing else (but what could?)
Verily that <hi>fault</hi> would sooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57521:6"/>
a <hi>Virtue,</hi> than our <hi>Saint</hi> be
made <hi>Vitious.</hi> No question, but he is
in a blessed condition among the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Angels.</hi> As for <hi>us,</hi> who reverence
the <hi>Memory</hi> of this best and wisest
man, we shall not doubt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
<hi>Oxford</hi> will then be <hi>happy,</hi>
when any equal and like to him shall
succeed into his place. For we may
have, whom their great <hi>Eloquence,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Reading,</hi> sublimity of <hi>Wit,</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of <hi>Judgment, Virtue, Humanity,
Candor,</hi> and all these shewed in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Monuments</hi> and Writings, may
very much commend; <hi>Reynolds</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,

                  <p>DOctor <hi>Crackanthorp</hi> there tells
the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57521:7"/>
that Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> was no <hi>Puritan,</hi> (as
he called him) but he himself a great
<hi>Calumniator:</hi> For first, he professed
that he appeared unwillingly in the
Cause at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and meerly
in obedience to the Kings Command.
And then, he spake not one word there
against the <hi>Hierarchy:</hi> Nay, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
it to be consonant to the
Word of God, in his <hi>Conference
with Hart.</hi> And in <hi>Answer to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
his Book of the Schism of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(which is in the Archbishops
Library) he professes that he approves
of the Book of Consecrating and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>Bishops, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
He was a strict observer also of all
the <hi>Orders of the Church,</hi> and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
both in publick and his own
Colledge, wearing the square <hi>Cap,</hi>
and <hi>Surplice, kneeling</hi> at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he himself commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Benefactors at the times
their Statutes appointed, and reading
that Chapt. out of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> which
is on such occasions used. In a Letter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57521:7"/>
also of his to <hi>Archbishop Bancroft</hi>
(then in Dr. <hi>Crackanthorp</hi>'s hands) he
professes himself conformable to the
<hi>Church of England</hi> willingly, and from
his heart, his <hi>Conscience</hi> admonishing
him so to be. And thus he remained
perswaded to his last breath, desiring
to receive <hi>Absolution</hi> according to the
manner prescribed in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
when he lay on his <hi>Death-bed.</hi> Which
he did from Dr. <hi>Holland</hi> the Kings
Professor in <hi>Oxford, kissing his hand</hi>
in token of his love and joy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a few hours after resigned up his
Soul to God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HIS Schoolmaster perswaded
his <hi>Parents</hi> (who intended
him for a Prentice) to continue him
at School till he could find out some
means, by perswading his rich <hi>Uncle,</hi>
or some other charitable person, to
ease them of a part of their care and
charge; assuring them that their <hi>Son</hi>
was so enriched with the Blessings of
Nature and Grace, that God seemed
to single him out as a special Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Glory. And the <hi>Good man</hi>
(whose name I am sorry I am not
able to recover) told them also, that
he would double his <hi>diligence</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
him, and would neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
nor receive any other <hi>reward,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57521:8"/>
than the <hi>content</hi> of so happy an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>Parents</hi> and his <hi>Master</hi> laid
a Foundation for his future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by instilling into his Soul the
Seeds of Piety, those conscientious
Principles of loving and fearing God,
<hi>a Belief that he knows the very secrets
of our Souls, that he punisheth our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and rewards our Innocence; that
we should be free from Hypocrisie, and
appear to man what we are to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
first or last the crafty man is catch'd
in his own snare.</hi> These seeds of Piety
were so seasonably planted, and so
continually watered with the dew of
Gods blessed Spirit, as hath made
<hi>Richard Hooker</hi> honour'd in <hi>this,</hi> and
will continue him to be so to <hi>succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Generations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An. 3. Eliz. John Hooker</hi> gave Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Jewell</hi> a Visit at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
him for Charity sake to look
favourably upon a poor <hi>Nephew</hi> of
his, whom Nature had fitted for a
<hi>Scholar,</hi> but the estate of his Parents
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57521:9"/>
was so narrow, that they were unable
to give him the advantage of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and that the <hi>Bishop</hi> would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
become his <hi>Patron,</hi> and prevent
him from being a Tradesman; for he
was a Boy of remarkable hopes. The
<hi>Bishop</hi> appointed, the <hi>Boy</hi> and his
<hi>Schoolmaster</hi> should attend him about
<hi>Easter</hi> next following; and then after
some questions and observations of
the Boy's Gravity and Behaviour, gave
his Schoolmaster a <hi>reward,</hi> and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<hi>Pension</hi> to his Parents, promising
also to take him into his <hi>Care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>An.</hi> 1567. About the 14th.
year of his Age the Bishop commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Hooker</hi> to Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> President of
<hi>C. C.</hi> Colledge, who provided for
him both a <hi>Tutor</hi> (which was said to
be <hi>John Reynolds</hi>) and a <hi>Clerks</hi> place;
which though not a full maintenance,
yet with the Contribution of his
<hi>Uncle,</hi> and the continued <hi>Pension</hi> of
his Patron the good <hi>Bishop,</hi> it gave
him a comfortable subsistence. And
in this condition he continued unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57521:9"/>
the 18th. year of his Age, still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
in <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> in
<hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. About this time of his Age he
fell into a dangerous <hi>Sickness,</hi> which
lasted two months; all which time
his <hi>Mother</hi> having notice of it, did in
her hourly <hi>Prayers</hi> as earnestly beg
his life of God, as the <hi>Mother</hi> of St.
<hi>Augustin</hi> did that he might become
a true <hi>Christian;</hi> and their Prayers
were both so heard as to be granted.
Which <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi> would often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with much joy, and as often pray,
<hi>That he might never live to occasion any
sorrow to his good Mother, whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so dearly, that he would endeavour
to be good, even as much for hers as for
his own sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. As soon as he was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from this Sickness, he took a
Journey from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>Exeter</hi> to
satisfie and see his good Mother, and
by the way visited the good
<hi>Bishop.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vol.</note> After his return to
his <hi>Colledge,</hi> came sad news
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57521:10"/>
of the death of his Learned and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<hi>Patron.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Cole</hi> raised his
Spirits, and bad him go chearfully to
his <hi>Studies,</hi> and assured him he should
not want.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A little before his death Bishop
<hi>Jewell</hi> meeting with Bishop <hi>Sandys</hi>
(who had been his companion in exile)
began a story of his <hi>Hooker,</hi> and in it
gave such a <hi>Character</hi> of his Learning
and manners, that though Bishop
<hi>Sandys</hi> was educated in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
where he had obliged and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Friends; yet his Resolution was,
that his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> should be sent to
<hi>Corpus Christi Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
by all means be Pupil to Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
though his Son <hi>Edwin</hi> was then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of the same Age. <hi>For,</hi> said the
Bishop, <hi>I will have a Tutor for my Son,
that shall teach him Learning by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and Virtue by example.</hi> And
doubtless, as to these two, a better
choice could not be made. For by
great industry added to his great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>He did not only know more, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57521:10"/>
what he knew, he knew better than
other men.</hi> And such was his pious
behaviour, that in <hi>four</hi> years he was
but <hi>twice</hi> absent from the <hi>Chappel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prayers:</hi>
and there he shewed an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Reverence</hi> of that God which he
worshipped. He was never known to
be <hi>angry,</hi> or passionate, or extreme in
any of his desires; never heard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
or dispute with <hi>Providence,</hi> but
by a quiet gentle <hi>submission</hi> bore the
burthen of the day with patience.
And when he took any liberty to be
<hi>pleasant,</hi> his wit was never blemish'd
with <hi>Scoffing,</hi> or the utterance of any
conceit that bordered upon, or might
beget a thought of <hi>looseness</hi> in his
hearers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the 19th. year of his Age,
<hi>Decemb,</hi> 24. 1573. he was chosen to
be one of the 20 <hi>Scholars</hi> of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
And <hi>Feb.</hi> 23. 1576. his <hi>Grace</hi>
was given him for <hi>Inceptor</hi> of Arts,
Dr. <hi>Herbert Westphaling,</hi> a man of
note for Learning, being then <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor.</hi>
The Act following he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57521:11"/>
was compleated <hi>Master,</hi> his Patron
Doctor <hi>Cole</hi> being <hi>Vicechancellor</hi> that
year, and his dear Friend Mr. <hi>Henry
Savil</hi> of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, being then
one of the Proctors: That <hi>Savil,</hi>
which afterward founded two famous
Lectures in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and
enriched the world with that labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and chargeable Edition of St.
<hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Works in Greek.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And in this year 1577. Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> was chosen <hi>Fellow</hi> of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
happy also in being the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
and Friend of Dr. <hi>John
Reynolds,</hi> and of Dr. <hi>Spencer:</hi> both
which were after successively made
<hi>Presidents</hi> of that Colledge, men of
great Learning and Merit, and famous
in their Generations. Happy he was
also in the Pupillage and Friendship
of his <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> (after, Sir <hi>Edwin
Sandys,</hi> known by his <hi>Speculum Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae</hi>)
and of <hi>George Cranmer</hi> (the
Great Archbishop and Martyr's grand
Nephew, a Gentleman of Singular
hopes:) both whom, a desire to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57521:11"/>
know the Affairs, and Manners, and
Learning of other <hi>Nations,</hi> that they
might thereby become the more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
unto their own, made to put
off their Gowns, and leave Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
to his Colledge and private Studies.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thus he continued his Studies
in all quietness for the space of three
or more years; about which time he
entred into <hi>Sacred Orders,</hi> and was
made Deacon and Priest, and not long
after in obedience to the Colledge
Statutes being to Preach at St. <hi>Pauls
Cross, London,</hi> to <hi>London</hi> he came to
the <hi>Shunamites</hi> house (a house so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
for that beside the <hi>Stipend</hi> paid
the <hi>Preacher,</hi> there is <hi>provision</hi> made
for his Lodging and Diet two days
before and one day after his <hi>Sermon:</hi>)
but to this house Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> came so
wet, so weary, and weather-beaten,
that hardly with much diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
was he enabled to perform the
office of the day, which was in or
about the year 1581.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>An.</hi> 1584. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. he was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57521:12"/>
presented by <hi>John Cheney</hi> Esquire, to
a Country <hi>Parsonage,</hi> which was
<hi>Draiton-Beauchamp</hi> in <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
not far from <hi>Alesbury,</hi> and in
the Diocess of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about a year; in which time
his two Pupils, <hi>Edwin Sandys,</hi> and
<hi>George Cranmer,</hi> were returned from
<hi>Travel,</hi> and took a Journey to see
their Tutor; where they found him
with a Book in his hand, (it was the
<hi>Odes of Horace</hi>) being then tending his
small allotment of <hi>Sheep</hi> in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
field: which he told his Pupils
he was forced to do, for that his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
was gone home to <hi>dine,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his <hi>Wife</hi> to do some necessary
houshold business. When his Servant
returned and released him, his two
<hi>Pupils</hi> attended him to his house,
where their best entertainment was his
<hi>Company;</hi> and having stayed till next
morning (which was time enough to
<hi>discover and pity</hi> their Tutors condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
and having given him as much
present <hi>comfort</hi> as they were able, they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57521:12"/>
return to <hi>London.</hi> Then <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi>
acquaints his Father of his Tutors
sad case, and solicits for his removal
to some <hi>Benefice</hi> that might give him
a more comfortable subsistence.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Not long after Mr. <hi>Alvie,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the <hi>Temple</hi> died (a man of
strict Life, of great Learning, and of
so venerable behaviour, as to gain
such a degree of Love and Reverence
from all men, that he was generally
known by the name of <hi>Father Alvie</hi>)
into whose place <hi>Bishop Sandys</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<hi>Hooker</hi> with such effectual
earnestness, and so many testimonies
of his worth, that he was sent for to
<hi>London,</hi> and there the place was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to him by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
freedom from cares, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of a <hi>better Society,</hi> a more <hi>liberal
Pension</hi> than his Country Parsonage
did afford him: and at last notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his averseness he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to accept of the Bishops pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
being by Patent for life made
<hi>Master of the Temple, March, An.</hi> 1585.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57521:13"/>
13. Mr. <hi>Walter Travers</hi> was <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer</hi>
at the <hi>Temple</hi> for the Evening
Sermons, a man of competent Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of a winning Behaviour, and a
blameless Life, but ordained by the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> in <hi>Antwerp.</hi> He had hope
to set up the <hi>Geneva Government</hi> in
the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to that end used his
endeavours to be <hi>Master</hi> of it; and his
being disappointed by Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
proved some occasion of
<hi>opposition</hi> betwixt them in their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi>
Many of which were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Doctrine, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
of this Church; insomuch
that, as one hath pleasantly express'd
it, <hi>The Forenoon Sermon spake</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<hi>and the Afternoon</hi> Geneva.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The <hi>oppositions</hi> became so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and the <hi>Consequences</hi> so danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
(especially in that place) that the
prudent <hi>Archbishop</hi> put a stop to Mr.
<hi>Travers</hi> his Preaching, by a positive
<hi>Prohibition.</hi> Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> appeals, and
Petitions her Majesty and the Privy
Council to have it recalled, but in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57521:13"/>
vain: For the Queen had entrusted
the <hi>Archbishop</hi> with all Church
Power. Hereupon the <hi>party,</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Archbishop's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s
disgrace, <hi>privately printed the Petition,</hi>
and scattered it abroad. Now is Mr.
<hi>Hooker</hi> forced to appear publickly,
and print an <hi>Answer</hi> to it: which he
did, and it proved a full Answer, writ
with such clear <hi>Reason,</hi> and so much
<hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> of Style, that
the <hi>Bishop</hi> began to wonder at the
man, to rejoyce that he had appeared
in his cause, and disdained not earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beg his friendship, even a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
friendship with a man of so much
quiet <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The Foundation of his eight
Books of <hi>Ecclesiastical Politie</hi> was laid
in the <hi>Temple,</hi> but he found it no fit
place to finish what he had there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
and therefore solicited the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> for a remove, saying, <hi>When
I lost the freedom of my Cell, which was
my Colledge, yet I found some degree of
it in my quiet Country Parsonage. But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57521:14"/>
I am weary of the noise and oppositions
of this place. And indeed God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
did not intend me for Contentions,
but for Study and Quietness. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
a work in which I intend the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of our Laws of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I shall never be able to finish
it, but where I may study and pray for
Gods Blessings upon my Endeavours, and
keep my self in peace and privacy, and
behold Gods Blessing spring out of my
Mother Earth, and eat my own Bread
without oppositions; and therefore, if
your Grace can judge me worthy such a
favour, let me beg it, that I may perfect
what I have begun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. About this time the Rectory
of <hi>Boscum</hi> in the Diocess of <hi>Sarum,</hi>
and six miles from that City became
void: to which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
(in the vacancy of that Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick)
by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
in the year 1591. And in the same
year, <hi>July</hi> 17. was he made a <hi>minor
Prebend</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the Corps to it
being <hi>Neather Havin,</hi> about ten miles
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57521:14"/>
from that City; which <hi>Prebend</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of no great value, was intended
chiefly to make him capable of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preserment in that Church. In
this <hi>Boscum</hi> he continued till he had
finished <hi>four</hi> of his <hi>eight</hi> proposed
<hi>Books,</hi> and these were publish'd with
that large and affectionate <hi>Preface,
An.</hi> 1594.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Parsonage of <hi>Bishops-Borne</hi>
in <hi>Kent</hi> three miles from <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
is that <hi>Archbishops</hi> Gift. In the latter
end of the year 1594. Dr. <hi>William Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
the Rector of it, was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Norwich,</hi> by which means
the power of presenting to it was <hi>pro
ea vice</hi> in the <hi>Queen.</hi> And she presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Hooker,</hi> whom she loved well, to
this good living of <hi>Borne, July</hi> 7.1595.
In which Living he continued till his
death, without any addition of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or profit. His fifth Book of <hi>Eccl.
Politie</hi> was Printed first by it self (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
larger than his first four) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to his Patron <hi>Archbishop
Whitgift, An.</hi> 1597.</p>

18. These Books were read with
an admiration of their excellency in
<hi>this,</hi> and their just same spread it self
into <hi>Forein</hi> Nations. Dr. <hi>Stapleton</hi>
having read the first four, boasted to
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. <hi>That a poor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
English Priest had writ four such
Books of Laws and Church Politie, and
in a style that express'd so grave and
such humble Majesty, with clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of reason, that in all his
reading he had not met with any that
exceeded him.</hi> And the <hi>Pope</hi> having
heard the <hi>Doctor</hi> interpret to him a
part in <hi>Latin,</hi> said, <hi>There is no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this man hath not search'd into;
nothing too hard for his understanding:
this man indeed deserves the name of
an Author: Books will get reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
by Age; for there is in them such
seeds of eternity, that if the rest be
like this, they shall last till the last fire
shall consume all Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. King <hi>James</hi> also, at his first
coming into this Kingdom, enquiring
of the <hi>Archbishop Whitgift</hi> for his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57521:15"/>
friend Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and being answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he died a year before <hi>Queen
Elizabeth,</hi> who received the sad news
of his death with very much sorrow,
replyed, <hi>And I receive it with no less,
that I shall want the desired happiness
of seeing and discoursing with that man,
from whose Books I have had so much
satisfaction:</hi> Adding, <hi>Though many

they will be forgotten: but doubtless
there is in every page of</hi> Hooker's <hi>Book
the Picture of a Divine Soul; such Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Truth and Reason, and drawn
in so sacred colours, that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Fade, but give an immortal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

Hooker:</hi> nor his Son, our late <hi>King

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57521:16"/>
                  <hi>Modesty</hi> and other Virtues) wished,
That for the honour of this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of other Nations, those Books
were turned into the Universal Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is now accomplish'd by the
happy Pen of Dr. <hi>John Earl</hi> Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a man like unto
<hi>Hooker,</hi> for his innocent Wisdom,
sanctified Learning, and Pious, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
Primitive Temper.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Parsonage of
<hi>Borne</hi> being near the common Road
that leads from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi>
many mov'd by the Fame of his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Holiness turn'd out of their
way, and others (Scholars especially)
came purposely to see the man: <hi>A
man in poor Cloaths, his Loyns usually
girt in a course Gown or Canonical Coat,
of a mean Stature, and Stooping; and
yet more lowly in the thoughts of his
Soul (so mild and humble that his poor
Parish-Clerk and he did never talk, but
with both their Hats on, or both off at
the same time) short-sighted; his Body
worn out, not with Age, but Study
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57521:16"/>
and Mortification: his Face full of
Heat-Pimples, begot by his unactive
and Sedentary Life.</hi> Here he gave a
Holy <hi>Valediction</hi> to all the pleasures
and allurements of <hi>Earth,</hi> possessing
his Soul in a Virtuous <hi>Quietness,</hi> in
Constant <hi>Study,</hi> Devout <hi>Prayers,</hi> and
heavenly <hi>Meditations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. His use was to Preach <hi>once</hi>
every Sunday, and hear his <hi>Curate</hi> to
<hi>Catechise</hi> after the second Lesson in the
Evening Prayer: his <hi>Sermons</hi> were
neither long nor earnest, but uttered
with a <hi>Grave Zeal,</hi> and an <hi>Humble
Voice:</hi> his eyes always fix'd on one
place to prevent his imagination from
wandring; insomuch that he seem'd
<hi>to study</hi> as he spake. The design of his
<hi>Sermons,</hi> (as indeed of all his <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>)
was to shew <hi>reasons</hi> of what he
spake; and with these Reasons such a
kind of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as did rather <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
and perswade, than <hi>frighten</hi> men
into Piety; studying not so much <hi>for
matter</hi> (which he never wanted) as
for apt <hi>illustrations</hi> to inform and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57521:17"/>
teach his unlearned hearers by fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<hi>Examples,</hi> and then make them
better by convincing <hi>Applications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. He never failed, the <hi>Sunday</hi>
before every <hi>Ember-week</hi> to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it to his <hi>Parishioners,</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them both to <hi>Fast,</hi> and then to
double their <hi>Devotions</hi> for a Learned
and <hi>Pious Clergy;</hi> but especially the
last: saying often, <hi>That the Life of a
Pious Clergy-man was Visible Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
and so convincing, the most God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
men (though they would not deny
themselves the enjoyment of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Lusts) did yet secretly with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like those of the strictest Lives.</hi>
He did usually every <hi>Ember-week</hi> take
from the Parish-Clerk the Key of the
Church-Door, and lock himself up
there many hours, and the like, most
<hi>Fridays</hi> and other days of Fasting.</p>
               <p n="23">23. He would by no means omit
the customary time of <hi>Procession,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
all both Rich and Poor, (if
they desired the preservation of <hi>Love,</hi>
and their <hi>Parish-Rights</hi> and Liberties,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57521:17"/>
to accompany him in his <hi>perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
and most did so. In which he
would usually express more pleasant
<hi>discourse</hi> than at other times, and drop
some good <hi>Sentences</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi>
to be remembred by the <hi>Young</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
still enclining all his Parishion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to <hi>mutual Love</hi> and Kindness.</p>
               <p n="24">24. He would often <hi>Visit the Sick</hi>
unsent for, supposing that the fittest
<hi>time</hi> to discover those errors, to
which health and prosperity had blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them: and having by pious <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
and <hi>Prayers</hi> moulded them into
holy <hi>Resolutions</hi> for the time to come,
he would incline them <hi>to Confession,</hi>
and bewailing of their Sins, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to forsake them, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Communion,</hi> both as a
strengthening of those Holy Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and as a Seal betwixt God and
them of his Mercies to their Souls,
in case that present Sickness did put a
period to their lives.</p>
               <p n="25">25. He was diligent to prevent
<hi>Law-Suits,</hi> still urging his Neighbours
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57521:18"/>
to bear with each others infirmities,
and live in love, <hi>Because he that lives
in Love lives in God, for God is Love.</hi>
And to maintain this holy fire of
Love constantly burning on the Altar
of a pure heart, his advice was <hi>to
watch and pray,</hi> and always keep
themselves fit to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and then to receive it <hi>often;</hi>
for it was both a confirming and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
of their Graces. This was
his advice: And at his entrance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of any <hi>house,</hi> he would
usually speak to the whole Family and
<hi>bless</hi> them. And though in this <hi>decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Age</hi> such examples are almost
incredible, <hi>yet let his memory</hi> be blest
with this true Recordation: Because
he that praises Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> praises
<hi>God,</hi> who hath given such gifts unto
men. And let this invite posterity to
imitate his Virtues.</p>
               <p n="26">26. In the year 1600. and of his
age 46. he fell into a sickness, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
by a <hi>cold</hi> taken in his passage
betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Gravesend.</hi> But a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57521:18"/>
submission to <hi>his will</hi> that makes the
Sick mans bed easie by giving rest to
his soul, made his very Languishment
comfortable. And yet all this time
he was solicitous in his <hi>Study,</hi> and
said often to Dr. <hi>Saravia,</hi> Prebend of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> (with whom he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a sacred Friendship at his coming
to <hi>Borne,</hi> who saw him daily, and was
the chief comfort of his life;) <hi>That
he did not beg a long life of God for any
other reason, but to live to finish his
three remaining Books of Politie; and
then, Lord let thy Servant depart in
Peace,</hi> said he. And God heard his
Prayers, although he denied the
Church the benefit of them, as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted</hi>
by himself: and 'tis thought he
hastned his own death, by hastning to
give life to his <hi>Books.</hi> But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the nearer he was to his
<hi>Death,</hi> the more he grew in <hi>Humility,</hi>
in holy Thoughts, and Resolutions.</p>
               <p n="27">27. In this time of his Sickness,
and not many days before his death,
his house was <hi>rob'd;</hi> of which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57521:19"/>
notice, his question was, <hi>Are
my Books and written Papers safe?</hi> And
being answered that they were, his
reply was, <hi>Then it matters not, for no
other loss can trouble me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. About one day or two before
his death, Dr. <hi>Saravia,</hi> who knew the
very secrets of his soul (for they were
supposed to be <hi>Confessors</hi> to each
other) came to him, and after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the benefit of the <hi>Churches
Absolution,</hi> it was resolved that the
Doctor should give him both <hi>that,</hi>
and the <hi>Sacrament</hi> the day following.
Which being performed, he returned
early the next morning, and found
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> deep in Contemplation,
and not inclinable to discourse; which
gave the Doctor occasion to require
his present thoughts; to which he
replyed, <hi>That he was meditating of
the number and nature of Angels, and
their blessed Obedience and Order,
without which peace could not be in
Heaven. And oh! that it might be so
on earth.</hi> And a little afterward,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57521:19"/>
                  <hi>Lord shew Mercy to me, and let not
death be terrible, and then take thine
own time, I submit to it: let thy will
be done.</hi> And after a little slumber,
<hi>Good Doctor</hi> (said he) <hi>God hath heard my
daily Petitions, for I am at peace with
all men, and he is at peace with me:
And from that blessed assurance, I feel
that inward joy, which this world can
neither give, nor take from me.</hi> Then
after a short conflict betwixt <hi>Nature</hi>
and <hi>Death,</hi> a quiet sigh put a period
to his last breath, and he fell <hi>asleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. He died in the 46. or 47. year
of his Age, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> who hath
the year 1599. and the Author of
that <hi>Inscription</hi> on his Monument at
<hi>Borne,</hi> who hath 1603. are both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.
For it is attested under the
hand of Mr. <hi>Somner, Canterbury-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
that <hi>Richard Hooker</hi>'s Will bears
date <hi>Octob.</hi> 26. 1600. and that it was
prov'd <hi>Decemb.</hi> 3. following. He left
<hi>four Daughters,</hi> and to each of them
100. l. his Wife <hi>Jone</hi> his sole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutrix,
and by his <hi>Inventory</hi> his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57521:20"/>
Estate (a great part of it being in
Books) came to 1092 l. 9 s. 2 d. His
youngest Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> was
Married unto <hi>Ezekiel Clark</hi> a Minister
neer <hi>Cant.</hi> who left a Son <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> at
this time Rector of <hi>Waldron</hi> in <hi>Sussex.</hi>

<q>My <hi>Father's</hi> knowledge of
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was occasion'd by the
Learned Dr. <hi>John Spencer,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Death of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> was so
careful to preserve his <hi>three</hi> last
Books of <hi>Ecclesiastical Politie,</hi> and
other Writings, that he procur'd
<hi>Henry Juckson</hi> then of <hi>C. C.</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to transcribe for him all Mr.
<hi>Hookers</hi> remaining written Papers,
many of which were imperfect; for
his Study had been rifled or worse
used by Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> and another of
<hi>Principles</hi> too like his. These Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
were endeavoured to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
by his dear Friend Dr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
who bequeathed them as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Legacy to my <hi>Father,</hi> then

Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> then <hi>Archbishop of

they could hardly fall into

further to shew his Affection to the

and had thereby filled the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi>
with admiration of his <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Eloquence,</hi> he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
mainly to the study of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
and to the reading of <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi>
to which he ever attributed all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi>
of Religion. Yet he dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hently
turned over the Writings of
<hi>Modern Divines:</hi> and such was his
indefatigable pains, within few years
he read over all the sound and most
useful Books of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> both
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> setting himself a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57521:23"/>
daily task, which if he were interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
and lost any time in his daily
business by visit of friends, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was to make it up by his <hi>night
watchings.</hi> But by this custom, though
he gained <hi>knowledge,</hi> he impaired his
<hi>health;</hi> neither the firm <hi>constitution</hi>
of his Body, nor his temperate <hi>diet,</hi>
nor the <hi>Recreation</hi> he sometimes used,
by <hi>Shooting,</hi> by <hi>Angling,</hi> and (when
the season of the year would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
these) by the Philosophical Game
at <hi>Chess:</hi> I say, none of these could
make amends for the injuries his
health received from his <hi>immoderate
Studies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. However, he pleased himself in
the daily increase of his large stock of
<hi>Learning,</hi> and thereby was most dear
to the Learned Master of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>Doctor Whitgift;</hi> not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
with him, whilst he continued
<hi>Master,</hi> but after he was advanced to
the highest place of the Church, still
accounted as a most beloved <hi>Son.</hi>
Together with daily and nightly read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57521:23"/>
of good <hi>Authors,</hi> he was much
and frequent in all <hi>exercises, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing</hi>
in the Chappel, <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Preaching,</hi>
and <hi>Domestick Catechising</hi>
in the same Colledge: to which adde
his three solemn <hi>Lectures</hi> for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Batchelor</hi> in <hi>Divinity.</hi> In all
which I know not whether he shewed
himself a more learned <hi>Divine,</hi> or
more pious <hi>Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Those were but <hi>Specimens</hi> and

For at the publick Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>An.</hi> 1578. at St. <hi>Maries</hi> he
preached the <hi>Latin-Sermon,</hi> Learned,
Pious, Eloquent. Then he handled
two Theological <hi>Questions,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
in the Schools solidly and
subtilly; to the satisfaction of all.
And yet they were not satisfied, for
our <hi>Whitaker</hi> was called again into
the Battel, to defend certain <hi>Theses</hi>

against the opposition and assault of

he rested himself a while in his <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
yet, so as to prepare himself
for more work. And that was cut out
for him, when by the remove of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Chaderton,</hi> from the <hi>Doctoral</hi> to
the <hi>Episcopal Chair,</hi> our <hi>Whitaker</hi> was
chosen <hi>Regius Professor</hi> in his room;
the <hi>Electors</hi> passing by his <hi>Seniors,</hi> and
preferring him, for his great reading
and judgment surpassing his years
and standing. Although this high
dignity was conferred on him, not
by his own ambitious <hi>suit,</hi> but for
his <hi>merit</hi> and worth, and the good
trial the <hi>University</hi> had of him; yet
his <hi>friends</hi> were a little doubtful how
he would bear the <hi>Envy</hi> and burden
of the place: comforting themselves
nevertheless, and hoping good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
as being assured by his <hi>Sobriety</hi>
and <hi>Prudence,</hi> in such years, together
with his industry in Studies, and his
unfeigned Piety and Devotion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nor were they deceived in their
hopes; for no sooner had he settled
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57521:24"/>
him to his <hi>Lectures,</hi> but they found
all things in him, requisite in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Divine, and a most exercised
Professor; various <hi>Reading,</hi> sharp
<hi>Judgment,</hi> easie and pure <hi>Expression,</hi>
sound and solid <hi>Doctrine:</hi> all these
(which indeed are all commendable)
shined forth in his first <hi>prelections.</hi>
Whereupon, his <hi>Fame</hi> is spread
through the <hi>University,</hi> and the <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi>
flock unto him in greater <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
and attend with greater earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and write his <hi>Dictates.</hi> His first
endeavours were in the interpretation
of the three first Chapters of St. <hi>Luke:</hi>
next he ran over all the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the
<hi>Galatians:</hi> then he attempted St.
<hi>Pauls First to Timothy:</hi> whence he
proposed many useful <hi>observations</hi> for
young <hi>Divines:</hi> Lastly, he explained
the <hi>Song of Solomon.</hi> And so laying
aside the Interpretations of <hi>Scriptures,
An.</hi> 1585. <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. he began to bend
his Forces to the <hi>Controversies</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. But before this <hi>An.</hi> 1581. in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57521:25"/>
his answer to <hi>Campians</hi> 10 <hi>Reasons,</hi> he
disarmed that vaunting Adversary;
and after him, replyed to <hi>Duraeus</hi> (who
engaged in the quarrel on <hi>Campians</hi>
behalf) and stopped the mouth of
that railer, using such civility and
wit, and evidence in these two Books,
that <hi>himself</hi> was thereby much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and the <hi>Cause</hi> of our Church
very much advantaged. His next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
was <hi>Saunders,</hi> a notable English
Papist, against whose <hi>demonstrations
of Antichrist,</hi> our <hi>Whitaker</hi> published
an Answer, with an Appendix, his
<hi>Thesis de Antichristo,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
<hi>Doctor.</hi> This Answer to <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
gave him another Adversary,
<hi>Reynolds,</hi> whose aspersions he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to wipe off, and then set upon a
more noble Champion <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. And first he began with the
Controversie <hi>de Scripturis,</hi> which he
proposed <hi>Methodically,</hi> and treated
on <hi>accurately</hi> in six questions, publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by himself, <hi>An.</hi> 1588. So proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
orderly, he went through the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57521:25"/>
Controversies. <hi>De Ecclesia, De conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis,
De Romano pontifice, De Ministris,
De Mortuis, De Ecclesia Triumphante,
De Sacramentis, De Baptismo, De Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistia.</hi>
All which as he had hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Admiration and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of his <hi>Auditors,</hi> so they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had time to revise them, and
set them forth in Print. But the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>
being carried on with a desire
of confuting <hi>Bellarmine</hi> throughout,
laid by his former <hi>Lectures,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at length some convenient time to
publish them: which God was not
pleased to afford him, but took him
away (too soon for us) from fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Battels</hi> in defence of truth, to
receive the <hi>Crown</hi> he had ready for
him. In all those <hi>Controversies,</hi> his
assiduity and diligence was very great,
reading twice or thrice every week in
<hi>Term time,</hi> except hindred by some
weighty business, which seldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and was carefully avoided:
He dealt with his <hi>Adversary</hi> civily,
and ingenuously, not disparaging, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57521:26"/>
making the best of his <hi>Arguments,</hi>
finding out and shewing the <hi>Knot,</hi> and
then dexterously untying it: such was
his <hi>Candor,</hi> that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself is
said to have gratefully acknowledged
it.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Nevertheless, <hi>Stapleton (Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
being silent) finding a sore
place of his (<hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Princip. Doct.</hi>)
gently touched by <hi>Whitaker,</hi> kicks at
him, and casts upon him whole loads
of Reproaches and Slanders, without
wit or modesty, in a Book written (as
he pretends) at his <hi>spare hours,</hi> in
answer to the third Question of the
<hi>second Controversie.</hi> To which <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
speedily prepares a <hi>Reply,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more sharp than his manner
was (for some Diseases must have
strong Medicines) and so fully and
clearly refutes all his Reasons and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
that the <hi>Lovain Doctor</hi> had
no more spare hours, not play days,
to write any more against <hi>Whitaker:</hi>
neither are those mad and unsavory
words, (<hi>Doctor indocte, disputator ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57521:26"/>
professor asinine, Magister men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax,</hi>

the most perfect and most <hi>Modest Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
of our Age.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It is to be wished, that the rest
of <hi>Dr. Whitakers</hi> Writings may come
to light: namely, several <hi>Sermons ad
clerum,</hi> preached in the beginning of
every year: Brief <hi>determinations</hi> of
Theological Questions in the Schools,
very many, and written with his own
hand: Fuller and more exact <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi>
of questions at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement,
of the same number
with his <hi>Latin Sermons:</hi> a Book
against <hi>Stapleton, De originali peccato,</hi>
written fair and prepared for the
Press: The loss of these we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to his <hi>Immature Death.</hi> For by a
winter Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
watching, he contracted a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
whereof he died peaceably,
breathing out his Spirit sweetly as
an infant, and saying, <hi>He desired to
live no longer, unless for Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and the Churches service.</hi> He

2. It was ever esteemed no mean
blessing to be well <hi>descended;</hi> and
though thy Fathers goodness shall
avail thee little, if thou beest not
good, yet it availeth much to
make thee good. Such a good <hi>Father</hi>
had this worthy man, by name Mr.
<hi>Thomas Willet</hi> a grave Divine, who in
his younger time was <hi>Sub-Almoner</hi>
unto that Reverend Prelate Dr. <hi>Cox</hi>
Eleemosynary and Schoolmaster unto
<hi>Edward</hi> VI. our <hi>Englands</hi> young <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
of most blessed memory: After
whose death, Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> being in Exile
during the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> this
Mr. <hi>Willet</hi> was not only deprived of
his Service, but enforced for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to forsake his first Promotion
in the Church of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to the House of a truly
noble Gentleman, who was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Obadiah,</hi> and hid him in those days
of persecution. But when Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> by
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was advanced to
the Bishoprick of <hi>Ely,</hi> his antient
Chaplain then repairs unto him, is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57521:28"/>
lovingly embraced and preferred to a
<hi>Prebend</hi> in his Church: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when a Messenger told the good
<hi>Bishop</hi> the Parson of <hi>Barley</hi> in <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi>
was dead, the <hi>Bishop</hi> replied
<hi>He is not dead.</hi> And when the party
avowed he was dead, the <hi>Bishop</hi> again
replies, <hi>I tell you the Parson of</hi> Barley
<hi>is not dead, for there he sits,</hi> pointing
at Mr. <hi>Willet,</hi> who was then sitting at
the Table.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Rectory</hi> being thus added
to his other means, did now enable
him to do works of Charity: and as
he had freely received, so he freely
gave. He remembred that he had
been the Dispenser of a <hi>Princes Alms,</hi>
and still retained a magnificent mind
that way. His <hi>Wife</hi> was as nobly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and as free. In her elder years,
when her <hi>Children</hi> were disposed of
in the world, her manner was to call
her poor Neighbours in, and feeding
them to say, <hi>Now again have I my

very dexterous and ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any thing well upon the sudden,
his <hi>Orations</hi> were such as gained the
approbation and applause, if not the
admiration of all his Auditors, both
their own and strangers, who knew
the straits of time wherein he was
confined.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After he had spent 13 years in
that University, his Father now grown
old resigned his <hi>Prebend</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Ely,</hi> which by the Favour
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth (sede vacante)</hi>
was conferr'd upon him. Hereupon
he left his <hi>Fellowship,</hi> and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Society of a <hi>Wife,</hi> of the
Kindred of old Doctor <hi>Goad,</hi> Provost
of <hi>Kings Colledge.</hi> In this estate God
bless'd him with a numerous <hi>Issue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. His manner was to arise <hi>early</hi> in
the morning, and to get half way on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57521:29"/>
his Journey before others could get
out; he came down at the hour of
<hi>Prayer,</hi> taking his <hi>Family</hi> with him
to Church (after he was preferred to
the Rectory of <hi>Barley,</hi> upon the death
of his <hi>Father</hi>) there <hi>Service</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
read, either by himself or his
Curate, to the great comfort of his
<hi>Parishioners,</hi> before they went out to
their <hi>daily</hi> Labours. Prayers being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he returns unto his task again
until near dinner time: then he would
recreate himself a while, either play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a little <hi>Organ,</hi> or sporting
with his young <hi>Children;</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he would use <hi>cleaving of Wood</hi>
for exercise of his Body: At his <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
he was always <hi>pleasant</hi> to his
Company, telling some pretty <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme</hi>
or Facete Tale, and seasoning
it with some profitable <hi>Application.</hi>
After dinner his custom was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
himself a little, sometime sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in <hi>Discourse,</hi> sometime <hi>walking</hi>
abroad, and now and then taking some
view of his <hi>Husbandry:</hi> after which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57521:30"/>
straightway to his better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
again till <hi>supper time:</hi> so that
commonly (without extraordinary
avocations) he spent no less than <hi>eight
hours</hi> a day in his Study.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By which long continued course
he had read the <hi>Fathers, Councils, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Histories,</hi> &amp;c. and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Books to the number of 33 (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

those things which you have<gap reason="foreign">

and saving the Readers cost and

and his other <hi>Studies,</hi> he never omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his usual exercise of <hi>Preaching,</hi>
In his younger time he read the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
for three years together in the
Cathedral Church of <hi>Ely;</hi> for one
year in St. <hi>Pauls:</hi> in both with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>Approbation</hi> of a most frequent
Auditory. Sometimes he preached
in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (both <hi>Ad Clerum,</hi> and
<hi>Ad Populum</hi>) discovering himself to
be the only man, <hi>Quem rus non infus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit,</hi>
whom the Country had not
stained: and therefore at his last De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
was chosen to <hi>answer</hi> in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. This being over, he returns to
his people again, daily teaching them
and instructing them in <hi>a plain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
way;</hi> applying himself to their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57521:31"/>
capacity: and though he knew how
to turn his tongue to a <hi>Courtiers</hi> ear,
yet he more affected the simplicity of
plain Preaching. And always in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation
of <hi>Judgments</hi> he would
put on the Bowels of <hi>Compassion,</hi> and
the spirit of <hi>Meekness;</hi> sugaring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bitter <hi>Pill</hi> (like a wise <hi>Physician</hi>)
that it might go down the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly:
neither were his labours in
<hi>vain,</hi> enjoying such a <hi>people</hi> as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Instructions with <hi>delight.</hi> For
there was a sweet harmony between
the <hi>Life and Doctrine</hi> of this Reverend
man, whether we look upon him as
at <hi>home,</hi> or as <hi>abroad</hi> with others.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It was my <hi>happiness</hi> to make
aboad under his roof: his <hi>House</hi> was
a little model of a <hi>Church,</hi> and House
of God: here morning and evening
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered unto God
daily: his <hi>Children</hi> after supper read
some part of Holy Scripture, and he
required of <hi>every one</hi> present, that
they should <hi>remember</hi> some one <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi>
or other; and afterward he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57521:31"/>
himself, as he thought convenient,
would rehearse the same again; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some <hi>exposition,</hi> and now and
then some <hi>Application</hi> to them. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with these <hi>private</hi> exercises of
Piety, no man more religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the <hi>Publick</hi> Congregations than
he did, continually calling upon his
<hi>houshold</hi> to follow him to Gods <hi>Holy
House,</hi> where especially he is to be
worshipped. Besides his endeavour
was, to order his <hi>Family</hi> like a little
<hi>Common-wealth:</hi> He had his <hi>Laws</hi>
and Ordinances set up in <hi>Tables,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his <hi>Family</hi> in their several <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
and Duties both <hi>Oeconomical</hi>
and <hi>Moral;</hi> and in all these things,
so much as might become his place,
he made himself an exact <hi>pattern</hi> and
example to them all.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It may be some <hi>searching eye</hi>
may hap to spy out one trained up
under his good <hi>Discipline,</hi> who yet
peradventure groweth not after the
<hi>seed</hi> first sowen in him. It is a blessed
<hi>gift</hi> of God to have all <hi>good Children,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57521:32"/>
but every man, nay every good man
cannot enjoy it. St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith well,
<hi>Though I keep a watchful Discipline
over my house, yet am I but a man, and
they are men that live under me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dare I arrogate to my self, that my
House should be better than the Ark of</hi>
Noah, <hi>where yet amongst but eight
persons, there was one Reprobate found;
or better than the house of</hi> Abraham,
<hi>or</hi> Isaac, <hi>or</hi> Jacob; <hi>or better than the
Family of Christ our Lord, where was
one</hi> Judas; <hi>or lastly, better than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
when the Angels fell.</hi> Truly
when I call to mind his many <hi>blessings</hi>
of his Children I may use the words
spoken to the Mother of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
a little varied, <hi>Fieri non potest, ut Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
istarum benedictionum pereat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. As for his <hi>Charity</hi> to others, he
entertained two of his nearest <hi>allies,</hi>
being fallen into some want, at his
own Table many years, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for the most part a <hi>Son</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them at the <hi>University.</hi> It
was usnal and <hi>annual</hi> with him, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57521:32"/>
give a dole of <hi>Bread</hi> unto the poor on
the <hi>Coronation day,</hi> and on the <hi>Powder
Treason.</hi> At <hi>Christmas</hi> he gave Corn
to some of the poor of his Parish, to
others <hi>mony,</hi> to others, yea to all the
rest of his Neighbours liberal and
loving <hi>entertainment.</hi> In the time of
<hi>Harvest,</hi> when the Fields were crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Gods Blessings, he would
scatter of his heaps with a full hand,
and a chearful heart among the <hi>Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
who rejoyced at his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Field. If he set any one to
work, no <hi>Master</hi> paid more freely;
nor more speedily than he: if the
poor bought <hi>Corn</hi> of him (as they did
often) they were sure ro gain both in
<hi>price</hi> and <hi>Measure:</hi> if he bought any
thing of them, he would give them
<hi>more</hi> than they demanded; and his
substance <hi>increased</hi> with his bounty.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Had any of his <hi>Neighbours</hi>
suits and troubles abroad, he was their
<hi>Counsellor,</hi> whom they always, even
the meanest found easie of access
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57521:33"/>
                  <hi>friendly</hi> to be spoken with: Had they
need of the assistance of some great
persons, he would <hi>intercede</hi> for them,
either personally, or by Letters: Had
they <hi>Jars</hi> and janglings among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
he would call both parties,
and handle them so with mild and
courteous speeches, that he would
soon <hi>compose</hi> their differences. And
such was his <hi>Humility,</hi> that he would
condescend to any office for their
good: himself would sometimes
write their <hi>Bills amd Bonds,</hi> and other
instruments, to save them <hi>expences.</hi>
And such things being ended, he
would return with great <hi>alacrity</hi> to
his higher Contemplations. Lastly
for the Town of <hi>Barley,</hi> where he
lived, being not able to do what his
heart desired, he gave out of a little
<hi>Tenement,</hi> which he bought, twenty
shillings <hi>per an.</hi> to the poor for ever;
and perswaded some other his richer
<hi>Friends</hi> to a greater liberality to this
same Town. He was indeed a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
perswader to <hi>works of Piety,</hi> but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57521:33"/>
in none more than in soliciting that
old Gentleman Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> to that
Heroick work of his in the erecting
of his <hi>Hospital;</hi> whom he earnestly
desired, not to be like that <hi>Antigonus,</hi>
sirnamed (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the <hi>future giver,</hi>
but to do something in his life. And
doubtless, he during life <hi>projected</hi>
that, which after death was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<hi>effected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. He studied chiefly to do good
unto <hi>poor Ministers,</hi> not only by his
<hi>private bounty,</hi> but he prevailed with
the <hi>Dean</hi> and his fellow <hi>Prebendaries</hi>
of <hi>Ely</hi> to grant considerable <hi>Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
for three <hi>poor Vicars</hi> out of the
<hi>Impropriations</hi> belonging to that
<hi>Church:</hi> and he induced old Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell</hi>
to yield out of his Impropriation
of <hi>Tadlow</hi> ten pounds <hi>per an.</hi> to the
better maintenance of the <hi>Vicar</hi> of
that Town. Never may they want
their due <hi>honour</hi> with men, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
with God, who religiously take
care to cherish and continue these
<hi>good works</hi> so happily begun.</p>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57521:34"/>
17. The exercise of <hi>Hospitality</hi>
was even hereditary to him from his
Parents. This <hi>Abraham</hi> so loved, nay
he loved still, saith <hi>Chrysologus, That he
would scarce think himself happy in
Heav'n if he were depriv'd of the use
of it, if he may not have</hi> Lazarus
<hi>lie in his bosome:</hi> And <hi>Synesius</hi> saith,
<hi>By being harborous he entertained God
himself.</hi> So this liberal and godly man
(whose doors were open to any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of entertainment) enjoyed the
comfort of many happy <hi>Guests,</hi> some
of them <hi>strangers,</hi> men of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who having heard the <hi>Fame</hi> of
him in their own Countries, <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
to see this Land, have in their
way resorted to his house, as <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
of his Acquaintance: But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
his goodness was abused; as
once by a <hi>Jew</hi> entertained in his
house, and seemingly converted, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him <hi>Father,</hi> and pretending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<hi>Baptism;</hi> but when the time of
<hi>Solemnity</hi> was at hand, the <hi>Jew</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and ran away without return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57521:34"/>
thanks to the <hi>Doctor</hi> for all the
courtesies received. Another <hi>Impostor,</hi>
a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> begged his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Instructions, and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
upon <hi>Repentance</hi> to be admitted
to the Holy <hi>Communion;</hi> but when
the time came, this <hi>Guest</hi> appeared
not, and was seen there no more. A
third <hi>Intruder</hi> was a <hi>Separatist,</hi> who
seemed a long time <hi>inclining,</hi> but at
last <hi>sequestred</hi> himself from every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Piety used in the <hi>Family;</hi>
and, though he must be present <hi>at
Grace</hi> for fear of losing his <hi>Dinner,</hi>
would not so much as <hi>uncover</hi> his
head: Which being observed by the
<hi>Doctor,</hi> Grace being ended, he snatch'd
his Hat from his head, and thrust him
out, saying, <hi>He shall not lodge, or eat,
or drink with me, that will not give
God thanks with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. It happened about the end of
<hi>Michaelmas Term, An.</hi> 1621. some
occasions having called him up to
<hi>London,</hi> in the midst of his way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
his Horse stumbling, both
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57521:35"/>
                  <hi>Horse and Rider</hi> fell to the ground; in
which fall his right <hi>Leg</hi> was broken:
being lifted up and set upon his Horse
again, he rode on a little to a Town
called <hi>Hodsdon,</hi> where he turned into
an <hi>Inn,</hi> and sent for a <hi>Bone-setter,</hi> by
whom after his Leg was set, he was
directed to keep his <hi>Bed</hi> ten days:
unto which direction he willingly
submitted, resolving to make that
place his <hi>Study</hi> for the time: and I
had almost said his <hi>Pulpit</hi> too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thus he continued all the ten days,
when (<hi>December</hi> 4.) after the singing
of <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. having occasion for
some ease to stir himself a little, he
suddenly fetch'd a <hi>deep groan,</hi> and fell
into a <hi>Trance.</hi> His <hi>Wife</hi> presently cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out for help, and presently some
came in, and upon means used he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to rouse himself a little, and to
look about: and then uttered these
his (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>last words,</hi> wherein
he breathed out his soul, <hi>Let me alone,
I shall be well, Lord Jesu,</hi>—Next day
his <hi>Body</hi> was conveyed by Coach to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57521:35"/>
his Town of <hi>Barley,</hi> and on the third
day there honourably interred. After
the <hi>Funeral</hi> was over, I remember
well, how the several <hi>Lecturers</hi> of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
in their Courses, for a long time
after, making some worthy <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of their friend departed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
the loss of him, and besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his <hi>Ashes</hi> with their <hi>Tears</hi> before
the People. <hi>Vixit annos</hi> 59.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. HIS right name was <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clough,</hi>
and by that name he
was ordained, as his <hi>Letters of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
witnessed. All the antient <hi>Deeds</hi>
of the <hi>Family</hi> ran in the name of <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clough,</hi>
and his elder Brother so wrote
his name; but evenin his days by the
mistakes of people the word varied
from <hi>Fairclough</hi> to <hi>Faircley,</hi> then to
<hi>Fateley,</hi> and at length to <hi>Featley:</hi>
which name he first owned in print of
all our Family. He was extracted ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
out of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the same <hi>House</hi> do to this day
retain the Primitive name, and give
the same <hi>Coat of Arms</hi> with us. The
name at first rose from that <hi>Fair cliff</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57521:36"/>
where his <hi>Ancestors</hi> long since were
seated: for in the Dialect of that
Country a <hi>Cliff</hi> was antiently written
<hi>Clough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Family of the <hi>Faircloughs</hi>
in former times growing numerous,
their Estate lessened by increase of
their Issue; for the Land was given
by parcels to their Children, and
among those many slips from the first
root, some were transplanted into
other Countries. The good old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> was one whom
providence removed, and placed in
<hi>Oxfordshire. Daniel</hi> his second Son
was born at <hi>Oatmoor,</hi> and being a
studious and ingenious Child, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
at <hi>School</hi> beyond expectation;
insomuch as when he was but twelve
years old, he gained no small credit
and applause by the <hi>Latin and Greek
Verses</hi> which he frequently, wittily,
and elegantly composed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His <hi>Father,</hi> entertaining an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> gained an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to prefer his forward Son to be
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57521:37"/>
also gratified Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> with a <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi>
or Brothers place in the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
whereof he was then <hi>Master.</hi> After
this, the <hi>Archbishop</hi> gave him the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of <hi>Alhallows Broadstreet;</hi> but
by reason of the thickness of <hi>London
Air,</hi> and the many inconveniences
which he daily met with, <hi>his Grace</hi>
yielded to an exchange of <hi>Broad-street</hi>
for <hi>Acton,</hi> six miles from <hi>London,</hi> and
in a pleasant healthful situation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To pretermit his many <hi>Disputes</hi>
with <hi>Fisher,</hi> and other Jesuits, his
<hi>Cygnea Cantio,</hi> his <hi>handmaid to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and many more passages of his
former life, and to hasten to his last
times, in the year 1642. the soft
and wanton <hi>Peace</hi> of our Nation, was
soon turned into rough and bloody
Wars, <hi>Jusque datum sceleri:</hi> at
which time some Parliament <hi>Souldiers</hi>
having first spoiled <hi>Acton</hi> Church,
and the <hi>Doctors</hi> House, pursued him
to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he then resided,
and on the Lords Day (<hi>Feb.</hi> 19.) five
of them rushed into the <hi>Church,</hi> where
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57521:37"/>
he was then to preach, even in the
time of Divine Service, with <hi>Pistols</hi>
and drawn <hi>Swords</hi> to murther him.
But missing the <hi>Doctor</hi> (who had been
advertised of the danger) in their fury
they mortally wounded one of the
Parish, and shot another dead, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out malice against this Reverend
Person, and threatning <hi>to chop him as
small as Herbs to the Pot,</hi> for suffering
the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> (which in high
contempt they called <hi>Porrage</hi>) to be
read in his Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In <hi>Lambeth Church</hi> he so scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Times (according to his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom)
that in <hi>July,</hi> 1643. three Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
<hi>Brownists</hi> there present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
against him no less than <hi>Seven
Articles</hi> to the Committee of plundred
Ministers. The <hi>Articles</hi> are extant in
a Book intituled, <hi>The gentle Lash,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Doctors</hi> Answer. He
began his Answer with this heavy
complaint, <hi>Hoc uno die plus vixi quam
oportuit.</hi> But he comforted himself
with the example of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Prince
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57521:38"/>
of our Salvation, who was consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
through <hi>Afflictions:</hi> And with
that Apology of St. <hi>Cyprian, Nec mihi ignominiosum est pati à meis, quod passus
est Christus; nec illis gloriosum facere,
quod fecit Judas.</hi> In brief, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
were so false, scandalous and
indigested, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
and the <hi>Compiler</hi> of them
dismiss'd with sufficient disgrace.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the <hi>Solemn League and
Covenant,</hi> hatched in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
sent to the <hi>Assembly</hi> of Divines in
<hi>England,</hi> for their concurrence, and
proposed in the <hi>Synod,</hi> our <hi>Doctor</hi>
(being one of the <hi>Members</hi>) in a grave
and learned Speech, and with solid
and judicious <hi>Arguments</hi> so strongly
opposed it, that those who wanted
Learning to <hi>Answer</hi> him, wanted
not malice to <hi>ruine</hi> him. The Reader
may peruse a Book intituled <hi>Sacra
Nemesis,</hi> or, <hi>The Levit's Scourge,</hi> and
there find not only this <hi>Speech</hi> printed
at large, but others of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
as also his <hi>sixteen Reasons for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57521:38"/>
Episcopal Government,</hi> and many other
things well worthy of his notice.</p>
               <p n="9">9. About the middle of <hi>September</hi>
1643. one of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> made Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the <hi>Doctor</hi> under pretence
of friendship, and privately informed
him, as from the <hi>Lord Primate of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi>
at <hi>Oxford</hi> (from whence he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
he was newly come) <hi>That the
King was very much offended at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with the Assembly,</hi> &amp;c. This
pretended <hi>Messenger</hi> seemed to be
grieved for the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and advised
him to write a Letter back to his
<hi>Grace</hi> and acquaint him with some
passages of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of his Majesties leave to continue
his attendance there. Something of a
<hi>Letter</hi> was written, committed to
this trusty <hi>Messenger,</hi> intercepted,
the <hi>Doctor</hi> charged for holding intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and presently Voted both
out of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> and out of his
<hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. On <hi>September</hi> 30. a <hi>Warrant</hi>
(mentioning no Crime) was brought
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57521:39"/>
from the <hi>Committee,</hi> to commit the
poor <hi>Doctor,</hi> whom they so plundred
that he had no more <hi>mony</hi> left him
than one poor five shillings piece of
Gold, which he bestowed on the
Officer that conducted him to <hi>Prison:</hi>
There skipped hastily into his <hi>Livings</hi>
(those who had long gaped for them)
<hi>While</hi> into <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Nye</hi> into <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
Many sad months did our <hi>Doctor</hi>
spend in <hi>Prison</hi> wanting his sweet <hi>Air,</hi>
and the comfortable society of his
<hi>Books and Friends,</hi> and indeed all
things except a good <hi>Conscience,</hi>
which might qualifie the bitterness of
a tedious life.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the height of these his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi>
it happened, that a <hi>Papist</hi> sent
a bold <hi>Challenge</hi> abroad, throwing
dirt in the face of the <hi>Protestant</hi>
Church. The <hi>Parliament</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the answering of it to our <hi>Doctor,</hi>
whom they knew to be well versed in
the matters in question. Had they
first restored him to his <hi>Liberty and
Estate,</hi> this had been a just and noble
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57521:39"/>
                  <hi>encouragement.</hi> But he was a poor
<hi>Israelite</hi> under the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Yoke, and
must be content to abate the <hi>straw,</hi>
yet make the <hi>brick:</hi> only they voted
him the use of his <hi>Books,</hi> three of
them at one time; and by this Vote,
his <hi>Library</hi> was a while preserved, and
himself diverted the irksomness of his
sad Imprisonment. To work he went,
and at length he finished and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his <hi>Answer</hi> to the Challenge,
<hi>Aug.</hi> 1. 1644. in a Book intituled <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Ruens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Nor may I forget another
<hi>Book,</hi> which he had perfected and
published the same year against the
<hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and other Sectaries, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The Dipper Dipt.</hi> Whereat the
Sectaries being enraged, and some
others, threw upon him a foul and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aspersion, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Featley <hi>was
turn'd Papist.</hi> To vindicate himself,
he publish'd his <hi>Manifesto,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
saith, <hi>I have thought fit to make
known to you all whom it may concern,
that being chosen Provost of</hi> Chelsey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Colledge,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57521:40"/>
                  <hi>I have under the Broad
Seal of</hi> England, <hi>a Warrant to buy,
have, and keep all manner of Popish
Books; and that I never bought and
kept any of them, but to the end and
purpose, the betttr to inform my self to
refute them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To which Vindication, in the
same <hi>Manifesto,</hi> he adds this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge:
<hi>whereas I am certainly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that aivers Lecturers and Preachers
in</hi> London <hi>and the Suburbs (who have
entred upon the Labours of many worthy
Divines, and reaped their Harvests) do
in their Pulpits after a most insolent
manner insult upon them, demanding,</hi>
Where are they now that dare stand
up in defence of <hi>Church-Hierarchy,</hi> or
Book of <hi>Common-Prayer;</hi> or any
way oppose or impugn the <hi>new inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Reformation,</hi> both in Doctrine and
Discipline of the Church of <hi>England?
I do here protest, that I do and will
maintain by Disputation, or Writing,
against any of them, these three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi>
viz.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:57521:40"/>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
agreed upon in the year of our
Lord, 1562. by both Houses of
<hi>Convocation,</hi> and ratified by <hi>Queen
Elizabeth,</hi> need no <hi>alteration</hi> at all,
but only an Orthodox <hi>explication</hi>
in some ambiguous phrases, and a
<hi>Vindication</hi> against false aspersions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> established by
many Laws and Acts of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that is, the Government by
<hi>Bishops</hi> (removing all <hi>Innovations</hi>
and <hi>Abuses</hi> in the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
is agreeable to Gods Word,
and a truly antient and <hi>Apostolical</hi>
Institution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there ought to be a <hi>set
Form</hi> of Publick Prayer, and that
the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> (the
<hi>Ralendar</hi> being reformed in point of
<hi>Apocryphal Saints and Chapters,</hi> some
<hi>Rubricks</hi> explained, and some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi>
revised, and the whole cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectedly
Printed; with all the
<hi>Psalms, Chapters,</hi> and <hi>Allegations</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57521:41"/>
out of the Old and new Testament,
according to the <hi>last</hi> Translation) is
the most complete, perfect, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<hi>Liturgy</hi> now extant in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="14">14. Notwithstanding the great
Service, which the Doctor had done
for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
to that Popish Challenge in his
<hi>Roma Ruens,</hi> yet they suffered him to
continue in <hi>Limbo,</hi> in his old Prison.
But when, through bad Air, and bad
Diet, and ill Lodging, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
he fell into a <hi>Dropsie,</hi>
and other Diseases (upon his humble
Petition, and his <hi>Physicians</hi> Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate)
after sixteen weeks attendance
of his Friends, the <hi>House</hi> granted him
an <hi>Order</hi> to remove to the fresh Air
of <hi>Chelsey-Colledge</hi> for six weeks.
Thither he came about the beginning
of <hi>March</hi> 1644. but neither <hi>Physick,</hi>
nor <hi>Air,</hi> nor <hi>Diet,</hi> nor better <hi>Lodging,</hi>
nor <hi>Company,</hi> nor <hi>Cordials,</hi> nor any
thing else could remove his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57521:41"/>
or give him hope of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. There he spun out a short
time in much Piety and <hi>Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi>
although wearied with <hi>pains,</hi>
and worn out with <hi>afflictions;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
none were so grievous to him, as
the presenr <hi>Distractions</hi> in the Church
and State, <hi>April</hi> 14. 1645. he set his
<hi>House</hi> in order, and made his <hi>Will,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
thus: <hi>First, for my soul, I
commend it to him, whose due it is by a
three-fold right: My Creator, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it into me: my Redeemer, who
freely ransomed it with his dearest
Blood: my Sanctifier, who assisteth me
now in my greatest and latest assaults of
temptations,</hi> &amp;c. The next day he
made a Confession of his <hi>Faith</hi> to Dr.
<hi>Loe,</hi> and others, <hi>April</hi> 17. (which
was the <hi>last day</hi> of those <hi>six weeks</hi> his
Enemies had allotted him) his spirit
waxed faint, and drawing near to
death he prayed thus: <hi>Lord, strike
through the reins of them that rise
against the Church and King, and let
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57521:42"/>
them be as chaff before the wind,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>But upon our gracious Sovereign and
his posterity, let the Crown flourish.
This</hi> (said he) <hi>is the hearty and earnest
prayer of a poor sick Creature.</hi>

heavenly <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>Soul</hi> into the hands of his
<hi>faithful Creator,</hi> he fell asleep. But
his <hi>Nephew</hi> coming in, caused a
small dose of <hi>Cordial Spirits</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
to him: which made him
once more to open his eyes, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tears of his mourning Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
said, <hi>Ah Cousin, the poor Church
of God is torn in pieces.</hi> More he said
not, but sweetly and gently groaned
out his wearied and fainting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and resigned his Soul into the
extended Arms of his merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p n="17">17. In <hi>Lambeth-Chappel</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his desire) he was solemnly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
(Dr. <hi>Loe</hi> preached the Sermon,
afterward Printed.) To add a short
<hi>Character</hi> of his Person and Graces:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57521:42"/>
He was low of <hi>stature,</hi> yet of a lovely
graceful <hi>Countenance,</hi> and of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
strength and health of Body:
of a most sweet <hi>disposition,</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable,
and courteous to all, without
the least commixture of that sullen
<hi>morosity</hi> which some men mistake for
<hi>gravity.</hi> He was generally free from
all shews both of <hi>pride and anger:</hi>
only when he disputed with <hi>Hereticks</hi>
and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in defence of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Truth, his <hi>Zeal</hi> and dexterity
made them unjustly suspect, that he
had been <hi>cholerick.</hi> He was a <hi>Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of the learned <hi>Tongues,</hi> and all
the liberal <hi>Arts and Sciences,</hi> most
seriously and soundly <hi>pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout:</hi>
freely <hi>charitable,</hi> both in giving
and forgiving, and a faithful and true
<hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church of England. Ob.

               <p n="1">1, HIS <hi>natural parts</hi> were so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
by Gods great blessing,
as to out-strip many of his rank at
<hi>School,</hi> when he was a Child; and
being quickly removed from School
to the <hi>University,</hi> from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> he there grew
so eminent, as to be called to the <hi>Bar</hi>
betimes with much honour, daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
in repute, and renown, till
he performed his publick <hi>Reading</hi>
with great applause: nor could he
have missed the degree of a <hi>Serjeant,</hi>
had times been as favourable, as his
Worth was great.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though one of the youngest Sons
of his <hi>Father,</hi> and by a second Wife;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57521:43"/>
yet so highly he gained his Fathers
good opinion by his constant <hi>dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
and his known ability and
worth, that long after the Death of
his <hi>Mother,</hi> his Father at his decease
ordained him <hi>sole Executor,</hi> left him
all his <hi>personal Estate,</hi> besides his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>Land,</hi> suitable to the rest
of his Children. Which <hi>overplus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
to him alone, he yet with
such Charity and Tenderness impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Brothers again, that of his
meer voluntary goodness, he gave
them (as I am informed) to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of <hi>two thousand pound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In his <hi>honest industry,</hi> God so
blest him, that he grew to a fortune,
such as scant any of his Family had
the like: yet not to be charged (for
ought I could ever hear) of <hi>ruining</hi>
any Person or Family, or rising by the
fall and impoverishing of others: but
<hi>eminent</hi> for his faithful diligence, and
honest trustiness, and wise secresie, and
abundant sufficiency in his <hi>profession:</hi>
so that great and eminent ones in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57521:44"/>
same profession, and some elder than
he, have repaired to him for his <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
and to be assisted with his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In all the time of his <hi>life and
practice,</hi> never heard I of any, that
could tax him of the least breach of
<hi>trust,</hi> of any <hi>extortion, bribery,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,</hi>
or of being <hi>feed on both sides,</hi>
or for deserting any cause, which he
thought just, for want of his poor
<hi>Clients</hi> purse-ability. Well might he
say with <hi>Samuel, Whose Oxe, or whose
Ass have I taken; or of whose hand
have I received any bribe to blind mine
eyes withal?</hi> Notable late instances
might be given of this, if particulars
of this nature were fit here to be
mentioned.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His <hi>integrity</hi> so great, and his
<hi>abilities</hi> so eminent, could not fail
to have preferred him to a Seat of
<hi>Judicature</hi> among the highest, had
not the tempest of the <hi>Wars</hi> cover'd
him with a cloud. Wherein yet he
preferred his <hi>Conscience</hi> before all
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57521:44"/>
worldly ends; nor followed any side,
because he thought it would prosper,
nor forsake that side, when he saw it
prospered not; but persevered as he
had first engaged, and engaged not
weakly, but <hi>fervently,</hi> actively, and
courageously. And yet so <hi>prudently,</hi>
that though he suffer'd <hi>imprisonment,</hi>
and paid large <hi>Compositions,</hi> yet he
scaped easier than some that were less
active. So great was his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and
in such esteem was his worth had by
the adverse party. I will not say, he
was <hi>courted</hi> by some of them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of <hi>preferment</hi> among them; but
such things have been <hi>averred</hi> in my
hearing; and to my knowledge his
<hi>constancy</hi> was such, the world could
not have wrought him to accept of
promotion against his Conscience, for
all that was offer'd to our <hi>Saviour</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Mountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. During the time of <hi>Wars</hi> and
troubles, though he were far in years,
yet he made no haste to <hi>marry:</hi> no,
nor in times more quiet before the

                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57521:45"/>
to fail him, and <hi>newer</hi> customs to
creep in, which he fansied not: a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi>
receiver of the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a <hi>frequent</hi> Communicant
in <hi>publick,</hi> when he might receive it
in the <hi>beauty of Holiness,</hi> as he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see it. Seldom failed he, at
<hi>three Solemn times</hi> of the year espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
to make one at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
if he were in the Country.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To the suffering party of the
<hi>Clergy,</hi> to those of his own <hi>perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
very loving, kind, respectful and
bountiful. To none, of any sort as I
know, <hi>uncivil,</hi> though in more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner, he favoured and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
<hi>Divines</hi> of known Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Gravity, and Experience; not
much respecting other, whom he
thought <hi>time-serving,</hi> hypocritical,
ignorant, raw, or scandalous.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A friend to <hi>peace</hi> he was,
though his Profession rather thrived
by <hi>strife:</hi> a willing <hi>reconciler</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
up of differences, where both
parties would hear reason, rather
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57521:45"/>
than a <hi>prolonger</hi> of suits. A man,
such as <hi>Moses</hi> would have chosen
for a <hi>Judge, fearing God and hating
covetousness:</hi> hating it not only in
himself, but in others: yea, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
to my knowledge, to displease
some of his very good friends, where
he thought them too worldly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
Very <hi>bountiful</hi> he was to the
poor himself, and would fain have
had all of ability like him. Far from
<hi>flattering,</hi> lying, and soothing up:
Loving <hi>Truth,</hi> and delighted in them
that loved it, as one rightly <hi>sensible</hi>
of the great calamities, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath been involved in, through
the licentious and unconscionable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>lying tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Therefore was he <hi>honoured</hi> and
respected far and near: scant a <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
or <hi>Gentleman</hi> in these parts, that
made not much <hi>use</hi> of him, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
as their <hi>occasions</hi> required,
resorted to him: So that he was the
eminent Beauty, <hi>Ornament,</hi> and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this poor place wherein he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57521:46"/>
liv'd, a <hi>staff</hi> to the poor, a <hi>Counsellor</hi>
to the rich, a <hi>sanctuary</hi> to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
a <hi>terrour</hi> to the unconscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
deceitful, and worldly minded;
a <hi>comfort</hi> to those in need, and to such
as for need desired his help.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Our hearts <hi>sorrow</hi> it was, that
so soon in his bodily health he began
to <hi>decline,</hi> having yet scant added
three years to threescore; but to his
joy in the end it proved, I doubt not.
Near upon two years I have percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him declining; when, as his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
man perished, so his <hi>inward
man</hi> seemed to renew day by day.
During which time he exercised his
<hi>Piety,</hi> addressing himself to read
Books of Religion; his <hi>justice</hi> paying
every one his own. And the four Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Cross, <hi>Humility, Charity,
Patience,</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> appeared
more and more to manifest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in him, the nearer he drew to
his end.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Humility,</hi> for he was courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the meanest, ready to put off,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57521:46"/>
and yield reverence to any as fast as
any to him; nay, to prevent in <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,</hi>
and to give place to some his
inferiours. <hi>Charity,</hi> for he exceeded
in <hi>bounty</hi> to the poor, witness his last
charitable gift to this <hi>Parish,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
pious <hi>Legacies</hi> in his Will to the
value well nigh of <hi>a thousand pound:</hi>
Witness his loving invitation of his
poor Neighbours in his weakness at
<hi>Christmass</hi> last; even when <hi>himself</hi>
could not eat, yet it joyed him to walk
by and see <hi>others</hi> eat and drink at his
cost. And for an eminent proof of his
<hi>Charity,</hi> but a little before he took his
bed in his <hi>last sickness,</hi> he <hi>lent freely</hi>
to one that had dealt falsly enough
with him (and was likely for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be utterly ruin'd by the fraud
of another;) he lent I say to him
notwithstanding a considerable summe
of mony to preserve him from <hi>perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
So notable was his Charity in
returning <hi>good for evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. It pleased God to enlarge his
<hi>Patience</hi> by the manner of his last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57521:47"/>
which, seizing at length on his
Lungs, deprived him of the use of
his <hi>Speech,</hi> for any length or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of speaking: during which
time I never observed in him the least
<hi>impatient</hi> carriage in word or deed, or
any repining at the heavy hand of
God upon him: but silently he <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
himself under the scourge, like
him that said, <hi>I became dumb and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not my mouth, for it was thy
doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. And lastly, for his <hi>Constancy,</hi>
as he approved it in the course of his
<hi>Life,</hi> so to the <hi>Death</hi> constant he was
to the <hi>Religion</hi> he had been born and
bred up in: an obedient Son of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> as he had ever
professed himself to be, and suffered
for it. Heartily he answered to all
<hi>questions</hi> that were asked him about
the profession of his <hi>Faith,</hi> willingly
and readily submitted himself to
<hi>Gods will</hi> for leaving the world, glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgave all that had offended him;
and wherein he had offended any, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57521:47"/>
himself willing to ask for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
and to make <hi>restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Being put in mind of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
he would not for Reverence
sake receive it in the <hi>Evening,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
it till the <hi>next morning,</hi> and
then most piously and devoutly, like
one that bowed the knees of his <hi>heart,</hi>
when those of his <hi>body</hi> failed him,
with eyes lifted up and hands bent to
Heav'n, he received it: and when he
heard after both kinds taken, <hi>Lord
grant it may nourish you to eternal life,</hi>
chearfully and audibly he said, <hi>Amen.</hi>
After which, he dismissed us from
longer praying by him, being desirous
to be left for the present to his own
<hi>private Devotions,</hi> and requested us
<hi>to pray</hi> by him again in the afternoon,
as if he had foreseen the certain time
of his <hi>departure:</hi> and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
according to his own <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
at Prayer we continued by
him till toward five in the evening.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57521:48"/>
At which time, most <hi>meekly and
silently,</hi> and like a Lamb he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and <hi>quietly slept</hi> in the
Lord.</p>

of the <hi>Roman</hi> way: but their <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,</hi>
to my certain knowledge, was
unjust and groundless, he having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
declared and protested, not only
to me, but also to many of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
friends, his <hi>Abhorrence of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
and his sincere Affection and

by Acts of Parliament.</p>

also, a most obedient and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Son to his distressed Mother,

Those, and the foresight of that <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity,</hi>
(wherein <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

L<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Bp of Winchester.</head>
               <p>
                  <bibl>[From D. <hi>Jasper Maine.</hi>]</bibl>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. WHen I look back upon our
<hi>late suffering times</hi> (the
saddest which I think any History
hath recorded) where <hi>oppression</hi>
backt with <hi>power</hi> made the Ruine
of our <hi>Church</hi> the horrid step and
ladder to the Usurpation of the
<hi>Crown,</hi> and where the very name of
<hi>Bishop</hi> was criminal and odious:
And when withal I do consider, by
what <hi>unlookt</hi> for way of <hi>providence</hi>
the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> like a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
snatcht from Shipwreck, was
<hi>stupendiously</hi> restored after many years
confusion: Methinks that <hi>bush,</hi> which
<hi>Moses</hi> saw, was the Emblem of our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57521:53"/>
                  <hi>Church,</hi> kept safe by miracle in the
midst of hungry <hi>fire;</hi> and the ship
in the Gospel was presented to my
eies, where <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>
were lost in a hideous storm: but
he awaked and stilled the <hi>winds,</hi> and
put a calmness to the <hi>Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In those daies of <hi>publick cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>
I saw some take for their Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> and sleep
securely in the storm: Other to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their wretched fortunes <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi>
with the <hi>Tempest,</hi> and made
a <hi>League</hi> and friendship with the
<hi>winds:</hi> others of a <hi>nobler</hi> and more
<hi>Christian</hi> temper (whose just reward
is now to shine like <hi>stars</hi> of honour
in the Church) immoveably <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>
to maintain their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and
<hi>Conscience</hi> with the loss of their <hi>lives,</hi>
as they had already with their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet I hope it will be no <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution</hi>
of their Virtues, if I say, that
the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Carriage in
those times of persecution was to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57521:53"/>
me most remarkable: who by this
happy restitution and addition of
more honour, was made a greater
<hi>Bishop</hi> but not a greater <hi>person,</hi> than
he had been in his lowest ebbe of
Fortune.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The payment of his vow in
building of an <hi>Alms-house</hi> on the
place (at <hi>Richmond</hi>) where himself
so often sate, weeping ore the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
not then pleasant to his eye;
His large bounty to the <hi>Colledge,</hi> of
which I am a member (which if I
should name the <hi>Sum</hi> would make
the world believe he meant to found a
<hi>new</hi> Colledge, and not complete an
<hi>old:</hi>) His <hi>dying liberalities</hi> bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
to others in his <hi>Will,</hi> even to
his meanest <hi>Servants,</hi> who were his
Servants in distress, are things,
which do proclaim him a great
and noble <hi>Benefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But these are but the good deeds
of his <hi>Fortune</hi> done by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> the Charities of one pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with plenty and abundance;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57521:54"/>
his Rents and Mannors share with
him as <hi>Co-founders;</hi> and his new
<hi>Alms-house</hi> might have it written on
the Walls, <hi>A poor Bishop vow'd this
house, but a great and mighty built
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That which made him truly
great and <hi>Reverend</hi> in my eies, was
to look into his <hi>Noble heart,</hi> his
large and bounteous <hi>mind,</hi> where
his good <hi>deeds</hi> now, were then but
<hi>wishes</hi> and designs. He was truly
great to me, when I saw him in his
<hi>poverty</hi> anticipate his Alms-house,
and <hi>liberal</hi> at his door; and the poor
people in his <hi>house</hi> now, had then
places at his <hi>gate:</hi> when being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to his last <hi>cruse of oyl,</hi> he made
the <hi>drops</hi> run to others; and when
there was but a handful of <hi>meal</hi> left
in the little <hi>barrel,</hi> he then dealt his
<hi>loaf</hi> to them that wanted daily bread.
In short, when he had but <hi>two Coats</hi>
left, to give one to the Naked; when
he had hardly more than <hi>one dish,</hi>
to make the poor his guests; to see
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57521:54"/>
him walk on the <hi>Hill</hi> with not much
money in his purse, and return back
with none: But then to think of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up <hi>treasures</hi> in Heaven, when he
had so little left on earth, was a
<hi>Charity</hi> which raised in me a <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
admiration,</hi> and lookt something
like the <hi>Miracle</hi> wrought by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the Gospel, where <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
were sed with two fishes, and
five loaves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Nor may I, without some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
to his Virtues, forbear to let
the world know, That I never saw
<hi>Afflictions</hi> born with a more serene
and even temper, than he did his:
who in the worst of times stood like
a firm unshaken <hi>Rock</hi> in the midst of
angry waves; his <hi>Courage</hi> still the
same, unbroken or undisturbed with
any sad Disasters, not more <hi>publick</hi>
than his own.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Old Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> still
kept up in his <hi>house,</hi> with all its
<hi>Forms and Rites,</hi> though publickly
forbidden: <hi>Prayers</hi> constantly, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57521:55"/>
twice a day, read by him for the
<hi>King;</hi> at a time when such <hi>Devotions</hi>
were made <hi>Treason</hi> by the Tyrant:
and weekly <hi>Sermons</hi> preacht before
him, filled with so much <hi>loyalty</hi> and
truth, as would any where else have
cast the <hi>preacher</hi> into bonds, if not sent
him from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> to the place of
Execution.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To all this, his Lordships con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
kindness <hi>to me,</hi> his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my younger <hi>studies,</hi> which
grew up under his <hi>example,</hi> his <hi>Rescue</hi>
of me from a shipwrack in the late
<hi>undoing</hi> times, when being tost and
stript of all, he was a <hi>plank</hi> to save
me, and threw me out a <hi>line</hi> which
drew me safe to shore, are Reasons
sufficient to let the world receive this
publick Testimony of my Gratitude.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe Death of our late most
Reverend <hi>Primate</hi> the
<hi>Church of Ireland</hi> hath very great
reason to deplore, and we have great
obligation to remember his very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthy deeds done for this poor
afflicted and despised Church. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
that excellent Preacher (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.)
made a Sermon in <hi>Commemoration</hi> of
the <hi>Saints.</hi> For since good men,
while they are alive, have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in <hi>Heaven;</hi> when they are
in Heaven, it is also fit that they
should in their good names live <hi>upon
Earth.</hi> Their great <hi>examples</hi> are
an excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> to the Living:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57521:56"/>
and in praising them when <hi>envy</hi> and
<hi>flattery</hi> can have no interest to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as it is the best <hi>incentive</hi> to
great things, so to conceal what good
God hath wrought by them is great
unthankfulness to God and good
men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This great man, whom God
hath lately taken from our eies, was
bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in <hi>Sidney Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
under Mr, <hi>Hulet,</hi> a grave and
a worthy man: and he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not only a <hi>fruitful plant</hi> by his
great progress in his studies, but
made him another return of <hi>gratitude</hi>
by taking care to provide a good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
for him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
he then began to be greatly interested.
<hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> gave his <hi>Tutor</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Funeral; <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi>
erected a Statue to his: <hi>Gratian</hi> the
Emperour made his Master <hi>Ausoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
to be Consul, and our worthy
<hi>Primate</hi> suffered not the industry of
his <hi>teacher</hi> to pass unrewarded.</p>

                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57521:56"/>
3. Having passed the course of his
studies in the <hi>University,</hi> and done
his Exercise with that Applause
which is usually the reward of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
wits and hard study, he was
remov'd into <hi>Yorkshire:</hi> where
first in the City of <hi>York</hi> he was an
assiduous <hi>Preacher,</hi> but by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Divine providence he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to be engaged at <hi>Northalerton</hi>
in disputation with three pragmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Romish Priests</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
whom he so much worsted in
the <hi>Conference,</hi> and so shamefully
disadvantaged by the evidence of
Truth, represented Wisely and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
that the famous <hi>Primate</hi> of
<hi>York,</hi> Archb. <hi>Matthews,</hi> a learned
and most excellent Prelate, and a
most worthy Preacher, hearing of that
Triumph, sent for him and made him
his <hi>Chaplain.</hi> In whose service he
continued till the Death of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
but in that time had given so
much testimony of his great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Conduct of <hi>Ecclesiastical
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57521:57"/>
and Civil</hi> Assairs, that he grew dear
to his <hi>Master,</hi> and in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made <hi>Prebendary of York,</hi>
and then of <hi>Rippon.</hi> The Dean of
which Church having made him his
<hi>Sub-dean,</hi> he managed the affairs of
that <hi>Church</hi> so well, that he soon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a greater fame, and entred into
the possession of many <hi>hearts,</hi> and
admiration to those many more that
knew him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There and at his <hi>Parsonage,</hi> he
continued long to do the duty of a
Learned and good <hi>Preacher;</hi> and by
his wisedome, eloquence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
so gain'd the <hi>Affections</hi> of
the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons
of that County, that as at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thither upon the blessed <hi>Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of his most Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi>
he knew himself obliged enough and
was so kind as to give them a Visit:
so they by their coming in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to <hi>meet</hi> him, their joyful <hi>recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of him, their great <hi>caressing</hi> of
him when he was there, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57521:57"/>
hopes to enjoy him as their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
their trouble at his departure,
their <hi>unwillingness</hi> to let him go
away, gave signal testimonies that
they were <hi>wise and kind</hi> enough to
understand and value his great worth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But while he lived there, he
may seem like a <hi>Diamond</hi> in the <hi>dust;</hi>
his low fortune cover'd a most valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
person, till he became observ'd
by Sir <hi>Tho. Wentworth,</hi> Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>York,</hi> whom we all knew
for his great excellencies, and his
<hi>great</hi> but <hi>glorious misfortunes.</hi> This
great person espied the great abilities
of Doctor <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and made him
his <hi>Chaplain,</hi> and brought him into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> as one whom he believed
would prove the most fit instrument
to serve in that design, which for two
years before his arrival here, he had
greatly meditated and resolved: the
<hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
of the broken Fortunes of
the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>complaints</hi> were many, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57521:58"/>
                  <hi>abuses</hi> great, the <hi>Causes</hi> of the Church
vastly numerous: but as fast as they
were brought in, so fast they were
by the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> referred back to
Doctor <hi>Bramhall:</hi> Who by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
<hi>pains,</hi> great <hi>sagacity,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<hi>watchfulness,</hi> daily and hourly
<hi>consultations,</hi> reduc'd things to a
more tolerable condition than they
had been left in, by the <hi>Schismatical
principles</hi> of some, and the unjust pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessions
of others, for many years
before. For the <hi>Bishops</hi> were easie to
be oppress'd by those that would, and
they <hi>complained,</hi> but for a long time
had no <hi>helper;</hi> till God raised up
that glorious instrument the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> who brought over with
him as great <hi>affections</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi>
and to all publick <hi>interests,</hi> and as
admirable <hi>abilities,</hi> as ever before his
time did invest and adorn any of the
<hi>Kings Vice-gerents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And God fitted his hand with
an <hi>instrument</hi> as good, as his skill
was great. For the first <hi>Specimen</hi> of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57521:58"/>
his Abilities and diligence, in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of some <hi>lost Tithes,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to his <hi>late Majesty</hi> of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and glorious Memory, it pleased
his Majesty, upon the Death of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
Downham</hi> to advance the <hi>Doctor</hi>
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Derry.</hi> Which
he not only adorned with an excellent
spirit, and a wise Government, but
did more than <hi>double tht Revenue;</hi>
not by taking any thing from them to
whom it was due, but by <hi>resuming</hi>
some of the <hi>Churches Patrimony,</hi>
which by undue means was detained
in unfitting hands.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But his <hi>care</hi> was beyond his
<hi>Diocess,</hi> and his <hi>zeal</hi> broke out to
warm all his Brethren: for by the
favour of the Lord <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> and
his own incessant and assiduous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and wise conduct, he bought in
divers <hi>Impropriations,</hi> cancell'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unjust <hi>alienations,</hi> and did restore
them to a condition much more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable;
I say much more tolerable:
for though he rais'd them above <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:57521:59"/>
yet they were not near to <hi>envy.</hi>
But he knew there could not in all
times be wanting too many, that <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied</hi>
to the <hi>Church</hi> every degree of
prosperity. And for ever, since the
<hi>Church</hi> by Gods blessing, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Religious <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi>
and pious <hi>Nobility,</hi> hath been endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with fair <hi>Revenues,</hi> the <hi>enemy</hi> hath
not been wanting, by pretences of
Religion, to take away <hi>Gods portion</hi>
from the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have heard
from a most worthy hand, that at his
going into <hi>England,</hi> he gave <hi>account</hi>
to the <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury</hi> of
30000<hi>l.</hi> a year, in the recovery of
which he was greatly and principally
instrumental.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But his care was not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the exteriour part only, and
accessories of Religion: he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and he was prosperous in it, to
reduce that Divine and Excellent
Service of our <hi>Church</hi> to publick and
constant Exercise, to Unity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion:
and to cause the <hi>Articles</hi> of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57521:59"/>
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
as the rule of publick confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and perswasions here, that they
and we might be <hi>populus unius labii,</hi>
of one heart and one lip, building up
our hopes of heav'n on a most holy
Faith, and taking away that <hi>Shibbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,</hi>
which made this Church lisp
too undecently. And the excellent
and wise pains he took in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
no man can <hi>dehonestate</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
but he that is not willing to
confess, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England
<hi>is the best Reformed Church in the
World.</hi> God, by the prosperity of
<hi>his labours</hi> and a blessed effect, gave te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
not only of the piety and
wisdom of his purposes, but that he
loves to bless a <hi>wise instructor,</hi> when
he is vigorously employed in a wise
and Religious Lahour.</p>
               <p n="10">10. These were great things, and
matter of great envy. At first the
product was nothing but great <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
at his stupendious <hi>parts,</hi> and
wonder at his mighty <hi>diligence,</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57521:60"/>
observation of his unusual <hi>zeal:</hi> but
this quickly past into the natural
daughters of envy, <hi>obloquy and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
His <hi>zeal</hi> for recovery of the
Church Revenues was called <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and rapine: his care of reducing
Religion to wise and <hi>justifiable</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
was called <hi>Popery and Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi>
and I know not what names,
which signifie what the Authors are
pleas'd to mean, and the people to
construe and to hate. This made him
to walk more <hi>warily,</hi> and do <hi>justly,</hi>
and act <hi>prudently,</hi> and conduct his
Affairs by the measure of <hi>Laws,</hi> as
far as he understood; and indeed
that was a very great way. And
though every <hi>slanderer</hi> could tell a
story, yet none could prove that
ever he receiv'd a <hi>bribe</hi> to blind his
eyes, <hi>to the value of a pair of Gloves.</hi>
It was his own expression, when he
gave <hi>Glory to God,</hi> who had preserv'd
him innocent.</p>
               <p n="11">11. See the greatness of truth and
prudence, and how greatly God
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57521:60"/>
stood with him. When the numerous
Armies of vexed people heaped up
<hi>Catalogues of Accusations;</hi> when the
Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> imitated the
violent procedures of the then disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<hi>English;</hi> when his glorious
<hi>Patron</hi> was taken from his head, and
he was disrobed of his great defences;
when <hi>Petitions</hi> were invited, and
<hi>Accusations</hi> furnished, and <hi>Calumny</hi>
was rewarded and managed with Art
and Power; when there was above
200 <hi>Petitions</hi> put in against him, and
himself <hi>denyed</hi> leave to answer by
word of mouth; when he was long
<hi>imprison'd,</hi> and treated so, that a
<hi>guilty</hi> man would have been broken
into <hi>affrightment,</hi> and pittiful and
low considerations: yet then, he
himself standing almost alone (like
<hi>Callimachus</hi> at <hi>Marathon,</hi> invested
with Enemies, and cover'd with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows)
defended himself beyond all
the powers of guiltiness, even with
the defences of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Innocence,</hi> and answer'd the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57521:61"/>
                  <hi>Petitions</hi> in Writing, sometimes 20
in a day, with so much clearness,
evidence of truth, reality of fact, and
testimony of Law, that his very
<hi>enemies</hi> were asham'd and convinc'd:
they found they had done like <hi>AEsop</hi>'s
<hi>Viper,</hi> they licked the <hi>File</hi> till their
tongues bled, but himself was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>invulnerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. They were therefore to leave
their <hi>Muster rolls</hi> and decline the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
and fall to their<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to
accuse him for going about <hi>to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Fundamental Laws:</hi> the way
by which great <hi>Stafford</hi> and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
fell. Which was a device, when
all reasons fail'd, to oppress the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by the bold <hi>affirmation</hi> of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
they could <hi>not prove.</hi> But the
<hi>Martyr-King, Charles</hi> the first, of
most glorious and eternal memory,
seeing so great a <hi>Champion</hi> likely to
be oppress'd with numbers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
sent what <hi>rescue</hi> he could, his
Royal <hi>Letter</hi> for his Bail, which was
hardly granted to him; and when it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57521:61"/>
was, it was upon such <hi>hard terms,</hi>
that his very <hi>delivery</hi> was a <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
He that does <hi>great things</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid the tongues and teeth of
<hi>Envy:</hi> but if <hi>Calumnies</hi> must pass
for <hi>Evidences,</hi> the bravest <hi>Heroes</hi> must
always be the most reproached per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the world. But God, who
takes care of <hi>Reputations</hi> as he does
of <hi>Lives,</hi> by the orders of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
confutes the slanderer, that the
memory of the <hi>righteous</hi> man might
be embalm'd with <hi>Honour.</hi> And so
it hapned to this <hi>great</hi> man. For by
a publick warrantry, by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
consent of <hi>both Houses</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the Libellous Petitions
against him, the false Records and
publick Monuments of injurious
shame were <hi>cancell'd,</hi> and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd
<hi>in integrum</hi> to that fame, where
his great Labours and just Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
had first instated him. Which
though it was but <hi>justice,</hi> yet it was
also such an <hi>honour,</hi> that it is greater
than the virulence of <hi>tongues,</hi> which
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57521:62"/>
                  <hi>Stratagem,</hi> they did in part by <hi>open
Force:</hi> they turned the <hi>Bishop</hi> out
of the Town, and upon trifling and
unjust pretences search'd his <hi>Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi>
and took what they pleas'd, till
they were asham'd to take more.
However though the usage was <hi>sad,</hi>
yet it was <hi>recompenc'd</hi> to him by his
taking <hi>Sanctuary in Oxford;</hi> where
he was graciously receiv'd by that
most incomparable and divine <hi>Prince:</hi>
But having serv'd the King in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
by his Pen, and by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and by his Interest, he return'd
back to <hi>Ireland;</hi> where under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
conduct of <hi>his Grace,</hi> the now
Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque
and fortune of <hi>oppressed Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. But God having still resolv'd
to afflict us, the good man was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into the fortune of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi>
to leave his Country, and his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and seek for safety and bread in
a <hi>strange Land.</hi> He was not asham'd
to <hi>suffer,</hi> where the <hi>Cause</hi> was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and glorious. Thus God
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57521:62"/>
provided for the needs of his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>sent a man,</hi> who could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<hi>comfort</hi> to the afflicted, and
<hi>courage</hi> to the persecuted, and <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the tempted, and <hi>strength</hi> to
that Religion, for which they all
suffered.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And here this great man was
indeed <hi>triumphant,</hi> for so it was, that
he stood in publick and brave defence
for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the
<hi>Church of England.</hi> There wanted
not diligent <hi>Tempters</hi> in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who taking advantage of
the <hi>Afflictions</hi> of his <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi>
(in which state men commonly <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
every thing, and like men in <hi>sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
are willing to change <hi>from side
to side,</hi> hoping for ease and finding
none) flew at <hi>Royal Game,</hi> and hop'd
to draw away the King from that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which his most Royal Father,
the <hi>best Man</hi> and the <hi>wisest Prince</hi> in
the world, had seal'd with the <hi>best</hi>
Blood in Christendom; and which
himself suck'd in with his <hi>Education,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57521:63"/>
and had <hi>confirmed</hi> by choice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and <hi>confess'd</hi> publickly and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and hath since <hi>restor'd</hi> prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously.
<hi>Millitier</hi> was the man, witty
and bold enough to attempt a zealous
and a foolish undertaking; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd
himself with <hi>ignoble</hi> indeed,
but <hi>witty Arts,</hi> to perswade the
<hi>King</hi> to leave what was dearer to
him than his <hi>eyes.</hi> It is true, it was
a <hi>Wave</hi> dash'd against a <hi>Rock,</hi> and an
<hi>Arrow</hi> shot against the <hi>Sun,</hi> it could
not reach him: but the <hi>Bishop of Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
turn'd it also, and made it fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Shooters <hi>head.</hi> For he made so
ingenious, so learned, and so acute
<hi>Reply</hi> to that Book, he so discover'd
the <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
the <hi>Arguments,</hi> stated the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,</hi>
demonstrated the <hi>Truth,</hi> and
shamed their <hi>Procedures,</hi> that nothing
could be a greater Argument of the
<hi>Bishops</hi> Learning, great Parts, deep
Judgment, quickness of Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and sincerity in the <hi>Catholick and
Apostolick Faith,</hi> or of the Follies
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57521:63"/>
and Prevarications of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. But this most Reverend <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
found a nobler adversary, and a
braver Scene for his Contention. He
found that the <hi>Roman Priests,</hi> being
wearied and baffled by the wise Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and pungent Arguments of
the <hi>English Divines,</hi> studiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
any more to dispute the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
questions</hi> against us, but fell at
last upon a <hi>general charge,</hi> imputing
to the <hi>Church of England</hi> the great
crime of <hi>Schism;</hi> and by this they
thought they might with most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
deceive unwary and unskilful
Readers: for they saw the <hi>Schism,</hi>
and they saw we had left them; and
because they consider'd not the <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
they resolved to out-face us in
the <hi>Charge.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> now, having
an <hi>Argument</hi> fit to employ his great
abilities, undertakes the question,
and in a full Discourse proves the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> not only to be <hi>guilty
of the Schism,</hi> by making it necessary
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57521:64"/>
to depart from them; but they did
actuate the <hi>Schism,</hi> and themselves
made the <hi>first separations</hi> in the
great point of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy;</hi>
which was the <hi>palladium</hi> for which
they principally contended. He made
it appear, that the <hi>Popes of Rome</hi>
were <hi>Usurpers</hi> of the Rights of Kings
and Bishops, that they brought in
<hi>new Doctrines</hi> in every Age, that they
impos'd their own <hi>devices</hi> upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
as <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith; that
they prevaricated the Doctrines of
the Apostles; that the <hi>Church of
England</hi> only return'd to her Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
purity, that she joyn'd with
Christ and his Apostles, that she
agreed in all the sentiments of the
<hi>Primitive Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. The old <hi>Bishop of Chalcedon,</hi>
known to many of us, replyed to
this excellent Book, but was soon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
by a Rejoynder made by the
Lord <hi>Bishop of Derry;</hi> in which he so
pressed the former <hi>Arguments,</hi> refuted
the <hi>Cavils,</hi> brought in so many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impregnable
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57521:64"/>
                  <hi>Authorities</hi> and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and added so many moments
and weights to his Discourse, that the
<hi>pleasures</hi> of reading the Book would
be the greatest, if the <hi>profit</hi> to the
Church of God were not greater.
Whenever men will desire to be <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
in those great questions, the <hi>Bishop
of Derry's</hi> Book shall be their <hi>Oracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. I will not insist upon his other
<hi>excellent Writings;</hi> but it is known
every where, with what Piety and
<hi>acumen</hi> he wrote against the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaean</hi>
Doctrine of <hi>fatal necessity,</hi>
which a late <hi>witty man</hi> had pretended
to adorn with a new Vizor: but this
<hi>excellent person</hi> washed off the <hi>ceruss</hi>
and the meretricious paintings, rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
well asserted the Oeconomy of the
<hi>Divine Providence;</hi> and, having once
more <hi>triumph'd</hi> over his Adversary,
betook himself to the more agreeable
attendance upon <hi>Sacred Offices;</hi> and
having usefully and wisely discoursed
of the Sacred Rite of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
hands upon the most illustrious
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57521:65"/>
Princes the <hi>Dukes of</hi> York <hi>and</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,
and the <hi>Princess Royal,</hi> and
ministred to them the promise of the
Holy Spirit, and ministerially esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
them in the Religion and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Holy <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. And one thing more I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that at his leaving those parts
upon the <hi>Kings Return,</hi> some of the
<hi>Remonstrant</hi> Ministers of the Low-Countries
coming to take their leaves
of his great man, and desiring that
by his means the <hi>Church of England</hi>
would be kind to them: He had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to grant it, because they were <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men,</hi> and in many things of a
<hi>most excellett Belief;</hi> yet he reproved
them, and gave them <hi>caution</hi> against
it, that they approached too near,
and gave too much countenance to
the great and dangerous errours of
the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. He thus having serv'd God and
the King abroad, God was pleas'd to
return to the King and to us all, as in
the days of old, and we sung the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57521:65"/>
Song of <hi>David, In convertendo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatem
Sion.</hi> When King <hi>David</hi> and
all his Servants returned to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
this great person, having trod in
the <hi>Wine-press,</hi> was called to drink of
the <hi>Wine;</hi> and as an <hi>honorary Reward</hi>
of his great Services and Abilities
was chosen <hi>Primate</hi> of this National
Church. He had this Remark in all
his Government, that as he was a
great hater of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> so he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself a publick enemy to
<hi>non-residence,</hi> and religiously against it,
allowing it in no case but of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or the <hi>greater good</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p n="22">22. There are great things spoken
of his Predecessor St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that he
founded 700 Churches and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Covents, that he ordained
5000 <hi>Priests,</hi> and with his own
hands Consecrated 350 <hi>Bishops.</hi> How
true the story is I know not, but
we are all witnesses that the late <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
whose memory we now Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate,
did by an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57521:66"/>
of Providence in one day,
consecrate <hi>two Archbishops and ten
Bishops,</hi> and did benefit to almost all
the Churches in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was
greatly instrumental to the <hi>endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the whole <hi>Clergy,</hi> and in
the greatest <hi>abilities</hi> and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>industry</hi> was inferiour to none of
his most glorious <hi>Antecessors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. The <hi>Character</hi> which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of that Learned Primate <hi>Richard
of Armagh</hi> by <hi>Trithemius</hi> does exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fit this our <hi>Father: Vir in divinis,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>He was learned in the Scriptures,
skilled in secular Philosophy, and not
unknowing in the Civil and Canon
Laws</hi> (in which studies I wish the
<hi>Clergy</hi> were with some carefulness
and diligence still more conversant:)
<hi>He was of an excellent Spirit, a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in his Discourses, an early and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Preacher to the People.</hi> And, as
if there were a more particular <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
between their souls, our <hi>Primate</hi>
had so great a veneration to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that he purposed, if he had
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57521:66"/>
lived, to have restor'd his <hi>Monument</hi>
in <hi>Dundalk,</hi> which time or impiety
or unthankfulness had either omitted
or destroyed. So great a lover he was
of all true and inherent worth, that
he loved it in the very <hi>memory of the
Dead,</hi> and to have such great <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
transmitted to the intuition and
imitation of <hi>Posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. At his coming to the <hi>Primacy,</hi>
he knew he should at first espy little
besides the <hi>ruines</hi> of Discipline, a
Harvest of Thorns and <hi>Heresies,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
in the hearts of the people,
the <hi>Churches</hi> possessed by Wolves and
Intruders, mens hearts greatly <hi>estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
from true Religion: and therefore
he set himself to <hi>weed</hi> the Fields of
the Church. He treated the <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi>
sometimes <hi>sweetly,</hi> sometimes
he confuted them <hi>learnedly,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he rebuked them <hi>sharply.</hi> He
visited his <hi>Charges</hi> diligently, and in
his own <hi>person,</hi> not only by proxies
and instrumental <hi>deputations:</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
nothing, that we know of, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57521:67"/>
the <hi>Redintegration of Religion,</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of <hi>collapsed</hi> Discipline, and the
renovation of the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God in the Churches: and
still he was <hi>indefatigable,</hi> and, even in
the last Scene of his life, not willing
that God should take him <hi>unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. The last of <hi>January</hi> God sent
him a brisk alarm of Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he made his <hi>Will;</hi> in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the prudence and <hi>presence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
manifested in making a just and
wise settlement of his <hi>Estate,</hi> and
provisions for his <hi>descendants,</hi> at
midnight and in the trouble of his
sickness, and circumstances of <hi>addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
death,</hi> he kept still a special sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
and made <hi>confession</hi> of Gods
admirable mercies, and gave thanks,
that God had permitted him to live
to see the blessed <hi>Restauration</hi> of his
<hi>Majesty</hi> and the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
confessed his <hi>Faith</hi> to be the same as
ever, gave <hi>praises</hi> to God that he was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57521:67"/>
born and bred up in <hi>this Religion,</hi> and
prayed to God, and hoped he should
die in the <hi>Communion</hi> of this Church,
which he declared to be the <hi>most pure
and Apostolical Church in the whole
world.</hi> He prayed to God to pardon
his frailties and infirmities, relyed
upon the Mercies of God, and the
Merits of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and with a
singular sweetness <hi>resign'd</hi> up his soul
into the hands of his Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But God, who is the great
<hi>Choragus</hi> and Master of the <hi>Scenes</hi> of
Life and Death, was not pleas'd to
draw the Curtains: There was an
<hi>Epilogue</hi> to his life, yet to be acted
and spoken. He returned to <hi>Actions</hi>
of Life, and went on in the methods
of the same <hi>procedure</hi> as before, was
desirous still to <hi>establish</hi> the Affairs
of the Church, complain'd of some
<hi>disorders</hi> which he purposed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
girt himself to the work: but
though his <hi>Spirit</hi> was willing, yet his
<hi>Flesh</hi> was weak, and he was <hi>heavy
unto death,</hi> and look'd for the last
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57521:68"/>
warning, which seiz'd on him in the
<hi>midst</hi> of business; and though it was
<hi>sudden,</hi> yet it could not be <hi>unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
or unprovided by surprize; and
therefore could be no other than that
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>which <hi>Augustus</hi> used to
wish unto himself, <hi>a civil and well
natur'd death,</hi> without the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of troublesome circumstances.
His <hi>passive</hi> fortitude had been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
tryed before, and therefore
there was the less need of it now; his
<hi>active</hi> Graces had been abundantly
demonstrated by the great and good
things he did; and therefore his last
Scene was not so laborious: but God
call'd him away, something after the
manner of <hi>Moses,</hi> which the Jews
express by <hi>osculum oris Dei,</hi> the kiss of
Gods mouth, that is, a death indeed
<hi>foresignified,</hi> but gentle and serene,
and without temptation.</p>
               <p n="27">27. To sum up all, he was a wise
<hi>Prelate,</hi> a learned <hi>Doctor,</hi> a just
<hi>Man,</hi> a true <hi>Friend,</hi> a great <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor</hi>
to others, a thankful <hi>Beneficiary</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:57521:68"/>
where he was obliged himself. He
was a faithful <hi>Servant</hi> to his Masters,
a loyal <hi>Subject</hi> to the King, a zealous
<hi>Assertor</hi> of his Religion against <hi>Popery</hi>
on the one side, and <hi>Fanaticism</hi> on the
other. The practice of his Religion
was not so much in <hi>form</hi> and exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Ministeries (though he was a
great observer of all the publick <hi>Rites</hi>
and Ministeries of the Church) as it
was in <hi>doing good</hi> for others. He had
the sate of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he
passed <hi>through evil report and good
report, as a deceiver, and yet true.</hi> He
was a man of great business and great
resort: he divided his life into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
and his <hi>Book:</hi> he took care of
his <hi>Churches</hi> when he was alive, and
even after his death, having left 500 <hi>l.</hi>
for the repair of his <hi>Cathedral of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda.</hi>
He was an excellent <hi>Scholar,</hi>
and rarely well accomplished: first
instructed to great excellency by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts,</hi> and then consummated by
<hi>study and experience. Melancthon</hi> was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57521:69"/>
us'd to say, that himself was a <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
Pomeranus</hi> a <hi>Grammarian, Justus
Jonas</hi> an <hi>Orator,</hi> but that <hi>Luther</hi> was
all these. It was greatly true of him,
that the single perfections, which
make many men eminent, were <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
in this Primate, and made him <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious.</hi>
It will be hard to find his
<hi>equal</hi> in all things: for in him were
visible the great lines <hi>of Hookers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciousness,</hi>
of <hi>Jewels Learning,</hi> and
of the <hi>Acuteness</hi> of Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi>
He <hi>wrote</hi> many things fit to be read,
and <hi>did</hi> very many things worthy to
be <hi>written;</hi> which if we wisely <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi>
we may hope to meet him in
the Resurrection of the <hi>Just.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. HE was born at <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and brought up in the <hi>Free-School</hi>
there, and was ripe for the
<hi>University,</hi> afore Custom would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of his admittance: but by that
time he was <hi>thirteen</hi> years old, he
was entred into <hi>Caius Colledge,</hi> and as
soon as he was <hi>Graduate,</hi> he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<hi>Fellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He was a <hi>Man</hi> long afore he
was of Age, and knew little more of
the state of <hi>Childhood,</hi> than its <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
and pleasantness. From the
<hi>University,</hi> by that time he was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
of <hi>Arts,</hi> he removed to <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:57521:70"/>
and became publick <hi>Lecturer</hi> in the
Church of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> where he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to the admiration and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Auditory: and by his
florid and youthful <hi>Beauty,</hi> and sweet
and pleasant <hi>Air,</hi> and sublime and
rais'd <hi>Discourses,</hi> he made his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
take him for some young <hi>Angel,</hi>
newly descended from the visions of
Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Fame</hi> of this new <hi>Star,</hi>
that out-shone all the rest of the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi>
quickly came to the notice
of the great <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
who would needs have him <hi>Preach</hi>
before him; which he performed not
less to his wonder than satisfaction.
His <hi>Discourse</hi> was beyond exception,
and beyond imitation. Yet the wise
<hi>Prelate</hi> thought him <hi>too young:</hi> But
the great youth humbly beg'd <hi>his
Grace to pardon that fault, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
if he liv'd, he would mend it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. However the grand <hi>Patron</hi> of
Learning and ingenuity, thought it
for the advantage of the world, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57521:70"/>
such mighty <hi>parts</hi> should be afforded
better opportunities of study and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
than a course of constant
<hi>Preaching</hi> would allow of. And to
that purpose he plac'd him in the
Colledge of <hi>All-Souls</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi>
where <hi>love</hi> and <hi>admiration</hi> still waited
upon him: which so long as there is
any spark of <hi>Ingenuity</hi> in the breasts
of men, must needs be the insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>attendants</hi> of so extraordinary a
worth and sweetness.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He had not been long here afore
my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the Rectory of <hi>Upingham</hi> in
<hi>Rutland-shire,</hi> and soon after preferr'd
him to be Chaplain to <hi>King Charles</hi>
the <hi>Martyr</hi> of Blessed and immortal
Memory. Thus were <hi>Preferments</hi>
heaped upon him, but still less than
his deserts: and that not through
the fault of his great <hi>Masters,</hi> but
because the amplest Honours and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
were <hi>poor,</hi> and inconsiderable,
compar'd with the greatness of his
worth and merit.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57521:71"/>
6. This <hi>great man</hi> had no sooner
launch'd out into the world, but a
fearful <hi>tempest</hi> arose, and a barbarous
and unnatural <hi>War</hi> disturb'd a long
and uninterrupted <hi>Peace</hi> and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
and brought all things into
<hi>disorder</hi> and <hi>confusion.</hi> But his <hi>Religion</hi>
taught him to be <hi>Loyal,</hi> and engaged
him on his Princes side: whose <hi>cause</hi>
and quarrel he always owned, and
maintain'd with a great <hi>courage</hi> and
<hi>constancy:</hi> till at last, he and his little
<hi>Fortune</hi> were shipwrack'd in that
great <hi>Hurricane,</hi> that over-turn'd
both <hi>Church and State.</hi> This fatal
<hi>storm</hi> cast him ashore in a private
corner of the world, and a tender
<hi>Providence</hi> shrouded him under her
wings; and the <hi>Prophet</hi> was fed in
the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and his great <hi>worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
procur'd him <hi>friends</hi> that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
him with bread and necessaries.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In this <hi>solitude</hi> he began to
write those excellent <hi>Discourses,</hi> which
are enough of themselves to furnish a
<hi>Library,</hi> and will be famous to all
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57521:71"/>
succeeding Generations for their
greatness of <hi>Wit,</hi> and profoundness
of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and richness of <hi>Fansie,</hi>
and clearness of <hi>Expression,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piousness
of <hi>Invention,</hi> and general
<hi>usefulness</hi> to all the purposes of a
<hi>Christian.</hi> And by these he soon got
a great <hi>Reputation</hi> among all persons
of judgment and indifferency; and
his <hi>Name</hi> will grow greater still, as
the world grows better and wiser.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When he had spent some years
in this <hi>retirement,</hi> it pleased God to
visit his Family with <hi>Sickness,</hi> and to
take to himself the dear pledges of
his favour, <hi>three Sons</hi> of great hopes
and expectations, within the space
of two or three months. And though
he had learn'd a quiet submission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Divine will,</hi> yet the <hi>Affliction</hi>
touch'd him so sensibly, that it made
him desirous to leave the Country:
And going to <hi>London,</hi> he there met
my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> a person of great
Honour and Generosity, who making
a kind profer, the good man embrac'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57521:72"/>
it, and that brought him over into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and settled him at <hi>Portmore,</hi>
a place made for study and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
which he therefore dearly
loved. And here he wrote his <hi>Cases of
Conscience;</hi> a Book that is able alone
to give its Author <hi>Immortality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. By this time the wheel of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
brought about the <hi>Kings</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<hi>Restauration,</hi> and there began a
new world, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God
mov'd upon the face of the <hi>Waters,</hi>
and out of a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> brought
forth Beauty and Order, and all the
<hi>three Nations</hi> were inspir'd with a
new Life, and became <hi>Drunk</hi> with an
excess of <hi>Joy.</hi> Among the rest, this
<hi>Loyal Subject</hi> went over to Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Prince and Peoples Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and bear a part in the <hi>Universal
Triumph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. It was not long after his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty</hi> began the settlement of
the Church, and the Great Doctor
<hi>Jeremey Taylor</hi> was resolv'd upon, for
the Bishoprick of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Conor,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:57521:72"/>
and not long after <hi>Dromore</hi> was added
to it. And it was but reasonable that
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> should consider
their <hi>Champion,</hi> and reward the pains
and sufferings he underwent in the
defence of their Cause and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p n="11">11. With what <hi>care and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
he discharg'd his <hi>Office,</hi> we are
all his witnesses; what good <hi>Rules</hi>
and Directions he gave his <hi>Clergy,</hi> and
how he taught us the practice of them
by his own <hi>Example.</hi> Upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over <hi>Bishop,</hi> he was made a <hi>Privy
Counsellor,</hi> and the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
gave him their Testimony, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
him for their <hi>Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor;</hi>
which honourable Office he
kept to his dying day.</p>
               <p n="12">12. During his being in this <hi>See,</hi>
he wrote several excellent Discourses,
particularly his <hi>Disswasive from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
(which was received by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Approbation) and a <hi>Vindication</hi>
of it from some impertinent Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
that pretend to <hi>answer</hi> Books,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57521:73"/>
when there is nothing towards it,
more than the very <hi>Title Page.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. This great <hi>Prelate</hi> improv'd
his <hi>Talent</hi> with a mighty industry, and
managed his <hi>Stewardship</hi> rarely well:
and his <hi>Master,</hi> when he call'd for
his Accounts, found him busie, and
at his work, and employ'd upon an
excellent Subject, <hi>A Discourse upon the
Beatitudes:</hi> Which if finish'd, would
have been of great use to the world,
and solv'd most of the <hi>Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
that occur to a <hi>Christian,</hi> in all
the varieties of states and conditions.
But the <hi>All-wise God</hi> hath ordained it
otherwise, and hath call'd home his
good Servant, to give him a portion
in that blessedness that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
hath promised to all his faithful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Followers.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thus having given you a brief
account of his <hi>Life,</hi> I will add a
<hi>Character</hi> of his person; although
the Subject can hardly be reach'd by
any expressions; for he was none of
Gods ordinary works, but his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57521:73"/>
were so many and so great,
as really made him a <hi>Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Nature</hi> had befriended him
much in his constitution, for he was
a person of a most sweet and obliging
<hi>Humour,</hi> of great <hi>Candour</hi> and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity;
and there was so much of
<hi>Salt,</hi> and fineness of Wit, and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
of address in his familiar Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
as made his <hi>Conversation</hi>
have all the pleasantness of a <hi>Comedy,</hi>
and all the usefulness of a <hi>Sermon.</hi>
His <hi>Soul</hi> was made up of <hi>Harmony.</hi>
and he never spake, but he charm'd
his Hearer not only with the clearness
of his <hi>Reason,</hi> but all his words, and
his very <hi>Tone</hi> and <hi>Cadencies</hi> were
strangely <hi>Musical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. But that which did most of all
captivate and enrich, was the <hi>gaiety</hi>
and <hi>richness</hi> of his <hi>Fansie.</hi> For he
had much in him of that <hi>natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,</hi>
that inspires all great <hi>Poets</hi>
and <hi>Orators;</hi> and there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>ferment</hi> in his Blood and Spirits
that set his <hi>Fansie</hi> bravely a work, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57521:74"/>
made it swell, and teem, and become
pregnant to such degrees of Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy,
as nothing, but the greatness
of his <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> could have
kept it within due bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And indeed it was a <hi>rare mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and a single instance, hardly to
be found in any Age. For the great
<hi>Tryer of Wits</hi> has told us, That there
is a peculiar and several <hi>Complexion</hi>
requir'd for <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and
<hi>Fansie:</hi> and yet you might have
found all these in this great Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
in their eminency and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But that which made his Wit
and Judgment so considerable, was
the largeness and freedom of his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
For <hi>Truth</hi> is plain and easie to
a mind disintangled from <hi>Superstition</hi>
and <hi>prejudice.</hi> He was one of the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a sort of brave Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
that <hi>Laërtius</hi> speaks of, that
did not addict themselves to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Sect, but <hi>ingenuously</hi> sought
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57521:74"/>
for Truth among all the wrangling
Schools. And they found her mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
torn and <hi>rent to pieces,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
into rags, by the several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
parties, and so <hi>dis-figur'd and
mishapen,</hi> that it was hard to know
her; but they made a shift to gather
up her <hi>scatter'd Limbs,</hi> which as soon
as they came together, by a strange
sympathy and connaturalness, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
united into a lovely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. This was the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this great
man, he weighed mens <hi>Reasons,</hi> and
not their <hi>Names,</hi> and was not scar'd
with the ugly <hi>Vizars,</hi> men usually put
upon <hi>persons</hi> they hate, and <hi>opinions</hi>
they dislike; nor affrighted with the
<hi>Anathema's</hi> and Execrations of an
<hi>Infallible Chair;</hi> which he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only as <hi>Bugbears</hi> to terrifie weak
and childish minds. He consider'd,
that it is not likely any <hi>one</hi> party
should wholly <hi>engross</hi> Truth to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that <hi>Obedience</hi> is the only way
to true <hi>knowledge</hi> (which is an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57521:75"/>
that he hath manag'd rarely
well, in that excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> of his
which he calls <hi>Via intelligentiae:</hi>)
that God always and only teaches <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and ingenuous</hi> minds, that are
willing to hear, and ready to obey
according to their <hi>Light:</hi> that it is
impossible, a pure, humble, resigned,
<hi>God-like Seul</hi> should be kept out of
<hi>Heav'n,</hi> whatever mistakes it might
be subject to in this state of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that the design of Heav'n is not
to fill mens <hi>Heads,</hi> and feed their <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities,</hi>
but to better their <hi>Hearts</hi>
and mend their <hi>Lives.</hi> Such conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as these made him <hi>impartial</hi>
in his disquisitions, and give a due
allowance to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi>
and contend for <hi>Truth</hi> and
not for <hi>Victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. To these advantages of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and excellency of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> he
added an indefatigable <hi>Industry,</hi> and
God gave a plentiful <hi>Benediction:</hi> for
there were very few kinds of Learning
but he was a <hi>Mystes,</hi> and a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in them.</p>
               <p n="21">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:57521:75"/>21. He was a rare <hi>Humanist,</hi> and
hugely verst in all the <hi>polite</hi> parts of
Learning, and had throughly conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
all the antient <hi>Moralists, Greek,</hi>
and <hi>Roman, Poets,</hi> and <hi>Orators;</hi> and
was not unacquainted with the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Wits of the later Ages, whether
<hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Italian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. But he had not only the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> but
so <hi>universal</hi> were his <hi>parts,</hi> that they
were proportion'd to every thing.
And though his Spirit and Humour
were made up of <hi>smoothness</hi> and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness,
yet he could bear with the
harshness and <hi>roughness</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi>
and was not unseen in their subtilties
and <hi>spinosities,</hi> and upon occasion
could make them serve his purpose:
And yet, I believe, he thought many
of them very near a kin to the <hi>Famous
Knight</hi> of the <hi>Muncha,</hi> and would
make sport sometimes with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick</hi>
Sophistry, and <hi>phantastick</hi>
Adventures of <hi>School-Errantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. His skill was great, both in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57521:76"/>
the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon Law,</hi> and <hi>Casuisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Divinity:</hi> And he was a rare <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor</hi>
of Souls, and knew how to
<hi>counsel,</hi> and to advise; to solve dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and determine <hi>Cases,</hi> and
quiet <hi>Consciences.</hi> And he was no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi>'s <hi>new Science of
Controversie:</hi> but could manage an
Argument, and make <hi>reparties</hi> with
a strange dexterity. He understood
what the several <hi>Parties</hi> in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
have to say for themselves; and
could plead their cause to better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
than any <hi>Advocate</hi> of their
Tribe; and when he had done, he
could <hi>confute</hi> them too, and shew,
that better <hi>Arguments</hi> than ever
they could produce for themselves,
would afford no sufficient ground for
their fond <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. I shall adde only his great
acquaintance with the <hi>Fathers</hi> and
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Writers, and the <hi>Doctors</hi>
of the first and purest Ages both of
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church; which
he has made use of against the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57521:76"/>
to vindicate the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from the Challenge of <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and prove her to be truly <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Apostolical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. But <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtùe</hi> is the
Crown of all other Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and it was the <hi>Glory</hi> of this
great man, to be thought a <hi>Christian,</hi>
and whatever you added to it, he
look'd upon as a term of <hi>diminution.</hi>
And yet he was a <hi>zealous</hi> Son of the
<hi>Church of England;</hi> but that was,
because he judg'd her, (and with
great reason) a Church the <hi>most pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christian</hi> of any in the world.</p>
               <p n="26">26. In his younger years he met
with some assaults from <hi>Popery,</hi> and
the high pretensions of their <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Orders</hi> were very accommodate
to his <hi>devotional Temper.</hi> But he was
always so much <hi>Master</hi> of himself,
that he would never be govern'd by
any thing but <hi>Reason,</hi> and the evidence
of <hi>Truth:</hi> which engag'd him in the
study of those <hi>Controversies;</hi> and to
how good purpose, the <hi>world</hi> by this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57521:77"/>
time a sufficient <hi>witness.</hi> But the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the more he consider'd, the
worse he lik'd the <hi>Roman Cause,</hi> and
became at last to censure them with
some severity: but I confess, I have
so great an opinion of his <hi>Judgment,</hi>
and the <hi>Charitableness</hi> of his Spirit,
that I am afraid he did not think
worse of them than they <hi>deserve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. But <hi>Religion</hi> is not matter of
<hi>Theory</hi> and Orthodox <hi>Notions,</hi> and it
is not enough to <hi>believe</hi> aright, but
we must practice accordingly: and
to Master our <hi>Passions,</hi> and to make a
right use of that<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>and <hi>power</hi>
that God has given us over our own
<hi>actions,</hi> is a greater glory than all
other <hi>Accomplishments</hi> that can adorn
the mind of man. And therefore I
shall close my <hi>Character</hi> of this great
Personage with a touch upon some
of those <hi>Virtues,</hi> for which his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi>
will be precious to all <hi>Posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. He was a person of great <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi>
and, notwithstanding his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
Parts, and Learning, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57521:77"/>
eminency of place, he had nothing
in him of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Humour,</hi> but was
<hi>courteous</hi> and <hi>affable,</hi> and of easie <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,</hi>
and would lend a ready <hi>ear</hi> to
the <hi>Complaints,</hi> yea to the <hi>impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of the meanest persons.</p>
               <p n="29">29. His Humility was coupled
with an extraordinary <hi>Piety,</hi> and I
believe he spent the greatest part of
his time in <hi>Heaven.</hi> His solemn <hi>hours
of Prayer</hi> took up a considerable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his life; and we are not to
doubt but he had learn'd of St. <hi>Paul</hi>
to pray continually; and that <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
ejaculations,</hi> and frequent aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and emigrations of his Soul
after God, made up the best part of
his Devotions.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But he was not only a good
man God-ward, but he was come to
the top of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Gradation, and
to all his other Virtues added a large
and diffusive <hi>Charity.</hi> And whoever
compares his plentiful <hi>Incomes</hi> with
the <hi>inconsiderable estate</hi> he left at his
<hi>Death,</hi> will be easily convinc'd, that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57521:78"/>
                  <hi>Charity</hi> was steward for a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of his <hi>Revenue.</hi> But the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi>
that he fed, and the <hi>Naked</hi> that
he cloath'd, and the <hi>distress'd</hi> that he
supply'd, and the <hi>fatherless</hi> that he
provided for; the <hi>poor Children</hi> that
he put to <hi>Apprentice,</hi> and brought up
at <hi>school,</hi> and maintain'd at the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,</hi>
will not sound a Trumpet to
that <hi>Charity,</hi> which he dispersed with
his <hi>right hand,</hi> but wouldnot suffer his
<hi>left hand</hi> to have any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p n="31">31. To sum up all in a few words,
This <hi>Great Prelate,</hi> had the Good
Humour of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of an <hi>Orator,</hi> the Fansie of a
<hi>Poet,</hi> the acuteness of a <hi>Schoolman,</hi>
The profoundness of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
the Wisdom of a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> the Reason of an
<hi>Angel,</hi> and the Piety of a <hi>Saint.</hi> He
had Devotion enough for a <hi>Cloister,</hi>
Learning enough for an University, and
Wit enough for a Colledge of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi:</hi>
And, had his <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
been parcell'd out among his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57521:78"/>
poor <hi>Clergy</hi> that he left behind him;
it would perhaps have made one of
the best <hi>Diocese</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p n="32">32. But alas! <hi>Our Father, Our
Father! The Horses of our Israel, and
the Chariot thereof!</hi> He is gone, and
has carried his <hi>Mantle,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi>
along with him up to <hi>Heaven;</hi> and
the <hi>Sons,</hi> of the Prophets have lost all
their beauty and <hi>lustre,</hi> which they
enjoy'd only from the <hi>reflection</hi> of his
Excellencies, which were bright and
radiant enough, to cast a <hi>glory</hi> upon a
whole order of Men. But the <hi>Sun</hi> of
this our world, after many attempts
to break through the crust of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Body, is at last swallow'd up in the
great <hi>Vortex</hi> of Eternity; and there
all his <hi>Maculae</hi> are scatter'd and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
and he is <hi>fix'd</hi> in an <hi>Orb</hi> of
Glory, and shines among his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren-stars,</hi>
that in their several Ages
gave <hi>Light</hi> to the world, and <hi>turn'd
many Souls unto Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="33">33. And we that are <hi>left behind,</hi>
though we can never <hi>reach</hi> his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57521:79"/>
must study to <hi>imitate</hi> his
Virtues, that we may at last come to
sit <hi>at his feet</hi> in the Mansions of Glory,
<hi>which God grant for his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in Jesus Christ.</hi>
