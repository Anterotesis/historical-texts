            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Don't much wonder, that the preſent State of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be a little ſurpriſing to you, at your return from your Travels beyond Seas, it being ſo very much changed from what it was ſome Years ago, when you were laſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the bare reflection upon it muſt needs occaſion Grief and Sadneſs to any who are endued with the leaſt ſenſe of Religion or Morality. The Church was then in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition, her Authority and Diſcipline in ſuch force and vigour, that a Sentence of Excommunication was even terrible to the moſt wicked and prophane; her Paſtors were Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Learning, and Prudence, and of ſuch unblameable Lives and Converſations, that they quite ſtopt the Mouths of their calumniat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and malicious Enemies. Whereas now the Scene of Affairs is ſo much altered, that the Church is made level with the ground, and her Adverſaries take pleaſure in the rubbiſh thereof; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Order of Biſhops totally ſubverted, and the greateſt part of the Epiſcopal Clergy barbarouſly driven from their reſpective Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, many of which are at preſent void and deſtitute of Paſtor, and their Flocks left deſolate, like Sheep wandring without a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd; others of their Churches are invaded by Men who can lay

no claim to that ſacred Function of the holy Miniſtry, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received Ordination from thoſe Perſons who are duly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to confer it: and their pretences for Learning, and the other Qualifications neceſſary for that Office are ſo very little, that the greateſt part of them have never had occaſion to apply themſelves to thoſe Studies, but have been all along trained up in Mechanick Employments, and have now leapt directly from the Shop into th Pulpit, where they exerciſe their Gifts at ſuch a rate, and enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain the<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Auditors with ſuch nauſeous Stuff <note n="*" rend="inter">Vid. <hi>The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Eloquence lately printed.</hi>
               </note>, (ſometimes intermixt with blaſphemous Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that inſtead of advancing the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 'tis to be feared, they have propagated more Atheiſm and Irreligion in the Nation, than many Years will be able to root out.</p>
            <p>And ſince your Curioſity prompts you to a ſtrict enquiry into the Ways and Methods by which this ſurpriſing Revolution was brought about, I ſhall, in order to your ſatisfaction, direct you to all thoſe Treatiſes that have been publiſhed on this occaſion, where you may find an exact and impartial account of the preſent Perſecution raiſed againſt the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; how it was at firſt contrived and ſet on foot, after the landing of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> in the Year 1688, and how it has been managed and carried on even till this time, with all the Fury and Violence imaginable by the Presbyterian Faction in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The firſt Diſcourſe, I think, which was publiſhed on this Subject was,
<q>A Memorial for his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in relation to the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi>; together with the Addreſs of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Party in that Kingdom to his Highneſs, and ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on that Addreſs. By two Perſons of Quality.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Memorial was wrote ſometime before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was proclaimed King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Author's deſign in it, was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Prince, how ſeditiouſly and rebelliouſly the Presbyterians in <hi>Scotland</hi> had behaved themſelves under the Reigns of K. <hi>James</hi> VI. K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. and K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. how in the Reign of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. they overturned not only the Government of the Church, but uſurped like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that of the State, reſcinded all the Royal Prerogatives, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Thouſands of the King's beſt Subjects, beſides the many other Barbarities which they committed under the pretence of Religion.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51725:3"/>
And from hence the Author takes occaſion to ſhew the Prince, how much his Intereſt obliged him to ſuppreſs that inſolent Party, whoſe Principles and Practices were not only inconſiſtent with the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, but even deſtructive of all human Society; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Epiſcopacy being neceſſary for the ſupport of the Monarchy, he ought to make it his chief care and concern to maintain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it; and the rather, becauſe he had ſo ſolemnly engaged his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor for the Defence thereof; for having publiſhed in his Declaration, That his deſign of coming over was to ſupport the Laws of the Nation, he tells him, That he was therefore in Honor bound to ſupport Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, it being confirmed by Twenty Seven Parliaments of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>The Obſervations upon the Presbyterians Addreſs to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> are done by another Pen: They ſufficiently expoſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Inconſiſtency that always appears in the Actions of that Party. In their Addreſs to the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> they complain heavily of their Oppreſſion and Suffering under K. <hi>James</hi>'s Government, that <hi>They were lying in the Mouth of the Lyon, while Refuge failed, and when they looked on their right and left Hands, there was no Man found to pity them, till the Lord raiſed up his Highneſs for their Deliverance.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding theſe heavy and grievous Complaints, we find that in their Addreſs to K. <hi>James,</hi> they render him their humble and hearty Thanks, <hi>for putting a ſtop to their long and ſad Sufferings for Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>; and they acknowledg the receipt of Favors from him, <hi>valuable above all earthly Comforts.</hi> Nay, ſo little reaſon have they to complain of Perſecution from him, that it's known how the leading Men of that Faction were only careſſed and cajoled by the then Miniſters of State to a very high degree, and preferr'd to Places of great Truſt in the Nation. And they themſelves were then ſo ſenſible of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, that out of Gratitude they offered to uſe their Intereſt for carrying on the Deſigns at that time ſet on foot by the Papiſts for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Popery in theſe Dominions.</p>
            <p>It is very well known to any who were then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently they comply'd with the <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> in taking an <hi>Indulgence</hi> from the Papiſts, how they magnifi'd K. <hi>James</hi> upon that account, as the beſt of Kings that ever reigned; and how active ſome of the moſt pragmatical Men of that Party were, in engaging all of their own perſuaſion to promote a Relaxation of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading ſuch Members of Parliament as they could influence, to go along with the Deſigns of the Court therein. And this is ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51725:4"/>
that one of their own Preachers <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Hardy, <hi>at</hi> Edinburgh.</note> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely checked and rebuked by the Party, becauſe much about that time, in a Sermon preached before their Provincial Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he ſignified his diſlike of theſe Proceedings, and laid before them the dangerous Conſequences of the ſame, how fatal ſuch Methods would at laſt prove to the Proteſtant Religion in theſe Nations. I could here entertain you with a great many Inſtances of their Behaviour under K. <hi>James</hi>'s Government, and of their ready complyances with all the Popiſh Deſigns then ſet on foot, but that I think it altogether ſuperfluous, ſince one of their own Party <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Shields <hi>in his Remarks upon the Presbyterian Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to</hi> K. James, <hi>at the end of his</hi> Hind let looſe.</note> has ſufficiently expoſed them to the World upon this account, and ſhewn how their Practices at that time were directly contrary to their former Principles, and that their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was ſuch, as did rather become Sycophants and Court Paraſites, than thoſe who aſſumed the Title of Miniſters of the Goſpel. And his Accuſation is ſo very true, that they have never as yet attempted to anſwer him, or to vindicate themſelves from thoſe many Scandals and Reproaches wherewith he ſo juſtly charges them; nay, on the contrary, they are ſo conſcious of their own Guilt, that in their Addreſs to the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> they very very frankly own it, and make a long Apology to his Highneſs for it.</p>
            <p>The next thing that appear'd abroad with relation to our <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs, was a ſhort Letter entituled,
<q>The preſent State and Condition of the Clergy and Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It gave us but a very ſhort and brief, tho a true, account of the many Affronts and Indignities that were done to the Epiſcopal Clergy of that Kingdom, by the Presbyterians there; but after having enumerated ſome few Inſtances of their atrocious Cruelties, ſuch as the killing of one Miniſter, the daubing of anothers Face with Excrements, and the inhumane uſage of the Wife of a third, tho in Childbed, he at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>That it was beyond the power of words to expreſs their Miſery to that degree as they ſuffered it.</hi> This Letter had not been very long publiſh'd, when there comes out a ſcurrilous Pamphlet, under pretence of an Anſwer to it; it was call'd
<q>A brief and true account of the Sufferings of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Episcopalians ſince the Year 1660. being a Vindication of their Majeſties Government in that Kingdom, relating to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51725:4"/>
againſt the Biſhops and Clergy there. With ſome Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon a Libel entituled, <hi>The preſent State and Condition of the Clergy and Church of</hi> Scotland.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of this Pamphlet, inſtead of anſwering the Letter, as he pretends, ſumms up, and highly aggravates the Puniſhments that were juſtly inflicted upon the Presbyterian Diſſenters by the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for their frequent Inſurrections and Rebellions againſt it, and charges the Epiſcopal Clergy as the Authors of all their Sufferings upon that account. The Proceedings of the Civil Magiſtrate againſt this rebellious Crew are ſufficiently vindicated by a learned Pen, as I ſhall afterwards inform you. And as for the Behaviour of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy, with relation to the Sufferings of theſe Men, they were ſo far from being any ways the Authors of them, that there may be many Inſtances given, where the Clergy have interceeded for their Pardon, and actually ſaved many of them from the Gallows, which they could not have eſcaped, had they been left to the due courſe of Law: And yet theſe Men did afterwards prove ſo ungrateful, that they were the chief Inſtruments of all the Sufferings and Perſecution which thoſe Clergy-Men, to whom they owed their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, met with in this late unhappy Revolution of our Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And this is plain in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Riddel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chiſholm,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Liſly,</hi> whom he was then proſecuting for his Non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance; and yet, at the ſame time, ingenuouſly confeſſed to him, before a good many Witneſſes, that he had been very much obliged to him, and proteſted he would never have treated him at that rate, if it had not been Matter of Conſcience to him.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer is all over ſtuff'd with ſo many groundleſs Reflections and Aſperſions upon the Clergy, and fill'd with ſuch obſcene and ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Language, without the leaſt ſemblance of Reaſon or Argument, that the true way of anſwering it, had been to publiſh to the World a true and impartial Hiſtory of the Author's Life and Actions, that by comparing it with his Writings, they might eaſily perceive what Credit and Authority they ought to have among all ſerious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men. I muſt confeſs, I'm a great Enemy to all perſonal Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in whatever kind of Writings, as knowing how prejudicial they of<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

yet when Men do thus diveſt themſelves of all Morality and Religion, as at this rate, without the leaſt reſtraint of Modeſty or good Manners, to beſpatter the ſacred Perſons of Princes and Prelates, I know no other way to deal with them, but either to oblige them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to recant their Calumnies and Aſperſions, or at leaſt to fight them with their own Weapons, and to expoſe them to the World in their true Colours, that the unwary and undiſcerning Multitude may not be bubbled into a belief of their malicious Lies and Calumnies.</p>
            <p>There was indeed a Reply very ſoon returned to this Anſwer, which, I ſuppoſe, did not a little diſcompoſe our Author, it giving him a ſmall taſt of what Treatment he might expect, if he ſhould ſtill continue to write at this extravagant and ſcurrilous rate. The Title of it is,
<q>The Prelatical <hi>Church-Man</hi> againſt the Phanatical <hi>Kirk-Man,</hi> or a Vindication of the Author of the Sufferings of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſhort Vindication of ſuch of the Clergy as our Author had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to wound in their Reputation, by his groundleſs and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aſperſions. But much about this time, or a little before, there was a Diſcourſe publiſh'd, which, tho it was not deſign'd as an Anſwer to this ſcurrilous Pamphlet, it having been publiſh'd before it came abroad, yet contains ſuch Matters of Fact as do fully anſwer all the Calumnies of this Accuſer, and it relates the Hiſtory of the Perſecution ſo impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, as that it defies the Contradiction of the moſt effronted Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. It is called,
<q>An Account of the preſent Perſecution of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſeveral Letters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion and deſign of this undertaking, was this. When the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Par<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y had barbarouſly and inhumanly treated the Epiſcopal Clergy of that Kingdom, when their Rabble had turn'd out of their Churches by Force and Violence, above 300 Miniſters in the Southern and Weſtern Countries, and had driven them in the midſt of Winter, with their Wives and tender Children, from their Houſes and places of abode; and when they had got ſuch Miniſters, as their Rabble could not reach, deprived of their Livings by a Sentence of their Civil Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, and by this means had expos'd them to all the Miſeries of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Want; yet all this was not enough to ſatisfie their implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Malice, but after they had thus cruelly treated their Perſons at home, they endeavoured to murther them in their Fame and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation abroad; for here in <hi>England</hi> they induſtriouſly printed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51725:5"/>
Papers, under the pretence of giving an account of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in <hi>Scotland</hi> at that time, which contain'd a number of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and bitter Invectives againſt the deprived Epiſcopal Clergy of that Nation, repreſenting many of them to have been deprived for groſs Scandals and Immoralities in their Lives, and impudently denyed the many Affronts and Indignities that were done them by the Rabble; and by this Method they thought not only to render our Clergy odious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, but alſo to make the World believe there was no ſuch thing as a Perſecution raiſed againſt them, and that all the noiſe about it was nothing elſe but the Clamours and Out-cries of a Party diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Government.</p>
            <p>The Epiſcopal Clergy therefore ſeeing that theſe malicious Lies and Calumnies gained credit daily with People in <hi>England,</hi> who were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Strangers to theſe Tranſactions, and being in a ſhort time ſenſible how much they ſuffered in their Fame and Reputation upon this account (than which nothing ought to be more dear and ſacred to Men of their Prof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion); found it altogether neceſſary to vindicate themſelves from the Aſperſions caſt upon them by their Enemies, and to publiſh a true and impartial Account of their Sufferings, that the World might not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be impoſed upon in the Hiſtory of theſe Tranſactions. And ſo they publiſh'd this account of the Perſecution in Four Letters, which do very fully and impartially r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>late a great many Matters of Fact concerning the ſaid Perſecution; how it was at firſt begun by the Rabble in the Weſtern Shires, how they were animated and inticed thereto by their Paſtors and Teachers, and how at laſt the Presbyterians having got the Government of the Kingdom in their hands, did proſecute the Epiſcopal Clergy in their Civil Courts with ſuch open Partiality and Injuſtice, as if they had ſeem'd reſolv'd never to deny it.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe no ſooner appear'd abroad, than People eaſily ſaw how much they had been impoſed upon by former Accounts, and being now fully convinc'd of the Truth of the Perſecution, began to have ſome Pity and Compaſſion towards thoſe Reverend Perſons that were thus expos'd to the Fury and blind Rage of an oppoſite and bigotted Faction. But the reſtleſs Spirit of that Party was ſtill at work to run down this Account of the Perſecution as falſe, and to perſuade the World, that the Matters of Fact related therein had not the leaſt ſhadow of Truth in them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in a ſhort time their Impudence in denying ſo boldly theſe known Matters of Fact was ſoon baffled, and they themſelves were quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the ſight of another Treatiſe which came out very ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former, <hi>viz.</hi>

By a Lover of the Church and his Country.</q>
            <p>In this Diſcourſe we have ſome further account of the Proceedings of the Rabble and Presbyterian Governours againſt the Clergy; and moſt of the particular Matters of Fact, mention'd both in this and the other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, are ſo fully atteſted by many unexceptionable Witneſſes, that it gave ſatisfaction to the moſt ſcrupulous Enquirers, and made the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians themſelves almoſt deſpair of cheating any more into a belief of their Lies and Aſperſions. For here you'll find among the Collection of Papers, particular Declarations of the Outrages and Cruelties committed upon many worthy Miniſters and their Families, owned and ſubſcribed by themſelves, and atteſted by many other Perſons of good Fame, that had the misfortune to be Eye-Witneſſes to many of their tragical Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Our Author has likewiſe inſerted all the publick Acts and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Convention and Parliament, relating to the Clergy, by reading of which, you'll in ſome meaſure perceive, with what open Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and Injuſtice they were treated by the Presbyterian Governours at that time, even thoſe whoſe Station and Character did oblige them at leaſt to put on an outward ſhew of executing Righteouſneſs and Juſtice in the Land.</p>
            <p>A further continuation of the Hiſtory of this Perſecution we have under the Title of
<q>A late Letter concerning the Sufferings of the Epiſcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This relates only to the Perſecution of ſuch Miniſters as lived in the Presbyterie of <hi>Stranraver</hi> in the Shire of <hi>Galloway,</hi> of which the former Treatiſe had promiſed us a fuller account, ſince it was only hinted at there. Here we have a brief Narrative of the condition of that place for ſome few Years before this laſt Perſecution aroſe; he tells us, in what Peace and Tranquillity they lived for a conſiderable time before the Indulgence granted by K. <hi>James</hi>; how that before the publiſhing of that, there were not above two Diſſenters in the whole Presbyterie of <hi>Stranraver,</hi> but all People went regularly and orderly to Church, nay even the Presbyterian Miniſters themſelves were conſtant hearers of the Epiſcopal Clergy in their Pariſh Churches. But no ſooner was this Indulgence proclaimed, than the Presbyterian Miniſters erected ſeparate Congregations, and by infuſing ſeditious Principles into the Minds of the giddy Multitude, did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51725:6"/>
in a ſhort time transform the Country into a Wilderneſs of Savage Beaſts. He deduces their Hiſtory in ſhort till the commencement of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Clergy, and then informs us of a great many Barbarities that were committed upon them by the Rabble. I will not here trouble your Patience with informing you of any of the tragical Stories related both in this and the former Accounts, but rather adviſe you to read the Accounts themſelves, where you'll find the Presbyterians charged, and that juſtly too, with ſuch monſtruous Barbarities, as the moſt ſavage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels would have been aſham'd to commit.</p>
            <p>There are two other ſhort Treatiſes in Print, which, tho they do not immediately concern the Hiſtory of the Perſecution, yet ſince they have a reference to the Principles and Practices of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterians, I thought fit to ſend you this ſhort Account of them. The firſt, which was publiſh'd a conſiderable time before the Diſcourſe laſt mention'd, goes under this Title,
<q>Some Queſtions reſolved concerning Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author's deſign in this Diſcourſe, is to prove that the Presbyterian Government was not by Law ſetled for many Years after the Proteſtant Religion had the legal Eſtabliſhment in that Kingdom, and that it was never ſetled in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without reſtraint from tumultuous times; all which he unanſwerably proves from our Records of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and our beſt Hiſtorians; and further ſhews, that even at preſent, it is very far from being agreeable to the <hi>Inclinations of the People,</hi> the Baſis upon which it is now erected. He ſhews likewiſe that the Principles of Presbyterians allow no Liberty of Conſcience to any that diſſent from them, and clearly demonſtrates that their Principles are utterly deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the legal Monarchy of that Kingdom. He further proves that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Presbyterians, had nothing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution in them, and he fully vindicates the Epiſcopal Clergy from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ways concern'd in the Sufferings which they ſo grievouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of. He has likewiſe given us an Account of the Behaviour of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in reference to the Deſigns of taking away the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt Papiſts, and ſhewn us how induſtrious and active the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians were in promoting the Deſigns for taking away the legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints againſt Papiſts. So that in this Treatiſe you may meet with a full and ſatisfactory Anſwer to all the Calumnies and Aſperſions which the Presbyterians have in their Pamphlets of late maliciouſly thrown upon our Clergy.</p>
            <p>Soon after the publiſhing of this, follow'd the other Diſcourſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51725:7"/>The Danger of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from a General Aſſembly of Covenanters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Repreſented from their Principles in Oaths, and late Acts of Aſſemblies, compared with their Practices in theſe laſt two years, By a true Son of the Church.</q>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe Diſcourſes there was an Anſwer publiſhed under this Title,
<q>A Vindication of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being an Anſwer to a Paper, Intituled, Some Queſtions concerning Epiſcopal and Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein the later is vindicated from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Calumnies of that Author, and the former is made appear to be a Stranger in that Nation. By a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is now Eſtabliſhed by Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In which the Author pretends to prove, that the Anſwers given to theſe Queſtions by his Adverſary are altogether falſe and erroneous; but the performance is very much diſproportion'd to the ſtrength and merits of the Diſcourſe he undertakes to attack, as you may eaſily diſcover by comparing them together.</p>
            <p>Having thus far inform'd you of the Diſcourſes that relate the Hiſtory of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Perſecution, as it was acted by the Laity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Presbyterian Governours: I come in the next place to acquaint you with thoſe Treatiſes which contain that Scene of the Perſecution wherein the Presbyterian Clergy were the Principal and only Actors. It is true that in the former part of this Tragical Scene, their Miniſters were not bare Spectators of the Sufferings of the Epiſcopal Clergy; nay on the contrary, they took occaſion in all their publick appearances at that time, from their Pulpits and elſewhere, to incite and ſtir up the Rabble to the commiſſion of all theſe Cruelties and Outrages upon the perſons of thoſe Reverend and Worthy Men, by calling it <hi>the glorious work of Reformation,</hi> and telling them, that they were carrying on <hi>the work of the Lord,</hi> and that God would certainly reward them for the great ſervices they were then doing to his Church and Kingdom. Whereas it had been more for their perſonal Credit and Reputation, and more ſuitable to the Character they aſſume to themſelves, of being <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> to have repreſſed the fury of the Rabble, and to have reſtrained them from theſe Inſolencies and barbarities which they were acting in ſeveral corners of the Kingdom. But in this later Period of the Perſecution, the Presbyterian Clergy acted their part open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and barefacedly; when they ſat upon the Bench as Judges, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed iniquity by a Law. The firſt Diſcourſe of this Nature that was publiſhed, was
<q>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51725:7"/>An Hiſtorical Relation of the late General Aſſembly held at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> from <hi>October 16.</hi> to <hi>November 13.</hi> in the year <hi>1690.</hi> In a Letter from a perſon in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his Friend in <hi>London.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And here our Author has given us a very exact and impartial account of the proceedings of the Presbyterian Miniſters againſt the Epiſcopal Clergy both in their General Aſſembly, and likewiſe before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. The Parliament after having aboliſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Epiſcopacy, was pleaſed to lodge the whole Government and management of Church Affairs in the hands of ſome few old Presbyterian Miniſters, who in the year 1661. had been deprived for refuſing to ſubmit to the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government then Eſtabliſhed by Law. This was a Presbyterian Conſtitution, you may ſay, not very agreeable to their Principles, which only allow an equal parity among all the Miniſters of the Goſpel; but however the Conſtitution being ſo much for their Intereſt, it was not thought convenient to ſtand two nicely upon Principles. Theſe men who were now intruſted with the Church Government having met at <hi>Edingburgh,</hi> and aſſumed into a ſhare of the Government ſuch of the Presbyterian Miniſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs as they could intirely confide in, did firſt agree upon the Method of Conſtituting their next General Aſſembly, and afterwards divided themſelves into ſeveral Claſſes and Presbyteries, for examining and enquiring into the Principles and Qualifications of the Epiſcopal Clergy, and this in order to deprive them of their Livings and Preferments. One Author gives us a great many inſtances of the partiality and injuſtice that attended the proceedings of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judicatories, and then continues his Hiſtory to the ſitting down of the General Aſſembly, where he entertains us with an uſeful and pleaſant account of what paſſed in that meeting.</p>
            <p>When the General Aſſembly was diſſolved, they appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for proſecuting the work of the Reformation, and putting an end to what the Rabble and Aſſembly had begun. This Commiſſion was inveſted with a full power to cite before them, and deprive ſuch of the Clergy as they ſhould judge unfit for enjoying their Preferments in the Church. And what the Methods were which they uſed in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Epiſcopal Miniſters that as yet retained peaceable poſſeſſion of their Churches, what trifling Crimes they were forced to invent againſt them, may be eaſily gathered from another Diſcourſe which the ſame Author publiſhed not long after the former, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>A Continuation of the Hiſtorical Relation of the late General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in <hi>Scotland.</hi> With an account of the Commiſſions of that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51725:8"/>
Aſſembly, and other particulars concerning the preſent ſtate of the Church in that Kingdom.</q>
            <p>In this Treatiſe the Author informs us what were the effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the Meaſures, which the General Aſſembly had laid down for eſtabliſhing and ſecuring the Presbyterian Government. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many Hiſtorical Relations of conſiderable importance, which are contained both in this and the former Treatiſe, he has likewiſe inſerted here ſeveral Original Papers which add a great deal of Light and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his Hiſtory; among which there are two Letters from King <hi>William</hi> to the Commiſſioners of the General Aſſembly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein he requires them to receive into their Communion ſuch of the Epiſcopal Clergy as were willing to ſubſcribe their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and ſubmit to the Presbyterian Government as then Eſtabliſhed by Law. He further commands them, during his abſence out of <hi>Britain</hi> to ſtop all further Proceſſes againſt the Epiſcopal Miniſters until they received further directions from him; and withal he aſſures them of his Protection, and that he will maintain the Government of the Church in that Kingdom by Presbytery, without ſuffering the leaſt Invaſion to be made upon it.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped that the worthy Author of this Hiſtorical Relation of the General Aſſembly will gratifie the World with a further Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Hiſtory of their Proceedings, eſpecially of what paſt at their laſt Meeting of their General Aſſembly. And this is the more earneſtly to be wiſhed for, ſince the two former parts were ſo very <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,</hi> and ſo very <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to all that peruſed them.</p>
            <p>I come now to inform you of an Anſwer to ſome of thoſe Diſcourſes above mentioned, which after a long delay was at laſt publiſhed under this Title,
<q>A Vindication of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being an Anſwer to five Pamphlets. By the Author of the former Vindication in anſwer to the ten Queſtions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſcourſes which he pretends to anſwer are theſe. 1. An account of the preſent Perſecution of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2. The Caſe of the afflicted Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> truly repreſented. 3. A late Letter concerning the Sufferings of the Epiſcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland.</hi> 4. A Memorial to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. 5. An Hiſtorical Relation of the late General Aſſembly held at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> from <hi>October</hi> 16. to <hi>Nov.</hi> 13. <hi>Anno</hi> 1690.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51725:8"/>The occaſion the long delay of this pretended Anſwer was this. The Aſſembly, it ſeems, enjoyned this task of anſwering the Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Perſecution to one <note n="*" rend="inter">Mr. <hi>Alexander Pitcairn.</hi>
               </note> of their Miniſters, and recommended to him, to receive particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations from the places of the Kingdom, in which theſe cruel Barbarities were acted; but he, finding that the Informations ſent him did confirm the truth of moſt of the Hiſtorical Relations he was required to anſwer, and being a Man of more honeſty and ingenuity than many of his Brethren, did, after he had for ſeveral months made a trial of the work, at laſt intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it, becauſe he ſaw theſe Accounts could not be anſwered without juſtifying what the Rabble had done, which, he ingenuouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, he was neither able nor willing to do. And therefore they were forced to pitch upon another <note n="†" rend="inter">Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule.</hi>
               </note> for this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whom, as it appears, being a Man of a greater ſtock of Boldneſs, and far leſs Sincerity than the other, they found both fitter and readier for ſerving their deſigns. And he after a great many ſtrugglings, what with the Checks of his own Conſcience, and the difficulties he met with in guilding over and diſguiſing theſe Matters of Fact, which are ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and ſo circumſtantially reported in theſe Diſcourſes he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to attack, at laſt appears abroad in the World, thinking by his bare confidence alone to impoſe upon the Senſe of Mankind, and with a bold denial to confute thoſe truths which have all the proof and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation that a Matter of Fact can poſſibly bear. They are owned in Publick and Printed Declarations, ſubſcribed by the Miniſters upon whom theſe Outrages were committed, and atteſted by many Witneſſes of unſpotted Fame and Reputation; nay further, the Miniſters who were the Sufferers undertake, under the ſevereſt Penalties, to prove the truth of theſe Declarations before any Judicial Court, even to the Conviction of their moſt obſtinate Enemies; and what further Proof can any reaſonable Man deſire?</p>
            <p>But to let you ſee how fully and beyond the poſſibility of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction theſe matters of Fact are atteſted, I have ſubjoyned hereunto two Declarations relating to this Subject, the Original Copies of which are in my hands, ſubſcribed by the Miniſters upon whom theſe Cruelties were acted, and their Subſcriptions atteſted by very good Witneſſes. I ſend you theſe the rather, becauſe they are not to be found among the Collection of Papers annexed to the <hi>Caſe of the Afflicted Clergy in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and one of them is a great deal more particular in the Relation than any therein inſerted: For in this Declaration the particular days
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51725:9"/>
and months upon which theſe barbarities were acted, and the names of the particular perſons that were Actors of the Tragedy are expreſly mentioned, and three or four Witneſſes at leaſt brought to prove every individual matter of Fact that is there related; and, if my memory don't very much fail me, a Copy of this Declaration was given in to the Privy Council at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Gentleman deſired a redreſs of theſe grievances, and offered to prove before them the truth of all theſe particulars, if they thought them worthy of their Cognizance; ſo that I would gladly know what further proof and atteſtation can be brought for any matter of Fact, than is here offered to evince the truth of theſe.

                           <hi>September 20.</hi> They purſued me upon the High-way as I was convoying a Couſin of my own, alledging that he and I had taken down the Bell. They hurled us back Priſoners to the Town, and <hi>James Rae</hi> ran at me with a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, it ſeems, with a deſign to have killed me.

            <p>And now Sir, I hope, you ſee with what evidence and clearneſs of Demonſtration, the particular Inſtances related in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Scotch</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51725:11"/>
Perſecution are accompanied, and from this you may eaſily judg what a height of Impudence Men muſt needs arrive at, to deny ſo plain and ſo evident Matters of Fact, that have all the Proof and Atteſtation that the Nature of the thing can poſſibly bear. And yet the Author of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Anſwer is not in the leaſt aſham'd to put on ſuch a degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this matter, as no Man beſides a Presbyterian is capable of. But to let you ſee a little of his Diſingenuity in managing this Affair, he has collected together five Diſcourſes whieh he undertakes to confute, and then urges the number of the Books he's to anſwer, as an Excuſe why he cannot confute them all ſufficiently, leaſt he ſhould ſwell his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer into too great a Volume. What ſhould have obliged this Author to undertake to anſwer ſo many Treatiſes at one time, I cannot readily conjecture, unleſs it were to have ſome plauſible pretence for not being able to give a ſufficient Anſwer to any of them ſingly. I'm ſure the meaneſt of theſe Treatiſes does far exceed the Malice of his weak Efforts, and the Aſſembly enjoyn'd him but the firſt two Diſcourſes to confute, which, if he had done to purpoſe, he had better ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tisfy'd the Commands of his Superiors, and done greater Service to his Party, by vindicating them from thoſe heavy Crimes ſo juſtly charg'd upon them.</p>
            <p>But all the Vindication he offers to bring for them, is in ſome Caſes with a daring Boldneſs to deny point blank the Matter of Fact, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſproving the Atteſtations brought to confirm it; in others to alleviate it, by pretending the Epiſcopal Clergy had expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Hatred of the Rabble; but in moſt Caſes he acknowledges the Truth of the Relation, and then diſowns the Actors were Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, and therefore the ſober Presbyterians, he ſays, ought not to account for thoſe Proceedings: Whereas it's notoriouſly known, that theſe Perſons whom he thus diſowns and reflects upon, are the only true Presbyterians, and act in a cloſe Conformity to their Principles, while others, pretending to a little more Sobriety and Moderation, have evidently deſerted the <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> and degenerated into a mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel Conſtitution which they know not how to name. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Author diſowns the Actors to be of their Communion, yet in his Vindication he is pleas'd to call them the <hi>Zealous</hi> Party, and repreſents them as pretty gentle, in that they made it <hi>their work only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, and not to murder the Epiſcopal Miniſters.</hi> In ſome particulars, the better to diſguiſe and leſſen the atteſted Matters of Fact of our late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, he has brought a few Evidences and Atteſtations of ſome Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whom he looks upon as Men of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Credibility</hi>; but they are thoſe very Perſons who were the principal Actors of that horrid Tragedy; and how fair and candid dealing this is, I leave the World to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51725:11"/>
judg. Is it to be ſuppos'd, that Men who had ſuch a degree of Malice to act theſe unheard of Barbarities, will be at a loſs for a little Impudence to deny them? And yet this you'll find to be the whole of his Vindication, after peruſal of it, which I would adviſe you by all means to do, ſince, inſtead of anſwering, it rather confirms the Truth of the Accounts that have been given by the Eye-witneſſes and Sufferers in that Perſecution.</p>
            <p>There are lately publiſh'd ſome Remarks upon this Vindication, which are printed with another Book called, <hi>The Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> which I ſhall have occaſion to mention afterwards. But the Author of theſe Remarks has taken the pains to collect ſeveral of this Vindicator's Falſhoods and Contradictions, with which every Page of his Book doth abound, and which may be ſufficient to direct us in paſſing our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the whole; he ſhews, how in ſome places he juſtifies or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the greateſt Barbarities of the Presbyterian Rabble, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſowns and condemns them; ſo that he is not aſham'd to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf at every turn. It's probable that ere long you may ſee this Vindicator more ſeverely chaſtis'd, as he truly deſerves, and therefore I'll trouble you with no further Account of him at preſent, but leave him to the Correction of thoſe that are chiefly concern'd to take notice of his Inſolence, and ſhall conclude with this one Remark. That if theſe Men were in earneſt to anſwer the Hiſtorical Relations of the Perſecution pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Epiſcopal Clergy, the moſt effectual and ſatisfactory way of confuting theſe Accounts, were to examin upon Oath before an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Judicatory, the Witneſſes that atteſt all theſe publick Declarations printed in the <hi>Caſe of the afflicted Clergy</hi>; and if they diſown the truth of theſe Relations, or if the Miniſters be not able to prove their ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations by ſufficient and unexceptionable Witneſſes, let them ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be reputed as Men infamous for Lying and Calumny. This, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, is a fair way of dealing, and ſuch as that Party ought not in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to refuſe, ſince they have the Government of the Nation in their hands, and may eaſily put it to a Tryal when they pleaſe. And till they do this, they muſt excuſe the World to believe theſe Accounts of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to be true and genuine Relations, and to proceed neither from Malice nor Revenge.</p>
            <p>The next Period of the Hiſtory of our <hi>Scotch</hi> Affairs, relates to the Viſitation of the Univerſities, and other inferior Schools of Learning. The Presbyterian Miniſters never thought themſelves ſecure, were never at Peace and Quiet till they got this brought about; they lookt upon them as Nurſeries of ſuch Plants as would infallibly overturn their Settlement and Conſtitution; and therefore it was ſtill the ſubject Matter of their Sermons before the Parliament, to preſs them to a ſpeedy purging of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51725:12"/>
Univerſities, that the Youth of the Nation might not any longer be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd with Loyal, Epiſcopal, and ſuchlike Antichriſtian Principles. This was their conſtant Topick for many Months together, and there was nothing gall'd them more than the delay of ſo deſireable a Work; but at laſt their Importunity was gratify'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an Act of Parliament publiſh'd, conſtituting a Commiſſion for viſiting the Univerſities and other Schools and Seminaries of Learning within the Kingdom. This Commiſſion divided themſelves into ſeveral Committees for viſiting the particular Univerſities, who were to make report to the General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Qualifications and Behaviour of the Profeſſors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in each Univerſity. And what the Methods of their proceeding in this Viſitation were, you may eaſily learn from the Hiſtory of what they did in relation to the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> It goes under this Title,
<q>Presbyterian Inquiſition; as it was lately practiſed againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh, Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September 1690.</hi> In which the Spirit of Presbytery and their preſent Method of Procedure, is plainly diſcovered, Matter of Fact by undeniable inſtances cleared, and Libels againſt particular perſons diſcuſſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe is a ſufficient demonſtration to the World, what inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and ſeverity the Profeſſors of this Colledge met with from their Presbyterian Viſitors. It would not ſatisfie their Malice to ſtrip them of their places and preferments, but they muſt likewiſe contrive ſome ways to ruin their Fame and Reputation, the better to palliate their own injuſtice. They invent Libels, and deliver them into the Viſitors, no Accuſer produc'd to own the Libel, <note n="*" rend="inter">And refuſed when legally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> no Witneſſes brought to prove any particular of it, and yet theſe Libels muſt be Regiſtred and kept upon Record as Authentick Evidences, containing the Crimes for which the Profeſſors were then deprived; and all this with deſign to render them infamous not only in the preſent, but likewiſe to future Ages. It was this ſort of treatment that obliged the Profeſſors of the Colledge of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to publiſh a true Narrative of the Proceedings in their Viſitation, that they might vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the aſperſions caſt upon them by theſe Libels, and let the World ſee, that the greateſt Crimes their Adverſaries had againſt them were their Sallaries and Revenues. In this Account you have a general Narrative of the Proceedings of the Committee againſt all the Members of that Colledge; and particularly you have here inſerted at large the whole Trials of two of their number, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctor <hi>Monro</hi> Principal of the Colledge, and Doctor <hi>Strachan</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity. There you may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51725:12"/>
ſee all the Articles Libelled againſt theſe two Doctors, to what neceſſity their Accuſers were reduced, in being forc'd to invent mean and trifling Calumnies againſt Men of an unblemiſhed Character; you may ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their particular Anſwers to the Libels, wherein they have fully vindicated their Innocence againſt all thoſe ſilly aſperſions, that the utmoſt effort of their Adverſaries Malice could contrive. The Author has likewiſe inſerted in this Treatiſe, the Report of the Committee to General Commiſſion in relation to theſe two Doctors, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion's Sentence of Deprivation againſt them, together with their ſeveral Animadverſions upon the Report of the Committee. And that none might doubt of their partiality in this Affair, Mr. <hi>Andrew Maſſie</hi>'s Libel is inſerted, which, though notoriouſly true, owned and offered to be proved by perſons of unqueſtionable Credit and Reputation, was not in the leaſt enquired into, becauſe he had declared himſelf to be of their Party. All theſe things you'll find fully related in this Account, which in your reading will afford you Matter of Diverſon as well as of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe are, I think the chief Diſcourſes, that have been publiſhed by our Epiſcopal Divines, relating to the Hiſtory of the Perſecution under which their Church at preſent moſt heavily groans. But I muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beg leave to mention another Treatiſe lately come from the Preſs under this Title,
<q>The <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbyterian Eloquence, or the fooliſhneſs of their Teaching diſcovered from their Books, Sermons, and Prayers, and ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Mr.<hi>Rule</hi>'s late Vindication of the Kirk.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of publiſhing this Tract, as I am inform'd, was this. You may obſerve that the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> in all their Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, endeavour to juſtifie their Proceedings againſt the Orthodox Clergy with this Topick, by pretending that a great many of them were turn'd out meerly for their <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Inſufficiency.</hi> This was the great Teſt by which the Presbyterian Teachers pretended to proceed in Judging and Depriving ſuch of the Epiſcopal Clergy as condeſcended to appear before their Aſſemblies. Upon this account therefore, it ſeems, the Publiſher of this Treatiſe thought it convenient, to inform the World a little of the Qualifications and Learning of our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Doctors, and if it were poſſible, to make them ſenſible of their own Infirmities, and for the future aſham'd of their <hi>Inſolence,</hi> that they ſhould pretend to Deprive Men for <hi>Ignorance,</hi> who are ſo many degrees above the reach of their low capacities; that they, who in their Preachings and Writings appear to be not only void of all manner of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51725:13"/>
Learning, but likewiſe deſtitute of common Senſe and Reaſon, that that they ſhould be ſo arrogant, as to think themſelves fit Judges of any Man's Qualifications for the Office of the Holy Miniſtry. They might have acted perhaps more prudently, if they had ſet this Topick aſide, and made choice of another Teſt for Depriving the Epiſcopal Clergy, and that is, as they are pleas'd to call it, <hi>the want of Grace</hi>; then in all appearance, they had not given our Author this occaſion of proclaiming to the World their ſcandalous Ignorance, and they would have acted more conſonantly to their own Principles and Doctrines, when they run down all kind of Human Learning as a thing truly Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>And here, Sir, I muſt tell you, that their particular deſpite againſt all manner of Learning is ſo obſervable, that when you return to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you'll find your ſelf deprived of the Society of many of theſe Learned and Ingenious Gentlemen, in whoſe Company and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation you were formerly wont to be ſo much Edified, and ſo highly pleaſed. They have not only Perſecuted the Clergy at that rate, as to make ſome of our moſt eminent Divines leave the Kingdom; but have likewiſe extended their Malice againſt the Learned Men of all other Profeſſions, and diſcouraged them to that high degree, that they have forc'd ſome of the moſt Conſpicuous of our Lawyers, Phyſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ians and Mathematicians, to deſert their Native Country, and take up their Reſidence among ſuch as have a juſt value and eſteem of their Merit and Deſert. I could inſtance in all theſe Particulars, but that you your ſelf will be too ſenſible of it, and the inſtances are ſo well known, and ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally exclaimed againſt, that the Presbyterians themſelves begin to be ſomewhat aſham'd of their Proceedings towards them. And truly no wonder, if they conſider with what abhorrence and indignation their Poſterity will remember them; that they ſhould have been ſuch <hi>Hoſtes Patriae,</hi> ſuch open and declared Enemies to their Native Country, as by their violent Proceedings to baniſh therefrom Men who were the Glory and Ornament of their Nation.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe is a Collection of ſeveral remarkable Paſſages taken out of the Writings and Sermons of the Presbyterian Paſtors; in which their groſs Ignorance in matters of Learning, and their ridiculous and almoſt blaſphemous way of Worſhip is ſufficiently deſcribed. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has collected a great many inſtances of the Madneſs and Deluſions of the Presbyterian Vulgar; how they are paſſionately moved with a Sermon of the greateſt Nonſenſe, if it be pronounced but with a loud Voice and a whining Tone; how they contemn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, as childiſh Ordinances, and far
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51725:13"/>
below their Care or Concern; and how upon their Death-beds they take it as a certain ſign of Salvation, that in their life-time they never heard a <hi>Curate</hi> preach. Theſe are ſuch ſtrong Deluſions and Infatuations, that it's eaſie to gueſs by what Spirit they are thus acted. In the next place he deſcribes the peeviſh and unconverſible Temper of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; how they have enſlav'd themſelves ſo wholly to the Humors of their People, that to gratifie them, they muſt diveſt themſelves of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility, as well as Chriſtian Charity. He ſhews that their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Learning go no further than to underſtand the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation, and how by their indiſcreet Sermons upon this Subject, they often drive many of the ignorant Multitude into ſuch a high deſpair of God's Mercy, as to make them lay violent hands on themſelves, and this they call <hi>The Saving of Souls.</hi> They infuſe into the Minds of their Hearers ſordid and low Notions of the high and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God; they repreſent him as a ſevere and unmerciful Being, and have not the Prudence to intermix God's Offers of Mercy with his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. They not only force their Followers into Deſpair, but likewiſe ſometimes encourage them in direct Impieties, by telling them, that if they be among the number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> they may be guilty of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Sins without hazarding their Salvation. They talk of the greateſt Myſteries of Religion in ſuch homely, coarſe, and ridiculous Expreſſions, as are very unſuitable to the Gravity and Solemnity with which theſe ſacred Myſteries ought to be treated. And all theſe Particulars the Author of this Treatiſe proves againſt them by ſuch undeniable Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that I believe they'll hardly be ſo bold as to offer to confute them, leaſt thereby they expoſe themſelves to the greater Scorn and Deriſion.</p>
            <p>I think I need not caution you to read this Diſcourſe I here ſpeak of, with a due Regard and Veneration to thoſe ſacred things you ſee thus polluted and prophaned; and not to improve it to ſuch a bad use, as I too much fear ſome of our open Prophaners of all Religion will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to do. I know you have more juſt and adequate Notions of the Divine Majeſty, and of the Myſteries of our Holy Religion, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the meaner Thoughts of theſe holy and ſacred things, becauſe you ſee them prophan'd in this manner by the Mouths of ſuch ſordid and ſilly Creatures; you know that Pearls caſt before the Swine loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their intrinſick Worth and Value. I muſt therefore intreat you to improve the reading of this Treatiſe to the true deſign for which it was publiſh'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That all good Men, being rightly inform'd of the preſent Miſery and Deſolation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the great Detriment that accrues thereby to Religion in general, may contribute their aſſiſtance, what by their Prayers and other lawful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51725:14"/>
means, for reſtoring that National Church to its Primitive and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Inſtitution; that Religion may again flouriſh there as the Palm-tree, and all manner of Iniquity being depreſs'd, Judgment may as yet run down our Streets like a River, and Righteouſneſs like a mighty Stream. Is it a matter of no moment, to ſee a whole National Church, with its Apoſtolical Government, quite overturn'd and deſtroy'd? To ſee many Hundreds of the Miniſters of God's Word, together with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, expos'd to the extreme Neceſſities of Poverty and Want, and by that means to the Contempt of the Laity? To ſee them thus ſacrific'd to the Fury and Rage of a blind and bigotted Party? Is it nothing to ſee Religion in this manner abuſed and polluted by ſordid and ſtupid Men, who aſſume to themſelves the Name of <hi>Paſtors?</hi> To ſee them prophane the ſacred Myſteries of our holy Religion by their Drollery and Ridicule? To behold many Chriſtians in a Kingdom wandering to and fro, without any Guide to direct them in the ways and means of Salvation, or which is worſe, having only ſuch Teachers as entertain them with Nonſenſe and Blaſphemy, and infuſe into their Minds ſuch ſeditious Principles and Doctrines as muſt inevitably tend to their Ruin and Deſtruction? Theſe are Matters not of mere Jeſt and Diverſion, but of great Concern and Importance, and will at laſt prove to be of far more fatal Conſequences than, I fear, many of us are aware of. If this Deluge of Atheiſm and Impiety, which theſe Men are too too like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to introduce into that Kingdom, by venting ſuch nauſeous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſtuff in their Prayers and Sermons; I ſay, if this Deluge be not timely prevented, but be ſuffered to go on without any ſtop or hindrance, it will not be found very eaſie to rid the Nation of the bad Effects of it for many Generations.</p>
            <p>Having now gone through all the Diſcourſes that have been publiſh'd on both ſides, concerning our late Revolution in Church Matters, I think it may not be amiſs to acquaint you with two or three other Treatiſes, which, tho they principally relate to the Civil Affairs of our Nation, yet do contain ſome things that concern likewiſe our Church Affairs. The firſt of them is entituled thus,
<q>The late Proceedings and Votes of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in an Addreſs deliver'd to the King, ſign'd by the plurality of the Members thereof, ſtated and vindicated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That you may rightly underſtand the occaſion of printing this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, It is neceſſary to acquaint you, That after the Convention of Eſtates in <hi>Scotland</hi> had devolved the Government of that Kingdom upon K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> they fell into great Heats and Animoſities
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51725:14"/>
among themſelves. What the cauſes of theſe Diviſions were, I am not at preſent concerned to enquire, but divided they were into ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one of which went ordinarily under the Name of the <hi>Club.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a great many Members of Parliament, who were moſt of them Presbyterians, and zealouſly affected to the preſent Government, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared very active and induſtrious in dethroning K. <hi>James,</hi> and advancing K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> to the Throne. This Party combin'd together to obſtruct and oppoſe all Matters brought into the Parliament, till they ſhould firſt get their Grievances againſt the former Governments redreſs'd by this, according to their <hi>Claim of Right.</hi> They alledged K. <hi>William</hi> had refuſed Satisfaction and Redreſs to theſe Points of the Grievances which were moſt material, and that he was ſo far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, that both he and his Miniſters deny'd there lay any Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them for that end; ſo that in this Revolution, they pretended the People did only obſerve a change of Maſters, but no eaſe of Burden, or redreſs of Laws. And this obliged them to ſend up an Addreſs to K. <hi>William,</hi> ſubſcrib'd by the greateſt part of the Members of Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> repreſenting to him the Grievances which they wanted to be redreſs'd in the preſent Parliament. This Addreſs was deliver'd to him by the Earl of <hi>Annandale,</hi> the Lord <hi>Roſſe,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> of <hi>Skelmurly,</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> the 15th. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1689. They were much diſſatisfy'd with the Miniſters of State whom King <hi>William</hi> had received into his Councils and Service, alledging that he had made choice of thoſe very Men, who had been the Inſtruments of K. <hi>James'</hi> Miſeries and Ruine, by adviſing him to theſe Courſes that had robb'd him of the Hearts of his Subjects. It was theſe Miniſters whom they blam'd as the Authors of all the Differences that had ariſen betwixt K. <hi>William</hi> and his Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi>; they thought his delaying to gratifie their Deſires, proceeded merely from the ſiniſter Miſrepreſentations given him of their Demands as illegal, and as Encroachments upon the Royal Authority. And therefore, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Actions, they publiſh'd this Treatiſe and their Addreſs to King <hi>William,</hi> to ſhew, that what they deſired therein was agreeable to all the Rules of Law, Religion and Policy. The Author has inſerted at large the ſeveral conteſted Votes of Parliament, to which K. <hi>William</hi> had refuſed his aſſent, and he endeavours to demonſtrate the Legality, Reaſonableneſs, and Neceſſity of them, by proving them to be in all Points agreeable to the antient Laws and Cuſtoms of that Nation.</p>
            <p>This has produced us another Diſcourſe on the ſame Subject, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the former. It is call'd,
<q>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51725:15"/>An Account of the Affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in relation to their Religious and Civil Rights.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here our Author undertakes to ſatisfie the World, that K. <hi>William</hi> had offer'd to the Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> all the Satiſfaction and Redreſs of their Grievances that reaſonable Men could expect; and that the true Source and Fountain whence proceeded all the Complaints of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party, was, that ſome of their Number were not advanc'd to ſuch honourable and advantageous Poſts of the State, as they thought they had merited by their Zeal for K. <hi>William,</hi> and the eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they had done him in advancing his Intereſt in that Kingdom. And to evince what he undertakes, he has ſet down at length the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances themſelves, and the Redreſs offer'd them by King <hi>William</hi> in his Inſtructions to his Commiſſioner, and makes ſome Reflections on both. If you encline to ſearch any further into the Hiſtory of theſe Debates betwixt K. <hi>William</hi> and his Parliament, you may conſult the Treatiſes themſelves, to which I refer you.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you may have heard how active and diligent the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in <hi>Scotland</hi> have been ever ſince this late Revolution, to exclaim againſt the Injuſtice and Severity of the former Reigns, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. (under whoſe Adminiſtration we enjoyed ſo much Peace and Tranquillity) whom they charge with Tyranny and Oppreſſion, Cruelty and Perſecution againſt them and their Adherents; and reproach his Miniſters of State as Subverters of the Laws of the Kingdom, and Betrayers of the Liberties and Property of the Subject. The bad Impreſſion which theſe Clamours made upon Strangers that were ignorant of theſe Tranſactions, obliged Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie,</hi> (who had been Advocate to K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. and was principally aim'd at in many of the Reflections caſt upon the Government and its Miniſters) to vindicate his Majeſty K. <hi>Charles</hi> and his Miniſters of State, from theſe Calumnies and Aſperſions ſo unjuſtly thrown upon them. And this he has very fully and ſatiſfactorily done in a Diſcourſe publiſh'd after his Death, and called,
<q>A Vindication of the Government in <hi>Scotland,</hi> during the Reign of K. <hi>Charles II,</hi> againſt Miſrepreſentations made in ſeveral ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pamphlets. To which is added, The Method of proceeding againſt Criminals, as alſo ſome of the Phanatical Covenants, as they were printed and publiſhed by themſelves in that Reign. By Sir <hi>George Maekenzie,</hi> late Lord Advocate there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51725:15"/>In this Treatiſe we have a ſhort Narrative of the Proceedings of that Government in relation to the Presbyterian Diſſenters, which alone is ſufficient to undeceive Perſons that have been impoſed upon by Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, and to confute all the malicious Calumnies raiſed againſt the Government. For when we conſider the frequent Rebellions and Commotions which the Presbyterians raiſed during the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. we ſhall ſoon find that thoſe Acts of the Government, which they tax with the greateſt Severity, ſavour of nothing but Mildneſs and Lenity, and that the Government proceeded by the ſloweſt ſteps ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to puniſh thoſe who openly own'd their Deſigns of ſubverting the Monarchy. The Authour has collected all the Objections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of pretended Cruelty againſt the Government, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of its Enemies could contrive, and has anſwer'd them beyond the poſſibility of a Reply. The Publiſher has ſubjoyned a Collection of original Papers publiſh'd by themſelves, which contain an Account of their avowed Principles and Practices, and from thence you may eaſily judg how conſiſtent it is with the Security of any Government, to ſuffer the Propagation of ſuch wicked and ſeditious Principles. But I think you cannot have a more impartial and true Account of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor a fuller Vindication of the Proceedings of the Government againſt this rebellious Party, than from a Book lately publiſh'd under this Title,
<q>The Hiſtory of <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery, being an Epitome of the <hi>Hind let looſe,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Shields.</hi> With a Preface by a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is Epitome of a larger Book publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Alexander Shields,</hi> one of their moſt eminent Preachers, and a zealous Defender of the good <hi>old Cauſe.</hi> Here we have a true Deſcription of the Temper and Genius of the whole Party, and it diſcovers the true Spirit of the Presbyterian Goſpel. There is none of them that b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter underſtands the true Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Presbyterians, nor is more conſequential to their Principles; for he fairly ſets down their Doctrines and Opinions, and diſowns none of the moſt abſurd and pernicious Conſequences that naturally flow from them. He gives us an Hiſtorical Account of their many Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Rebellions againſt the Civil Government, and very frankly owns and juſtifies them all, together with ſeveral of their barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders committed upon the Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and ſome others,; ſo that by a ſlight view of this Book, you may eaſily judg, whether any Government of whatever ſpecies can ſubſiſt where ſuch Principles and Doctrines are ſuffer'd to be propagated among the Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:51725:16"/>And now, Sir, I have ſatisfied your deſire as fully as poſſibly I could; I have given you an exact Account of the moſt, if not all the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Treatiſes that have been Printed with reſpect to the preſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that you may be the better able to judge of the truth and certainty of it, I have ſet down the Treatiſes publiſhed by both Parties; and likewiſe that you may the more eaſily procure any of them you are deſirous to read, I have ſubjoyned to this Letter a Catalogue of them all with the names of the Bookſellers by whom they are to be ſold. I think it is ſufficiently evident from the foregoing Collection, what Sufferings the Orthodox Clergy in <hi>Scotland</hi> have endured, and how unaccountable the Proceedings of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians are towards them; and which is moſt to be lamented, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſerable ſtate and condition of the whole National Church, and the great prejudice that Religion ſuſtains by the overthrow thereof, is no leſs apparent. How much it concerns all Sober and Religious Men to contribute their endeavours, for delivering that Oppreſſed Church from the Miſeries and Calamities under which it at preſent Groans, I hope we are all ſenſible; and therefore I ſhall give you no further trouble but of this one requeſt, which is, That you would be careful to inform all perſons with whom you may chance to converſe, of the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that every one may lend their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for reſcuing the Revered Clergy of that Kingdom from under their preſent Sufferings and Oppreſſions, that the Rod of the wicked may lye no longer upon the back of the Righteous, leaſt they ſtretch forth their hand unto Iniquity, and likewiſe that our National Church may be reſtored to its Primitive Order and Beauty.
