            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reflections on a Paper, intituled, <hi>His Majesty's</hi> Reasons for withdrawing Himself from Rochester.</head>
            <p>THERE is a Paper spread about the Town, which might be confuted in every particular, not only with Clearness, but with Severity too, if there was not a restraint put upon the full liberty of answering any thing that goeth under a Name, to which Respect will still be paid, even by those to whom it is denied: Therefore nothing will be said to it by way of an intire Answer; nor any advantage taken of the many Mistakes which lye too open to be Defended. It shall suffice for the present to mention some things which are laid down in the Paper, in such a manner, as may, perhaps, mislead men into a wrong judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, for want of being sufficiently informed in the matter of fact.</p>
            <p>The particulars are: 1. The Prince sending his Guards at Eleven of Clock at Night, to take possession of the Posts at <hi>Whitehall, Without advertising him of it in the least.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The sending a kind of an Order by Three Lords, to be gone out of his own Palace before Twelve that Morning.</p>
            <p>To the first, the matter of fact is, That upon the King's being Apprehended, when He was going out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and afterwards being brought to <hi>Rochester,</hi> whither his Servants and Coaches were sent for by Him, to bring Him up to <hi>London,</hi> The Prince, who had upon that taken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47953:3"/>
his measures to hasten up to Town, and being fixed in his opinion, That it was, in many respects, improper for the King and him to be there at the same time, in the present state of Affairs; sent Monsieur <hi>Zulestein</hi> to meet Him in the way, and to desire Him to return to <hi>Rochester</hi>; but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Zulestein</hi> missing Him, by going another way than that by which He came, the King arrived at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and at the same time sent a Message by my Lord <hi>Feversham</hi> to the Prince, inviting him to come to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, with what number of Troops he should think fit to bring with him.</p>
            <p>The Prince upon this deliberateth with the Lords then at <hi>Windsor,</hi> the day before he had appointed to be in Town, and having communicated the Message to them, and left them to debate the whole matter, it was agreed, That it was in no kind adviseable for the Prince to accept the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; and on the other side, there being a necessity that the Prince should be in Town next day, the Lords thought that the shortness of time could admit no better Expedient, than that the King might be desired to remove to some place within a reasonable distance from <hi>London</hi>; upon which, <hi>Ham,</hi> a House belonging to the Dutchess of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> was pitched upon. In order to this, a Paper was drawn in these words, and Signed by the Prince:
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>We desire you the Lord Marquess of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Shreusbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> to tell the King, That it is thought convenient for the great quiet of the City, and for the greater safety of His Person, That He do remove to <hi>Ham,</hi> where He shall be attended by Guards, who will be ready to preserve Him from any disturbance. </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47953:3"/>The Prince appointed three Lords to carry this Paper; and it was resolved, That before the delivery, the Prince's Guards should be possessed of all the Posts at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to prevent the possibility of a disturbance from Guards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to several Masters; which besides other ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences might perhaps have involved even the King's own Person in the danger that might have arisen from any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute. It was supposed by computation, that the Prince's Guards might be at <hi>London</hi> by Eight of the Clock that Night: But it so happened, that it was past Ten before they all arrived, commanded by the Count of <hi>Solmes</hi>; and when they were come, there being difficulty made of withdrawing the King's Guards from <hi>Whitehall,</hi> there was so much time spent, that it was past Twelve of the Clock before the Lords could proceed in their Message. In which, that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all possible decency and respect; and that they might not suddenly break in upon the King with a Message of this kind, they sent to my Lord <hi>Middleton,</hi> His Principal Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, the following Letter.

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47953:4"/>The Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> told the Messenger, he would be ready at the Stairs of the Guard-chamber to carry the Lords to the King. Upon this they went, and finding my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> at the place he had appointed, he brought them to the King, whom they found in bed: After making an Apology for coming at an hour which might give him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, The Prince's Message before recited was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Him; which after He had read, He said, He would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with. Then the Lords, as they were directed, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desired, if it might be done with convenience to His Majesty, That He would be pleased to remove so early, as to be at <hi>Ham</hi> by Noon; by this means, to prevent the meeting the Prince in his way to <hi>London,</hi> where he was to come the same day; His Majesty readily agreed to it, and then asked, Whether he might not appoint what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants should attend Him; to which the Lords replied, That it was left to Him to give order in that as He pleased. And after that, they took their leave. When they were gone as far as the <hi>Privy Chamber,</hi> the King sent for them again, and told them, That he had forgot to acquaint them with his Resolutions before the Message came, To send my Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> next Morning to the Prince, to propose His go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to <hi>Rochester,</hi> he finding by the Message that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Zulesteyn</hi> was charged with, That the Prince had no mind He should be in <hi>London</hi>; and therefore He now desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that He might rather return to <hi>Rochester,</hi> than go to any other Place. The Lords replied, That they would immediately send an Account to the Prince of what His Majesty desired, and did not doubt of such an Answer as would be to His satisfaction; accordingly they sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Prince, who was then at <hi>Sion,</hi> to inform Him of all that had passed; and before Eight of the Clock in the Morning had a Letter from Monsieur <hi>Benting,</hi> by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47953:4"/>
Prince's Order, agreeing to the King's Proposal of going to <hi>Rochester</hi>; upon which, the Guards being made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Boats prepared, He went that Night to <hi>Gravesend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Observations which may naturally arise from this whole matter are, First, That the King having been sent to by the Prince by Monsieur <hi>Zulesteyn,</hi> That He would be pleased to return to <hi>Rochester.</hi> This Message by the Lords could not possibly be a surprize to Him, but must have been expected as a necessary Inference from the first; and this is proved in fact by the King's having given Order to my Lord <hi>Godolphin</hi> to go to the Prince with an offer to return to <hi>Rochester,</hi> concluding that his Highness would have less exception to His being there, than he might have to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, As to the Complaint of the Prince's sending his Guards at such a time of night, and without giving warning; Let it be considered, whether, since a thing of this kind was judged necessary to be done, it had not better grace even in respect to the King Himself, to do it upon short warning, rather than expose Him more by treating and proposing formally that which His Majesty was in no condition to deny. In all Cases where the means of contesting fail, it is sure a Respect to those who are under such a disadvantage, not to add to their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, by drawing it out in length by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ceremony of treating where no Power is left to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute.</p>
            <p>Then as to the Unseasonable hour, besides other Reasons that have been mentioned; Would those who make the Objection have been content, a thing of this nature should have been done in broad day-light, and by sound of Drum and Trumpet? No doubt they would then, with more reason, have complained, That a King, in these unhappy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47953:5"/>
circumstances, should be exposed to such an appearance of a Triumph; The thing, in the World, the Prince is the least inclined to, and in that respect hath right to the fairest construction such a Proceeding will admit.</p>
            <p>Whoever will compare the Power of the Prince, with the use he maketh of it, must be sufficiently convinced of his Moderation: And in this particular instance, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessity of the Prince's coming to Town that very day, of which he was the best Judge, and admitting the consequence, which cannot reasonably be denied, That the King's remaining there at that time might not only have given an interruption to the Peace of the Town, but to the Respect that ought to be preserved to his Person; it was not possible to execute what was thought so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, with more Decency and Precaution than was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; and impartial Judges, who are not carried away by the Sound of things, against the Reason of them, will, no doubt, give their Opinions, That this Proceeding doth not deserve any part of the Censure that hath been put upon it, by those who did not know the Truth of it.</p>
