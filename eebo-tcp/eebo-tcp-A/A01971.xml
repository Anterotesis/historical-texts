         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Surely it deſerueth the beſt paines of a

in expounding this rare <hi>Song.</hi> Such is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
ſuch the worke, that neither father nor child

is a man of great place and note in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;

is a very deep &amp; profound <hi>Diuine.</hi> The many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

other in Engliſh ſome heretofore publiſhed, other
still lying by him, are euidences of more then I haue
ſayd. As for this preſent Treatiſe, I obſerue ſixe
worthie points in it to commend it vnto thee.
1. A true interpretation of the Hebrew text. 2. A
ſound expoſition of the ſenſe and meaning of the
words. 3. A fit application of the Metaphors, and
allegories. 4. A fruitfull collection of doctrines,
and obſeruations. 5. Perſpicuit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to be briefe, are obſcure; other, labouring
to be perſpicuous, are taedious: when they meete
together they are admirable helpes to vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
memory, affection and all. Thus I haue ſhewed
thee (Chriſtian Reader) that this <hi>Song of Songs</hi>
is worthie to bee expounded; yea that neceſſarie
it is, it ſhould bee expounded: that the Author of
this worke is well able to performe ſo weightie a
worke; and that he hath taken good paines in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it. Do thou vſe his paines for thine owne
good. If thou aske me why I meddle ſo farre in it,
as to publiſh it, I anſwere, <hi>For thy good;</hi> had it
not been for me, thou haddeſt not ſeene it: for it
ſhould ſeem that the Author long ſince wrot it, and
let it lie in his ſtudie, not minding to publiſh it, I
being of late with him about other buſineſſe, eſpied
it: and reading it deſired him to publiſh it: he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
denied me. I then intreated him to beſtowe
it on me; he gaue it me. Thus it was mine. But
ſhould I keepe ſuch a pearle of ſo good vſe to all
that will vſe it, cloſe and ſecret to my ſelfe? Then
might I iuſtly be cenſured, as enuious of thy good.
I enuie it not: I would I could doe thee more good;
<pb facs="tcp:3431:5"/>
thou ſhouldest be ſure to pertake thereof. But that,
while I ſeeke to auoide the blame of <hi>Enuie,</hi> I may
not ſeeme ambitious, know that in this whole worke
there is nothing of mine, but all is the Authors own.
Hee hath alſo by him, a like <hi>Expoſition of the

preuaile with him for the publiſhing of them, when

Church, and ſometimes, but very rarely, the friends
of them both: In all which the Church, burning
with a deſire of Chriſt longeth, and is impatient
till ſhee be ioined vnto him. For hether tend all her
paſſions, exclamations, teſtifications of her loue,
commendations of her ſpouſe. Chriſt againe by
kinde gentle and louing ſpeeches comforteth and
cheereth vp the Church with certaine hope of that
happie and bleſſed time: for hether tend all his

making her more holy and fit for him. Till ſhee be

               <p>The Booke hath two parts. Whereof the firſt
comprehendeth all that time that Chriſt and ſhee
are friends, before any falling out, in the foure firſt
Chapters. The Churrh longing to bee ioined to
Chriſt. Chapt. 1. Acknowledging the benefits and
comforts of life, pleaſure and all good things which
he beſtoweth vpon her. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2. And laſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ſee Chriſt in his heauenly glory. Chapt. 3.
Whom Chriſt moſt ſweetly comforteth. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4.
The ſecond part, in the foure laſt chapters, is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out of theſe two louers thorough the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
fault and vnkindneſſe to him. But this falling
out is a renuing of their loue. In her by repentance
<hi>Chapt.</hi> 5. in him by a gratious accepting of her into
his fauour againe, as deere as euer ſhee was before.
<hi>Chapt.</hi> 6. Whence ariſeth all thankefulneſſe from
the Church and promiſe to amend <hi>Chapt.</hi> 7. <hi>vers</hi> 1.
2. 3. 4. with a noble demonſtration of her zeale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; teſtified by her longing, firſt for his owne
comming in the fleſh. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 7. <hi>vers</hi> 5. <hi>to the end of
the Chapter.</hi> Secondly for the drawing of others
that as yet were ſtrangers and aliens from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to the fellowſhip and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of Chriſt, and for the whole Iſraell of God
(Iewes and Gentiles) to be knit and ioined together
in one holy ſociety. <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8. And ſo this ſecond part
containeth three moſt excellent propheſies. One of
the <hi>words</hi> incarnation, an other of the calling of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3431:9"/>
Gentiles, the third of the conuerſion of the Iewes

Chriſt to trie the faith of his children ſeemeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <hi>a little one, and ſhe hath no breſts,</hi>) The Church
of God before the comming of Chriſt, was ſhut
vp within narrowe bounds, the Gentiles beeing
then aliens and ſtrangers from the couenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>in the day, when</hi>) God hath the moments of

               <p>
                  <hi>ſhe ſhall be talked of.</hi>) Faith onely maketh men
famous. The Gentiles before their calling were
neuer talked of amongſt Gods people: though
for learning, arts, valour, they were the men of
name in the world, and accounted the worthies of
the earth: but it is indeed more honourable to be
famous in Gods Church, then to haue al the fame
and eſtimation in the world beſide.</p>
               <p>True fame is in piety, and the feare of God only.</p>
               <p>Men muſt beate their heads and caſt about how
to performe the worke of God in the beſt manner.</p>
               <p>Gods children muſt bend their ſpeeches to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
and ſet forth thoſe that truely feare God, and
to make them famous, to honour and prefer them
before worldlings, howſoeuer they glitter and
ſhine in the eies of men. So did <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſet light by
