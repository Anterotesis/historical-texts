         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
Unprejudic'd READER,
By Way of DIALOGUE,
Between Gent. and Prefacer.</head>
            <p>IT is Obvious to every days Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that to the well furniſhing a
Houſe, pieces of Paint (wherein the
Pencil hath naturally deſcribed <hi>Anticks</hi> and
<hi>Mimmicks</hi>) are as much valued by the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as ſome Originals of renowned Faces:
The true proportion of the Figure, and
lively deciphering (as much as poſſible) the
very Air of every Motion, making <hi>Art</hi> do
the Buſineſs of <hi>Nature;</hi> whilſt the Eye is
entertained with the divertive Figure of
a <hi>Scarramouch</hi> or <hi>Pantalloon,</hi> behind the
<pb facs="tcp:45028:4"/>
door of a Parlour here in <hi>London,</hi> as if
they beheld him Acting in an Opera at
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Books,</hi> therefore, that (like Pieces of
<hi>Paint</hi>) repreſent unto us <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi>
(otherwiſe) out of our <hi>Kenn,</hi> and too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
for our Obſervation, may claim the
Privilege of uſing <hi>natural Colours,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
<hi>Poſtures proper</hi> to the <hi>Figure</hi> they ſet
before us: Or elſe how can the <hi>Deſcription</hi>
Anſwer the end for which it was <hi>deſigned,</hi>
and give a true <hi>proſpect</hi> of the propoſed
<hi>Object?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Artiſts, in deſcribing <hi>Apollo,</hi>
paint him with large <hi>Rays</hi> round his Head,
and ſometimes <hi>Circling</hi> the whole Body.
<hi>Diana</hi> is known by the <hi>Creſcent,</hi> on her
Forehead; a <hi>Fountain, Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Bow</hi> and
<hi>Arrows:</hi> But if he that expoſed the Story
of <hi>Guzman,</hi> had clapped him on a <hi>Lawyers</hi>
Gown; or <hi>Don Quixot</hi> had been dreſs'd
up in a <hi>Cloak</hi> or <hi>Caſſock,</hi> it would ſo vaſtly
have altered the <hi>Figure,</hi> that the <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi>
had been loſt; and the <hi>Buffoon</hi>
could not ſo well have been diſcerned
through the <hi>Formality</hi> of the <hi>Garb:</hi> Tho'
it's impoſſible but a <hi>ſtrict Judicious Eye</hi> might
obſerve a <hi>Step,</hi> a <hi>Glance</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> that
might betray the <hi>Mechaniſm</hi> of the <hi>Puppet,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45028:4"/>
and diſcover the <hi>Aſs</hi> in the <hi>Lions</hi> Skin.
Yet all the while, a thouſand others (who
had ſeen no further than the Vizor) might
have been impoſed upon by the <hi>Impoſture,</hi>
and take the <hi>Cobler</hi> for the <hi>Vicar.</hi>

            <stage>Enter Gent.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But you will ſay (perhaps) if you
were for expoſing either the <hi>Fool</hi> or the
<hi>Knave,</hi> why could you not (too) have
gone into ſome Foreign Country for the
<hi>Habits,</hi> and have made <hi>them</hi> ſpeak <hi>French,
Dutch</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh?</hi> Did ever any Man, as
yet, hang up the Pictures of his <hi>Family</hi> and
<hi>Kindred</hi> in <hi>Fools Coats,</hi> or dreſs his Friends
in the Equipage of <hi>Anticks?</hi> Were there
none for thee to let looſe thy wild Satyr
upon, but a <hi>harmleſs, meek, inoffenſive</hi> ſort
of <hi>People,</hi> that would not Injure ſo much
as a <hi>Fly,</hi> that came in their way? Hadſt
thou none but <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>theſe</hi> to <hi>worry</hi> and
<hi>abuſe</hi> at this barbarous rate? I can aſſure
you, that divers <hi>ſober</hi> well-meaning People
can by no means think well of it, at this
time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prefacer.</speaker>
               <p>Why, look ye Gentlemen! give
me but the allowance of a few words, and
I will convince you, That it was not any
<pb facs="tcp:45028:5"/>
                  <hi>Pique</hi> or <hi>Animoſity</hi> againſt <hi>Friends</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
that firſt gave Occaſion to the writing
hereof; and that the matter herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
ought not in any wiſe to Affect a
ſober Man, of what Profeſſion ſoever;
for it is not the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but the <hi>Pagan</hi>
that is expoſed.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe I have a <hi>Friend</hi> whom I much
eſteem and value, and the <hi>Devil</hi> get on a
Suit of his Apparel, may I not <hi>beat, thraſh,</hi>
and cudgel the <hi>Fiend</hi> to force him thence?
Nay, I take my ſelf to be the more obliged
to <hi>Baſtinado</hi> him, for attempting the <hi>Garb</hi>
of a <hi>Friend.</hi> So that you are not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that it is the <hi>demure, cloſe,</hi> or <hi>honeſt</hi>
Yea-and-Nay-man that is here expoſed;
but the <hi>Devil,</hi> or ſome <hi>Fiend</hi> as bad, that
hath put on the <hi>Habit, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Mein</hi>
of a <hi>Sanctimonian.</hi> If you ſhould ſee a
<hi>Bear</hi> run through the Street with your
Brother's Coat on, would you not <hi>Baſte</hi>
and <hi>Cudgel</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> notwithſtanding the
Kindneſs you might have for his Coat?
Let me ask you that Queſtion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and to very ſmall purpoſe;
when 'tis not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that thou haſt been
<hi>beating</hi> of, but the <hi>Brother:</hi> Elſe when
thou proclaimeſt to the World the <hi>vicious,
debauch'd,</hi> and <hi>licentionu</hi> Actions of <hi>Friends;</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:45028:5"/>
why doſt thou not ſay, It's the <hi>Devil</hi> or
the <hi>Bear</hi> in the ſhape of a <hi>Friend?</hi> Or elſe
thou maiſt well imagine the moſt of Men
will be under a miſtake, which it is thou
meaneſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pref.</speaker>
               <p>I tell you once more, That the
Devil doth not only put on the Habit and
<hi>Ear-mark</hi> of <hi>Friends;</hi> but, ſometimes, their
very <hi>Name</hi> too; and yet for all, that ſhall be
a mere <hi>Devil</hi> ſtill; however he be <hi>Dignified</hi>
and <hi>Diſtinguiſhed:</hi> So that for the time to
come, whenever you ſee the <hi>Cloven-Foot,</hi>
you may be aſſured it is the <hi>Fiend,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other Figure he appears in.</p>
               <p>Though it's unqueſtionably true, That
the <hi>Devil</hi> hath haunted, and doth ſtill
haunt the World in <hi>Forms</hi> much differing
from that of <hi>Friends;</hi> yet, (ſince <hi>It</hi> is a
<hi>Maſquing</hi> Habit he hath often taken up
and worn) it is to be hoped the <hi>Taylors</hi>
will not fall out about it.</p>
               <p>One of the greateſt Difficulties will be
to reconcile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Complement,</hi> and
make a Suit of <hi>Clothes</hi> of the <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi>
Stamp, without <hi>Feather, Lace</hi> or <hi>Ribbons,</hi>
ſit well upon the Back of a <hi>Devil</hi> dancing
to a <hi>Serenade,</hi> or plunging himſelf into a
<hi>Debauch:</hi> And this (in plain Engliſh) is
the higheſt part of the <hi>Deviliſm.</hi> But
<pb facs="tcp:45028:6"/>
(ſince there hath hardly been any other
<hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Profeſſion</hi> but the <hi>Fiend</hi> hath <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queraded</hi>
in) the wonder may abate, if we
him clad in <hi>this,</hi> eſpecially if we conſider
the <hi>cloſeneſs</hi> of the Diſguiſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Beſides this, there is much fault
found with the ſcurrilouſneſs of the <hi>Stile,</hi>
which in many places is ſo fulſome, that it
quite overcomes a weak Stomach, and
your <hi>Book</hi> is brought up immediately. If
the deſign be allow'd to be <hi>tolerable,</hi> it is
not to be imagined that a <hi>Stile</hi> ſo Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
will paſs amongſt Men of <hi>Judgment</hi>
and <hi>Temper,</hi> but that it will be hiſs'd off as
an inſufferable <hi>Indecency.</hi>

               <salute>Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS is to give you to <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi>
That the Devil of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
is come amongſt ſome call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Friends,</hi> and hath drawn them into wretched
<hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Inconveniencies:</hi> For, by reaſon
of the Tufting of the <hi>Men of the Worlds</hi> But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
with Silk, the price will ſo advance, that
<hi>Friends</hi> may not think it convenient to Line
their <hi>Rayment</hi> with <hi>Venetian</hi> or <hi>Tabbee</hi> for
the future. And why may not Friends have
as much right to the Toylings of the Creature,
as thoſe that <hi>are without?</hi> Shall the poor little
Worm Spin out her Bowels, only to make Sattin
and Velvet, Flowered Silks, and Sarſnets for
carnal Men, and their <hi>Women?</hi> And ſhall not
Friends put in for a ſhare of the outward En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments?
I tell thee Yea, as long as Friends
<pb facs="tcp:45028:8"/>
have any thing of the <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>old</hi> Man
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft, they have a right to be accommodated
with <hi>outward</hi> Things, Yea marry have they.
And therefore in Subordination, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential
to what was ſaid before, Friends will
not be <hi>button'd</hi> out of the <hi>Linings</hi> of their
upper Garments.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Complement</hi> be entered
into certain People, by the World called Friends;
it may be very likely he may grow <hi>unruly</hi> and
<hi>diſorderly,</hi> unleſs he meet with as much <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi>
and Entertainment amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> as
amongſt the Wicked.</p>
            <p>Why may not <hi>Complement</hi> find as good
Lodging under a Holland Shirt, or a <hi>Silk Waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat</hi>
on the back of a Friend, as well as another
Man; eſpecially ſince Friends <hi>outward Man</hi>
is made of <hi>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>?
Well then it is allowable, that Friends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
(not only common Silks, but) the richeſt they
can get, as one ſtep to the entertaining of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement;</hi>
and who knows but by Converſation
<hi>he</hi> may be brought over to <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi>
to <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then if <hi>Complement</hi> be <hi>thirſty,</hi> it may be
convenient for <hi>Friends</hi> to make him drink, not
Water (which they call <hi>Adam's Ale</hi>) but <hi>Wine,</hi>
generous <hi>Wine,</hi> edifying <hi>Wine, Friends
Wine,</hi> that which ſhall make him drop his
<pb facs="tcp:45028:8"/>
               <hi>Hat off from his Pool</hi> by way of <hi>Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Complement</hi> may be as well
<hi>fed</hi> at the Table of a <hi>Friend,</hi> or (if he thinks
meet) at a Tavern, or <hi>French Ordinary,</hi>
with <hi>Ragouſts, Oglio's</hi> and <hi>Soops,</hi> as at
any other Mans Table whatſoever.</p>
            <p>We can allow <hi>him</hi> his <hi>Brace</hi> of <hi>Gueldings,</hi>
or a <hi>Coach</hi> to rumble him to his <hi>Country-houſe,</hi>
where he may <hi>Epicurize</hi> in that which
the World calls <hi>Luxury</hi> from one <hi>Firſt Day</hi> to
another. And what ſhould make this Devil of
<hi>Complement</hi> to lead <hi>Friends aſtray</hi> into
<hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences?</hi> What ſhould
make him ſo <hi>Sullen</hi> and <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> after all
this Entertainment and <hi>Careſſing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some are of Opinion, It's only becauſe Friends
will not allow him to wear <hi>Point de Venice,</hi>
a laced Hat and Feather, and have two or
three <hi>Footmen</hi> at his breech with <hi>gawdy lac'd
Liveries:</hi> Why! and if this be the matter that
is ſtuck at, <hi>Friends</hi> are reſolved never to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
to it. Nay, they will rather be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to be condemn'd to ſwallow <hi>Heathen
Plum-broth</hi> and <hi>Minc'd Pye</hi> at the time called
<hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> to <hi>pull off their Hats</hi> in the
<hi>Steeple-houſe,</hi> to wear <hi>Swords, lac'd Bands,</hi>
and <hi>Pantaloons</hi> hung round with <hi>Ribbons,</hi>
than ever comply with the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
upon ſuch Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45028:9"/>
By the following Diſcourſe it will appear,
That Friends have been no Strangers to the
thing call'd <hi>Complement,</hi> as it relates to <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
Entertainment</hi> or <hi>Converſation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> or (as I may ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman.</hi> And if it muſt be
inſiſted upon (after all this) that becauſe ſome
<hi>called Friends</hi> have arrived to ſuch great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
by means of ſomewhat that looks as it
were <hi>Complement:</hi> I ſay, that therefore the
<hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Complement</hi> muſt be thus <hi>Equip'd</hi>
at the Charge of <hi>Friends,</hi> we think it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
as to enter our <hi>Proteſt</hi> againſt
it.</p>
            <p>But if by reaſon of this Conteſt betwixt us
and the <hi>Devil</hi> aforeſaid, any of them (by the
World) called Friends, have had their <hi>Light</hi>
ſo far Extinguiſhed, as to be led into <hi>Snares</hi>
and <hi>Difficulties;</hi> muſt preſently a Printer take
up the matter, and publiſh the Banes of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
between us, to the World? Commend me
to our Brethren the <hi>Turks,</hi> who (being of the
ſame <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Order, in ſome reſpect) will
not permit the <hi>Carnal</hi> Art of Printing in their
Dominions; ſo that the Inquiſitive <hi>World</hi>
cannot be ſo eaſily informed of <hi>Amities</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

of our <hi>Tribe</hi> have made in the Acquiſition
<pb facs="tcp:45028:9"/>
of <hi>modiſh</hi> and <hi>complemental</hi> Attainments.
But hang it! it relates not at all to any of <hi>Us,</hi>
but only to thoſe, who either had not the <hi>Light,</hi>
or ſuffered it to be <hi>Extinguiſhed;</hi> and then
they are none of <hi>Us.</hi> So</p>

Friends, It may not be amiſs,
when a Friend undertaketh to
ſpeak as touching a <hi>Thing,</hi> the Nicity of the
<hi>Thing,</hi> the Subject of the <hi>Thing,</hi> the Nature
of the <hi>Thing,</hi> the Matter of the <hi>Thing,</hi> the
Conſequence of the <hi>Thing;</hi> how far the
<hi>Thing</hi> may be according to the <hi>Light,</hi> and
how far not according to the <hi>Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45028:11"/>
the main <hi>Thing</hi> in Queſtion. The <hi>Thing</hi> that
we are now upon, is, concerning the <hi>Word</hi>
or the <hi>Thing</hi> called <hi>Complement</hi> or <hi>Courtſhip,</hi>
which is all one in that which the <hi>Carnal</hi>
call the <hi>Original.</hi> For though Friends do
not think fit to ſet forth their <hi>own</hi> Original
before the <hi>Wicked</hi> ones; yet they do, and
may think it lawful to declare their
Thoughts, as concerning the riſe and firſt
derivation of the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Faſhions</hi> uſed
by the <hi>Wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humh! As for concerning and touching
the word Complement, it is of a baſe,
filthy, polluted, and carnal Original, it
being found in the Language of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi>
or the Roman Language, which few
Friends are acquainted withal; as thus,
they teach the poor deluded Youth in their
carnal Schools, <hi>Complement, Complementior,
Complementiſſimus,</hi> which ſoundeth ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
as is enough to turn the Stomach
eſpecially of a <hi>She Friend;</hi> for what can
<hi>tiſſimus</hi> and <hi>iſſimus</hi> ſignifie, unleſs they have
a prophane meaning? So again, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
it from <hi>Complementare, Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiri,</hi>
and <hi>Complete-mentiri,</hi> which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ones themſelves ſay ſignifies no other
than a downright Lye; ſo again, the <hi>Vain
Ones</hi> ſay, <hi>I muſt pay a Complement</hi> to ſuch a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45028:11"/>
Lady (as they call 'em) or ſuch a Perſon;
as if <hi>Lying</hi> were a Debt which they owed,
and muſt pay to one another. So again,
ſays one of them, I received a <hi>Complement</hi>
from ſuch a Lord or Gentleman, (as they
call one another) which is as much as to
ſay, I received a <hi>Lye,</hi> a <hi>Sham,</hi> an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth,</hi>
or the like. Whereas <hi>Friends</hi> make no uſe
of ſuch Words as look one way, and mean
quite another, but leave them to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Ones. For the Language of Friends
is after this ſort, I have <hi>heard</hi> from <hi>Thomas,</hi>
or ſo; or, I have received a <hi>Meſſage</hi> from
<hi>Abigal,</hi> which commonly carries ten to
one more <hi>in it</hi> than their vain, puff-paſt
Airy Words can pretend to. So they ſay
in their Teachings, <hi>Second-Lye, Third-Lye,</hi>
and <hi>Fourth-Lye;</hi> wherein many times they
ſpeak much according to Truth; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Friends ſay,</p>
            <p>Again in the ſecond place, If a Friend
out of pure <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> ſhould
go to one of theſe young <hi>Whipper-ſnappers,</hi>
and taking him by the Hand, and twinkling
his Eyes, ſhould ſpeak unto him after this
manner;</p>
            <p>Friend, I have great Yearnings for thee,
and wiſh I could prevail with thee to lay by thy
overgrown Perriwig of Harlots Hair, thy
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45028:12"/>
carnal Sword, thy painted Habit, and become
a Friend of the Light; it is pity ſuch a well-featur'd
Youth, and one for whom Nature
hath done ſo much, ſhould caſt himſelf away,
by following the evil Manners of the Wicked:
for if thou didſt but know the ſweet Enjoyments
that are to be had amongſt Friends, I dare
ſay thou wouldſt find them much ſafer, and
more ſuitable to thy Inclinations, than this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
and open way of Gallantry (as thou call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
it) for I am greatly moved towards thee,
and could wiſh thou wouldſt leave that frothy
carnal Way of the World called Complement,
and become as one of us. <hi>What reply may
we think would be returned to ſuch a
courteous, ſweet and friendly Invitation?
Alas, alas! let me ſee whether I can for

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Thing,</hi> which was juſt-now hinted
in the Word <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-courtly;</hi> for it is from
this Fountain, that all the other Miſchiefs
do ſlow, as our Right truſty Friend <hi>James
Naylor</hi> heretofore Witneſſed; and it may
appear from conſidering the Word <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in it ſelf, and <hi>figuratively</hi> as they call it
(that is to ſay) clothed with ſuch a Sence
as they pleaſe to put upon it. The naked
word <hi>Court</hi> hath been conſider'd by Friends
to have been applied unto many Things.
There were two Courts in the Temple of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> the Outer Court, and the Inner;
but the Houſes of worldly Princes were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot then called Courts, but Houſes or
Palaces: But afterwards, when they had
large places of Entrance walled in before
them with Gates, for prophane Coaches
and Chairs to enter, they were Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leaped
Courts. Our Friends have not ſaid much
upon this Subject, they having had little
Buſineſs in ſuch Places, unleſs it were to
complain of Grievances; and ſometimes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45028:13"/>
in friendly manner to Upbraid and Raile
at their Governors, and to denounce cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Woes</hi> againſt ſuch as have oppoſed
what <hi>Friends</hi> call the <hi>Light;</hi> and therefore
I ſhall not meddle much with that Matter.
There are likewiſe Courts in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall,
where Friends have the benefit of
Sueing and Impleading the Men of the
World, that would Deceive and Defraud
them of the things belonging to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Tabernacles; and the Men of Law,
that belong to thoſe Places, will (upon
the appearance of Friends Angels) ſay as
much, and fill the Hall with as much noiſe
on behalf of Friends, as on behalf of the
Wicked. To this Court it is not only
lawful but expedient for Friends to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
as I ſaid, for ſecuring the Advantages
of their outward Man. And Friends are
often obſerved to be great Followers of
theſe Courts, drudging after the Green
Bags, the Gowns and Coifs, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as great a Harveſt to the Men of the
Robe, as other of their carnal Clients.</p>
            <p>It is eaſie for any that have the Light
to obſerve from hence the Original of the
word Courtly, as if I ſhould ſay <hi>Court-Lye;</hi>
and though it be allowable upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Friends, yet ought the Wicked
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45028:13"/>
by no means to take Advantage thereof.
This word <hi>Courtly</hi> is in ſuch great requeſt
among the carnal World, that ſome of
their <hi>heatheniſh Poets</hi> have made a Play
thereof; and have inſolently dubb'd it
with the vain glorious Title of, <hi>Sir Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nice:</hi> which is one of the moſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh</hi>
Inventions that ever blaſted the
Eyes of Friends. For as Friend <hi>holding
forth</hi> at <hi>Bull-and-Mouth</hi> oftentimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his Voice, diſtends his Lungs, caſts
up his Eyes, diſtorts his Mouth, erects
his Ears, and puts himſelf forth in ſuch
Poſtures as extorts Laughter from the
<hi>unthinking</hi> part of the Auditory; even ſo
is this <hi>poor thing, Sir Courtly,</hi> expoſed on
a prophane Stage, until he
become the very<note n="*" place="margin">A notable heathen Word.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay now I come to ſpeak
of another <hi>Court,</hi> which is not far from
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Church (as they call it.) <hi>Court,
Court, Court,</hi> where Friends have been
long at School, and undergone divers ſorts
of Diſcipline; I ſay, They have been

it bore the Name of a certain man of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington,</hi>
that had ſtuck cloſe upon the

will the Name of <hi>Court</hi> be ever diſtaſteful
to Friends upon account of the Place called
the <hi>Commons,</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>Paul</hi>'s

            <argument>
               <p>Of friendly Salutations uſed by the
Yea-and-Nay People.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving kick'd the carnal Complements
of the Wicked out of Doors, it may
not be amiſs to acquaint thee with the
manner of Greetings uſed amongſt Friends,
and the reaſon thereof; and therefore I
ſhall begin (as is uſual amongſt the Brethren
of the Wind-mill) at the wrong end, and
treat of the laſt thing firſt; that is to ſay,
the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why Friends may Greet one the
other.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, Becauſe Friends have the
Light, and can by help thereof diſcern the
difference between Perſon and Perſon, and
betwixt one <hi>Thing</hi> and another; Yea, I
ſay unto thee, Friends are <hi>Light</hi>-headed,
which makes them wear Hats of the largeſt
Size, that may depreſs and keep them faſt
upon their Shoulders: Sometimes Friends
have been ſo <hi>Light-headed</hi> (eſpecially after
ſome Creature-refreſhment) that they have
not been able to ſtand alone without the
help of ſome fellow Creature; as one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
Sings,
<q>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45028:15"/>
                  <l>A Candle of himſelf can't ſtand <hi>upright,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The reaſon is, becauſe his <hi>Head</hi> is <hi>light.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Yea many times He-Friends have been ſo
very Light above their Shoulders, that
She-Friends have been compelled to graft
on brow-Antlers, and Prongs of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſize, to keep their Airy <hi>Craniums</hi> from
being puffed off with every blaſt; and this
Commodity hath abounded ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<hi>Bull-and-Mouth</hi> People of late,
that it hath been thought, the price of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils
at horn Fair hath been much abated
on that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Lightneſs</hi> beſides,
to which She-Friends are much addicted,
and that is when their Heels are <hi>Light</hi> Yea
verily, and ſome of them are <hi>Light</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>For it hath been obſerved, that when a
Female Friend hath come into a Room
with a Bed (that is to ſay, whereon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man uſeth to be ſtretched, eſpecially
if ſome powerful Friend hath been in the
Chamber) that then, I ſay, She-Friends
Bowels have fallen a Yearning, and ſuch a
<hi>Lightneſs</hi> hath ſeized her Neither Parts,
that ſtreightways Female Friend hath been
overcome by the weight of Affection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45028:15"/>
Thus the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Brethren</hi> lies (as
thou maiſt ſee) in their
Heads, and that of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
(by<note n="*" place="margin">Another word of the Beaſts Language.</note> 
               <hi>Antitheſis</hi>) in their
Heels.</p>
            <p>Again, ſome She-Friends have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be ſo <hi>Light</hi> of Members, that
they have been blown down by a blaſt
from the mouth of the Wicked, having
not been able to reſiſt that ſlender force.
Now whether this may be imputed to the
<hi>Lightneſs</hi> of the Sex, or to their Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
is not much to the purpoſe; for
either way it may paſs for an obliging
Complement.</p>
            <p>But the Light that more particularly
hath influenced Friends, is that which the
Beaſts Language calleth an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi>
and ſome of their Modern Authors render,
<hi>Will-with-a-Wiſp,</hi> which leads Friends into
many Inconveniencies, that ſome of them
have been over Head and Ears in foul Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by running after it. It was this ſort
of <hi>Light</hi> that led Friend <hi>Green</hi> aſtray to
Court the Mare at <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others into Feaſts of like Nature:
And this <hi>Light</hi> Friends have been much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to follow, by which they have
found out new Complements, and forms
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45028:16"/>
of Addreſs, in uſe amongſt them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <argument>
               <p>Certain Examples of friendly Greetings
towards Great Men.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ABOUT the Year 1667, certain She-Friends
took an occaſion to paſs a
Complement on the then Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Seventh. They followed the Light, or
the <hi>Will-with-a-Wiſp</hi> that I told thee of,
until they came to the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> In
their Paſſage they travelled through the
<hi>French</hi> Army, then on the Borders of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
(though I cannot remember that they
left any ſign of their Light behind them)
but they purſued their Courſe through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Regions and Principalities until they
arrived at the Apoſtolical See; there, after
many days Seeking and Attendance (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared unto divers, that they had
a particular Meſſage to the Man called the
Pope) at length they were admitted into
the Palace; whereupon (like true Friends)
they began to <hi>open,</hi> ſaluting his Holineſs
by the Names of the <hi>Man of Sin, Whore of
Babylon,</hi> The <hi>Scarlet Whore</hi> ſitting on a
Beaſt with Seven Heads, with many other
Apocalyptick Greetings, which the Holy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45028:18"/>
Father thought very improperly applied
to him; at length the good Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them, What Profeſſion they
were of? They told him that they were
<hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> whom the Carnal
abuſiveely called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and that they
had come from far on purpoſe to paſs
thoſe Complements, and to pour their
Vials on the Seat of the Beaſt, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
more of their quaking Rhetorick,
and figurative Nonſence. At length the
good Man began to apprehend they might
be troubled with ſome ſort of Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack
Diſtemper, much like that which
haunts <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Porter, and his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
on the <hi>South</hi>-ſide of <hi>Moorefields;</hi>
whereof the Witty <hi>Hudibraſs</hi> Sings:
<q>
                  <l>As Wind in th' Hypocondria pent,</l>
                  <l>Is but a F—t, if downward ſent;</l>
                  <l>But if it upward chance to fly,</l>
                  <l>Turns to <hi>New Light</hi> and Propheſy.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So they were compaſſionately delivered
over to the care of divers able Phyſicians,
who having preſcribed them frequent
Bleedings, and a mortifying Diet for a
conſiderable time, our Females at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to feel an Inclination to return to their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45028:19"/>
Native Country, whither they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd,
having left much of their Diſeaſe
behind them, but bringing back much
more <hi>Light</hi> than they carried out; for they
returned not only with <hi>light</hi> Heads, <hi>light</hi>
Purſes, <hi>light</hi> Bodies; but not a little <hi>Light</hi>-hearted
that they had eſcaped the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Doctors.</p>
            <p>Where are there now amongſt any other
ſort of People but we of the <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi>
Tribe, any whoſe <hi>Civility</hi> ſhall lead them
through ſo many hazards and dangers of
loſing their <hi>Light</hi> to paſs a Complement
upon a Stranger? Where are there, I ſay,
amongſt the Wicked and Carnal any that
are buoy'd up to ſuch a height of Courage,
and ſeared with ſuch a <hi>friendly</hi> hardneſs,
to carry them through ſuch an Adventure
as this? Nay, nay, it is not to be expected
that their Lights ſhould laſt them half

               </gap>e-puffs as Friends met
withal. But you muſt know that all this
while Friends carried their <hi>Light</hi> in a dark

               <head>Another Relation touching the Courtſhip of
Friends.</head>
               <p>In the Days of <hi>Oliver</hi> (when prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
went by Merit, and Friends were
made Juſt-Aſſes, and the Brethren of the
Light enſtruſted with the Staff of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
when Friends of the Enthuſiaſtick
Order ſaw Plots in the Air by way of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and the Revelation of a Conſpiracy
was enough to Chop off the Heads of all
the Loyal Party: About that time an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was Iſſued out to <hi>Robert Tichbourne,</hi>
called Lord Mayor, to double the Watches
of the City, for that it was feared the
Lyons would run away with the Tower of
<hi>London</hi> on their backs; <hi>Tichbourne</hi> ſent out
his Warrants to the Conſtables in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the ſaid Order: Amongſt the
which one came to the hand of one of our
Friends of the Wind-mill, who was then
called Conſtable of <hi>Smithfield;</hi> he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thereby to apprehend all Perſons that
paſſed in his Rounds betwixt the hours of
Nine at Night, and Six in the Morning,
unleſs they gave a very ſatisfactory Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Buſineſs. Accordingly Friend
with his carnal Beadle and Watchmen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45028:20"/>
took their Poſt at the time appointed, and
about One in the Morning a Party of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>'s
Horſe-guards (who had Orders to
have an Eye on that ſide) came athwart
Friend's Rounds. Whereupon Friend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of them what they were? and
they replied, they were of the Guard; but
it being the depth of the Night, Friends
Light happened to fail him (for Friends
<hi>Light</hi> doth not always ſerve them in the
Dark, though they can diſcern in the Dark
as well as without <hi>Light</hi>) ſo that Friend
ſuppoſing they might be Enemies of the
wicked Cavalier Party, put them into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,
until the next morning the Captain
of the Guards having notice of it, ſent a
Party for them, and complained thereof
unto him they called the Supreme; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Oliver</hi> ſent for Friend-Conſtable, and
having demanded of him the reaſon why
that affront was put upon his Guards?
Friend in moſt <hi>Courtly</hi> Phraſe returned this
or the like Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Since thou haſt ſent for me, O <hi>Oliver,</hi>
upon this Occaſion, I ſhall acquaint thee with
the beſt of my Knowledge concerning it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the meaſure of <hi>Light</hi> that is within
me. Therefore thou maiſt underſtand, O
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45028:20"/>
                  <hi>Oliver,</hi> that thy Servant <hi>Robert Tichbourne</hi>
ſent unto me, ſaying, Take unto thee a Band
of Men, and get thee into one of the high
Places of the City, namely <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and
there keep thee diligent Watch and Ward from
the hour of Nine in the Evening, until the
Sixth hour the next Morning, ſeizing on ſuch
as give not account of themſelves. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
I took unto me a Band of Men, and
went into the high Place of the City, namely
<hi>Smithfield;</hi> and behold about the Second
Watch there appeared unto us as it were ſome
of the Sons of Men Armed, and riding upon
Horſes; and I ſaid unto them, Who are ye?
and they anſwered and ſaid, We are the Guard:
And I anſwered and ſaid unto them, Nay, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we are the Guard. Whereupon (a diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
touching that matter) I ſmote them Hip
and Thigh, and laid them in Bands. Now if
there be any fault in this matter, thou canſt
not take it to be in me who received the Order,
but in <hi>Robert Tichbourne</hi> who ſent it.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Friend</hi> had paſſed this Extraordinary
Complement on his <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Mightineſs,</hi> it
took ſuch Effect with the Ruler, that <hi>Friend</hi>
was not only diſmiſſed without Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but was told, He had done well in

Creature called Wine, which is a beneficial
Creature in many reſpects. It is ſaid the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Poets have made many prophane and
wicked Ballads in Praiſe of this Juice of the
Vine, and have called it <hi>Nectar,</hi> and the
Fountain of <hi>Helicon,</hi> and have Dedicated
it to their Heathen God <hi>Bacchus</hi> (as they
call him) a moſt debauch'd and looſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45028:21"/>
Companion, whom themſelves always
paint with red a Noſe, and fiery Face, a
tun Belly, and Bunches of Grapes round
his Head, with a great Goblet of Wine in
his Hands, ſitting a-ſtride a great Tun or
Veſſel; all which are lewd Intimations of
their beaſtly Inclinations: But Friends have
found out greater Advantages by the Juice
of the Grape, than theſe Heathen People
could ever pretend to; for Friends have
not ſet themſelves upon Tuns in that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
naked manner, without Clothes on
their Backs, but Friends have got Clothes
to their Backs; yea, I ſay, Clothes to their
Backs, and City-houſes, and Country-houſes
(nay, ſome have had the vanity
to be hurried about in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>r Coaches too,
after the manner of the Wicked) and all
by virtue of this ſame Juice of the Vine,
whilſt the beaſtly Poets (who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be Inſpired by it) have ſung
themſelves out of all they had: And is not
this a vaſt difference? I ſay then, That
they are only the Friends of the Light that
know how to put a value on this ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and beneficial a Creature, having got
the right knack of improving themſelves
thereby.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this that thou ſhouldſt think
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45028:22"/>
Friends know not the uſe of its Vertue in
other reſpects; for to deal plainly with
thee, there are a ſort of Wet-friends, who
perhaps have been as ſenſible of the warm
Effects of the Bottle, as the great hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
noiſey Pretenders: But what then?
Doth it follow that if a Brother have a little
Eclipſed his <hi>Light</hi> by taking too much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
into his Veſſel, and happen in that
Condition to ſtumble over a Female Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Dark, muſt he preſently ſend
a Note of it to <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and get
all the carnal Waſps called Parritors about
his Ears? Nay, nay, Beloved! Friends
have more of the Serpent than ſo to expoſe
themſelves. But I had almoſt forgot I
promiſed thee an Account of a paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Friend <hi>B.</hi> and a certain King; and
it was thus;</p>
               <p>Friend <hi>B.</hi> was a Vintner, and I need not
tell thee his Dealing was in that ſort of
Juice I juſt now ſpoke of; it happened that
one day ſome of the King's Servants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Cellar, drinking at his houſe,
ſo much approved of the Wine, that they
agreed for ſeveral Veſſels of it, and marked
them up, having agreed to ſend for them
the next Morning; and taken with them
ſome Bottles, whereof the King having
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45028:22"/>
had a Taſte, ſo far liked the Wine, that
he commanded it to be kept for his own
uſe. But behold, when the Carts came in
the Morning to carry off the Veſſels, they
were all Enchanted, not one of them could
ſo much as be moved; for Friend <hi>B.</hi> had
laid an Imbargo on them, becauſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that agreed for the Price of them, had
not ſent the <hi>Praemium</hi> which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
between them; whereupon the
King became acquainted that Friend <hi>B.</hi>
had refuſed to ſend the Wine by the Carts,
ſo that in fine the Vintner was ſent for,
who at his Entrance into the Preſence,
was accoſted by one of the Uſhers who
endeavoured to take off his Hat, which the
King perceiving (who was a Prince of a
very excellent Humour) commanded to
let his Hat alone; whereupon Friend drew
near, and making a complemental Nod
(which amongſt Friends paſſes for a Bow)
the King demanded of him, Whether he
were the Quaking Vintner, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to truſt him with the Wine his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had marked up? To which Friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
He was one of thoſe the World cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Quakers, but that he had not refuſed
to truſt the King with the Wine; for if
he thought fit, he ſhould have all the Wine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45028:23"/>
Friend had; <hi>But,</hi> continued he, <hi>to deal
plainly with Thee, Thou haſt a ſort of People
about Thee, that I do not care to have to do
with.</hi> This Jeſt ſo pleaſed that gracious
Prince, that Friend was ordered his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and preſently the Enchantment was
diſſolved, and the Veſſels had leave to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of Friends Cuſtody.</p>
               <p>So that as I was ſaying to thee, Friends
are Wiſe in their Generation, and know
how to make more advantage of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than the pretended Grape-admirers
can pretend to.</p>

Men of the Times, to beget in them a good
Opinion of the Genius and Humour of
<hi>Friends;</hi> that they may ſee that <hi>Friends</hi> are
not ſo far removed from the Influences of
Fleſh and Blood, but that they can reliſh
the <hi>Refreſhments</hi> of the Creature, and take
a ſhare in the liberal uſe of her Bounties.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt Sort of theſe, as their
Temper is more rugged, ſo is their way of
Greeting more Blunt, Stiff and Inflexible;
for their Poſture is ordinarily with their
Arms folded upon their Breaſt, their Hats
ſomewhat of a larger Size, leſs Hair on
their Heads, and leſs Linen appearing in
their Neckcloths than the reſt; a walk
ſlow, ſtarch'd and ſevere, and out of that
Poſture they will not put themſelves upon
the account of any Perſon whatſoever; for
as for carnal Men, they paſs them by, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly neglected, or at beſt allow
them but an <hi>Innuendo.</hi> Upon meeting an
Acquaintance, they ſhall juſt ſtop in the
ſame Poſture, and ſtare ye full in the Face
with,</p>
            <p>How doſt thee, <hi>Edward,</hi> or <hi>William?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How fares it with thee?</p>
            <p>How it is? or ſo; and then caſting
their Eyes down on the Ground, of a
ſudden walk off with a Humh, Fare thee
well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45028:24"/>
The ſecond Sort accoſts thee after a
much different manner, with an Air and
Grace very obliging, having their Hats
more Faſhionable, their Cravats larger,
their Apparel of a more gentile Cut, of
very fine Cloath, and richer Lining; with
an inviting Bow, inclining pretty low, a
gentle Elevation, and a courteous Graſp
by the hand; with,</p>
            <p>Friend <hi>Samuel,</hi> how is it with thee?</p>
            <p>Sometimes (if Gloves are off) a ſoft
touch in the Palm, and a pretty ſort of
grin, twinkling the Eyes; <hi>Friend how doſt
thee do?</hi> or the like, holding thee by the
Hand in friendly manner; and ſweetly
Leering in thy Face all the while, ſhall ask
thee, <hi>Art thee free to take a Diſh of Coffee,
or a Walk upon</hi> Change, or the like; where
theſe mortified Self-deniers ſhall be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Brokers, Chapmen, Maſters
of Ships, Meſſages, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as if they had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs'd
all the Trade of the River: But
if thou art not free to go, thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd
with a <hi>Humh, I am very buſie:
Well, I ſhould be glad to ſee thee ſome
time, &amp;c.</hi> This the baſe Cenſorious World
may be apt to interpret Oſtentation, or
ſo; but Friends well know the Advantage
of this way of Courtſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:45028:25"/>
But now it fares much otherwiſe if one
or ſo of the prettier ſort of She-friends
happen to come athwart theſe ſecond kind
of Friends; for then the pretty Simpers
are made, the Face dreſt with friendly
Smiles. Then it is fit that buſineſs ſhould
give way, that Friends outward Man may
take ſome Creature refreſhing: Then
Humh, <hi>Alack, alack,</hi> Suſan, <hi>I am glad to
ſee thee; why, when waſt thee in Town before?
How is it with</hi> John, or <hi>Robert?</hi> (If ſhe be
a married Woman) <hi>When doſt thee expect
him home? or, How is it with thy Family?</hi> &amp;c.
She-friend replies, Indeed I think it may
be a pretty while ſince I ſaw thee, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
to ſee thee ſo well tho; why, thee
lookeſt very well; I am in ſome doubt
whether I may ſee <hi>John</hi> yet this month or
two; but when wilt thee call at <hi>Horſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or <hi>Lime-houſe?</hi> Verily thee mayſt
come if thee didſt think it convenient, if it
may ſo <hi>ſtand with thy Buſineſs.</hi> Yea verily,
<hi>Suſanna,</hi> (continues Male-friend) I think
it may very well <hi>ſtand with my Buſineſs</hi> at
this time; I warrant thee maiſt be thirſty
with walking ſo far, therefore I would
have thee accept of ſome Refreſhment at
Friend <hi>M</hi>'s, I uſe to go there with a
Friend ſometimes? Well then, quoth Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45028:25"/>
ſince thee beeſt <hi>Free</hi> unto it, I ſhall
be <hi>Free</hi> to go with thee for ſome time.</p>
            <p>Then (becauſe Friends cannot Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize)
the pint of Old-Hoc is called for,
and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arrel of Oyſters; then up comes
the Florence, Tuſcane and Canary, the
Sturgeon, Lobſters, Pigeons, Weſtphalia
Bacon, cold Capon, Anchovies, Caveare
or cold Salet, according to the Seaſon;
and being very mellow, the Door is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned,
and Friends endeavour to wear off
the Fumes of the Banquet; and being
known to be Friends of the Light, the
Drawer diſturbs them not until the Streets
are pretty Dark, then the Coach is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
called to the Door, and Friends
gentily ſlide in, and rumble home after the
Ceremony of a <hi>private holding forth.</hi> Next
I come once more to the Wet-Brother,
who is an indifferent Sociable Animal, and
of a more Complaiſant way of Addreſs;
for he commonly greets his Acquaintance
not altogether unſuitable to their Quality,
for he is heard to ſay to a Lord, <hi>Lord</hi> P.
<hi>or Lord</hi> S. <hi>how is it with thee?</hi> to a Military
Officer, <hi>Collonel</hi> P. or, <hi>Captain</hi> W. <hi>thee
art a Man of a good humour, and thee talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
very prettily, or ſo: I could be glad to
drink a glaſs of</hi> Wine <hi>with thee ſometimes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45028:26"/>
but thou art ſo given to ſwear in thy Diſcourſe
that Friends think it not well for me to be with
thee.</hi> So after this pretty ſort of Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
manner Wet-friend creeps into any
ſort of Company, and is as free of his
Bottles and Collations as the Topmoſt of
them all, Canting after his Yea-and-Nay
manner, till the repeated Glaſſes of Wine
ſo enflame his Light, that it may be ſeen
to blaze at his Face and Eyes: Thus it is
obſervable, that Wet-brother never balks
nor ceaſes to force about the Glaſs, with a
<hi>wilt not thee drink, Captain</hi> P.? or the like,
until, as was ſaid, his outward Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
ſeems to be all on fire. Then is Friend
become the Buffoon of the Company, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in the abundance of his own
Sence, till he has talked and drunk himſelf
into the Opinion of all in the Room; then
a <hi>Song</hi> is admitted to be ſeaſonable, and
Friends <hi>outward Man</hi> approves the Wit of
it; then out comes the unſanctified <hi>Humh!
It were pity ſuch an ingenious Man ſhould be ſo
much given to Waggery; but to deal plainly with
thee, I never was againſt any thing that was
ſmart and witty, though Friends themſelves
were Expoſed in it.</hi> Hick-cough prevented
Friend from enlarging upon that Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45028:26"/>
This may ſuffice to give thee an Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Morals of Friends, when that
which is called the <hi>outward Man</hi> prevails;
for that obſtinate <hi>Caſe</hi> many times will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>Margaret</hi> departed out of the State of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
having done the part of Friend for
Thirteen Years. She had in that time no
leſs than Fourteen Children, which were
named without Dipping, Croſſing or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45028:27"/>
Sprinkling; the firſt came in Two Months
after we came together, being the <hi>Firſt
Fruits,</hi> and Pledge of our friendly Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
as for the reſt ſhe often told me,
that ſome of them reſembled thee, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and I hope thee
wilt be kind to me for their ſakes. Since
her <hi>outward Tabernacle</hi> was laid amongſt
the duſt of <hi>Friends</hi> in the purchaſed place
of Burial, I have had great <hi>hankerings</hi> and
<hi>luſtings</hi> after <hi>ſtrange Women,</hi> and have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſuſpected that ſomewhat of the
Root of Wickedneſs hath remained in me.
But (as thee art a Friend) I will be plain
with thee, for I am apt to think thy Wife's
Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> may be in Condition to
cure theſe wild Inclinations. All the while
I was at the <hi>Holding-forth</hi> in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi>
ſhe carried away my affections ſo far from
what was ſaid, that not a Word of that
precious Friend could ſink into my Memory;
yea, I muſt acknowledge to thee that my
Deſires went a wandring, and <hi>Margaret</hi> was
as much out of my Thoughts as if I had
never known her. Indeed <hi>Margaret</hi> hath
told me, that thee waſt a very good Natur'd
Man, and didſt very well underſtand the
very Symptoms of friendly Inclinations;
therefore, it may be, thou knoweſt the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

how to adviſe thy Friend in like Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that, if thou thinkeſt it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
I may take her home to me, to lie

to be very agreeable to me, and I am apt
to think thy Siſter-in-Law <hi>Elizabeth</hi> may
have ſome well-wiſhings to me; for, to
be plain with thee, ſhe permitted me (all

Philoſopher, called <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
it as the fitteſt time for Males

as they call it) yet, by computation
I am about Four and thirty Years of Age,
and (as I have been told) ſhe may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                  <p>As for what thee wert ſpeaking
touching Maturity, I can ſay little to it,
becauſe as thee knoweſt we are denied the
uſe of Books, which are (by Friends)
thought to be the Effects only of humane
Learning, and by conſequence very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Light; though (to be free with

               <p>I Have often had thoughts of giving thee
an Account of our Arrival in this Place,
of its Situation, Temper, and what we
underwent (as well in our Paſſage hither,
as ſince our Arrival;) and when this
comes to thy Hand, thou mayſt ſee that
I have taken the preſent Opportunity to
diſpatch unto thee by the <hi>Wind-mill</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
<hi>Patrick Maggot</hi> Maſter, being the
ſame that brought us hither. And it ſeems
not amiſs if I begin to relate unto thee
what happened to us in our Paſſage, which
(as thou knoweſt) we began the <hi>34th.</hi> Day
of the Month of <hi>Fancies.</hi> When we came
on Board at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> there was very little
material happened unto us, until we paſſed
the <hi>Downs,</hi> ſaving that divers Friends came
to take their Leaves of us, not without
promiſes, that (when we had planted the
<hi>Light</hi> in thoſe <hi>far Parts,</hi> and Converted the
<hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Natives</hi> of the Country to the
<hi>Naylorian</hi> Faith) they would come and ſeek
out a <hi>Habitation</hi> amongſt us; and in the
mean time would not fail to ſend over to us
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45028:34"/>
as many as they could of the Families of
the <hi>Fickle-heads, Paper-ſculls, Humouriſts</hi> and
<hi>Stiff-necks,</hi> beſides ſome of the Order of
<hi>Thomas Muggleton,</hi> to Settle and Improve
us in <hi>Bull-and-Mouth</hi> Faith. Having given
us theſe aſſurances, they recommended us
to the Protection of the Waves, leaving
ſome vollies of Sighs to fill the Sails, and
a great many <hi>Farewels</hi> and <hi>goggling Glances</hi>
to accompany us in the Voyage. We took
in divers Paſſengers as we paſſed down the
Channel, ſome of which I ſhall name unto
thee, becauſe they may be of great uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in this place; there was (let me ſee)
Humh—<hi>Thomas Giddybrains, Arthur
Holderforth, Geofery Crackwit, Marmaduke
Featherpate,</hi> and <hi>Humphrey Shakenoddle;</hi>
beſides ſome <hi>She-Friends</hi> that freely <hi>offered
themſelves</hi> with much <hi>chearfulneſs</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the <hi>Brethren</hi> into any Region whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
for the ſake of Propagating the <hi>Bull-and-Mouth</hi>
Strain: Amongſt them was <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth
Stickfaſt, Margery Tiplecan,</hi> with
ſome others, who may be of great <hi>Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
when <hi>need ſhall require.</hi> But I ſhall now
ſpeak no more of that matter, but purſue
my Deſign in acquainting thee with what
we obſerved in our Voyage. The firſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Place we came to was that which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45028:35"/>
they call the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> belonging to
the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and our <hi>Wind-mill</hi> was
here put very hard to it, for the Winds
were loud and contrary, the Waters rough
and mountainous; ſo that it was well that
we of the Ships Crew were of ſuch <hi>Light
Principles and make,</hi> that we had no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of Sinking, or elſe we might have
been in danger of having our <hi>Lights quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
in the <hi>Bay,</hi> by the Impetuoſity of the
Waters, as ſome Friends have had theirs
<hi>Extinguiſhed</hi> on <hi>that Shore,</hi> by the Violence
of an <hi>Hurricane,</hi> they call the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
We continued two Nights and almoſt three
Days in this boiſterous Place, before we
got off; and then the Sea calm'd, and the
Winds became gentle all of a ſudden, which
ſeemed as if we had left all our troubles
behind on the Shores of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that
we had now paſt the Storms of Adverſity,
and were going to enjoy <hi>Peace, Light</hi> and
<hi>Tranquillity</hi> amongſt the better natured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Foreſts of <hi>Noddy-Land;</hi>
for though at our firſt Landing we might
find them ſomewhat <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi>
yet we had no reaſon to diſpair, but the
<hi>conſtant Temper</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> and the <hi>Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi>
and <hi>Proportion</hi> they maintained in
their Underſtandings, with thoſe of that

New-found Country, would ſoon beget a

them to ſo agreeable Converſation.</p>
               <p>We continued our Courſe through a
vaſt unbounded Ocean, abounding with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Sorts of ſtrange Fiſhes, ſome whereof
had Wings and flew above the Waters;
theſe we thought might reſemble <hi>Friends,</hi>
for that which occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ioned theſe Fiſhes to
fly, was to avoid the devouring Jaws of
certain great Fiſhes that hunted after them
upon the face of the Waters; and then
they would of a ſudden ſpring up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
themſelves in the Air to a far diſtant
place, and by that means were preſerved.
We alſo ſaw divers of the great <hi>Fiſhes</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Porpoiſes,</hi> who with great and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Eagerneſs were ſtill in purſuit of
their Prey; and theſe ſeemed unto us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
our Adverſaries the <hi>Informers, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors</hi>
and <hi>Proctors,</hi> who often ſuck in whole
Shoals of Friends; ſtowing them in the
naſty <hi>Maws</hi> of their Priſon-houſes; unleſs
(like the flying Fiſhes) Friends get on Wing
to avoid their greedy Chaſe.</p>
               <p>One Night, in our Paſſage, <hi>Suſanna</hi>
dream'd, That the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> had
put her ſelf in the Diſguiſe of a Friend, and
was going over <hi>Incognito,</hi> to mix her <hi>Tares</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:45028:36"/>
and Chaff amongſt the precious Seed that
Friends were about to Plant in this <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
Climate; and that ſhe had on Board
many Buſhels of ſuch deteſtable Weeds,
whereby ſhe intended to choak the good
Corn. We were very much troubled at
this <hi>Viſion</hi> of <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s, and could not
think it to be any think ſhort of a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
wherefore we were as diligent as
poſſible to find out if any ſuch perſon was
amongſt us, and began to enquire amongſt
our ſelves, where every ones place of <hi>Birth</hi>
and <hi>Abode</hi> had been? At laſt it ſeems there
was one who had been bred in <hi>Italy,</hi> but
upon further Examination of the Matter
you could no more have imagined her to
be the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> than the <hi>Cam</hi> of
<hi>Tartary;</hi> for it was not poſſible you could
diſcern any difference betwixt her and
the reſt of the Siſters, nor was there any
ſign that ſhe had ever uſed Patching or
Painting, nor could we find ſo much as one
<hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Necklace</hi> amongſt all her Cloaths;
beſides, her Looks were ſo Innocent, her
Demeanour ſo <hi>Humble,</hi> and her general
Converſation ſo ſweet and obliging, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch a particular kindneſs for Friends,
that we concluded <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s Dream muſt
needs mean ſomewhat elſe, that we could
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45028:36"/>
not conceive at that time, and therefore
we e'en troubled our Heads no more about
it.</p>
               <p>A Day or two after we met with a ſmall
Storm, which was very black and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
for ſometime, but it continued not
long, not above the ſpace of four or five
Hours. The Captain told us we were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Iſle of <hi>Poines;</hi> and that there were
a ſort of <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> that haunted thoſe
Parts, and always ſhewed ſome diſtaſte
or other when <hi>Friends paſſed by,</hi> perhaps
fearing leaſt at ſome time or other Friends
may take occaſion to Plant the Light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them; which doubtleſs would be
the ruine of their State.</p>
               <p>At length we arrived, after all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and came ſafe on the Shore of a Land,
in all Reſpects, ſo like our ſelves, as if it
had been cut out on purpoſe; for nothing
but an univerſal Confuſion appeared, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was <hi>Regular,</hi> nothing in Order:
There were no <hi>Exchanges</hi> for Pride and
Vanity, no gilt Coaches, nor painted
Women, no <hi>Steeple-houſes</hi> nor <hi>Hireling-Prieſts,</hi>
no <hi>wicked <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> for the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting</hi>
of Youth with <hi>humane Learning,</hi> no
<hi>Inns of Court,</hi> to ſet one Neighbour againſt
the other. And ſome are of Opinion, it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45028:37"/>
will be ſafer for the Publick to have no
Laws at all amongſt us; for whilſt we
come not to a determination of what ſhall
be Law, every body hopes that his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Inclination may be gratified, but when
once the thing is concluded upon, one ſide or
other will certainly be diſguſted: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more Prudent conclude this way
of ſuſpending any poſitive determination
as to that matter, to be of more univerſal
ſatisfaction, than it were poſſible to be were
it once reſolved upon. So that to me it ſeems
much better not to be troubled with tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Volumes of humane Laws; which have
always been ſuch a burthen as neither
<hi>Friends,</hi> nor <hi>our Brethren of the Diſſention</hi>
have been able to bear: And ſince there is
no <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> where there is no <hi>Law,</hi>
it would look as if we made <hi>Laws</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make <hi>Tranſgreſſor;</hi> but every
Friend may be a Law unto himſelf; and
then of conſequence there will be no room
for <hi>vexatious Sutes, carnal Officers, wicked
Proſecutions,</hi> nor <hi>cruel Priſon-houſes.</hi> And as
for <hi>Steeple-houſes,</hi> we intend to Build none,
and that will be an Infallible way to keep
out <hi>unclean Church-men,</hi> for they will find
little Comfort to Inhabit where they have
no <hi>reſting Place.</hi> And we are out of hopes of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45028:37"/>
bringing over the <hi>Natives to us</hi> in ſome ſhort
time, by inviting them to a
<note n="*" place="margin">A kind of heathen Word.</note>
                  <hi>Promiſcuous</hi> Cohabitation
with us; ſo that the Iſſue (at
firſt) will be <hi>Enlightned</hi> on one <hi>ſide,</hi> and in
the next Generation, there need be no
doubt but they may be <hi>Tranſparent</hi> all
through. Our greateſt fear is, leaſt at
ſome time or other the <hi>Whales</hi> might Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
againſt us, and bring <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi>
(over Sea) into this our <hi>illuminated Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi>
but as long as <hi>London-bridge</hi> ſtandeth
in the old place, it will be a hard matter
for them to do it, and we hope our <hi>Friends</hi>
(yet behind) will take care to ſecure that
Poſt: For if that Neſt of Plagues ſhould
once come to be Tranſplanted into this our
Region, it would ſoon render it <hi>

For the Security of our Territories,

               <p>Heark thee, Cornet, it is like I

but it is to be feared thee mayſt have
dealt with the evil One for that. I buy
my Wines of <hi>Friend F</hi>—who, I am apt to

deal in it? And good Creatures do not put

ſometimes drunk of Wine at thy Houſe
that hath put a Thouſand ill Things into

there might be ſomething of the <hi>Old Man</hi>

that ſometimes in an Evening I have had

               <p>A further Illuſtration of Yea-and-Nay
Morals, by way of Viſion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE ſubſequent Story hath been ſo
ſtrongly Imprinted on my Thoughts,
whether purely by the force of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ſome other Circumſtances, that it
hath obtained ſometimes the Credit of a
reality—However (in this place) it is like
to paſs for a Viſion.</p>
            <p>It was in the charming Seaſon of the
Year (when Nature was clothed in all her
Fragrances, and the tender Bloſſoms of the
cultivated Fields lent their Aromaticks to
the wanton Air, which toſs'd the <hi>Spicknard</hi>
into the neighbouring Roads, which gave
a powerful Invitation to be on Horſe-back)
that a dear Friend of mine came to my
Bed-ſide, acquainting me, That he had ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Buſineſs that Term to <hi>London,</hi> and
would be glad of my Company: <hi>For hang
it,</hi> Jack, (ſaid he) <hi>why ſhall we ſtill confine
our ſelves to the Solitudes of a Melancholy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
from the Converſation of Mankind?
I have a little Inclination to divert my ſelf
with obſerving the</hi> Modes <hi>and Tricks of the
Town, and to ſpend ſome Guineas to ſee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45028:44"/>
the</hi> Scenes <hi>of that great Theatre, the City.</hi>
The Invitation was as agreable as could be,
and I immediately complied; but we were
forced to take Coach to accompany a Lady
that was related to my Friend. When we
came to go into the Coach, there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in the Company a pretty ancient
Gentleman, who was of a ſingular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Temper, and a very good Scholar;
beſides, a brisk jocond ſort of a <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi>
Man, who ſeemed to be about Thirty
Years of Age, of an Air and Garb leſs
ſtarch'd than uſual amongſt People of his
Profeſſion. We ſpent the firſt day after the
manner of Strangers, in a kind of reſerved
Obſervance of one anothers Humours and
Inclinations, only the old Gentleman En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
us with divers Relations of what
he had obſerved in his Travels, which
were very Pleaſant, and received great
advantage by his manner of delivering
them. The ſecond day we became more
Sociable, and took a greater freedom to
Diſcourſe by turn, of ſeveral Matters Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and Divertive upon the Road; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt the <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi> Man told
us one that ſeemed ſomewhat reflective up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own Profeſſion; which gave us oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to think him not of the number of
thoſe ſtreight-lac'd ones, who preſume
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45028:45"/>
none to be honeſt but thoſe of the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
but that he entertained (at
leaſt) a poſſibility that they might fall
under the ſame Topick with other Men,
and that they might make uſe of a knack in
their way of dealing not inferiour to ſome
that have been looked on as Sharpers, by
the reſt of the World. The Story was
this:</p>
            <p>One day a certain <hi>Friend</hi> of ours went to
<hi>Smithfield</hi> Market to diſpoſe of a Horſe
he had, which had the misfortune to be
blind, but ſo advantageouſly, that he muſt
be a good Jockey that could diſcern it.
Many look'd upon the Horſe and bid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for him, but came not up to the Price
Friend intended to make of him: At length
a Citizen liked him (it may be the rather
becauſe he was in a <hi>Friends</hi> keeping)
and came ſo near the Price, that <hi>Friend</hi>
thought it no part of Prudence not to put
him off; notwithſtanding the Citizen
(having tryed the Paces, enquired into the
Age, and liked the Height and Colour of
the Horſe) at length demanded of Friend,
What faults the Horſe had? Nay, (ſays
Friend) I know of no <hi>Faults</hi> that he hath
(meaning he had but that one) ſo the
Citizen paid him down the Money, and
having received the Horſe into his Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45028:45"/>
ſaid, <hi>Truly I ſee no Fault in him;</hi> to
which <hi>Friend</hi> replied, <hi>Neither doth he ſee
any in thee:</hi> Which the Citizen (not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
took in good part; and Friend ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
a <hi>blind Horſe</hi> to be ſuitable for one
that was without <hi>Light.</hi> This Story ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the Company much the more coming
from the mouth of one of the Fraternity,
and put my Friend in mind of one he had
heard of another kind, but of the ſame
ſort of People, which he related after
this manner.</p>
            <p>It happened once on a time that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Judge ſate upon the Bench at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Aſſize, who took the Freedom (in the
Afternoon) to joak and droll upon Mens
Names; and there happened to be one
Indicted for a Murther whoſe Name was
<hi>Willman,</hi> but one of a very odd ſort of
Aſpect, whether his Guilt might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it, or no, it matters not. The
Judge (having heard the Indictment read)
ſpeaks after this manner to the Priſoner at
the Bar; <hi>Sirrah, you are here Indicted for a
Murther, and your Name is</hi> Willman, <hi>put
away</hi> W <hi>and put to</hi> Sp <hi>and it is</hi> Spill-man, <hi>put

wilt certainly be hanged.</hi> One that ſate
there as a Juſtice of the Peace (who was a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45028:46"/>
Brother of the <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi> People) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
this rhiming ſort of Juſtice to
be a ſingular new method, and that which
would paſs for current in all Caſes, entered
it down in his Pocket Book for a good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
and reſolved to ſteer by it. It
happened that in a ſhort time after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fellow was Convicted before him for
ſtealing of ſome Bacon, and after the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
had upon Oath declared their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<hi>Oh, Oh,</hi> (quoth the <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi>
Juſtice) <hi>you are a dangerous Fellow indeed,
your name is</hi> Willman. Sir (replied the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low)

<hi>that</hi> is all one, <hi>how dare you interrupt
Juſtice? I ſay thy name is</hi> Willman, <hi>(and I

out his Pocket Book, <hi>Look you, Sirrah,</hi>
(quoth the Juſtice) <hi>here is your deſtiny,

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45028:46"/>
laſt Sentence was delivered with great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence,
becauſe the Priſoner had Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him in his Execution of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi> Paſſenger Laughed as
heartily as any of the reſt, at the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Quaking Juſtice, and no debate
at all aroſe about the truth, or probability
of the Story; for all agreed that things
very Ridiculous and Abſurd might be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon the Ignorant, which was all
the uſe the Company made of it.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Coach brought us to
<hi>Coventry,</hi> where (after we had very well
Supped together) our <hi>Friend</hi> Traveller was
very importunate to take my Kinſman, and
my ſelf abroad to ſee the Town; which
we willingly conſented to, being weary of
two days ſitting in a Box. After we had
walked for ſome time, and obſerved what
he had a mind to, Friend <hi>was free</hi> to ask us
if we would not drink a Glaſs of <hi>Wine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we returned to our Quarters, adding,
He was acquainted at a Tavern, where he
could Command the beſt in that Town.
We willingly accepted the Motion, and
went to the <hi>M</hi>—where the Claret and
Rheniſh were very good, but that which
pleaſed us moſt of all was another <hi>Friend</hi> of
our Fellow Travellers, whom he had ſent
for to make up a meſs; drinking went
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45028:47"/>
round very briskly, and the Diſcourſe was
agreeable to it; for <hi>Bacchus</hi> as ſoon warms
a <hi>Yea-and-Nay</hi> Man, as any other ſort of
Fleſh and Blood. The <hi>Old Man</hi> had taken
ſuch freedom amongſt <hi>Friends,</hi> that the
<hi>Young one</hi> began to be Rampant; there
was a Motion made by <hi>Friends</hi> to go to a
Houſe of <hi>Convenience,</hi> but we prevailed
with them to put off that, becauſe of the
Seaſon of the Night which was pretty late;
and doubting we might be Indiſpoſed for
the Mornings Travel, we had a hard tug
to over-power the Importunity of <hi>Friends</hi>
upon that account; they giving us all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
aſſurances that nothing could be
objected, either againſt the Youth and
Beauty of the <hi>Ladies, (for ſo in their Wine
they called them</hi>) nor the Accommodation
of the Houſe, which they affirmed to be
very gentile, and ſuch as could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
upon the Road: Beſides, Friend offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be at all the Expences of the Treat,
if we would accept of it. It coſt the other
half a dozen Bottles before the heat of this
Inclination could be Extinguiſhed; at
length it was reſolved that drinking a Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to each Females Health ſhould ſuffice
at that time. So (diſcharging the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning)
we endeavoured to find the way
Home to our Lodging, about Twelve at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45028:47"/>
Night. The Old Gentleman, and the Lady
I ſpoke of, were taking their repoſe
ſome hours before. All the way home to
our Lodging Friend gave us all the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of a moſt paſſionate reſpect, and
determined, when we came to <hi>London</hi> to
give a demonſtration of that Kindneſs he
had conceived for us, to which we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the acknowledgements the Seaſon
would permit, and we thought proper on
that occaſion, but could by no means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to go to our Lodging until every Man
had called for his Bottle in our Quarters;
ſo uneaſie did Friend appear to be, that
he muſt leave our Company that Night.
We were fain to promiſe him to ſpend as
much of our time with him as our Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
would permit, when we came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
and we reſolved to let no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſlip that might give us the trueſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>Friend</hi>'s Morals; for that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to be convinced, ſomewhat of
Fleſh and Blood might Inhabit under that
ſeemingly <hi>abſtemious</hi> and <hi>mortified</hi> Outſide,
and that much of the Goat lay lurking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Sheeps</hi> Skin; ſo that now there
wanted nothing but a fit Opportunity for
our new Friend to give a thorough Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Detection of his Morals; and
our ſeeming compliance with his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45028:48"/>
gave him occaſion to imagine that
our deſires were the ſame, and that we fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
thoſe <hi>looſe Paſſions</hi> with no leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
than himſelf; and that <hi>Bait</hi>
which (perhaps) was intended to betray
us into a diſcovery of our Reſentments,
gave him the greateſt provocation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his own, or elſe it might be purely the
violence of his Appetite that might hurry
him upon thoſe unwary Attempts, and
that in the preſence of Strangers; at leaſt
he muſt be ſuppoſed to much to credit
his own Opinion of our <hi>Complexions;</hi> not
regarding that no determination ought
to be made of any Man's <hi>Inſide</hi> by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of his exterior <hi>Mien</hi> and Figure,
whereof himſelf was a ſufficient Inſtance.
It is not to be forgot, that going to ſee the
Cathedral of the Dioceſs, which was in
that City; Friend (who was a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer
of <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) kept on his Hat in
deteſtation of the Idol Tombs and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and made many <hi>Sage</hi> and Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Remarks upon thoſe <hi>ſtinking</hi> Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
(as he thought fit to call them)
and entertained them with an Harangue on
that Occaſion, which I think not proper
in this place to omit.</p>
            <p>Friends <hi>(ſaid he</hi>) I would have ye to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that our Paganiſh Forefathers did little
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45028:48"/>
think of the ill Conſequences they ſhould bring
upon their Poſterity, by Erecting ſuch Places of
Worſhip; they were of <hi>one Mind</hi> when they
did it, and dream'd not of the Animoſity and
Contention that ſhould ariſe amongſt their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
Succeſſors, by reaſon of the <hi>Diſſentions</hi>
and <hi>Differences</hi> in <hi>Opinion</hi> that ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be fomented and carried on by the Prieſts
attending upon theſe Places. How many ſorts
of <hi>Opinions</hi> have been broached and <hi>vended</hi>
from yonder pratling <hi>Box,</hi> which ye call a
Pulpit, but it might very properly be called a
<hi>Pull-pit,</hi> becauſe, by the Doctrines taught in
many of them, People are <hi>pulled,</hi> halled and
dragged into the <hi>Pit;</hi> not only the horrid black
<hi>Pit</hi> in the other World, but into dark and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<hi>Pits</hi> and Holes even in this. Is it not
from the <hi>Cuſhion-ſmiters</hi> of that place that
Friends are Fulminated, Excommunicated,
Condemn'd and Delivered over to the <hi>Devil</hi> of
the other World to be kick'd and buffetted; and
to his <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> the Priſon Keepers of

their Vanities, as if they could not ſleep quiet in
their Graves, unleſs they were loaded with vaſt
Tombs, Statues, and Hatchments, enough to
load a mighty Ship; and the Expence of which

               </gap>he reſt of the

Colonies.</p>
            <p>I thought he would never have done
with his Enthuſiaſtick Reflections; but it
fell out, that juſt in the Nick one of our
Men came and gave us an account that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſtay'd for us at our Inn; to which we
then returned, not a little ſatisfied that we
were relieved from his unwelcome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks;
having not only declaimed againſt
the Decencies uſed by the Living, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his invidious Remarks on the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſacred to the Memories of the Dead.
However, it was ſome ſatisfaction to us,
to hear his Zeal vented in that ſort againſt
the Antick and unexcuſable Fopperies of
that kind of <hi>Pulpeteers,</hi> for which we could
not but acknowledge he was not without
ſome plauſible cauſe to ſhew his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Thoſe people having (by their
affected Tones and Poſtures) too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
expoſed their Profeſſion to Exception
of the more prudent ſort of Men. We
forgot not at Supper to give the Company
an account of Friends Expoſtulations; (but
in ſuch manner as was not diſtaſtful to
him) which was very acceptable to them,
and the Old Gentleman was much ſatisfied
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45028:50"/>
with the Railery that paſſed on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
of which his part ſeemed to us the
moſt ſweet and diverting. We paſſed the
reſt of the Evening in a Game or two at
Tables with the Old Gentleman, at which
he was very excellent; and this gave <hi>Friend</hi>
a freſh occaſion to exerciſe his Talent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that vain and idle ſort of Exerciſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but he was ſo <hi>civil,</hi> or ſo prudent (at leaſt)
as not to give us any diſturbance, but held
forth amongſt the Ladies, who were very
witty, and encouraged him to ſpeak his
utmoſt upon that Subject; which (they
aſſured us afterwards) was as pleaſant to
them as a Farce. This gave <hi>Friend</hi> ſome
inclination to think that he had crept a
little into the Converſation of the Ladies;
and by their ſeeming aſſent to what <hi>Friend</hi>
had alledged, he began to conclude with
himſelf that they were bringing over to
his Party, and that encouraged him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to them of ſeveral other matters;
ſome whereof ſavoured of very great and
particular kindneſs, which <hi>Friend</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
eſpecially for the Lady who was
of our Company; ſhe ſeemed not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
any diſlike at his Inſinuations,
which prompted him the more to purſue
and improve that Intereſt which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
he had gained; ſo that it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45028:51"/>
he went to bed not without having
ſome hopes kindled of attaining ſomewhat
that was never intended for him. After
our Game was ended, the Lady informed
her Couſin of all that had paſſed between
<hi>Friend</hi> and her, and with what ſeeming
Complyance ſhe had raiſed in him a belief
of arriving to what he might deſign. We
could not but conclude this would afford us
other matter to work upon; and that by
this means <hi>Friend</hi> might be prevailed with
to give us a further proſpect of his Morals
when he came to <hi>London;</hi> having reſolved
with our ſelves to uſe our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to underſtand after what manner he
Converſed in the City, and whether all his
deſigns were executed in the diſguiſe and
figure of a <hi>Yea-and-Nay-man.</hi> This ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to our wiſh; for after having paſſed
three days more upon the Road, (wherein
nothing material paſſed, but the encreaſing
a mutual Correſpondence, and ſome Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Treatments which <hi>Friend</hi> preſented
to the Lady (for he took all occaſions to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
any thing that looked as a kindneſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
on her) though he ſeemed very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive
of his reſpects to all the Company)
we arrived at our Inn in <hi>Biſhopsgate-ſtreet,</hi>

               </gap>
firſt Viſit; enquiring of us (but eſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
of the Lady) how we found our ſelves after
our Journey, and expreſſing great Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation
for our Health and ſafe Arrived;
he permitted us to prevail with him to
accept of a Dinner with us; and gave us
a ſolemn Invitation to requite that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by Dining with him the next day.
After Dinner he complyed to go to the
Tavern with us, where we warmed him
with ſome Bottles of Wine, which with
much freedom he accepted of, recounting
to us divers pleaſant paſſages relating to
himſelf; at length (taking a full Glaſs of
Wine in his hand) ſays he to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who was related to the Lady: <hi>Friend</hi>
Robert, <hi>It would be great peace to my Mind
if I might be related unto thee according to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45028:52"/>
the Fleſh; that is to ſay, if I might Marry
thy Kinſwoman; I do aſſure thee, that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as to our Opinions, ſhould never occaſion a
difference in Affection; and therefore if thee
pleaſeſt, thee may'ſt acquaint her that I have
drank a Glaſs of Wine, minding her Welfare.</hi>
At that word ſetting the Bumper to his
Noſe, he gave it ſo hearty a Toſs, that he
made every drop of the Wine inviſible;
and caſt back his Head ſo far to clear it,
that his Hat dropt off before the Glaſs was
taken from his Lips. Whoever hath heard
the Story of <hi>Let him Live,</hi> need be at no
loſs to comprehend the Myſtery of the Hat
falling off: It being a way of Complement
peculiar to <hi>Friends,</hi> when they <hi>mind the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi>
or, as the World hath it, drink the
Health of Men in Authority. We merrily
asked of <hi>Friend,</hi> whether that dropping off
of his Hat was not deſignedly permitted
by him, to let us ſee that he did not much
inſiſt upon the Ceremony of the Hat, if it
were agreeable to the Company? <hi>Friend</hi>
ingeniouſly acknowledged, that it was done
deſignedly, on purpoſe to teſtifie his reſpect
to Friend <hi>Robert</hi>'s Kinſwoman; and that
he could willingly, not only put off his Hat,
but perform any other Ceremonies to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
his kindneſs to her. This extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of ſhewing his reſpect to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45028:52"/>
obliged us to make our Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his kindneſs in the moſt ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terms that could be; he told us, that
before we left the Town, he doubted not
but to convince us, That there were ſome
amongſt the People of his Profeſſion, that
had as great an Eſteem for that which is
called Civility, as any ſort of People what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
We acknowledged, he had given us
all the reaſon in the world to believe it;
and that whoever had the happineſs to be
acquainted with him, could not miſs of an
undeniable demonſtration of it. <hi>We pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Health</hi> he had begun to the <hi>young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and were about to begin <hi>his;</hi> but he
would, by no means, ſuffer it at that time;
but alledged, the ſatisfaction he received by
our Excellent Company (as he was pleaſed
to term it) contributed more to his Health,
than all the Complements that could be
made uſe of: We returned, That we
thought he could not well condemn, or
ſpeak contemptfully of that whereof he
was ſo great a Maſter. And (having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him our repeated aſſurance of taking
a Dinner with him the next day) we Coach'd
it home to our ſeveral Lodgings; giving
the Lady an account, with what Obliging
<hi>Ceremony</hi> her Yea-and-Nay Servant had
<hi>drank her Health;</hi> and how full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45028:53"/>
and reſpect every thing was that he
ſpake concerning her: We likewiſe told
her, that ſhe was, in all probability, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſome brisk Attacque the next day, for
that we foreſaw <hi>Friend</hi> would not fail to
Charge her with all the Artillery of a great
Entertainment; departing ſo far in his way
of Converſe, from that <hi>ſullen, ſtubborn hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi>
that ſhews it ſelf amongſt Men of his
Profeſſion; that in ſoftneſs and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
of temper, he ſeemed to exceed the
moſt refined Courtier, and Gallant of the
Town.</p>
            <p>We again reſolved not to omit any thing
that might further our <hi>diſcoveries</hi> of the
Man's <hi>Morals,</hi> and doubted not but every
day would contribute more to our <hi>purpoſe;</hi>
and we doubted not but the next day we
might go a conſiderable <hi>length</hi> in our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi>
We determined to play all one Game,
(that is) of giving our ſelves up to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
for that day, the better to obſerve
whereto his Inclinations would prompt
him; only the young Lady had a deſign
to banter him with a trick, which ſhe
would by no means diſcover to us, till ſhe
came to put it in execution. But that I
may be the more exact in my Relation, I
think it proper in this place to let you
know in what Figure <hi>Friend</hi> preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45028:53"/>
to his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> or <hi>She-Friend</hi> the firſt

came in a Coach to the door, and having
made enquiry, and underſtood that we
were within, he entered the Houſe, my
Friend and ſelf conducting of him into a

Serge, of an indifferent, ſad Colour, lined
through with a rich Venetian Tabbee, as
near the colour as poſſible; his Cravat was
made up of the true ſtamp, with a little puff
before; his Shirt ſhewed very little at the

ſmiling, with an Aſpect that ſpake
<hi>Venus</hi> to have been his <hi>Aſcendant.</hi> This
was the form that Friends <hi>outward Man</hi>
ſhewed it ſelf in unto us the Firſt day, which
argued him to be a lover of his <hi>walking Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;</hi>
at his going away from the Houſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45028:54"/>
he was very liberal to the young Ladies
Maid, and forgot not the Cook.</p>
            <p>It remains now that I give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our <hi>Viſionary</hi> Entertainment at
<hi>Friend</hi>'s Lodging, which (no doubt) by
this time you are agog to hear; why then
it was after this manner. His Lodgings
were at a conſiderable Tradeſman's houſe
in <hi>N—ſtreet,</hi> who (though he was of the
ſame Profeſſion with <hi>Friend,</hi> yet) had a
very great Opinion of <hi>Friend</hi>'s perſwaſion)
and <hi>diſliked not ſo much of Friend's Diſpoſition</hi>
and <hi>Converſation,</hi> as <hi>Friend thought fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to him.</hi> At this place <hi>Friend</hi> received
us with demonſtration of a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and had obtained the Gentleman's
Lady of the Houſe, and a <hi>Friend</hi>'s Wife
(about <hi>Fanchurch ſtreet</hi>) who was a pretty
Woman, to bear our She-<hi>Friend</hi> Company.
We were Conducted into a Parlour very
well Wainſcotted, and a good Marble
Chimney-piece; after ſome little time the
Women came in and Complemented the
ſtrange Lady, with great Civility. You
could diſcern no difference in the Habit of
the <hi>Yea-and-Nay-Woman</hi> from the reſt, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that ſhe wore no Lace, nor Top-knot;
ſhe had on Manteau and Petticoats of as rich
Flower'd Silks as could be worn; a white
Gawfe Hood, ſet on ſomewhat looſe upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45028:54"/>
her own flaxen Hair, and good Face, which
needed no hidings, nor ſet-offs; a black
Hood tied ſomewhat looſe upon that; a
very white Hand, and a cheerful Air;
which were very advantageous Indications,
and of no ſmall force to gain upon the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of thoſe that Converſed with their
Owner. I made no particular Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any other perſon in the Company,
the reſt being of that ſort of people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom I ſpent my daily Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and for that cauſe nothing of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appeared worthy remarking amongſt
them: Beſides, it was our particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to detect what we could of <hi>Friends</hi>
way, and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> as it is the purport
of this Book to ſet before <hi>Friends (and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
too</hi>) a Glaſs, wherein they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
their <hi>own Complexions.</hi> But this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
muſt not hinder me from going on
with my account of our Entertainment at
<hi>Friend</hi>'s Lodgings: which now I re-aſſume;
A Barrel of Oyſters, and ſome Bottles of
Old Hock were ſet upon the Table, which
ſoon ſet the Men on work, who began their
<hi>Forcible Entries, Plundering</hi> the Fiſh out of
their <hi>Rockie Encloſures,</hi> and <hi>Epicurizing</hi> on
the Spoils: The Ladies were not forgot,
but were preſented by the Men with the
greeneſt, and the fatteſt they could find;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45028:55"/>
               <hi>Friend</hi> taking care to furniſh his <hi>new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi>
with the choiceſt he could <hi>cull</hi> from
amongſt them. Scarce had we made our
Conqueſts over the <hi>Colcheſterians,</hi> but we
were taken into a ſtately Dining-room ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well gilded, and wanted nothing of
Furniture that might ſpeak it Noble. The
Side-Tables groaned under their Load of
maſſy Plate, and rich Glaſſes; The Ciſterns
were heaped with Bottles of the choiceſt
Wine; and every thing that preſented,
ſpake the Oppulence of the Houſe, and the
generous Temper of the Maſter of the Feaſt.
The Table was covered with Diſhes of the
principal Rarities that Seaſon of the Year
produced; I am very loth to name them,
leſt it ſhould raiſe in ſome an <hi>Appetite,</hi> or
deſire to be at a <hi>Yea-and-Nay Feaſt;</hi> but
this I aſſure you, my Lord Mayor's Cook
never ſent Diſhes to his Table more Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
<hi>Ragouſted,</hi> garniſhed, or ſet off. You
may be ſure there wanted not a <hi>Quaking-Pudding,</hi>
dreſs'd in all his Formalities of
blanched Almonds, and ſteep'd in all the
rich Sweets of the Indies: And as every
Diſh was dreſs'd to the beſt advantage,
ſo the number no leſs diſcover'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
Bounty of the Maſter, for there were
three times more Diſhes than Gueſts; So
that I could not for bear thinking of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45028:55"/>
City of <hi>Mindas,</hi> where the Gates were ſaid
to be bigger than the Town. In the mean
time <hi>Friend</hi> was over Head and Ears in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
Carving to the Women, of every
Diſh, and loading his ſuppoſed <hi>Friend</hi> with
ſo many Plates, as if ſhe had been to eat
for all the reſt of the people at the Table:
Nor was ſhe more plied with Plates, than
with the ſweet Invitations of, <hi>Prithee eat if
thee canſt; I would fain have thee to help thy
ſelf where thee beſt likeſt; Prithee be as free as
if thee wert at home; for any thing that is here
is freely thine;</hi> with ſuch abundance more
of ſuch ſweetning Sawce, that the poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
ſtomach was cloyed with the ſight of
ſuch heaps of Delicates. It coſt us at leaſt
two hours at Table before we were freed
from the Attacks of freſh Diſhes, and a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
which concluded the Dinner. Very
little paſſed at Table, only general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes;
but I muſt not omit that before
all was taken away, <hi>Friend,</hi> whiſper'd me,
<hi>that it would be improper to drink any Healths
at that Table, for he would not for any Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the Maſter of the Houſe ſhould ever
underſtand that he had complyed with any thing
of that kind.</hi> This throughly convinced me
that <hi>Friend</hi> ſeemed to be one thing to one
ſort of people, and another to others; and
that there muſt be ſomething of the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:45028:56"/>
lurk under that reſervation. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that <hi>Healthing</hi> was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there was a great deal of Wine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
at Dinner; for the Glaſſes (and
thoſe not of the ſmalleſt ſize) were always
kept in motion with, <hi>Thee haſt not taſted of
ſuch or ſuch a ſort of Wine yet; why doſt thee
not call for that ſort thee likeſt beſt? I would
have thee drink as freely as if thee wert at home.</hi>
And ſtill when theſe <hi>Greetings</hi> came about,
you were ſure to have a Bumper put into
your hand; that by that time we came to
riſe from the Table, ſome of us had got
red-coated Faces, and looked as if we had
been at a meeting of <hi>Goſſips</hi> at a <hi>hot Soop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
To carry off the Fumes of which,
<hi>Friend</hi> takes us into his Lodging-room, and
their treats us with a Bottle of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſquebaugh</hi>
to help the digeſtive faculty. He there
ſhew'd us divers pretty Rarities which he
had in a little Cabinet, and offered to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
our <hi>She-Friend</hi> with a Gold <hi>Snuffbox,</hi>
which ſhe would by no means accept of,
alledging the Entertainment ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there had been ſuch as ſhe had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to take <hi>ſnuff at,</hi> which <hi>Friend</hi> admitted
for an Excuſe; however <hi>Friend</hi> was ſeized
with ſomething of a <hi>Qualm,</hi> which made
him turn up the <hi>Whites of his Eyes,</hi> and
make a ſtronger Impreſſion upon <hi>She-friends</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:45028:56"/>
Hand, which he <hi>graſp'd</hi> with a more than
ordinary vehemence, and was about to
<hi>whiſper</hi> ſomewhat to her by the <hi>ſide of the
Bed;</hi> but had no more power to ſpeak,
than if he had been at a <hi>ſilent Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>—Virtue forſooth,</l>
               <l>And Modeſty ſo ſtop't his Mouth.</l>
            </q>
            <p>At length a little recollecting himſelf,
he began to apprehend, that this ſort of
<hi>Trance</hi> might have betray'd ſomething
more than was fitting at that time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he endeavour'd to excuſe himſelf, <hi>That
ſome ſudden Vapour had ſurprized his Spirits,
and that he was ſubject ſometimes to Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack
Fits:</hi> This paſs'd well enough with
ſome that knew nothing of the cauſe; but
the truth is, <hi>he wiſh't all but one out of the
room.</hi> The young Lady feigned a great
ſorrow for him, but hoped the indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would not be of continuance, but that
he would be in condition to receive her
Thanks for that days generous Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Friend</hi> was under ſome difficulty to
make returns ſuitable to the Complements
put upon him; but (whiſpering the Lady)
he told her, <hi>That he muſt owe the Cure of the
diſtemper he lay under to her Goodneſs, as it
had been cauſed by her Beauty.</hi> The Lady
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45028:57"/>
knew not how to acquit her ſelf of this,
without a Bluſh; but returned, <hi>She was
not Conſcious of any diſeaſe which ſhe had,
that might ſpread its Malignity, and be the
occaſion of a diſtemper on any one, but for the
Cauſe he had aſſigned:</hi> She deſired not to be
numbered amongſt thoſe that were called
the <hi>Killing Beauties;</hi> and that ſhe fanſied
thoſe were rhetorical Flouriſhes that he had
gathered out of a Book call'd the <hi>Academy of
Complements,</hi> where it was uſual to bring in
the Men <hi>bleeding, fainting,</hi> or <hi>dying,</hi> under
the <hi>Wounds</hi> their <hi>Cruel</hi> Miſtreſſes had given
them; as if our tender, ſimple Sex (ſaid
ſhe) carried Darts in our Eyes, or ſome
ſecret Venom about us that kill'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
people at a diſtance. For my ſhare,
I cannot apprehend the meaning of ſuch
Imputations; and (unleſs you inform me)
ſhall be at a loſs to underſtand the intent
of them.</p>
            <p>This Railery put <hi>Friend</hi> out of heart to
purſue his deſign that way; but (fetching
a deep ſigh) ſaid to her, <hi>I may take ſome
convenient time to ſatisfie thee as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
and ſo the Diſcourſe and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ended at that time, my Friends Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
having been diſappointed of the
deſigned Trick ſhe had merrily intended
to put upon him. We took our leaves,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45028:57"/>
but <hi>Friend</hi> would by no means part with us
until he had obtained a promiſe of my
Kinſman and ſelf to meet him at Eight
that night at an appointed Tavern; ſo
having fixed upon the Number, we parted
very well ſatisfied that our next Meeting
would give us ſome clearer Detection of
<hi>Friend</hi>'s Temper and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The hour being come, we repaired to
the Tavern, where we found the Number
at the Bar, and were Conducted into the
Room where <hi>Friend</hi> was juſt come before
us; having in his Company two perſons
that ſeemed to be Gentlemen, one of them
about Twenty years of Age, the other ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſomewhat leſs; they were both in Garbs
very gentiel, and handſome; and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
we were not much out in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
concerning them, for one of them
was of one of the Inns of Court, the other
Lodged about <hi>Pall-mall,</hi> and much inclined
to the practice of Muſick, in which he had
acquired a conſiderable Excellence. <hi>Friend</hi>
made ſomewhat of an Excuſe for having
taken Strangers into his Company, having
before made us an Aſſignation; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
told us, they were Gentlemen of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
whom he met juſt in the Street
as he was coming into the Tavern. We
gave him the aſſurance, That any that had
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45028:58"/>
the Honour to be of his Acquaintance could
not fail of being very welcome to us, and
that we ought to acknowledge it as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
favour, that he did us the kindneſs
to admit us into the acquaintance of his
Friends. We then took half a dozen Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
round, and <hi>Friend</hi> could not forbear
putting the Younger of the two Gentlemen
upon a Song, particularly one above the
reſt, which <hi>Friend</hi> ſaid he much admired,
for one of the wittieſt Pieces of Poetry
which he had ever heard. The young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
in complyance with <hi>Friend</hi>'s deſire,
ſung the enſuing Song, which I think may
be found in <hi>A. Brome</hi>'s Poems.</p>

The Song ended, <hi>Friend</hi> ask'd our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of it; we could not but acknowledge
the Words to be very witty, and that the
Gentleman had expreſſed very much Art in
Singing it; but withal, we could not but
conclude within our ſelves, that <hi>Friend</hi> was
certainly in his Amorous Moods and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and that the time was come that he
could no longer ſuppreſs his Inclinations;
but it was pleaſant to obſerve in what ſort
of Forth they diſcovered themſelves, for
'twas not one Song, nor ten, that ſatisfied
the Importunity of <hi>Friend</hi>'s deſires, though
the young Gentleman eaſily complyed with
whatſoever he asked in that kind, and not
one of the Songs but was well Liquor'd,
or elſe ſome of them were groſs enough to
have riſen upon the ſtomach of a Bawd.
But the fatter they were, the better they
ſlipt down; till at length <hi>Friend</hi> was for
putting round, not only a Glaſs, but a Kiſs
in memory of his Coy <hi>Friend</hi> (as he called
her) ſo that <hi>Love</hi> was now become ſo <hi>blind,</hi>
it could hardly diſtinguiſh Sexes. By this
it appeared to us, that <hi>Friend</hi> had much of
the Neopolitan in his Veins: And that as it
is ſaid of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that another Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
ſaw his Pride look through the Raggs
of his Garment; So might it be ſaid of
<hi>Friend</hi>'s Levity, that it ſhewed it ſelf
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45028:59"/>
through the formal Cover, and diſguiſe of
his grave and ſelf-denying Habit.</p>
            <p>Nor may it be improper in this place to
recollect a little how in Cluſters the Vanity
of weak and unmortified Tempers ſhew
themſelves; for <hi>Friend</hi> was not content to
expoſe the <hi>folly</hi> of his Inclinations on the
one hand, but he muſt be diſcovering the
<hi>pride</hi> of his Mind on the other hand, being
not able to contain the Oſtentation of that
ſplendid Treat, which but that day he had
entertain'd us withal; but muſt divulge to
the two young Gentlemen the Extravagance
of his Banquet, until they ſeemed to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with his unwelcome Repetitions. So
much doth an <hi>oſtentatious Affectation,</hi> and an
uncurbed Paſſion <hi>diveſt</hi> a Man of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
which a <hi>reſerved</hi> and <hi>tenacious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
ſtill <hi>maintains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Friend</hi> wholly for making a
Night on't, and giving the <hi>Body-natural</hi> a
little <hi>relaxation;</hi> we were for complying
with the humour, and the two young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
diſcovered no Inclination to refuſe
joining in the deſign. More Wine was
called for, a piece of Sturgeon, and ſome
Anchovies, which delicately helped on the
Ferment: So about one of the Clock in the
Morning a Coach took us up at the door,
and (we being all at <hi>Friend</hi>'s diſpoſal) rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45028:60"/>
through the Watches, until we alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not far from <hi>K—bridge,</hi> where we were
received into a very fine Houſe, the Rooms
modiſhly furniſhed, and ſhining with many
Lights, every thing appeared very gay,
and <hi>Friend</hi> told us the <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> (for
<hi>now he was able to ſpeak that Language</hi>) was
a remote Kinſwoman of his, That ſhe was
a <hi>brisk</hi> Woman, and had ſeveral pretty
Neices, that would be very good Company
for us. The Bottle of Orange-water was
produced, and the Servants were as buſie
as if it had been Noon-day; two Spits of
Fowl were ſet to the Fire, and (after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time)
there dropt into the Room five young
Damoſels, which paſſed for the Couſins;
they were all very formally ſaluted, and
took their places with us round the Table,
divers Songs kept us awake until Supper,
or rather Breakfaſt, was brought in (for
theſe ſort of Animals can cram and devour
at all hours) and amongſt the reſt a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
Dialogue was excellently Sung in
parts by the young Gentleman before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and one of the new She-Couſins;
who acquitted her ſelf admirably well in
the performance of it; which moved
Friend's <hi>outward Man</hi> to take acquaintance
with her Cheek and Breaſts, which after
ſerved him inſtead of a Guittar to play
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45028:60"/>
his part on. The Fowl was brought in,

a Health to the beſt Woman in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
which went round, and <hi>Friend</hi>
took it very <hi>Devoutly;</hi> ſo that Ceremony
being over, we were Conducted to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſeveral Lodging-rooms, the Damoſels
(being of courteous Function) bringing
Caps and Neck-cloaths into the Chamber,
and asking whether we would not have a
Dram of <hi>Roſa-ſolis,</hi> or Orange-water, or
<hi>any thing elſe</hi> to compoſe us to ſleep; my
Friend and ſelf deſired to be in one Bed,
pretending an Infirmity, which is often the

upon me. Sometimes I conſidered in what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igure <hi>Friend</hi> would appear to <hi>himſelf</hi> when
he began to <hi>recollect</hi> in the Morning; and
then I apprehended that <hi>we</hi> might preſent
much after the ſame form, having comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(for ought he might know) in all the
parts of the <hi>Extravagance.</hi> Again, what
account could he imagine we ſhould give
of him to the young Lady; unleſs he might
ſuppoſe her to be of the humour that (ſome
ſay) the <hi>Scots</hi> Women are of? Not to
have any value for a Man, unleſs he hath
<hi>ſet up the credit of his Abilities,</hi> by having had
<hi>two</hi> or <hi>three before-hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe (I ſay) and many more were the
Conſiderations which took up my thoughts,
but I perceived <hi>Friend</hi> had no ſuch Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to diſturb him; having (it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
concluded within himſelf, that <hi>all
Mankind were alike;</hi> and though they wore
different Habits, and were of different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
in other matters, yet all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
agreed to proſecute their <hi>Beſtial
Inclinations,</hi> and give themſelves up to
their <hi>Senſual Appetites.</hi> And I am the more
apt to believe this Opinion might much
prevail with him, for a reaſon that you
will find in the next Chapter, when we
come to ſpeak of his Aſſociates: Beſides,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45028:61"/>
that as ſoon as we were got up, he came
very briskly into our Room, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, how we had liked our <hi>Lodging,</hi>
and our <hi>Company;</hi> we anſwered him, that
<hi>both</hi> were very <hi>agreeable,</hi> becauſe <hi>both</hi> were
very <hi>pleaſant;</hi> at which he embrac'd us,
and buſs'd our Cheeks; by which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<hi>the Damſels had not given him notice
that we had had none of their Company;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
they kept that Secret to themſelves,
leſt the others ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, and they might be <hi>derided,</hi> and
expoſed for having been ſo ſlighted by their
ſuppoſed Gallants. A great deal of Chocolet
was conſumed as ſoon as we were dreſt, and
we uſed our endeavours to get <hi>Friend</hi> home
into the City with us; but he could by no
means part with his Aunt and Couſins be-Dinner;
we were not permitted to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
of any thing that was to pay, but
were told it would look ill if we queſtion'd
it: No doubt <hi>Friend</hi> ſufficiently gratified
his Aunt for the Entertainment; and we
gave ſomewhat to the Servants, took our
Leaves, having with much conteſting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that Point; (only our <hi>Change-buſineſs</hi>
would not permit us to ſtay) ſo we got to
the Water ſide, and came by Boat to the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
Stairs, leaving the <hi>Yea and-Nay Cully</hi> with
his Friends, to the further Management of
the Aunt and Nieces.</p>

that yeſterday (which was the day) of
<hi>Friend</hi>'s Treating his ſuppoſed She-friend,
he appeared in a fine, light, Broad-cloth
Suit, lined with Sattin of the ſame colour;
and the brims of his Beaver were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
larger than the day before; this was
the Garb he came to the <hi>Houſe of Pleaſure</hi>
in; but the Morning (before we parted)
he came into our Room in a Peach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> colour'd
Sattin Gown, Flower'd with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
having Cap and Slippers ſuitable; in
this Dreſs very Amiable, and whether it
might be his own, kept at that Houſe for
his wearing when he came to take the Air,
or whether <hi>Aunt</hi> kept ſuch Perquiſites for
the accommodating perſons of his Quality,
I cannot determine: This I am ſatisfied in,
that <hi>Friend</hi> conſidered himſelf as much in
that Garb, as a Peacock doth when he
erects his Plumes.</p>
            <p>We ſaw <hi>Friend</hi> no more until two or
three days after, accidentally meeting him
upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> we found him upon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45028:62"/>
the Eaſt-country Walk, with divers grave
Merchants, ſome whereof were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by their little Neck-cloths. <hi>Friend</hi>
was now become a Yea-and-Nay Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and (giving us the <hi>formal Bow, the
fleering Smile, with the Hand a little extended
out of the Cloak, to give us the</hi> Friendly <hi>gripe)
we were ſaluted with a How is it with thee</hi>
Robert? <hi>how is it with thee</hi> Thomas? <hi>I
would willingly drink a Diſh of Coffee with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
at the</hi> A. <hi>Coffee-houſe;</hi> to which we repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
He might find us there in a quarter of
an hour. We obſerved two or three <hi>Friends</hi>
came in with him, and preſſed him very
earneſtly to diſpoſe of two or three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pound for them in his Country Goods;
he ſeemed not much inclined to it, until
ſeemingly conquer'd by over-perſwaſion,
we heard him expreſs himſelf to them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner: <hi>If I am not miſtaken in my
own Heart (with Eyes lifted up) I can freely
ſay that I am willing to do my utmoſt for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> Friend's <hi>Intereſt, but ye very well know
what pains I take to manage my own little buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
my Returns have been but ſmall this
Year; and we are under ſuch diſcouragements,
that unleſs</hi> Friends <hi>be Aſſiſting to one another,
the Wicked will carry away all Trade ſheer from
us: Now I ſay, if ye deſire me to lay out ſuch
a Summe for ye to the beſt advantage, it is fit
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45028:63"/>
we come to a determination of a certain Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
by way of Poundage, or otherwiſe; and
that ye remit me ſuch Summes as I ſee occaſion
from time to time to draw upon ye; but we will
leave the further diſcourſe of this matter until
to morrow after Change, for I am willing now
to ſpeak a little to thoſe two Young men, that
came up the Country with me.</hi> So (after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal
Noddings) he dropt them, and
whiſper'd us, That that place would not
be convenient for us to diſcourſe in; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we had not Dined, it would not be
amiſs to go to the <hi>D</hi>—Ordnary, and
there we might have the opportunity of
enjoying our ſelves, without being <hi>ſupervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
We approved of the advice, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(if poſſible) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound <hi>Friend</hi> to the
bottom (having already gone ſo far) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a ſtrict Compliance with his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as we had hitherto done. We had a
Gooſe, and a diſh of Minc'd Pyes for Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which it may be <hi>Friend</hi> might have
<hi>Demurr'd</hi> to in other Company; but (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us) it was concluded all things
ſhould be in Common. <hi>Friend</hi> told us that
he had been prevailed with to tarry at
<hi>Aunt</hi>'s all the following Night, and that
his two Friends had continued with him:
That theſe Frolicks were ſomewhat <hi>charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
but that he ſeldom uſed them, unleſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45028:63"/>
(at times) for his Health's ſake; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the thing was not much to be valued
by him, being in a way of Trade, that <hi>(if
he had Vanity enough</hi>) he might very well
keep his Coach and Dogs. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
that he had laid an Obligation upon
us, which from another hand would have
look't like an affront, in taking upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the whole charge at the Country-houſe,
and that we thought it not proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it there; but were reſolved, unleſs he
would permit us to re-imburſe him, and to
be upon equal terms for the future; we
would even offer that Violence to our ſelves,
as never more to come into his Company.
He would by no means admit a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y thing of
a retribution, but conſented to an equality
for the future; and upon thoſe Terms a
Truce was made.</p>
            <p>Then he enquired of the young Lady, and
hoped we had not ſo far betrayed that
Confidence which he had repoſed in us, as
to ſpeak any thing to his diſadvantage
there; for that he hoped he was not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in our humors; for that we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appeared to him to be under the ſame
circumſtances of Fleſh and Blood with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>I diverted this diſcourſe by drinking a
Glaſs to the Aunts and Nieces Healths at the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45028:64"/>
Country-houſe, which very well confirmed
<hi>Friend</hi> in his Opinion of us. A great deal
more Chat paſſed about our Diverſion at
yond place, of which <hi>Friend</hi> expreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very <hi>Feelingly,</hi> and (being preſſed) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
he thought he might have been a
little <hi>too vigorous,</hi> but that in ſuch caſes he
never tied himſelf up to <hi>abſtinence,</hi> but
always applied himſelf to a doſe of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pills, which never failed him; and
offered each of us a <hi>Box,</hi> againſt ſuch time
as we might have occaſion. We returned
him our Thanks, and aſſur'd him we would
ſend for them when that preſented.</p>
            <p>After this (having paſſed the Bumpers
about, and <hi>Friend</hi> returned our Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by taking ſo many Glaſſes to ours)
he frankl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y told us, That he was very glad
we had met him that day, for we had
thereby put an opportunity into his hands
of inviting us into the <hi>merrieſt,</hi> and beſt
Company that the Town afforded; where
were ſuch <hi>variety of humours,</hi> and all joined
in ſuch a <hi>Harmony,</hi> as could not be match't
again: And therefore deſired us to meet
him not far from <hi>Salisbury-Court,</hi> at an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
place, betwixt the hours of Eight
and Nine, <hi>Number</hi> 43. This fell out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our wiſh, and we needed not be
asked twice for our Compliance in that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45028:64"/>
caſe. So that we had nothing to do but
to promiſe not to fail at the Time and
Place. So we drank about to the Healths
of the Excellent Company we were to
meet that Night; and having given our
hands to be punctual, we went home to put
our ſelves in order for that purpoſe; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
each of us a Glaſs of <hi>Water</hi> to ſuppreſs
the fumes of the <hi>Wine</hi> from diſturbing our
Heads. We acquainted the young Lady
with the deſign, who made us <hi>promiſe to
Print</hi> Friend's <hi>Hiſtory in a Book; which is
anſwered by this Viſion;</hi> in the Evening we
repaired to the Aſſignation. We made ſo
much haſte to the place appointed, that
we prevented the Company; and finding
no Number left at the Bar, we retired to
a Coffee-houſe for half an hour, and then
found <hi>Friend</hi> and a great many of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
arrived by that time, many more
drop't in, in a ſhort time after. It ſeemed
to me to be the greateſt Medley of people
that I had ever ſeen; for there were
<hi>French, Scots, Iriſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
as many Sects as <hi>Amſterdam</hi> affords: Some
ſeemed to be Gentlemen, ſome Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſome Merchants-men, others Mechanicks;
ſome came to Expoſe themſelves, others to
make their Advantages, and Obſervations
thereupon: Yet all agreed to make it a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45028:65"/>
               <hi>Merry-meeting,</hi> as they call'd it; there
were divers that by their Habits diſcover'd
themſelves to be of the <hi>Wet ſort</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi>
who had put on a brisk gayety of humour,
and appeared to be no more like the ſame
ſort of people they uſed to look like at <hi>Bull-and-Mouth,</hi>
than an <hi>Apple is like an Oyſter.</hi>
There was amongſt the reſt a Sullen-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion'd
Blade of a Glover, who (it ſeems)
had been a Holder-forth at Conventicles;
and this Spark was a great Stickler againſt
Church-diſcipline; but I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that either <hi>Friend,</hi> or any of the <hi>Yea-and-Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
People gave him any incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to promote his diſcourſe; but he was
quickly taken off by a ſmart Gentleman in
a red Coat, who ſo <hi>all-to-be-baffled</hi> him,
that he was condemn'd to ſilence during
the reſt of the time. In fine, this ſeemed
to make out the <hi>Harmony</hi> which <hi>Friend</hi>
was ſpeaking of, that ſo many people of
ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ivers Figures, and diſtant Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhould agree to come together, as (it
ſeems they often did at that place) on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to Fuddle, and <hi>blow up one another</hi> with
repeated Bumpers: Some were for talking
of publick News, others gave no Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it; ſome for Twoodling on their
Recorders, others for a Snap of a Song;
but ſtill the Glaſſes maintain'd a nimble
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45028:65"/>
motion; until (by general conſent) a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
of Voices was agreed upon to be very
ſeaſonable; which ſome of the Company
performed very well; amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Singing that which follows, with
four Parts.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Would you know how we meet o'er our Jolly
brisk Bowls,</l>
               <l>As we mingle our Liquors, we mingle our
Souls.</l>
               <l>The ſweet meets the ſharp, and the kind-ſoft,
the ſtrong,</l>
               <l>And nothing but Friendſhip grows all the
Night long:</l>
               <l>We Drink, Laugh, and Celebrate ev'ry deſire,</l>
               <l>Love only remains the unquenchable Fire.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Songs gave the whole Company great
ſatisfaction, after which ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
play'd two or three Conſorts on their
Haught-boys and Recorders: This Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I could not but eſteem very laudable
and gentile, and ſhould not have thought
my time miſ-ſpent in frequent Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of that kind. But now the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iery Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began to make many of their Brains
whirl; ſome then began to diſcourſe of
their Hectoring Pranks and Debauches, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Tricks they had play'd in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe;
ſome complain'd they could
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45028:66"/>
not make up their Maſter's Caſh, others
of Suretyſhips they had been enſnar'd in;
ſome again boaſting how often they had
paſs'd the Diſcipline for the <hi>French</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
others dreaded the need they were
in of entring into the ſame Courſe. The
noiſe was ſo great, that there began to be
an Univerſal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lamour from all parts of the
Room, which reſounded with nothing but
Oaths, Blaſphemies, Cheats, and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
enough to have deafned <hi>Newgate</hi>
it ſelf. And yet moſt of thoſe people (when
abroad) paſs'd for quite another ſort of
Animals then what they then appear'd to
be; Such a <hi>Mockage is there in the Exceſs
of Wine!</hi> This indeed gave a full diſcovery
of the lewd Revels that <hi>Friend</hi> was a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter
of: Now the Room was become
the perfect Emblem of a divided State, for
the whole Company were divided into lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Cabals, three or four in a place, and
as many Glaſſes as there were People, and
the Bumpers were conſtantly driven about
till the World began to Circulate: But
this I will ſay for <hi>Friends,</hi> They never bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
at their Wine, nor ſcrupled the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Hats; but moſt of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
were calm, touching Female Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or ſo. Amidſt all this clamour, one
of the Company makes up to <hi>Friend,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45028:66"/>
ſatisfaction of him, for carrying
him to a certain Houſe, where he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome damage in his <hi>Perquiſites,</hi> and
that the Cure had coſt him ten Guineas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
danger of Relapſes: this he inſiſted
upon with great noiſe and <hi>Menaces:</hi> Friend
meekly replied (ſmiling in his Face) <hi>Thee
might'ſt have ſtay'd at home, if thee had'ſt not
been free to have gone with me; and if thee
would'ſt make uſe of any thing that was to thy
prejudice, what is that to me? If thee findeſt
thy ſelf grieved in my company, thee may'ſt
keep out of it.</hi> But this was ſo far from
allaying the Gentleman's Paſſion, that he
was the more enraged, and ſwore bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if <hi>Friend</hi> did not promiſe him, before
the Company, to give him ſatisfaction the
next Morning, that he would immediately
run him through. My Kinſman, and Self,
interceded on behalf of <hi>Friend,</hi> but were
like to be ſet upon by four or five for our
pains; one of them (who appeared to be
the younger of the two that were with
him at <hi>Aunt</hi>'s) giving <hi>Friend</hi> a whole Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of filthy Names, and ſwearing by no
mean Devotions, he demanded ſatisfaction
of him, for giving him the <hi>Italian hug,</hi> as
they were one night in bed together:
Theſe matters were ſo plainly made out
by many of the Company; that there was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45028:67"/>
no good to be done by interpoſing, only
we urged the time of the Night, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Watches, (which I am apt to
think, ſome of that Company dreaded,
as much as a Jilt does a Beadle, or a Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock.)
This ſomewhat allay'd the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult;
and a further Debate of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
was put off until the next Meeting,
which <hi>Friend</hi> promiſed them ſhould be the
<hi>next day.</hi> Then an amicable Glaſs or two
paſſed about; and (a Reckoning being
called) my Kinſman and Self threw down
our Quota's, which was about Five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
a-piece, and excuſing our ſelves, that
we were Strangers, and had far to our
Lodgings; we took leave of the Company,
leaving <hi>Friend</hi> to pay for moſt of them, as
no doubt he did.</p>
            <p>When we came home, we gave the Lady
an account in what Company we had left
<hi>Friend,</hi> and how he had been Inſulted over
by divers of them, which made her hold
her Sides for Laughter: At length, ſaid ſhe,
Couſin, what ſhall I do for a <hi>Friend?</hi> for
now I plainly ſee my ſpruce <hi>Yea-and-Nay-Man</hi>
hath deſerted me, and is taken up
with Jilts and Boys; and in ſhort time I
fear he may fall in Love with a <hi>Fille,</hi> as
poor Friend <hi>Green</hi> at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> did.</p>
            <p>But for my ſhare, I could not but have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45028:67"/>
compaſſionate thoughts for him, and was
with great tenderneſs affected to ſee a
young Man with ſuch a ſeeming, plauſible
out-ſide, and one that was Courted with
all the advantages of Fortune, ſo miſerably
led Captive by his inſatiate and unruly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites:
I was no leſs aſtoniſhed (amongſt
that mix'd Company) to ſee <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of
almoſt all kinds <hi>Wallowing</hi> and <hi>Kennelling</hi>
in the ſwiniſh Debaucheries of a wanton
and degenerate Age. <hi>What's that Religion
that doth not reclaim Men from ſuch Inhumane
Beſtialities?</hi> But amidſt my Moralities, I
was whiſper'd in the Ear, <hi>That no Man yet
ever ſet fire to a Field of Corn, becauſe there
were ſome Tares in it:</hi> And that doubtleſs
there were ſome <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the beſt ſort of <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> or elſe
the <hi>World</hi> would be better ſtock'd with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi>
and <hi>Charity,</hi> than upon the ſtricteſt
enquiry it appears to be.</p>
            <p>That theſe were a ſort of Agents, and
Factors that would ſtill be kept on foot by
the Prince of the <hi>Lower World,</hi> as long as
he hath any thing to do in <hi>this.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>(ſince ſuch were abroad</hi>) they ought
with the more caution and diligence to be
reſiſted.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch-like Conſiderations not
only took me off from my wonted Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45028:68"/>
before I went to bed, but from my
ſleep after, until towards the Morning, and
then my very Dreams were compoſed of
ſuch reflections: Oh! the horrid diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of an unhappy Converſation; it
not only entraps a Man in the inextricable
Snares of <hi>Debauchery</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
and detects the miſerable Captive to
the reproach and contempt of the reſt of
Men.</p>
            <p>Wretched ſtate of <hi>Ductile</hi> Youth! al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
inclinable, and always open to the
Attacques of every violent Temptation;
forgetful of their Guard, and inconſiderate
of their Company. Happy they that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
in a <hi>lovely Solitude,</hi> with Groves and
Streams free from the diſadvantages of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Converſation,</hi> which beguiles and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
the unwary upon thoſe unavoidable
Precipices. And yet were it not for <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes,</hi>
who would be decoy'd? Were all
the Promoters of immorality and baſeneſs
amongſt Men ſtigmatized in their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
as Friend <hi>Naylor</hi> once was for his
Blaſphemies, it were to be hoped they
would have few or no Followers: But
whilſt <hi>Wolves</hi> ſhall put on the Habit of
<hi>Sheep, Vultures</hi> that of the <hi>Dove,</hi> and the
Hyprocrite haunt ye in all the Habits of
<hi>Gown, Cloak,</hi> or <hi>Jerkin;</hi> ſo long there is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45028:68"/>
little hopes that Men will be <hi>arm'd</hi> with
<hi>Caution</hi> enough to avoid the ſnare. Such
like thoughts as theſe (as I ſaid) kept me
company ſleeping or waking until the next
time I ſaw <hi>Friend;</hi> and that was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
thus:</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but the conſciouſneſs
of his guilt, and being ſo notoriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
as at the late Tavern-muſter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with him to keep at a diſtance from
our Lodging, where we never ſaw him
afterwards; but going one day by a houſe,
where I ſaw a great many green Aprons,
gray Coats, and large-Ear'd Brethren paſs
in before me, I had the curioſity to enter
into a Room where there were a great
Throng <hi>Aſſembled;</hi> in midſt of whom was
<hi>Friend</hi> Exalted on a Form; ſometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
his Palms, ſometimes thumping his
Breaſt, and Vociferating till he made the
Auditory <hi>groan</hi> again: I was a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to find him <hi>Holding-forth</hi> after that
manner, not thinking his Age had called
him to that Claſſis; but it ſeems he was
acknowledged a <hi>Gifted Brother</hi> from his
Youth: A little after he eſpied me, he put
a period to his diſcourſe, and (having ſate
down a-while) came to me, and deſired
me to call at his Lodgings; which I did
in a day or two after, with intention to tell
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45028:69"/>
him my thoughts of his lewd and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Hypocriſie: But he was gone into
the Country, where, in a ſhort time, he
drew down ſeveral Thouſands of pounds
out of <hi>Friend</hi>'s hands on pretence of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
for them; a little while after (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made himſelf too publick, and got
what he deſired into his hands) he ſlipt
over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo gave <hi>Friends</hi> the
ſlip with a conſiderable Stock, wherewith
he purchaſed an Eſtate there, and threw
off the diſguiſe of a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have been ſince told, that he had a
Wife and divers Children in the Country,
when he pretended that Addreſs to the
young Lady; and that ſince he hath been
ſettled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he hath carried it very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſively
to his Wife (who is look'd upon as
a ſober Woman) keeping Strumpets in his
Houſe, beſides what he frequents abroad;
where he continues to keep company with
the Neighbouring Youth, and infect them
with his contagious Debaucheries.</p>

Thou knoweſt thou haſt in thy Keeping

into the Cuſtody of thy <hi>Cage of Captivity;</hi> but
withal, it were not amiſs for thee to conſider,

do they <hi>whiſtle</hi> nor <hi>ſing</hi> as the <hi>feathered

Conſiderations moving the <hi>Men of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
ſo to do; and thee wilt find it much to thy
advantage to uſe <hi>Moderation</hi> towards them, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of their Captivity; for verily that
will ſound much to thy Commendation: Doſt
thou not ſee with what tenderneſs the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
that are kept in <hi>Cages</hi> about the Town are
uſed? they have their Priſons <hi>cleanſed</hi> every
day, and are ſupplied with freſh <hi>water</hi> and <hi>food</hi>
for the ſupport of their <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> ſometimes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45028:79"/>
they have <hi>green boughs,</hi> and leaves put about
them for their <hi>refreſhment,</hi> which makes them
rejoice in the kindneſs of their <hi>Keepers;</hi> Yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
they do greatly rejoice, and teſtifie their
thankfulneſs by their merry <hi>chirping</hi> and <hi>hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
from one pearch to another.</p>
               <p>Now (as I was a ſaying) though <hi>Friends</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>chirp</hi> and <hi>ſing</hi> thy Commendation, yet they
have ways of expreſſing their gratitude, in ſuch
a manner as (I am apt to think) may be <hi>more
acceptable</hi> to thee; For if there come into thy
Houſe a <hi>Hamper of Wine,</hi> a <hi>piece of Veniſon,</hi> or
a <hi>piece of Plate,</hi> verily I may ſay theſe are very
acceptable things, and yet ſuch as <hi>Friends</hi> can
part withal upon good terms. But if thee beeſt
<hi>ſowre</hi> and <hi>rugged</hi> to them, thou wilt find it far
otherwiſe; thoſe <hi>acceptable</hi> returns will be
ſtrangers to thy houſe, and it will be a hard

they will rather die in bonds, than that thou

               <p>I have ſet this matter before thee, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

it hath come unto my Ears, that thee haſt been

and that thou haſt not only denied them the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment</hi>

<hi>violent hands</hi> upon ſome of them; and haſt ſore

Seventh Day of the Sixth Month, which laſt
paſſed over us. It came to paſs that I was at
a <hi>ſilent Meeting,</hi> where were many <hi>Friends</hi>
who were in great <hi>pain of mind;</hi> Yea, and
their thoughts <hi>ſtrugled</hi> mightily within them,
as if they had been <hi>ready for the birth:</hi> But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
not one of us had ſtrength to <hi>bring forth</hi>
our thoughts, or (as I may ſpeak) to <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
them into words;</hi> ſo that in this ſtate we
waited there for ſeveral hours, ſometimes <hi>fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Arms, groaning,</hi> and <hi>goggling</hi> at one the
other, until at length we parted, and every one
returned unto his <hi>own place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it came to paſs that ſitting down in one
ſide of my Garden, and viewing the little Worms
that were laying up their Stores for their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-proviſion,
ſuddenly there was a <hi>mighty noiſe</hi>
within my <hi>head,</hi> much like the rumbling of a
violent ſtorm at a little diſtance, and a <hi>great
weight</hi> ſeemed to reſt upon my <hi>head,</hi> which
grew <hi>heavier</hi> and <hi>heavier,</hi> and the noiſe encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>more</hi> and <hi>more;</hi> And I called unto <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
my Wife, and ſaid unto her, <hi>Woman, come
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45028:80"/>
thee hither unto me;</hi> and ſhe haſtned, and came
unto me: but when ſhe drew near unto me,
ſhe cried out, ſaying, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> and I
anſwered, and ſaid unto her, <hi>I am</hi> Robert <hi>thy
husband; how comes it that thou doſt not know
me?</hi> And ſhe ſaid unto me, <hi>Tarry a little, and
I will fetch the</hi> mirrour <hi>out of our Chamber;
for I am apt to think thee may'ſt hardly know thy
ſelf:</hi> So ſhe brought with her the <hi>Mirrour</hi>
which was hanged againſt the Wall of the
Chamber; and I caſt mine Eyes towards it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
behold! there iſſued out on the top of my head
two <hi>branches</hi> in the appearance of mighty

And I ſaid unto her, <hi>Woman, what haſt thou
done, that my head is thus</hi> encumbred? And ſhe
anſwered, and ſaid unto me, <hi>Robert, what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thee by ſaying ſo unto me? Didſt thou ever

and ſhe anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>Yea a</hi> Wind-mill:
And again I caſt mine Eyes towards the
<hi>Mirrour,</hi> and <hi>behold</hi> the form of a <hi>Wind-mill</hi>
ſhewed it ſelf on the top of my <hi>head;</hi> and that
which had ſeemed like two <hi>beams,</hi> appeared

went <hi>round</hi> with <hi>great noiſe;</hi> and it ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
me as if a great quantity of <hi>Meal</hi> (which
was grinding in the Mill) iſſued forth at my

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45028:81"/>
                  <hi>which falleth to the ground, and</hi> preſerve <hi>it for

me, and ſaid, <hi>Thee art in ſome</hi> Trance <hi>or</hi> Viſion,
<hi>for there appeareth unto me nothing like the</hi>
Flour of Wheat <hi>iſſuing from thy</hi> Noſtrils; <hi>but
there is ſomewhat of a</hi> ſlimy matter, <hi>as if thee
hadſt caught Cold in thy head;</hi> And I ſaid unto
her, <hi>What then is become of the Wind-mill?</hi> and ſhe
ſaid unto me, <hi>Neither doth any ſuch thing appear

               </p>
               <p>During all this time I <hi>ſaw</hi> many <hi>ſtrange</hi> and

great <hi>fumigation</hi> againſt the <hi>Iaols</hi> (as he called

The Gentleman whiſper'd him, <hi>A foreign Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,</hi>

Ticket-money into the Box-keeper's hand, and
