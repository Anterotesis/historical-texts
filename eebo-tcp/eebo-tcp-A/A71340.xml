            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe ſolemn day appointed by his Electoral Highneſs for a publick Thankſgiving and rejoicing for the happy Return of His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to his Kingdoms, being come, <hi>viz.</hi> Tueſday laſt, it was celebrated here in this manner. Firſt his Highneſs and the whole Court left off their mourning habit that day (which they wore before, and ſince reſumed, for his late Majeſty of Sweden, and the deceaſed Electreſs Dowager of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh) to make the day and action the more joyful in every regard; at 8 of the clock his Highneſs came down from his palace, attended with a Noble and well-ordered Retinue, to the great Church, where choiſe muſick was heard in ſeveral parts thereof, and the 21. Pſalm was ſung by the whole Congregation, which was followed by an eloquent Sermon out of 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.14, 15. (a Text ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed then for the whole Palatinate, together with a ſet form of prayer to give thanks for the mercy celebrated.) Sermon being ended, <hi>Te Deum &amp;c.</hi> was ſung moſt ſolemnly, with Organs and all ſorts of muſical inſtruments: The Church was ſo thronged, and the joy ſo great and general, as if the Palatinate were but then reſtored, or their Peace but now ſealed and like to be ſetled. After this Divine ſervice (and the like in the reſt of the Churches here) his Highneſs returned with a greater Train up to his Palace, having invited divers Lords and Gentlemen, ſtrangers and others, who were Princely entertained there, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties health, long life and reign, as alſo the health and happineſs of both the Queens, the moſt illuſtrious Dukes of York and Glouceſter, the Princeſſes Royal, &amp;c. were with hearty apprecations cheerfully remembred, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth from thence all over the City, without the leaſt offence or ſcandal to any. In the afternoon his Highneſs came down again into the City, to partake alſo of the Peoples civil rejoycings, He having cauſed a very artificial
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:97700:416"/>
Mount, beſet ſeemingly with Orange trees, to be raiſed near the Town-houſe, divers Youths Satyr-like running tumbling and ſporting thereon, while a Fountain thence ran with white and red wine for three or four hours together; and from another place great quantities of manchets (to make up a compleat beverage with the wine) were flung among the multitude by one Mr. <hi>Sandys,</hi> an Engliſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſervant to his Highneſs. The Prince Elector himſelf alſo, and the young Prince, out of a Balcony ſcattered ſome gold and ſilver upon the throng, which cauſed notable paſtime. One condemned to die, was likewiſe pardoned and releaſed, having taken the advantage of the day, and begg'd his life for King <hi>Charls</hi> the Second's ſake, which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs immediately granted. In the evening between nine and ten, his Highneſs went up again, when on a ſudden the towers of the Palace, Caſtle and City, the River and the Hills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhew their artificial lights and fires, and the young Electoral Prince firſt himſelf fired ſome of his own ſmall ordnance, from a Battery upon the hill behind the garden, which ſerved as a warning to them at <hi>Manhlin</hi> and <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> to be in readineſs with theirs, five or ſix hours journey diſtant: Thereupon the Soldiery firſt in ſeveral bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their vollies; after which from three other Batteries 30 Canons plaid in order, and diſcharged thrice one after another; and thoſe upon the hills could plainly ſee, and partly hear the exact anſwers peece for peece, as it were, from the ſaid places, which yielded much pleaſure to the obſervers, but eſpecially by Firework from the top of a Tower in the Palace, in which you might ſee the Name of <hi>Charls II.</hi> and then that of the <hi>Prince Elector,</hi> as with letters of gold in the air; beſides the Fireballs, Darts, Rockets, the variety and greatneſs of Bonfires, and all manner of ſportful Repreſentations, till after midnight, all emulating one another who ſhould moſt teſtifie the largeneſs of their devotion and affection. And that which gave the more luſtre to the celebration of this Feſtival, was, that though for ſome days immediately before and after, there fell a great deal of
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:97700:417"/>
rain here, this whole day proved as ſerene and fair for ſuch a Jubilee, as heart could wiſh, and accordingly doubled the joy and ſatisfaction of all.</p>
               <p>By a letter written to her Majeſty of Bohemia of the ſame date and place, recounting moſt of the foregoing paſſages; there is alſo mention made of a Letter the Prince Elector had received that very day from the Duke of Wittenburg, ſhewing how much he did partake of his Highneſs joy, and intended Feſtival upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties account of Great Brittain, being ſorry he could not celebrate it on the ſame day, though he was reſolved to ſet a day apart for all his countrey, joyfully to ſolemniſe ſo great a mercy, and ſo auſpicious a reſtoration. The Prince of Kaſſaw Dillenberg had the like intent and purpoſe; the City of Wormes, Spire, Landaw &amp;c. had celebrated it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; the Preſs at Heidelburg laboured with learned Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Poems, the better to perpetuate the remembrance of the day, and the bleſſed occaſion of it; the City had been ſo full of ſtrangers from Hailbron, Franckfort, Strasburg &amp;c. yea even from parts of Helvetia upon the bruit of what was intended, that it had the reſemblance of an Inauguration or coronation time. At Franckfort, the conflux of people and the general joy was ſo great, that no body there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the like, ſince her Majeſties marriage.</p>
