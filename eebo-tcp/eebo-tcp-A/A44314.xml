            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what I had begun with so happy
an Omen. My good Success
therefore herein, if any, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be ascribed to your self; as
being the first Excitor and chief
Abettor of it. And therefore I
hope that may be my excuse, for
craving You so great a Patron
thereunto, in that I could not
have entitled it to any other
without a manifest Injury to
Your Honour; whose Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:56220:3"/>
countenancing of it, justly
requires my utmost Gratitude. I
must therefore with the <hi>Persian</hi>
offer to you, as he to the Sun,
what he believes himself to have
received from it. And therefore I
trust my endeavouring to soar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft

Influence of the most Glorious
Light of the world, will find a
Pardon, and be judged much
better, than a hovering and flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

the dim and fading Flame of a

those wings that raised it so
high, and in stead of giving it
more Vigour, will wholly disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it for the like Future At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
I am not a little sensible
indeed, that the Minuteness both
of the thing and its Author, may
seem to make it a Present very
<pb facs="tcp:56220:3"/>
unfit for so great a Personage.
But yet I am in hope, that like
the poor man, that seeing many
Noble and Rich, hasting to meet
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> with their Splendid
and Sumptuous Gifts, would
needs carry somthing too, and
though 'twas but a little water
fetch'd out of the River in the
Palms of his Hands, yet addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself, he presented it with
an unexpected acceptance, I also
may be happy in the like success,
with this Oblation, which is but
a few drops taken out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

            <head>The Experiment, as I
find it set down in the
fore-mentioned Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
runs thus;</head>
            <p>AN Eminent Mathematician told
me one day, that some inquisitive
Frenchmen (whose Names I know
not) had observed, that in case one
end of a slender and perforated Pipe of
Glass, as <hi>A. B. or C.</hi> be dipt in water,
<hi>as in that conteined in the Vessel, G. H.
of the 8th. Figure,</hi> the Liquor will ascend
to some' height in the Pipe, <hi>as to D. E. or
F.</hi> though held perpendicular to the plain
of the water. And to satisfie me, that he
mis-related not the Experiment, he soon
after brought two or three small Pipes of
Glass, which gave me the opportunity of
trying it, though I had the less reason to
distrust it, because I remember I had often in
the long and slender Pipes of some Weather-Glasses,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56220:6"/>
which I had caused to be made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a somwhat peculiar fashion, taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the like ascension of the Liquor,
though (presuming it might be casual) I
had made but little reflection upon it. But
after this trial, beginning to suppose, that
though the water in these Pipes that were
brought me, rise not above a quarter of an
Inch (if near so high) yet, if the Pipes
were made slender onough, the water might
rise to a very much greater height; I caus'd
several of them to be, by a dexterous hand,
drawn out at the flame of a Lamp, in one
of which that was almost incredibly slender,
we found that the water ascended (as it
were of it self) five Inches by measure, to
the no small wonder of some famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
who were Spectators of some
of these Experiments And this height the
Water reached to, though the Pipe were held
in as erected a posture as we could: For if
it were inclined, the water would fill a
greater part of it, though not rise higher in
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And we also found, that when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Pipe was wetted beforehand, the
water would rise much better than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
but we caused not all our slender Pipes
to be made straight, but some of them crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
like <hi>Syphons:</hi> And having immersed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56220:6"/>
the shorter Leg of one of these into a Glass
that held some fair water, we found as we
expected, that the water arising to the top of
the <hi>Syphon,</hi> though that were high enough,
did of it self run down the longer Leg, and
continue running like an ordinary <hi>Syphon.</hi>
The cause of this ascension of the water, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to all that were present, so difficult,
that I must not stay to enumerate the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conjectures that were made at it, much
less to examine them; especially having
nothing but bare Conjectures to substitute in
the room of those I do not approve. We tried
indeed, by conveying a very slender Pipe and
a small Vessel of water into our Engine,
whether or no the Exsuction of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Air would assist us to find the cause of
the ascension we have been speaking of:
But though we employed red Wine in stead
of water, yet we could scarce certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
through so much Glass, as was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
betwixt our eyes and the Liquor, what
happened in a Pipe so slender, that the red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wine was scarce sensible in it.
But as far as we could discern, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
no great alteration to the Liquor:
which seemed the less strange, because the
Spring of that Air that might depress the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56220:7"/>
water in the Pipe, was equally debilitated
with that which remained to press upon the
Surface of the Water in the little Glasse.
Wherefore, in favour of his ingenuous
Conjecture, who ascribed the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
under consideration to the greater
pressure made upon the water by the Air
without the Pipe, than by that within it,
(where so much of the water (consisting
perhaps of Corpuscles more pliant to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
surfaces of the glass) was contiguous
to the sides) it was shown, that in case the
little Glass-Vessel that held the water, of
which a part ascended into the slender Pipe,
were so closed, that a man might with his
mouth suck the Air out of it, the water
would immediatly subside in the small Pipe.
And this would indeed infer, that it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
before only by the pressure of the
incumbent Air. But that it may (how
justly I know not) be objected, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
this would not happen, in case the
upper end of the Pipe were in a <hi>vacuum:</hi>
And that 'tis very probable the water may
subside, not because the pressure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Air is taken off by exsuction, but
by reason of the spring of the external
Air, which impels the water it finds in
its way to the Cavity deserted by the other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56220:7"/>
Air, and would as well impel the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upwards, as make it subside, if it were
not for the accidental posture of the Glasses.
However, having not now leisure to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any further this Matter, I shall only
mind your Lordship, that if You will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
this Speculation, it will be pertinent
to find out likewise, Why the surface of
Water (as is manifest in Pipes) uses to be
concave, being depressed in the middle,
and higher on every side? and why in
Quick-silver on the contrary, not only the
surface is wont to be very convex, or swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in the middle; but if you dip the end
of a slender Pipe in it, the surface of the
Liquor (as 'tis called) will be lower with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pipe, than without. Which <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena,</hi>
whither, and how far, they may
be deduced from the Figure of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
Corpuscles, and the Shape of
the Springy Particles of the Air, I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave to be considered.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y former Conjecture,</hi> That
the unequal height of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
of the water proceeded
from the greater pressure
made upon the water by the
Air without the Pipes <hi>A. B. C.</hi> than by
that within them; <hi>I shall endeavour to
confirm from the Truth of the two
following Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of which is, That an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

cause an unequal height in the waters
Surfaces.</p>
            <p>And the Second is, That in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
there is such an unequal pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Now that the First is true, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Experiment will evince: For if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56220:8"/>
you take any Vessel so contrived, as
that you can at pleasure either increase
or diminish the pressure of the Air upon
this or that part of the Superficies of the
water, the equality of the height of
those parts will presently be lost. And
that part of the Superficies that sustains
the greater pressure, will be inferiour to
that which undergoes the less: A fit
Vessel for this purpose, will be an invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Glass <hi>Syphon,</hi> such an one as is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the Sixth Figure. For if into it
you put a quantity of Water, suppose
enough to fill it as high as the Line <hi>A. B.</hi>
and applying your mouth to one end, as
to <hi>D.</hi> you shall find, that by gently
blowing in at it, you shall depress the
Superficies <hi>B.</hi> and thereby raise the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Superficies <hi>A.</hi> to a considerable
distance; and by gently sucking, you
may perceive the clean contrary effects
produced.</p>
            <p>Next, That there is such an unequal
pressure, I shall prove from this, that
there is a much greater inconformity
or incongruity (call it what you please)
of Air to Glass, and some other Bodies,
than there is of Water to the same.</p>
            <p>What I mean hereby, I shall in short
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56220:9"/>
explain, by defining conformity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
to be a property of a fluid Body,
whereby any part of it is readily united
or intermingled with any other part, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it self, or of any other Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
or Similar, fluid, or firm and solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And unconformity or incongruity
to be a property of a fluid, by which it
is kept off and hindred from uniting or
mingling with any heterogeneous or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similar,
fluid or solid Body.</p>
            <p>This last property, any one that hath
been observingly conversant about fluid
Bodies, cannot be ignorant of: For (not
now to mention several Chimical Spirits
and Oyles which will very hardly, if at
all, be brought to mix with one another,
insomuch that there may be found some
8 or 9, or more, several distinct Liquors,
which swimming one upon another, will
not be brought to mix) we need seek
no further for Examples of this kind,
than to observe the drops of rain falling
through the air; and the Bubbles of air
which are by any means conveyed under
the surface of the Water; or a drop of
common Sallet Oyl swimming upon
water: In all which, and many more
Examples that might be enumerated, of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56220:9"/>
this sort, the incongruity of two fluids
is easily discernable. And as for examples
of Congruity or Incongruity of Liquids
one with another, or with several kinds
of firm, or solid Bodies, they have long
since been taken notice of, and called
by the Names of Drieness and Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
(though these two Names are not
comprehensive enough, they being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
used to signifie only the adhering
or not adhering of water to some other
solid Bodies) of this kind we may observe
that water will more readily wet some
woods than others; and that water let
fall upon a Feather, the whiter side of a
Colwort, and some other leaves, or
upon almost any unctuous or resinous su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not at all adhere to
them, but easily tumble off from them,
like a solid Bowl; whereas if dropt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Linnen, Paper, Clay, green Wood,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will not be taken off, without
leaving some part of it behind adhering
to them: So Quicksilver, which will
very hardly be brought to stick to any
vegetable body, will readily adhere to,
and mingle with several clean metalline
bodies.</p>
            <p>Now from what cause this congruity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56220:10"/>
or Incongruity of bodies one to another,
does proceed, whether from the Figure
of their constituent Particles, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
pores, or from the differing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the parts of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as whether circular, undulating,
progressive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether I say from one,
or more, or none of these enumerated
causes, I shall not here determine; It
being an enquiry more proper to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and explained among the general
Principles of Philosophy, whither at
present I shall refer it; as fearing lest it
might here seem absurd, without the
concatenation of several other Principles
to explicate it; and knowing it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sufficient for this enquiry to shew,
that there is such a property, from what
cause soever it proceeds.</p>
            <p>These Properties therefore (alwaies
the concomitants of fluid bodies) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
these following visible Effects:</p>
            <p>First, They unite the parts of a fluid
to its homogeneal Solid, or keep them
separate from its heterogeneal: Hence
Quicksilver will (as we noted before)
stick to Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
unite with them: but roule off from wood,
stone, glass, if never so little scituated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56220:10"/>
out of its horizontale Paralelisme; and
water that will wet salt and dissolve it,
will slip off from Tallow, or the like,
without at all adhering; as it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be observed to do, upon a dusty
superficies. And next they cause the
parts of homogeneal fluid bodies readily
to adhere together and mix, and of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal,
to be exceeding averse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Hence we find, that two small
drops of water, on any superficies they
can roule on, will, if they chance to
touch each other, readily unite and mix
in one 3d. Globule or drop: the like
may be observed with two small Bowls
of Quicksilver upon a Table or Glass,
provided the surfaces of those Globule
be not dusty; and with two drops of
Oyl upon fair water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further,
water put unto wine, salt water, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
spirit of wine, or the like, does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
(especially if they be shaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
disperse it self all over them: hence
on the contrary also we find, that water
powred upon Quicksilver, and Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that water, and Air upon that Oyl,
though they be stopt closely up into a
Bottle, and shaken never so much, they
will by no means long suffer any of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56220:11"/>
bigger parts to be united or included
within any of the other Liquors (by
which recited Liquors, may be plainly
enough represented the 4 Peripaterical
Elements.) From this property 'tis that
a drop of water does not mingle with, or
vanish into Air, but is driven (by that flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id
equality protruding it on every side)
and forc't into as little a space as it can
possibly be contained in, namely, into a
Round Globule. So likewise a little air
blown under the water, is united or
thrust into a Bubble, by the ambient
water. And a parcel of Quicksilver en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
with Air, water, or almost any
other liquor, is formed into a round
Ball.</p>
            <p>Now the cause why all these included
fluids newly mentioned, or as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as are wholly included within a
heterogeneous fluid, are not exactly of
a spherical Figure (seeing that if caused
by these Principles only, it could be of
no other) must proceed from some other
kind of pressure against the two opposite
flatted sides. This adventitious or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
pressure may proceed from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
causes, and accordingly must diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie
the Figure of the included hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56220:11"/>
fluid: For seeing that a body
may be included either with a fluid on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or only with a solid, or partly with
a fluid and partly with a solid, or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with one fluid, and partly with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there will be found a very great
variety of the terminating surfaces, much
differing from a Spherical, according to
the various resistance or pressure that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to each of these encompassing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums.</p>
            <p>Which Properties may in general be
deduced from two heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Motion,
and Rest. For either this Globular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
is altered by a natural Motion, such
as is Gravity, or a violent, such as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
any accidental motion of the fluids, as
we see in the wind rufling up the water,
and the purlings of Streams, and foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cartaracts, and the like, which
because they are so obvious and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
understood, and so little pertinent
to our present enquiry, I shall refer to
some other intended Speculations, to
which they do more properly belong.
Or thirdly, By the Firmness and Stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ambient Solid. For if the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Solid be of an angular or any other
irregular Form, the included fluid will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56220:12"/>
be near of the like, as a Pint Pot full of
water, or a Bladder full of Air. And
next, if the including or included fluid
have a greater gravity one than another,
then will the globular Form be deprest
into an Eliptico-spherical: As if for
example, we suppose the Circle <hi>A. B.
C. D.</hi> in the first Figure, to represent a
drop of water, Quick-silver or the like,
included with the Air, or the like, which
supposing there were no gravity at all in
either of the fluids, or that the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and containing were of the same
weight, would be equally deprest into
an exactly-spherical body (the ambient
pressing equally against every side of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
But supposing either a greater gravity
in the included, by reason whereof the
parts of it being prest from <hi>A.</hi> towards
<hi>B.</hi> and thereby the whole put into moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that motion being hindred by
the resistance of the subjacent parts of
the ambient, the globular Figure, <hi>A. D.
B. C.</hi> will be deprest into the Eliptico-spherical,
<hi>E. G. F. H.</hi> For the side <hi>A.</hi> is
detruded to <hi>E.</hi> by the Gravity, and <hi>B.</hi>
to <hi>F.</hi> by the resistance of the subjacent
medium: and therefore <hi>C.</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be thrust to <hi>G.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>H.</hi> Or else
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56220:12"/>
supposing a greater gravity in the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
by whose more than ordinary pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against the under side of the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
globul, <hi>B.</hi> will be forced to <hi>F.</hi> &amp; by its
resistance of the motion upwards, the
side <hi>A.</hi> will be deprest to <hi>E.</hi> and therefore
<hi>C.</hi> being thrust to <hi>G.</hi> &amp; <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>H.</hi> the globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Figure by this means also will be
made an Eliptico-spherical. Next if a
fluid be included partly with one, and
partly with another fluid, it will be found
to be shaped diversly, according to the
proportion of the gravity and incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the 3 fluids one to another, as in
the second Figure, let the upper <hi>M M M</hi>
be Air, the middle <hi>L. M. N. O</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Oyle, the lower O. O. O. be
water, the Oyl will be form'd not into
a spherical Figure, such as is represented
by the pricked Line, but into such a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
as L. M. N. O. whose side L.
M. N. will be of a flatter Eliptical
Figure, by reason of the great dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the Gravity of Oyle
and Air, and the side L. O. M. of a
rounder, because of the smaller diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the weight of Oyle and
water. Lastly, The globular Figure
will be changed, if the ambient be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56220:13"/>
partly fluid and partly solid. And here
the termination of the incompassed fluid
towards the incompassing is shap'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
or incongruity of the fluids to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,
and of the gravity and incongruity
of the fluids one to another. As suppose
the subjacent medium that hinders an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
fluid's descent, be a solid, as let
K. L. in the first Figure represent the
smooth superficies of a Table, E. G.
F. H. a parcel of running Mercury, the
side G. F. H. will be more flatted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proportion of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of the Mercury and Air to the
Wood, and of the gravity of Mercury
and Air one to another; The side G.
E. H. will likewise be a little more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
by reason the subjacent parts are
now at rest which were before in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
[I have not here time, nor is it much
to my present purpose, to shew how
much the Figure of the descending fluid
may be altered from this Eliptico spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Figure, by a very small resistance of
the subjacent medium, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the under parts of the descendent
may have as to the acceleration of their
motions of descent, may be able to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56220:13"/>
draw them out into the Form of the
Figure X.] Or further in the 3d. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
let A. I. L. D. represent an
including solid medium of a cylindrical
shape (as suppose a small Glass Jar) Let
F. G. E. M. represent a contain'd
fluid, as water; this towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and sides, is figured according to
the concavity of the Glass: But its up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Surface, which by reason of its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
(not considering at all the Air above
it, and so neither the congruity or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
of either of them to the Glass)
should be terminated by part of a Sphear
whose diameter should be the same with
that of the earth, which to our sense
would appear a straight Line, as F. G<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> E.
Or which by reason of its having a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
congruity to Glasse than Air has,
(not considering its Gravity) would be
thrust into a concave Sphear, as C. H. B.
whose diameter would be the same with
that of the concavity of the Vessel. But
by reason of its having a greater gravity
than the Air, and having likewise a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
congruity to Glass, than the Air
has; from hence I say it is terminated,
by a concave Eliptico-spherical Figure,
as C. K. B. For by its congruity it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56220:14"/>
conforms it self, and adheres to the
Glass, and constitutes as 'twere one
containing body with it, and therefore
should thrust the contained Air on that
side it touches it, into a spherical Figure,
as B. H. C. but the motion of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
depressing a little the Corners B. and
C. reduces it into the aforesaid Figure,
C. K. B. Now that 'tis the greater
congruity of one of the two contiguous
fluids, than of the other, to the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
solid, that causes the separating sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
of the two liquids to be thus or
thus figured: And that 'tis not because
this or that figurated surface is more
proper, natural or peculiar to one of
these fluid bodies, than to the other,
will appear from this, that the same flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids
will by being put into differing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,
change their surfaces for the same
water, which in a Glass or wooden Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
will have a concave surface upwards,
and will rise higher in a smaller than
greater Pipe, the same water, I say, in
the same Pipes greas'd over or oyled,
will produce quite contrary effects, for
it will have a protuberant and convex
surface upwards, and will not rise so
high in small, as in bigger Pipes: Nay,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56220:14"/>
in the very same solid Vessel, you may
make the very same two contiguous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quids
to alter their Surfaces; for taking
a small Wine-Glass, or such like Vessel,
and pouring water gently into it, you
shall perceive the surface of the water all
the way concave, till it rise even with
the top, when you shall find it (if you
gently and carefully poure in more) to
grow very protuberant and convex; the
reason of which is plain, for that the
solid sides of the containing body are no
longer extended, to which the water
does more readily adhere, than the air;
but it is henceforth to be included with
air, which would reduce it into a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,
but by reason of its gravity,
it is flatted into an Oval. Quicksilver
also which to Glass is more incongruous
than Air (and thereby being put into a
Glass-Pipe, will not adhere to it, but
by the more congruous air will be forced
to have a very protuberant surface, and
to rise higher in a greater than a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Pipe) this Quicksilver to clean Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
especially to Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iron excepted, is more congruous
than Air, and will not only stick to it,
but have a concave Surface like water,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56220:15"/>
and rise higher in a less, than in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pipe.</p>
            <p>In all these Examples, 'tis evident,
that there is an extaordinary and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
force by which the globular
Figure of the contain'd heterogeneous
fluid is altered, neither can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
how it should otherwise be of any
other Figure than Globular: For being
by the heterogeneous fluid equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
every way, whatsoever part is
protuberant, will be thereby deprest.
From this cause it is that in its effects it
does very much resemble a round Spring
(such as a Hoop) I shall not here speak
of the nature of Springs in general, as
being more proper for another Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
but only take notice, that as
in a round Spring there is required an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
pressure against two opposite
sides, to reduce it into an Oval Form,
or to force it in between the sides of a
Hole whose Diameter is less than that
of the Spring, there must be a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
force or protrusion against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave
or inner side of the Spring, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o to
alter this spherical constitution of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
fluid body, there is required
more pressure against opposite sides to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56220:15"/>
reduce it into an Oval, and to press it
into an Hole less in Diameter than it
self, it requires a greater protrusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the other sides. What degrees
of force are requisite to reduce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
longer and longer Ovals, or to press
them into less and less holes, I have not
yet experimentally calculated; but thus
much by experiment I find in general,
that there is alwaies required a greater
pressure to close them into longer Ovals,
or protrude them into smaller holes: the
necessity and reason of this, were it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
I could easily explain: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not so necessary, and requiring more
room and time than I have for it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
I shall here omit it; and proceed
to shew, that this may be presently
found true, if Experiment be made
with a Round Spring (the way of which
trials can scarce be mist by any one, at
all conversant in Experiments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And
with the fluid bodies of Mercury, Air,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the way of trying, which will be
somwhat more difficult; and therefore
I shall in brief describe it. He therefore
that would try with Air, must first be
provided of a Glass-Pipe, made of the
shape of that in the fifth Figure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56220:16"/>
of the side A. B. represents a straight
Tube of about 3 foot long (C. D.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
an other part of it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
of C. E. F. G. D. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> several
round Bubles so ordered, that there is
left a passage out of each of them, into
its next, of which passages, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
C. and E. is to be the biggest;
(as for example, ⅙ of an Inch in Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
that between E. and F. is to be
less, (<hi>viz.</hi> ⅛ of an Inch) that between
F. and G. (1/12 of an Inch) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
G. and D. (1/16) that above D
(1/24 or half a Line) there may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as many more as the experimenter
shall think fit, with passages or interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
holes continually decreasing by
known quantities so far as his senses are
able to help him; I say so far, because
there may be made Pipes so small that
it will be impossible to perceive the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration
with ones naked eye, though by
the help of a Microscope, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
enough be perceived: Nay, I have
made a Pipe perforated from end to end,
so small, that with your naked eye you
would very hardly have seen the body
of it, insomuch that I have been able to
knit it up into a knot without breaking,
but this by the by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56220:16"/>
To proceed then, for the trial of the
Experiment, the Experimenter must
place the Tube (A. B.) perpendicular,
and fill the Bubble E. with the passage
beneath it, full of water, but leave the
bubble C. full of Air, and then gently
pouring in water into the Pipe A. B. he
must observe diligently how high the
water will rise in it before it protrude
the Bubble of Air, (C.) through the
narrow passage into E. and denote ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
the height of the Cylinder of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then filling the bubble F. with water
and E. with air, he may proceed as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
denoting likewise the height of
the Cylinder of water, able to protrude
the Bubble E. through the passage E. F.
the like may be do with the next passage,
and the next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as far as he is able, then
comparing the several heights of the
Cylinders, with the several holes
through which each Cylinder did force
the air (having due regard to the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of water in the Tube C. D) it will
be very easie to determine, what force
is requisite to press the Air into such and
such a hole, or (to apply it to our present
experiment) how much of the pressure
of the Air is taken off by its ingress into
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56220:17"/>
smaller and smaller holes. Now because
to prepare this Instrument, is somthing
difficult (by reason of the holes which
will be found very troublesom to be
measured) it will be better to prepare
small Glass-Pipes, such as F. G. H.
I. K. L. of the several Bores desired,
each of them about an Inch long, and
having a Pipe, (such as is described in
the 5th. Figure) with only one Bubble,
as (C) with the passage (C. E) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
as before, to force the Air first
through that; then to fasten into it with
Cement the next smaller Pipe, and try
with it as with the other; then a less,
and so to the least, denoting, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and collecting as before. From
these, and other such trials, it will be
found very evident, that to force the air
or other fluid into a smaller hole, of an
incongruous Solid, there is required a
greater force, than there is requisite for
the protrusion of it into a bigger. Come
we therefore to the explanation of the
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> in the experiment of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of water in a smaller Pipe; And from
the application of what has been said to
the entring of the Air into the bigger
hole of the Vessel and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the smaller
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56220:17"/>
hole of the Pipe, we shall clearly find,
that there is a greater pressure of the air
upon the water in the Vessel or greater
Pipe, than there is upon that in the
Lesser Pipe: For since the pressure of
the air every way is found to be as much
as is able to press up and sustain a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Quicksilver of two foot and a half
high, or thereabouts; And since of this
pressure so many more degrees are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to force the Air into a smaller than
into a greater hole, that is full of a more
congruous fluid. And lastly, since those
degrees that are requisite to press it in,
are thereby taken off from the Air with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and the Air within left with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees of pressure less than the Air
without; it will follow, that the Air in
the less Tube or Pipe, will have less
pressure against the superficies of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therein, than the Air in the bigger:
which was the minor Proposition to be
proved.</p>
            <p>The Conclusion therefore will neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this unequal pressure of the
Air caused by its protrusion into unequal
holes, is a cause sufficient to produce this
effect, without the help of any other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56220:18"/>
concurrent, and therefore is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
(if not the only) cause of this <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore being thus explained,
there will be divers <hi>Phaenomena</hi> expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
thereby, as, the Rising of Liquors
in a Filtre, the rising of Spirit of Wine,
Oyl, Melted Tallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the
Weake of a Lamp, (though made of
small Wire, Threeds of Asbestus, Strings
of Glass, or the like) the Rising of
Liquors in a Spunge, piece of Bread,
perhaps also the ascending of the Sap in
Trees and Plants, through their small,
and some of them imperceptible Pores,
(of which perhaps I may say more on
another occasion) at least the passing of it
out of the earth into their roots. I
know not also whether it will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to add what things occurr'd to my
thoughts, when I had these <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
under consideration; which I shall only
propound as <hi>Queries,</hi> that may serve as
hints to some further discovery, and not
as Axioms.</p>
            <p>In short, they were these;</p>
            <p>First, Upon the consideration of the
congruity and incongruity of Bodies,
as to touch, I found also the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56220:18"/>
and incongruity (if I may so
speak) as to the Transcursion of the
Raies of Light: For in this regard,
water (not now to mention other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors)
seems nearer of affinity to glass
than Air, and Air than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Quicksilver:
For an oblique Ray out of Glass, will
pass into water with very little refracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the perpendicular, but none out
of Glass into Air, excepting a direct, will
pass without a very great refraction
from the perpendicular, nay any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Ray under 30 degrees, will not be
admitted into the Air at all, but reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And Quicksilver will neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
oblique or direct, but reflect all;
so that Quicksilver as to the transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Raies of Light, seems to be
of a quite differing constitution, from
that of Air, Water, Glass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
to assimilate most those opacous and
strong reflecting bodies of Metals: and
as to the property of cohesion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,
it seems to keep the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>A Second thing (which was hinted to
me, by the consideration of the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fluid's globular form, caused by
the protrusion of the ambient hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56220:19"/>
fluid) was whether the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of gravity might not by this means
be explained, by supposing the Globe of
Earth, Water and Air to be included
with a fluid, heterogenous to all and
each of them, which is so subtil, as not
only to be every where interspersed
through the Air, (or rather the air
through it) but does pervade the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Glass, and even the closest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
by which means it does endeavour
to detrude all earthly bodies as far from
it as it can; and partly thereby, and
partly by other of its properties (of
which I may some other time give a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
account) move them towards the
Center of the Earth. Now that there
is some such fluid, I could produce many
experiments and Reasons, that do seem
to prove. But because I see it would
ask some time and room to set them
down and explain them, and to consider
and answer all the Objections (many
whereof I foresee) that may be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against it; and because I know a more
likely hypothesis for gravity, which I
can make out by experiment; I shall
at present proceed to other Queries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
my self to have here only given a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56220:19"/>
hint of what I may elswhere determine.</p>
            <p>A Third Query then was, whether
the heterogeneity of the ambient fluid
may not be accounted a secondary cause
of the roundness or globular form of the
greater bodies of the world, such as are
those of the Sun, Stars and Planets, the
substance of each of which seems altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heterogeneous to the circum-ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
fluid aether?</p>
            <p>A Fourth was; Whether the globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Form of the smaller parcels of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
here upon the Earth, as that of
Fruits Pebbles or F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ints <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which seem
to have been a Liquor at first) may not
be caus'd by the heterogeneous ambient
fluid. For thus we see that melted Glass
will be naturally form'd into a round Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
so likewise any small Parcel of any
fusible body, if it be perfectly enclosed
by the Air, will be driven into a globular
Form, and when cold, will be found a
solid Ball. This is plainly enough ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
to us by their way of making
shot with the drops of Lead, or a show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Rain congealed in its falling into
Hailstones; and if you gently let fall a
drop of water upon small sand or dust,
you shall find as 'twere an artificial round
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56220:20"/>
stone quickly generated. I cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occasion omit the mentioning of
the strange kind of Grain which I have
observed in a stone brought from <hi>Kette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and therefore
called by Masons <hi>Kettering-Stone,</hi> like to
which are found also at <hi>Tormanton,</hi> neer
to <hi>Sudberry</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire:</hi> For I found
it to consist of a great number of small
and almost globular parcels of matter,
which to my naked eye look'd much
like the Cob or Spawn of a Herring,
though through a Microscope it looked
like a great Beach of round Pebble stone,
such as I have often seen by the Sea-shore,
some of which I perceived to be
hollow, much like the broken Shels of
Granadoes: Which brings into my
mind what I long since observ'd in the
fiery Sparks that are struck out of a
flint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For having a great desire to
see what was left behind, after the
Spark was gone out, I purposely struck
fire over a very white piece of Paper,
and observing diligently where some
conspicuous sparks went out, I found a
very little black spot no bigger than the
point of a Pin, which through a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope
appeared to be a perfectly round
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56220:20"/>
Ball, looking much like a polisht ball of
Steel, insomuch that I was able to see
the Image of the window reflected from
it, making the like Observation in very
many others, I found some to be hollow,
and to look like the broken shels of
Grandoes, much like that represented
in the 4th. Figure. I cannot here stay
to examine the particular Reasons of it,
but shall only hint, that I imagine it to
be some small parcel of the flint or steel
(for I find it may be of either) which
by the violence of the motion of the
stroke (most of which seems to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
upon those small parcels) is made
so glowing hot, that 'tis melted into a
<hi>Vitrum,</hi> which by the ambient Air is
driven into a round Globul.</p>
            <p>A Fifth thing which I thought worth
Examination was, Whether the motion
of all kind of Springs, might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to the Principle whereby the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
heterogeneous fluid seems to be
moved; or to that whereby two solids,
as Marbles, or the like, are thrust and
kept together by the Ambient flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id.</p>
            <p>A Sixth thing was, Whether the
Rising and Ebullition of the water out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56220:21"/>
of Springs &amp; Fountains (which lie much
higher from the Center of the earth than
the superficies of the Sea, from whence
it seems to be derived) may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
by the Rising of water in a
smaller Pipe: For the Sea-water being
as it were strain'd through the Pores or
Crevices of the earth, is as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in little Pipes, where the pressure
of the Air has not so great a power to
resist its Rising: But examining this
way, and finding in it several difficulties
almost irremoveable, I thought upon a
way that would much more naturally
and conceiveably explain it, which was
by this following Experiment: I took
a Glass Tube of the form of that descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the 6th. Figure, and chusing two
heterogeneous fluids, such as water and
Oyl, I poured in as much water as fill'd
up the Pipes as high as (A. B.) then
putting in some Oyle into the Tube
(A. C.) I deprest the superficies (A.)
of the water to (E.) and B. I raised to
G. which was not so high perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
as the superficies of the Oyle F.
by the space (F. I.) wherefore the
proportion of the gravity of these two
Liquors was as (G. H.) to (F. E.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56220:21"/>
This Experiment I tried with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other Liquors, and particularly with
fresh water and salt (which we made by
dissolving Salt in warm water) which
two though they are nothing heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
yet before they would perfectly
mix one with another, I made trial of
the Experiment: Nay, letting the
Tube wherein I tried the Experiment
remain for many daies, I observed them
not to mix; but the superficies of the
fresh was rather more than less eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above that of the salt. Now the
proportion of the gravity of Sea-water,
to that of River-water, according to
<hi>Stevinus</hi> and <hi>Varenius,</hi> (for I have not
now the opportunity of making trial
my self) is as 46. to 45. that is, 46.
Ounces of the salt-water will take up no
more Room than 45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the fresh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or
reciprocally 45 pints of salt, water weigh
as much as 46 of fresh. Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the difference to be much more,
for I found the proportion of Brine to
fresh water to be near 13 to 12: Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
therefore G. H. M. to represent
the Sea, and F. I. the height of the
Mountain above the Superficies of the
Sea, F. M. a Cavern in the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56220:22"/>
at the bottom of the Sea, and
terminated at the top of the Mountain,
L. M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sand at the bottom, through
which the water is as it were strained, so
as that the fresher parts are only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to transude, and the saline kept
back; if therefore the proportion of G.
M. to F. M. be as 45. to 46. then
may the Cylinder of salt water G. M.
make the Cylinder of fresh water to
rise as high as E. and to run over at N.
I cannot here stand to examine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
their Opinion, who make the
depth of the Sea below its Superficies,
to be no more perpendicularly measur'd
than the height of the Mountains above
it: 'Tis enough for me to say, there is
no one of those that have vented it,
have experimentally known the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
of either; nor shall I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
whether there may not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other causes of the separation of the
fresh water from the salt, as perhaps
some parts of the earth through which it
is to pass, may contain a salt, that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and uniting with the Sea salt, may
precipitate it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the Alkalizate and Acid Salts mix
and precipitate each other in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56220:22"/>
of <hi>Tartarum Vitriolatum.</hi> I know
not also whether the exceeding cold
(that must necessarily be) at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the water, may not help towards
this separation, for we find, that warm
water is able to dissolve and contain
more salt, than the same cold; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that Brines strongly impregnated
by heat, if let cool, do suffer much of
their salt to subside and chrystallize a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bout
the bottom and sides. I know
not also whether the exceeding pressure
of the parts of the water one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may not keep the Salt from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to the very bottom, as finding
little or no room to insert it self between
those parts, protruded so violently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or else squeeze it upwards into
the superiour parts of the Sea, where it
may more easily obtain room for it self,
amongst the parts of the water, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that there is more heat and less pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
To this Opinion I was somwhat
the more induced by the relations I have
met with in several Geographical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
of drawing fresh water from the
bottom of the Sea, which is salt above.
I cannot now stand to examine, whether
this natural perpetual motion may not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56220:23"/>
artificially be imitated: Nor can I stand
to answer the Objections which may
be made against this my Supposition:
As,</p>
            <p>First, How it comes to pass, that
there are somtimes salt Springs much
higher than the Superficies of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why Springs do not run
faster and flower, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
height made of the Cylinder of
Sea-water, by the ebbing and flowing
of the Sea?</p>
            <p>As to the First, In short, I say, the
fresh water may receive again a saline
Tincture near the Superficies of the
Earth, by passing through some salt
Mines, or else many of the saline parts
of the Sea may be kept back, though
not all.</p>
            <p>And as to the Second, The same
Spring may be fed and supply'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Caverns, coming from very far
distant parts of the Sea, so as that it
may in one place be high, in another
low water; and so by that means the
Spring may be equally supply'd at all
times. Or else the Cavern may be so
straight and narrow, that the water not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56220:23"/>
having so ready and free passage through
it, cannot upon so short and quick muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of pressure, be able to produce any
sensible effect at such a distance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that to confirm this hypothesis,
there are many Examples found in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Historians, of Springs that do ebb
and flow like the Sea: As particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those recorded by the Learned
<hi>Camden,</hi> and after him by <hi>Speed,</hi> to
be found in this Island: One of which,
they relate to be on the Top of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
by the small Village. <hi>Kilken</hi> in
<hi>Flintshire, Maris aemulus qui statis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
suas revomit &amp; resorbet Aquas;</hi>
which at certain times riseth and falleth
after the manner of Sea-Tides. A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in <hi>Caermardenshire,</hi> near <hi>Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
at a place call'd <hi>Cantred Bichan;
Qui (ut scribit Giraldus) naturali die
bis undis deficiens, &amp; toties exuberans,
marinas imitatur instabilitates.</hi> That
twice in four and twenty hours ebbing
and flowing, resembleth the uustable
Motions of the Sea. The <hi>Phanomena</hi>
of which two may be easily made out,
by supposing their Cavern by which
they are fed, to arise from the bottom
of the next Sea. A Third, is a Well
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56220:24"/>
upon the River <hi>Ogmore,</hi> in <hi>Glamorgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
and near unto <hi>Newton,</hi> of which
<hi>Camhden</hi> relates himself to be certified,
by a Letter from a Learned Friend of
his that observed it, <hi>Fons abest hinc,</hi> &amp;c.
The Letter is a little too long to be
inserted, but the substance is this, that
this Well ebbs and flows quite contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the flowing and ebbing of the Sea
in those parts: for 'tis almost empty at
Full Sea, but full at Low water. This
may happen from the Channel by which
it is supplied, which may come from the
bottom of a Sea very remote from those
parts, and where the Tides are much
differing from those of the approximate
shores. A Fourth lies in <hi>Westmerland,</hi>
near the River <hi>Loder; Qui instar Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi
saepius in die reciprocantibus undis fluit
&amp; refluit,</hi> which ebbs and flows many
times a day. This may proceed from
its being supply'd from many Channels,
coming from several parts of the Sea, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sufficiently distant asunder to have
the times of High-Water differing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
one from the other; so as that
whensoever it shall be High Water over
any of those places where these Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
begin, it shall likewise be so in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56220:24"/>
Well. But this is but a Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>A Seventh thing was, Whether in
general the Glutinousness of most bodies
may not be partly attributed to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty!
For supposing glutinous bodies
to be such as will easily conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the superficies of homogeneal
bodies, and being suffered for some time
to rest in that Position, until they grow
hard, the intercourse of the Air or other
fluid body being hindred, the force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to disjoyn those two superficies
must necessarily be such as is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate
and prevail against the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Air upon a superficies equal
to that of the body which is toucht by
the glutinous substance; for these two
touch so exactly, that 'tis impossible
for the Air to get between, until they
are somwhat disjoyn'd, by which means
the pressure of the Air can only be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the two outward sides opposite to
those which joyn them together: This
may be confirmed by the Experiment of
two flat Marbles, pieces of Glass, and
the like smooth bodies; for if they be
so exactly plain, that by rubbing them
together, you can detrude the interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

hard, that an ordinary strength can
hardly separate them; especially if they
be of any bigness.</p>
            <p>This Property I say, may at least
be the cause why some bodies adhere to
Glass, and the like: For I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that as for Wood, and many
other porous bodies, the glutinous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
may penetrate into their little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
and so hardning, become little
Hooks or Buttons, that may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to the former Cohesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>An Eighth Query was, Whether the
dissolution or mixing of several bodies,
whether fluid or solid, with saline or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Liquors, might not partly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to this Principle of the congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of those bodies and their dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents?
As of Salt in water, Metals in
several Menstruums, Unctuous Gums
in Oyles, the Mixing of Wine and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whether precipitation
be not partly made from the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Incongruity? I say partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there are in some dissolutions,
some other Causes concurrent.</p>
            <p>I shall lastly make a much more seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56220:25"/>
strange and unlikely Query; and
that is, Whether this Principle well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
and explain'd, may not be found
a co-efficient in the most considerable
Operations of Nature? As in those of
Heat and Light, and consequently, of
Rarefaction and Condensation, Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Solidity and Fluidness, Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
and Opacousness, Refractions and
Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there may be many things done in
Nature, in which this may not (be
said to) have a Finger? This I may
possibly further enquire into and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
if God grant me Life and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.
In the mean time, I would
not be thought guilty of that Errour,
which the thrice Noble and Learned
<hi>Verulam</hi> justly takes notice of, as such,
and cals <hi>Philosophiae Genus Empiricum,
quod in paucorum Experimentorum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustiis
&amp; Obscuritate fundatum est.</hi> For
I neither conclude from one single Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
nor are the Experiments I
make use of, all made upon one Subject:
Nor wrest I any Experiment to make it
<hi>quadrare</hi> with any preconceiv'd Notion.
But on the contrary, I endeavour to be
conversant in all kind of Experiments,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56220:26"/>
and all and every one of those Trials, I
make the standards (as I may say) or
Touchstones by which I try all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Notions, whether they hold not
in weight and measure and touch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
For as that Body is no other than a
Counterfeit Gold, which wants any
one of the Proprieties of Gold, (such as
are the Malleableness, Weight, Colour,
Fixtness in the Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indissolubleness
in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and the like.) though
it has all the other; so will all those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
be found to be false and deceitful,
that will not undergo all the Trials
and Tests made of them by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And therefore such as will not
come up to the desired Apex of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I rather wholly reject and take a
new, than by piecing and patching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to retain the old, as knowing
old things to be rather made worse by
mending, than better. And this course
I learn'd from Nature; whom we find
neglectful of the old Body, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Decaies and Infirmities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without repair, and altogether sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
and careful of perpetuating the

            <p>The Application of it is obvious, and
therefore (to digress no further from
the consideration of the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi>
more immediatly explicable by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment)
we shall proceed to shew,
That,</p>
            <p>As to the rising of water in a Filtre,
the reason of it will be manifest to him
that does take notice that a Filtre is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
of a great number of small long
solid bodies, which lie so close together,
that the Air in its getting in between
them, doth lose of its pressure that it
has against the fluid without them, by
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56220:27"/>
which means the water or liquor not
finding so strong a resistance between
them as is able to counter ballance the
pressure on its superficies without, is
raised upwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, till it meet with a pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Air which is able to hinder
it. And as to the Rising of Oyl, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Tallow, Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the
Weeck of a Candle or Lamp, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that it differs in nothing from the
former, save only in this, that in a Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
the Liquor descends and runs away
by another part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the Weeck
the Liquor is dispersed and carried away
by the Flame (which what it is, and
how it consumes bodies, I shall on
some other occasion by many luciferous
Experiments manifestly prove) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there is ascribable to the heat,
for that it may rarifie the more volatil
and spirituous parts of those combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Liquors, and so being made lighter
than the Air, it may be protruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by that more ponderous fluid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the Form of Vapours. But this
can be ascribed to the ascension of but a
very little, and most likely of that only
which ascends without the Weeck, as
for the Rising of it in a Spunge, Bread,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56220:28"/>
Cotton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above the superficies of
the subjacent Liquor; what has been
said about the Filtre (if considered)
will easily suggest a reason, considering
that all these bodies are bound with
small holes or pores.</p>
            <p>From this same Principle also <hi>(viz.)</hi> the
unequal pressure of the Air against the
unequal superficies of the water) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the cause of the accession or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any floating body against the
sides of the containing Vessel, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propinquation
of two floating bodies, as
Bubbles, Corks, Sticks, Straws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
one towards another. As for instance,
Take a Glass-jar, such as (A. B.) in
the 7th. Figure, and filling it pretty
near the top with water, throw into it
a small round piece of Cork, as (C.) and
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unge it all over in water, that it be
wet, so as that the water may rise up
by the sides of it, then placing it any
where upon the superficies, about an
inch, or one Inch and a quarter from any
side, and you shall perceive it by degrees
to make perpendicularly toward the
nearest part of the side, and the nearer
it approaches it, the faster to be mov'd;
the reason of which <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> will be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56220:28"/>
found no other than this, that the Air
has a greater pressure against the middle
of the superficies, than it has against
those parts that approach nearer, and are
contiguous to the sides. Now that the
pressure is not so much, may (as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before in the explication of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
Figure) be evinced from the rising of the
water near the sides, higher than that in
the middle: Hence the Ball having a
stronger pressure against that side of it
which respects the middle of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,
than against that which respects
the approximate side, must necessarily
move towards that part from whence it
finds least resistance, and so be accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as the resistance decreases. Hence
the more the water is raised under that
part of its way it is passing above the
middle, the faster it is moved: And
therefore you will find it to move faster
in E. than in D. and in D. than in C.
Neither could I find the floating sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to be moved at all, until it were
placed upon some part of the Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
that was sensibly elevated above the
height of the middle part. Now that
this may be the true cause, you may
try with a blown Bladder, and an exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56220:29"/>
ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Ball upon a very smooth Table.
For if the Ball be plac'd under a part of
the Bladder w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is upon one side of the
middle of its pressure, &amp; you press strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the Bladder, you shall find the
Ball mov'd from the middle towards the
sides. Having therefore shewn the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the motion of any float towards
the sides, the reason of the incursion of
any two floating bodies will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
For the rising of the water against
the sides of either of them, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sufficient, to shew the pressure of
the Air to be there less, then it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from it, where it is not so much
elevated; and therefore the reason of
the motion of the other toward it, will
be the same as towards the side of the
Glass; only here from the same reason,
they are mutually mov'd toward each
other, whereas the side of the Glass in
the former remains fixt. If also you gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fill the Jar so full with water, that
the water is protuberant above the sides,
of the same piece of Cork that before did
hasten towards the sides, does now fly
from it as fast towards the middle of the
Superficies; the reason of which will be
found no other then this, that the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56220:29"/>
of the Air is stronger against the
sides of the superficies G. and H. then
against the middle I. which may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd
from its being much lower then the
middle; and therefore the consecution
will be the same as in the former. It is
very odd to one that considers not the
reason of it, to see two bodies of wood
to approach each other, as though they
were indued with some magnetical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;
which brings into my mind what
I formerly tried with a piece of Cork or
such like body, which I so ordered, that
by putting a little stick into the same
water, one part of the said Cork would
approach and make toward the stick,
whereas another would discede and fly
away, nay it would have a kind of verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
so as that if the aequator (as I may
so speak) of the Cork were placed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the stick, if let alone, it would
instantly turn its appropriate pole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it, and then run a tilt at it, and
this was only by taking a dry Cork, and
wetting one side of it with one small
stroak; for by this means gently put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it upon the water, it would depress
the superficies on every side of it that
was dry, and therefore the greatest pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56220:30"/>
of the Air being near those sides caus'd it
either to chase away, or else to fly off from any
other floting body, whereas that side only against
which the water ascended, was thereby able to
attract. I cannot here stay to explain the
Reasons of magnetical and electrical attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor the Reasons of gravity or magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
direction and variation, they being little
or nothing at all to my present Subject, and
besides, will afford matter enough to fill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sheet when I have leisure.</p>
            <p>It remains only, that I should determine
now high the water or other Liquor may by
this means be raised in a smaller Pipe above the
superficies of that without it: But to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this, will be exceeding difficult, unless I
could certainly know how much of the Air's
pressure is taken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the smalness of such
and such a Pipe, and whether it may be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken off, that is, whether there can be a
hole or pore so small, into which Air could not
at all enter, though water might with its whole
force, for were there such, 'tis manifest, that
the water might rise in it to some five or six
and thirty English Foot high. I know not
whether there may not be such natural Pipes
in the bodies of small Trees, which we usually
call their Pores, But I have already pretergres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the bounds of a Sheet, which I at first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
my self for the explication of this <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi>
and therefore I shall at present make</p>
