            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Her Love was certainly articled and agreed on by the old man her father. But let us find somewhat else to entertain the time withal. And now I think of it, what was that Gentlewoman who was there last night in the Sky coloured Satten Gown?</p>

                  <p>Why? A female wit is a strange prodigious kind of thing, it frights off all that have no wit, and they that have will never come on, except it be for an Afternoon or so, to exercise their tongues. I have been out of conceit with it ever since I heard a Gentleman say, that he was going to a Lady that I know, a reputed wit, to prepare him for a Visit to his Mistris. Fye upon it, a thing fit for nothing, but to make one a common courting stock. I hate the very thought of it.</p>

I needs must say, he has this happinesse, that if he excel in ought, it is in things of that familiar nature, that each place and company he comes in, afford him opportunity to shew it. And this certainly is the only thing that makes him make a greater blaze then some of far more worth, whose eminence lying in that which is more choice, cannot so frequently discover it self, nor is their value prostituted unto every eye; but they, as great Bels, who are not easily nor on all slight occasions raised, yet being up, will far out sound any of these tinckling ting-tang blades.—Would heaven alot me but such a one to spend my time withal, it would be what I most desire; but yet I think I shall scarce run that odious fortune of a stale Maid in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a blessing. <stage>Enter Maid.</stage>

He cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then is hers; me thinks the very thought of that should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to master these desires; for usually Objects, though ne're so pleasing, if not probable, searce stir the mind; for since we all are rational, it were absurd our wills should act in vain. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when things with ease may be attained, we never give over until we are arrived at the utmost of our wishes. Thus nothing is more ordinary then for my Lady to love her Gentleman, or Mrs. <hi>Anne</hi> her fathers man. But if a Country Clowne coming up hither, and seeking for his Lawyer in Grayes Inne, should step into the Walks, and there should chance to spye some Master-piece of Nature, some fam'd Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that for a time hath born the name, he would stand amazed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps wish that his <hi>Ione</hi> were such, but farther would not be stirred, impossibility would stop more bold desires, and quench those sparks that else would turne to fires. But I without the remedy of hope, even in despair, begin a love that promiseth nought but grief and endlesse teares. But here he comes with my Cozen, I will stand and hear what they say. <stage>Enter Welbred and Crisis.</stage>

                  <p>Well Cozen, if you will help me, I will venture on it then. And to begin, Sir this Gentleman (as I have said) although he doth appear ridiculous enough, yet in my opinion not so much by nature as unlucky chance: for as when some common metals will serve for good substantial use, yet if you strive to force them to more curious shapes, they only such rude draughts will take as will render them more deformed: So this Gentleman (had his courser soul but had the luck to have acted in some downright way, to have managed some plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Trade) he might by long experience have understood himselfe within his Sphere; nay, have had wit enough to have got a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and through the repute of that, have been look'd upon by the world as wise; but this by his fathers industry being left to his hand, the common course of the world, unhappily doth fling him upon things fit only for more refined minds; which although he cannot master, yet some odde grudges and imperfect stamps have transformed him from what he was, nor can he be what he would.</p>

                  <p>So (Sir) that some laugh at him, some wonder, as one would at some monstrous thing; some, indigested vain attempt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <speaker>Cris</speaker>
                  <p>And first Sir, his Fortunes enabling him to keep variety of company; he hears indeed all sorts of wit enough, but that being a thing too subtile for his soul, naught stayes with him, but some few words and phrases, which he rudely plucking from that natural chaine that linck'd them with appropriating circumstances, shew very strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                  <p>Not much unlike (Lady) the relicks of those species, which (although in a methodick way, and by the discursive hints of thought are represented to the mind, yet) in a dream appear with casual conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the fancie making absurd contradictions, whilst at one act it doth rethink things treasured up in different time and place.</p>

Clapt up in the Fleet for forty shillings, that thou owedst in Ram-Alley for chippings of bread and porrage, when thou, Camelion like, hadst for some dayes lived by nothing but aire, and wert just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving into thy first principles? Did not I pay this dribling debt for thee, set thee free, and since have made thee the man thou art? I must confesse, I saw a good hopeful cozening countenance in thee, that did promise much.</p>

                  <p>Sir, for my part I could wish our habits were as constant as the course of nature, nor that we had more change of dress then birds or trees; but this I can but wish; for we see the generall humour of the world ever yet has been so set upon the contrary, that one can scarce discreetly hope it; nay, hee that would but a little strictly enquire and search into our natures, and mark how prone and apt they are for variety and change, might almost demonstrate its impossibility; for certainly, as long as in the world there are men of severall qualities and degrees, the inferiour, and more base will imitate the waies of those of better ranke, and strive to intrench upon, and gaine their customes; which being no sooner got by the one, but the other will despise them, and seek for new. Seeing then these alterations are so unavoidable, without doubt, it wil more become one in a moderate way to yeild unto, then vainely to oppose them. For whatsoever the riged do pretend, there is nothing can more argue a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick humor, or self-conceited pride, then with ones single whimseys to oppose what is received by the generality.</p>

                  <speaker>Old Cris.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true Sir, I needs must yeeld thus far, for I should condemn her of the height of folly, should shee oppose the general use in things that are indifferent: but that I chiefly blame her is, for certaine knacks and fashions, which although in common use and custome, yet not being decent and comely in themselves, must needs be unlawfull.</p>

                  <speaker>Know.</speaker>
                  <p>That, Sir, is impossible; for custome is the very square and rule of what is decent, and what not; indecency being nothing else but that harsh discord that any thing doth make, if it doth chance to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the common course of things, and certainly, the soundest judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wil not hold any habit to be simply in its self unlawfull. Thus much, indeed, must be granted, that some attires, by being first used by (and therefore being reckoned for the badges of) the vainer and more fantastick sort, may from them acquire some accidentall scandall, which afterwards (they growing into use, with the sober and more staid) by the same reason they must needs mew and let fall.</p>

And I would faine know that man could give me a solid reason of this difference besides common custome.

                  <p>You see, Sir, <hi>I</hi> am a woman, one of the most undervalued Creatures living; we never yet by any polity were allowed to meddle with any thing but a needle: We are not esteemed to know ought of rational but our wills; nay, some will not allow us for to know our wills.

                  <p>Sir, you did a little mistake me, for (as I think) I never did yet any thing that might encourage you to speak in this nature. So truly, thereby I needs must say, I did not intend to destroy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hopes you have conceived of me; for that which I was a going to say, (had you but given me leave) was only this:</p>
                  <p>Suppose me Mistris of all the Wit and Parts that ever yet was incident to our Sex,</p>
                  <p>And (now I am supposing of such impossible things) suppose me (as you just now said) yours; what were that to you more then to all the world? for you could as well hope to appropriate the Air as such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments. The Sun it self doth not afford more general and communicative influence then they would do.</p>
                  <p>Nay, perhaps as we now are, you might more enjoy such qualities; for what would wit in a wife serve for, but to interfere with yours. Nor have they been esteemed unwise, whom I have heard say, they could well spare all Judgment in one of that relation, save what were requisite to a handsome dresse, or so.—</p>

                  <p>I am so far, Lady, from thinking so, that were that realwhich you now supposed, the greatest Epicure could not more enjoy what e're his sensual appetite doth prompt him to, then I should those perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your mind; for then we should not only be linked in that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical knot, nor with those more natural tyes and charmes, as you are woman or fair; but certainly we should close in that stricter conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of friend and friend, the greatest cement possible 'twixt humane souls.</p>
                  <p>And where it joines us with the more refin'd minds, it is a happinesse that the super-errogating Saint in his boldest error could never hope to merit. For to have one who as my better Genius, might regulate even in their first matter my imparted thoughts. What can be a greater bliss?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57363:25"/>Or if I had any thing of worth or value in me, to have such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient judge and witnesse, would almost imitate the pleasure that some in the thought of an all-knowing Deity, can in any mis-construed action solace themselves against the opinion of the world.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I know some kind of Madam, who perhaps, having some not unhappy vaine which a little too much taking with the world, might drive her into strange conceits of what shee scarce can tell, and make her prove as troublesome and crosse, as sometimes are the winds, and have as various and fantastick waies: but wee should no more thwart or differ from each other, then truth would doe from truth, the waies of judgment and discretion being as certaine and demonstrative: wee should anticipate each others thoughts, our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions would be as harmonious as are those of Ants or Bees, as if by some secret law of nature we were designed to carry on some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worke: what say you, Lady, should we not? shall I ever enjoy in you this happinesse?</p>

                  <p>You should have asked, what was the newest fashion, who had the finest gowne, or the handsomest dresse; for these are things wee women onely mark: This Gent. I believe, would better have resolved you that question.—</p>
                  <p>What say you Mr. <hi>Know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well,</hi> which was the handsomest Lady that you saw there?</p>

                  <speaker>Know.</speaker>
                  <p>That, Lady, would be a very difficult business to determine, I should rather chuse me a Mrs. by her picture, or as the <hi>Italians,</hi> they say, do, through a window, and thinke my self subject unto lesse deceit.</p>

                  <p>When one sees, Lady, nothing but a face, and that dress'd up unto the height, I might as well Judge of a book by the fine Greeke title; the Vardingales had not so much imposture; give me a place where I may see and Judge of all dimensions.</p>
                  <p>I remember I mark'd a Lady there whom I have seene somewhere before, she is one (Ladies) that hath the strangest antick shape as ever nature in her greatest whimsey was Author of.</p>
                  <p>But as sometimes you shall see a pretty neat device carved on a knotty crab-tree stick, her face, I must confesse, is not much amisse, for as she order'd the business with her advantageous sitting in the Coach, she was the only shining planet, as you say, that drew all eyes upon her.</p>

                  <p>She had indeed a good complexion, and I believe right; besides, a pretty innocent look, as if she meant no hurt, and pitty it were to do her any. And although shee have some features which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact rule are not esteemed handsome, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there is somewhat in her face, will force one to believe them pleasing.</p>

                  <p>Yes, that I do, and truly shee will serve well enough, only me thinks she has a kind of sullen look, as if she would be angry, if the artillery of her eyes should fail.</p>

                  <p>The truth of it is, I have done some things, more for to satisfie my wants, then through my own desires.

                  <p>That (Sir) in my mind, if you be in earnest, is somewhat strange; for although that the chance of dice is certain in it self, and doth (as all other things of chance) depend on sure and natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; yet these causes either being unknown to us, or else not in our power, their effects must needs to us, before they come to pass, be also unknown; and from this ignorance, if thereby we are concerned, must needs arise a certain strife and Altercation of hopes and fears, which with no little pleasure doth affect the soul.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, all pleasures by providence being created for our better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may rationally enough be (if but discreetly) used.</p>
                  <p>From hence it followes, that one may not only play at D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <speaker>La.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true, Sir, if one venture no more; but to venture so much, as that the losse thereof may m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But, Sir, then said he, ones estate and fortune, being the principal thing that makes one to be valued in the world, I cannot certainly more rationally imply the force and vigour of my wit, then about that.</p>

                  <p>Well, Gentlemen will you refer the businesse to me, upon that condition, that I do please you all?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>1.</speaker>
                  <p>I, Sir, upon that condition; but we shall not be pleased without our money.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iust.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, then I order you to give them their money.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Slur.</speaker>
                  <p>But then we shall not be pleased.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iust.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, but you shall: for now I am resolved upon a design, which I hope will be as good as building Hospitals.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, by the carriage of this businesse, I see you have more in you then ever I did take you for to have. And although you have been wild in your time, yet now I believe you would know how to value an estate.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, as for you Mr. <hi>Had- Land,</hi> what you have gotten by this device from me, I freely will let you enjoy.</p>
                  <p>And for these Gentlemen, I will give them that which shall maintaine them like themselves without these shifts.</p>
                  <p>To be short, Gentlemen, I have an Estate and never a child, and if you henceforward do nothing that may displease me more then this your dayes work hath done, I shall not be wanting in any thing that you may expect from a father. What, doth this please you?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Slur.</speaker>
                  <p>Beyond our expectation.</p>

                  <p>We, Sir, shall never be able to deserve this.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iust.</speaker>
