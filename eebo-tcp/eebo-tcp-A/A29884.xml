            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CASE of ALLEGIANCE
TO A
KING
IN
POSSESSION.</head>
            <p>BY the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> may be meant, Firſt, The
Perſon who is inveſted with the Regal <hi>Authority.</hi>
Secondly, The Perſon who has the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the
Government in his Hands. The King in Poſſeſſion in the
former Senſe, is only the King <hi>de Jure, i. e.</hi> he that has
the true <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Crown;</hi> for he is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inveſted with the Regal Authority upon the Death
of his Predeceſſor, before he is either Crowned or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed;
and though he be excluded or depoſed from the
<hi>exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> by a Rebellion or Uſurpation, yet
he is not thereupon deveſted of his <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is of the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> in the other
Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Perſon who has the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in his hands: Whether though he be not King <hi>de
Jure</hi> but an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> and ſo has not the Regal <hi>Authority,</hi> yet
in as much as he has the <hi>execution</hi> of the Kingly <hi>Office,</hi> the
<hi>Subjects,</hi> are bound to bear <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him. To
ſtate which Queſtion exactly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53596:3"/>
Firſt, It is not meant of this caſe, namely, where there is
<hi>No Perſon ſurviving</hi> who has the <hi>Right</hi> to the Crown; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in an Hereditary Monarchy the whole Royal Line were
<hi>Extinct:</hi> Becauſe here there is no diſpute but the ſubjects may,
and ought to bear Faith and true, Allegiance to the <hi>King in
Poſſeſſion,</hi> though he came in at firſt by <hi>Uſurpation:</hi> For the
whole Royal Line being Extinct, the Subjects are at liberty
to give themſelves up to the <hi>Uſurper</hi> and his Line; and this it
may be their Duty to do, to prevent that Bloodſhed and
Confuſion which may follow upon their atten pring to ſet up
another Perſon or Government; and when they have thus
given themſelves up to the Uſurper, he becomes from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and all Faith and Allegiance becomes
due to him. <hi>V. Sanderſon de Conſcient Praelect.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is the Queſtion meant of this caſe,
where there is one or more who pretend a Title to the
Crown, beſides the Poſſeſſor, but it is not <hi>clear</hi> who has the
true <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title:</hi> For here alſo it is not diſputed but the
Subjects, while they don't know who has the Right, are to
pay their Allegiance to the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion;</hi> and the Reaſon
is not barely becauſe he is King in Poſſeſſion, but becauſe he
being in Poſſeſſion, and no better Title appearing, his Title is
preſumed to be Juſt and Lawful, and ſo he is ſuppoſed to be
King not only <hi>de Facto,</hi> but <hi>de Jure,</hi> till it do appear that
ſome other Perſon has a better Right to the Crown. And this,
according to the old-Rule, <hi>in Ribus dubus melior eſt Conditio
Poſſidentis.</hi> V. Sarderſon de Conſc Prae 5 Sect. 15. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Queſtion is properly meant of this Caſe, where
a King, whoſe Right to the Crown is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>undoubted,</hi> is
Excluded or Depoſed by an Uſerper: Whether then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are to bear Faith and Allegiance to the Uſurper, as
<hi>King in Poſſeſſion;</hi> and here it may be granted,</p>
            <p>1. That the Subjects may lawfully pay a Submiſſion and
Obedience under the Uſurper, as to all thoſe Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which tend to the Preſervation and Welfare of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
and are not <hi>diſtructive</hi> of the <hi>King de Jure's</hi> Right
and Intereſt; as for inſtance, The <hi>Laws</hi> made by the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the publick Good, the <hi>defence</hi> of the Nation againſt a
<hi>Forreign Invaſion</hi> (not made in beha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f of the King <hi>de Jure)</hi> the
execution of <hi>Juſtice, Trade,</hi> &amp;c. They may lawfully ſubmit to,
and obey theſe Acts of Government under the Uſurper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53596:3"/>
this is <hi>no renouncing</hi> of their Allegiance to their <hi>lawful</hi>
King, nor acting againſt his <hi>real</hi> Intereſt; but is conſiſtent
with their acting ſtill, all that they are capable to do, in the
preſent circumſtances, for the reſtoring of their <hi>lawful King,</hi>
and dethroning the Uſurper: Nay, they may be obliged in
<hi>Duty</hi> to pay an Obedience to the Acts of the Uſurper, in
things of this Nature; not by virtue of any Authority in the
Uſurper, but, Firſt, For their own Safety and Advantage.
Secondly, For the good of the Community. Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe Acts of Government, done by the Uſurper, are
ratified by the Authority of the lawful King, he being to be
preſumed to Will and Conſent to whatever is done for the
publick Good, and not againſt his own Intereſt, though
done by his Enemy, <hi>U. Sanderſ de Conſcient. Prael.</hi> 5 <hi>Sect.</hi> 17,
18, &amp;c. He adds another Ground of this Obligation, the
<hi>Protection</hi> the Subjects have from the Uſurper; but I think
this lays no obligation upon them, but in point of <hi>Prudence</hi>
for their own Safety; for they cannot be obliged to him in
<hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Gratitude</hi> for his Protection, who deprives them of
a more <hi>legal</hi> Protection from their rightful King.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Neither is it diſputed, but the Subjects (while
they have not <hi>number</hi> or <hi>force</hi> to oppoſe the Uſurper) may
<hi>ſit down quietly,</hi> and not make any <hi>reſiſtance</hi> againſt ſuch Acts
of Government, as are contrary to the Right and Intereſt
of their lawful King, becauſe their making any oppoſition
without ſufficient Force would be only to throw away
their Lives, and loſe the King <hi>de Jure</hi> ſo many Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who might be ready to act for his Service upon a fair
opportunity. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The point in diſpute is, whether the Subjects
may and ought to pay a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>entire</hi> Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Uſurper; ſo as never to attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him while he is in Poſſeſſion <hi>in behalf of the King de
Jure,</hi> upon the faireſt occaſion; but on the contrary to <hi>ſtand
by him, even againſt the King</hi> de Jure <hi>himſelf, with their Lives
and Fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Affirmative is maintained now upon theſe Grounds.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Authority of our greateſt Lawyers, who make
Treaſon to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e only againſt the King in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> whether he
be <hi>King de Jure</hi> or no, and not againſt a <hi>King out of Poſſeſſion,</hi>
though he be the <hi>King de Jure.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53596:4"/>
Secondly, The Statute (11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1.) which makes the
Allegiance of the Subjects due to the King <hi>for the time being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Authority of our Lawyers. The Lawyers quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for this Opinion are the Lords Chief Juſtices, <hi>Coke, Hale,</hi>
&amp;c. The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale</hi> ſays it in his <hi>Pleas of the
Crown</hi> p. 12. But then it is much doubted whether <hi>that
Piece be his:</hi> and he himſelf may be juſtly looked upon to be
of <hi>another Opinion</hi> in this point; becauſe he would never be
brought to try any<note n="a" place="margin">See his Life, by Dr. <hi>Burnet, p.</hi> 36, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Treaſons,</hi> or other <hi>Offences againſt the
State,</hi> when he was <hi>Judge</hi> under <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays it in his <hi>Inſtitut.</hi> Part 3d. p. 7. in his
Comment upon the Words <hi>[Seignior le Roy]</hi> in the <hi>Statute of
Treaſon</hi> (25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) by which words he ſays is to be
underſtood the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though he be <hi>King de Facta</hi>
and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> and not the <hi>King out of Poſſeſſion,</hi> though he
<hi>be the King de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Acts declared <hi>Treaſon</hi> in that Statute are, <hi>To compaſs
the Death of the King, Queen, or Prince: To Raviſh the Queen,
or the King's Eldeſt Daughter, or the Prince's Wife. To Levy
War againſt the King, or to be adherent to his Enemies, giving them
aid or comfort: To Counterfeit the Great or the Privy Seal, or the
King's Coin: To kill the Chancellor, Treaſurer, Judges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in
the Execution of their Office.</hi> The ſenſe therefore of my Lord
<hi>Coke's</hi> Aſſertion is, That theſe Acts are <hi>Treaſon</hi> when they are
committed againſt a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> whether he be <hi>King
de Jure</hi> or no; and not Treaſon when they are committed
againſt a <hi>King</hi> out of <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> though <hi>he be King de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I <hi>examine</hi> the grounds of his Aſſertion, I ſhall firſt
ſtate the point of Controverſy. The Queſtion therefore is
not, Whether ſome of theſe Acts may not be puniſhed as
Treaſon under an Uſurper, if they are committed againſt the
neceſſary Order of Government, and not done for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring</hi>
of the <hi>King de Jure</hi> to his Crown, or promoting <hi>his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:</hi>
For the Subiects are obliged to pay a Submiſſion and
Obedience to the Uſurper, as to all Acts of Government that
are not <hi>deſtructive</hi> of the <hi>King de Jure's Rights and intereſt;</hi> and
therefore if herein they oppoſe or diſturb the Government,
they may by the Law be adjudged <hi>Traytors,</hi> and puniſhed as
ſuch Thus therefore it may be Treaſon under an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To Counterfeit or Clip his Coin, or to Counterfeit his Broad
Seal, or Privy Seal, or to kill a Judge ſiting upon the Bench;</hi> ſome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53596:4"/>
theſe Offences touch not the Perſon or Intereſt of the Uſurper
but the Order of Government: and as it is juſt that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Government ſhould proceed under an Uſurper, ſo it
is juſt that theſe Acts againſt the Government ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
as well as Robbery, Murder, and the like, as Offences
not againſt the Uſurper, but the <hi>Lawful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To Levy War against him, or to be adherent to his
Enemies, or to compaſs his Death,</hi> out of a private <hi>ſeditious</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and not out of any regard to the Right and Intereſt
of the Lawful <hi>King;</hi> as ſuppoſe any Man ſhould practice
with a Forreign Prince to Invade the Nation, (not in the
Lawful <hi>King's</hi> behalf,) or ſhould betray any Fort or Caſtle,
or any part of the Country to him, or the like; for theſe
alſo are Offences not ſo much againſt the Perſon and Intereſt
of the Uſurper, as againſt the courſe of the Government,
and ſtrike (through the Perſon of the Uſurper) at the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Authority of the Lawful <hi>King;</hi> and in that regard
may be juſtly looked upon and puniſhed as Treaſon. So the
Swearing falſly, though by an <hi>Idol,</hi> may be looked upon and
puniſhed as <hi>Perjury,</hi> becauſe it terminates upon the Majeſty
of <hi>the true God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this may be granted, and yet it does not follow
that the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Subjects ought or may be paid to
the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> if he be an <hi>Uſurper;</hi> for ſtill their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
and Obedience to him is <hi>limited</hi> with a reſerve to the
Right and Intereſt of the <hi>Lawful King.</hi> The Queſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt be, Whether it be Treaſon to act <hi>againſt the Uſurper
in</hi> Poſſeſſion, <hi>for the Right and Intereſt of the King</hi> de Jure <hi>out
of Poſſeſſion,</hi> to be adherent to the <hi>King de Jure,</hi> to give him
and his Party Aid and Comfort, and to Levy War againſt
the Uſurper, for the reſtoring of the <hi>King de Jure</hi> to his
Crown? And whether it is not Treaſon to <hi>be adherent to the
Uſurper, and to Fight for him againſt the</hi> King de Jure <hi>out of
Poſſeſſion?</hi> This therefore muſt be that which my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
lays down for <hi>Law,</hi> where he Aſſerts that <hi>Treaſon lies only
againſt the King in Poſſeſſion.</hi> I ſhall proceed therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the grounds of his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>It is indeed true in <hi>Fact,</hi> that the Acts declared to be Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. will be adjuged and puniſhed
as Treaſon under <hi>every King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> whether he be <hi>King
de Jure</hi> or no; for though he be an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> yet while he is in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53596:5"/>
the Throne, the <hi>Laws, Courts of Judicature,</hi> and every thing
elſe is made to favour his ſide, as much as if he were the
moſt <hi>Lawful and Rightful King.</hi> His Party are held to be
the <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> in the Eye of the Law, and the adverſe
Party <hi>Rebels and Traytors.</hi> So the <hi>Laws</hi> may be fitly compared
to the <hi>Banks</hi> caſt up againſt the Sea, which are made to <hi>keep
out an Inundation,</hi> but when once the Water is got over them,
<hi>they keep it in:</hi> In like manner the Laws are made to <hi>prevent
an Uſurpation,</hi> but when once an Uſurper is got into the
Throne, then they are made to become a <hi>Fence</hi> to him to
<hi>keep in Poſseſſion</hi> of it. Now there is hardly any <hi>Monarchy</hi>
wherein there have been more Uſurpations then there have
been in <hi>Ours;</hi> and it ought not to be ſtrange if in all theſe the
Uſurpers took upon them to act as <hi>Lawful Kings,</hi> and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was paid to them as ſuch by the Major part of the
Nation, at leaſt, while they continued in the Throne; and
thoſe that ſtood by them (againſt the King <hi>de Jure</hi> whoſe
Rights they had Uſurped) were looked upon as <hi>Faithful and
Loyal Subjects,</hi> and rewarded accordingly; and thoſe that
roſe up againſt them (in <hi>behalf</hi> of their <hi>Rightful</hi> Kings) were
declared <hi>Traytors and Rebels,</hi> and puniſhed as ſuch; and ſo
the whole courſe of the Government ran on their ſide. They
called <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and then the <hi>Laws</hi> were made in favour
of their Title; they made the <hi>Judges,</hi> and no wonder then if
<hi>all the Laws,</hi> as well as the Sat. 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
<hi>in their Favour,</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi> lay in their <hi>own Courts
againſt them only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But its being always thus <hi>in Fact,</hi> is no iuſt Ground for
any Man to declare it to be ſo <hi>in point of Right,</hi> and to give
it <hi>for Law</hi> that <hi>Treaſon is only againſt the King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> or an <hi>Uſurper.</hi> We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take leave to examine whether there be any better
Grounds for this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>It would ſeem a <hi>very odd Question</hi> for any to ask, touching
the Laws which are made in any <hi>ſetled Monarchy</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the <hi>King's Perſon, Crown, and Dignity,</hi> who is meant
by the <hi>King</hi> in thoſe Laws? The <hi>Lawful and Rightful King</hi> of
that Realm, or <hi>any one</hi> that gets into the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the
Throne, though he be not the <hi>Rightful</hi> King but an Uſurper?
<hi>Common Senſe</hi> would hardly allow ſuch a <hi>Queſtion to be put:</hi>
For the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and not an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> is <hi>Truly and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53596:5"/>
King,</hi> and therefore (if the Words of a Law are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
in their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Proper Senſe)</hi> the Word <hi>King</hi>
cannot be underſtood to mean an Uſurper, unleſs with an
<hi>expreſs limitation</hi> to determine it to that Senſe. Beſides, the
Law is made for the <hi>defence of Right,</hi> and therefore cannot
be underſtood to be deſigned for the <hi>Security and Settlement</hi> of
an Uſurpation, but made to <hi>prevent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I granted <hi>above,</hi> That there may be <hi>ſome</hi> Acts committed
againſt the Perſon and Government of an Uſurper, which
the Law may juſtly condemn and puniſh as <hi>Treaſon;</hi> as
<hi>ſwearing falſely</hi> by an <hi>Idol</hi> may be juſtly looked upon as <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi>
and will by the <hi>true God</hi> himſelf be puniſhed as ſuch. But
if (becauſe ſome Acts againſt an Uſurper may be puniſhed as
Treaſon) a <hi>Lawyer</hi> may make this <hi>comment</hi> upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Treaſon, that by [our Lord the King] is meant
only the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> whether he be King <hi>de Jure</hi> or
no; I think a <hi>Divine</hi> (upon the other Ground that ſwearing
falſely by an Idol may be puniſhed as Perjury) may as well
make this <hi>gloſs</hi> upon the <hi>Third Commandment,</hi> that by <hi>[the
Lord thy God]</hi> is meant there the <hi>God in Poſſeſſion,</hi> he that is
Worſhiped in the Land, whether he be the <hi>true God or not.</hi>
But to ſhew what are my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> Grounds for his gloſs,
I ſhall ſet it down in his own Words, with the references he
makes in the Margin to the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Year Books</hi> of our
<hi>Law Caſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Act is to be underſtood of a King in Poſſeſſion of the Crown
and Kingdom;<note place="margin">V. 11 H. 7.</note> for if there be a King regnant in Poſſeſſion, though
he be <hi>Rex de Facto &amp; non de Jure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 1.</note> yet he is <hi>Seignior le Roy</hi>
within the purview of this Statute: And the other that hath Right,
and is out of Poſſeſſion is not within the Act:<note place="margin">4 E 4. 1.</note> Nay if Treaſon be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mited
againſt a King <hi>de Facto,</hi>
               <note place="margin">9 E. 4. 1, 2.</note> and after the King <hi>de Jure</hi>
cometh to the Crown, he ſhall puniſh the Treaſon done to the King
<hi>de Facto:</hi> And a Pardon granted by a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> that is
not alſo <hi>de Facto</hi> is void</p>
            <p>We may Obſerve here Firſt, this Gloſs is not grounded
upon the <hi>Act it ſelf;</hi> for that ſays only <hi>Seignior le Roy,</hi> which
Words <hi>my Lord C ke</hi> Interprets of the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> be he
King <hi>de Jure</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o. Nay it is plain that the Act does <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
only the <hi>King de Jure,</hi> if we conſider the other Parts
of it. For Firſt, it's Treaſon by the Act to kill the <hi>Prince,</hi>
the King's Eldeſt <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Heir Apparent</hi> to the Crown,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53596:6"/>
(and it is plain the Reaſon of the <hi>Law</hi> in this has its care
for the <hi>Succeſſion)</hi> Now the <hi>Heir Apparent</hi> of the Crown can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the <hi>Son</hi> of an <hi>Uſurper;</hi> for this implies a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>
after his <hi>Father,</hi> but the <hi>Son</hi> of an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> though his
Father be in <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, has no <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Succeſſion.</hi>
If therefore by the <hi>Prince</hi> here cannot be meant the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on</hi> of
an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> though <hi>King de Facto,</hi> then it muſt be <hi>only</hi> the
<hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>King de Jure;</hi> and conſequently by parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
by the King in the Statute muſt be meant <hi>only</hi> the <hi>King
de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is Treaſon by the Statute <hi>to violate or Raviſh
the Queen, or the Prince's Wife,</hi> and this alſo is grounded upon
the care the <hi>Law</hi> has to preſerve the true Right of <hi>Succſſion;</hi>
and it is Treaſon likewiſe <hi>to Raviſh the King's Eldeſt Daughter;</hi>
and let <hi>my Lord Coke</hi> himſelf give the Reaſon, becauſe<note n="a" place="margin">Inſt it. Par. 3. p. 9.</note> 
               <hi>for
default of Male Iſſue ſhe only is Inheritable to the Crown.</hi> Now the
<hi>Law</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to be thus concerned for the <hi>Iſſue</hi>
of an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> who have no Right to <hi>Inherit the Crown;</hi> though
we might ſuppoſe the <hi>Law</hi> were willing to maintain the
<hi>Uſurper himſelf</hi> in Poſſeſſion of the Crown <hi>for his own Life;</hi>
theſe inſtances therefore are a farther proof, that the <hi>Statute</hi>
it ſelf had an Eye only upon the <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any ſuch kindneſs to an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> as to oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to ſtand by him on pain of being guilty of <hi>Treaſon</hi> if they
did otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And if the Stat. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 2. Which is only a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what was Treaſon <hi>Originally by the Common Law,</hi> be
not applicable to a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> if not <hi>de Jure;</hi> then (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Vindication of the <hi>Statute</hi> it ſelf from my Lord <hi>cok'es</hi>
Gloſs) we have gained another very material point, <hi>viz.</hi> That
Treaſon did not then, by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> lie againſt the
<hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> if he were not <hi>King de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We may Obſerve that the Lord Chief Juſtice
<hi>Coke</hi> does not found his Gloſs upon the <hi>Funaamental Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Realm; and indeed that makes flatly <hi>againſt</hi> him.
<hi>England</hi> is a <hi>ſettled Monarchy,</hi> and in every ſuch Monarchy
the <hi>Right to the Crown</hi> is always veſted in ſome certain <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
who is the <hi>Rightful and Lawful King;</hi> and to this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Fundamental Conſtitution <hi>appropriates</hi> the <hi>Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> and conſequently
they cannot properly be guilty of <hi>violating their Allegiance</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53596:6"/>
but againſt <hi>him only:</hi> For the Conſtitution of the Realm
makes <hi>him King</hi> and no other, and makes them <hi>Subjects</hi> to
him and to none other; and therefore in ſtrictneſs of Law
Treaſon ought to <hi>lye againſt him only and no other,</hi> at leaſt it
ought not to lye againſt any other, but in ſuch caſe wherein
the Offences againſt another Perſon terminate upon the
<hi>Lawful Kings</hi> Authority, and are deſtructive of his Intereſt,
and ſo are puniſhable by vertue of his <hi>preſumed Will and
Conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither is my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> gloſs grounded upon
the conſtant <hi>Practice and Cuſtom</hi> of the Realm, but that alſo
proves the <hi>contrary.</hi> For if Treaſon, by the <hi>Practice and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
of the Realm, lay only againſt a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion of the
Crown and Kingdom,</hi> then</p>
            <p>(1.) Thoſe only would be <hi>attainted</hi> by our Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
who acted againſt a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion;</hi> but we ſhall
find, the contrary always practiced. We ſhall find that all
our Kings, whether lawful or not, with their Parliaments,
have attainted thoſe acted againſt them; but then they have
not only attainted thoſe that acted againſt them, while they
were in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but thoſe alſo that oppoſed their <hi>obtaining or
recovering the Poſſeſſion of the Crown,</hi> and acted againſt them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>another King in Poſſeſſion.</hi> And this we ſhall find in every
inſtance where any of our Kings came into the Poſſeſſion of
the Crown, not without a violent <hi>Oppoſition</hi> made againſt him
by the adherents of <hi>another King</hi> whom <hi>he depoſed.</hi> So <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.
in his Firſt Parliament<note n="b" place="margin">Exact A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg. of the Records of the Tower 1 Ed. 4. n. 20. 24.</note> 
               <hi>attaints</hi> thoſe that fought for
<hi>Hen.</hi> 6. againſt him: And <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. when Nine years after,
<hi>Ed.</hi> 4. fled out of the Realm, and he was again <hi>reſtored</hi> to
the Crown, calls a Parliament and<note n="c" place="margin">Truſſel's Continuat. of Daniel's Hiſt. p. 1 89. Stat. 17.</note> 
               <hi>attaints</hi> thoſe that
acted for <hi>King Ed.</hi> againſt him: And again when <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and depoſed <hi>King Hen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ed. 4. c. 7.</note> a Second time; then <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. in
his next Parliament<note n="d" place="margin">Abridg. of the Records 14 Ed 4. n. 34, 35. 36.</note> 
               <hi>attaints</hi> thoſe that had acted againſt
him on <hi>King Henry's</hi> ſide. So alſo <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. himſelf<note n="e" place="margin">See a large Catalogue of their names in Baker's Chr. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the life of Hen. 7.</note> 
               <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted</hi>
by Parliament thoſe that fought againſt him under
<hi>Rich.</hi> 3. in <hi>Boſworth-field.</hi> And <hi>Queen Mary</hi> firſt convicted,
and then in her Firſt Parliament<note n="f" place="margin">1 Mar. Seſs, 2. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>attainted the Duke of</hi>
Northumberland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for acting for <hi>Queen Jane</hi> againſt her.
Now their attainting thoſe that oppoſed their <hi>obtaining or re
covering the Poſſeſſion of the Crown,</hi> ſhews that they did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
them of Treaſon as acting againſt a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53596:7"/>
but as acting againſt a <hi>King de Jure,</hi> whether in Poſſeſſion
or out of it. I might add that in the Parliament 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the
Murderers of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.<note n="g" place="margin">Abridg. of the Records 4. Ed. 3. n. 5.</note> a King <hi>Depoſed</hi> and <hi>out of Poſſeſſion,</hi>
are <hi>Attainted</hi> of Treaſon: But here <hi>my Lord
Coke</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Coke's Inſtitut. part. 3d. p. 7. He ſays it was Treaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Stat. 25. Ed. 3. to kill the King's Father or Uncle, but that the Statute reſtrained it to the killing the King, Queen, or Prince.</note> ſays ſomething which may take of
the force of the Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> that this was
Treaſon not as <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. had been once <hi>King,</hi>
but as he was the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>King Regnant</hi>
and that upon the ſame ground the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of <hi>Edmond Earl of Kent</hi> were Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Treaſon by the ſame Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was the <hi>King's Uncle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Treaſon by the Practice and Cuſtom of the Realm
lay only againſt the</hi> King in Poſſeſſion, <hi>then certainly a</hi> King in
Poſſeſſion <hi>himſelf cannot be guilty of Treaſon for what he
does</hi> while in Poſſeſſion, <hi>much leſs can be guilty for what he
does againſt a</hi> King out of Poſſeſſion; <hi>and yet we ſhall find
the very</hi> Kings <hi>themſelves who are looked upon as Uſurpers,
as well as their</hi> adherents, attainted <hi>or</hi> declared guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>by the ſubſequent Kings and Parliaments. So in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
1. Ed. 4. <hi>King</hi> Hen 4. <hi>himſelf is declared a Traytor, for

               <hi>Queen Jane</hi>
for Uſurping her Crown. Now if we reflect upon theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of our Kings and Parliaments, that they always
<hi>Attainted</hi> thoſe Kings whom they looked upon as <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> it
plainly follows that they proceeded upon this Principle, that
our Law allows of no other King but a <hi>King de Jure:</hi> and
therefore when an <hi>Uſurper</hi> gets in to Poſſeſſion of the Crown;
though while he has the <hi>Laws in his Power</hi> they muſt ſeem
to be of his ſide, yet when once the Government is free it
looks upon him as <hi>no King,</hi> but conſiders him as a <hi>Subject</hi>
of, and a <hi>Rebel and</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Sat. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Traytor</hi> againſt the <hi>King de Jure.</hi> For
if an Uſurper were <hi>truly King</hi> he could not then be guilty of
<hi>Treaſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ed. 4. c. 17.</note> except againſt <hi>himſelf;</hi> ſo that if there be a <hi>Perſon</hi>
againſt whom the Law makes him a <hi>Rebel and Traytor;</hi>
               <note place="margin">there H. 6. is called a Rebel againſt Ed. 4.</note> then it
follows that the Law looks upon that <hi>Perſon</hi> only as <hi>King,</hi>
and the <hi>Uſurper</hi> as ſtill his <hi>Subject,</hi> though <hi>King in Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, If Treaſon lay only againſt the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi>
whether <hi>King de Jure</hi> or no: then when once there is an
Uſurper got into the Throne, the Subjects muſt look upon
themſelves as obliged upon pain of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> not to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
of any <hi>claim</hi> of the <hi>King de Jure,</hi> nor to attempt to <hi>bring
him into Poſſeſſien</hi> of his Right during the Uſurpers Life, though
they are fully convinced in their Conſciences of his juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Crown: for this were to be <hi>adherent to the Enemy
of the King in Poſſeſſion.</hi> But this notion of their Duty to the
<hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> it appears the Nation had not formerly,
from the Caſe of <hi>Richard Duke of York,</hi> when he came to put
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53596:8"/>
in his <hi>claim</hi> to the Crown, in the <hi>Parliament</hi> 39 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.<note n="Q" place="margin">Abridg. of the Records 39 H. 6. n. 10. &amp; ſeq. Rot.</note>
The <hi>Lords</hi> in that Parliament alledge againſt the <hi>Duke's claim</hi>
all that King <hi>Henry's Council</hi> could ſuggeſt to them in behalf
of a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Parl. 39. H. 6 n. 11, 12, &amp; ſeq. in Dr. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cly's Hiſt. of the Succeſſion p. 26.</note> As firſt, that they had all taken an
<hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> to King <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. then; that the <hi>Crown</hi> was
<hi>entailed</hi> upon the <hi>Heirs Males of Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
&amp;c. To which the <hi>Duke of</hi> York Anſwers, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their <hi>Oaths,</hi> nor the <hi>Act of entail,</hi> were of <hi>any force or
effect to the ſuppreſſion of Truth and Right, againſt him that is
Right Inheritour of the ſame Corones,</hi> &amp;c. And the Lords upon
conſideration of his Anſwer, conclude and agree, <hi>That his
Title could not be defeated.</hi> Now if by the Law and Cuſtom
of <hi>England,</hi> Treaſon lay againſt the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion only</hi>
whether King <hi>de Jure</hi> or not, and the Allegiance of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were due to him only; then it had been a <hi>ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
to the Duke's claim, to tell him that though his <hi>Title</hi> were
<hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Right of Blood</hi> inherent in him, yet at that
time <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>was King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> to whom alone their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi>
was due thereupon by the Law of the Land, even
though they due thereupon by the Law if the Land, even
though they had not taken an <hi>Oath to him,</hi> and that they
could not lay him aſide and admit the <hi>Duke</hi> into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Crown, without incurring the Guilt and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> This I ſay had been a more <hi>clear and
effectual Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Duke,</hi> to debar him, at leaſt from
giving. King <hi>Henry, the preſent Poſſeſſor,</hi> any diſturbance; but
neither <hi>Lords</hi> nor the <hi>King's Council</hi> ſeem to know any thing
of this, but urge only the <hi>Oaths</hi> they had taken as a ground
of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> being due to <hi>King Henry,</hi> and admit that
even their <hi>Oaths</hi> were <hi>null and void,</hi> as they tended to the
<hi>ſuppreſſion of the Right of the Heir to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be objected, That the Lords did not hereupon <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Hen.</hi> 6. but continued him <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> for his life, and
declared the <hi>Duke the next Heir.</hi> They did ſo, but it is plain
they did it not <hi>as of Right,</hi> but by Vertue of the <hi>Duke's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
and agreeing</hi> to it: The expreſs Words in the <hi>Records</hi>
are,<note n="r" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 39 H 6. n. 18. in Dr. Brady's Hiſt. of the Suceſſ. p. 27.</note> 
               <hi>For eſchuying the great inconvenients that may enſue, a
mean was found to ſave the King's Honour and Eſtate, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
the ſaid Duke,</hi> if he would; viz. <hi>That the King ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Crown during life, the Duke to be declared the true Heir,
and to poſſeſs it after his death,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If Treaſon lay only againſt the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53596:8"/>
Whether King <hi>de Jure</hi> or no; then the Law, in <hi>other regards</hi>
would look upon the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> as having the <hi>Dignity
and Authority</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> as well as it does in this point, that
it makes <hi>Treaſon</hi> to lye againſt him: But we find the Law
does not ſo regard the <hi>Kings in Poſſeſſion,</hi> when it conſiders
them as <hi>Uſurpers</hi> and not <hi>Kings de Jure.</hi> As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Law, where it conſiders them as <hi>Uſurpers,</hi> does
hardly vouchſafe them the <hi>Name of King.</hi> So in the Statute
1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. above cited, <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. whereever he is mentioned is
called not by the Name of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but<note n="f" place="margin">Year Book 9 Ed. 4. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Henry Earl
of</hi> Derby. And the ſame Act ſpeaking of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5, 6. ſtyles
them <hi>Henry late called King Henry</hi> 5. and Henry late called King
<hi>Henry</hi> 6. And in that part of it where their <hi>judicial Acts and
Grants an Confirmed;</hi> they are called all along the <hi>late</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Stat. 1. Ed. 4. c. 1.</note>
               <hi>pretended Kings, and Kings indeed and not in Right,</hi> and their
<hi>Reigns their pretenſed Reigns.</hi> And the Stat. 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.<note n="*" place="margin">c. 7.</note> made
to annul the Parliament 49. <hi>H.</hi> 6. called by <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. when
<hi>Ed.</hi> 4. was <hi>fled</hi> out of the Realm, ſtiles that Parliament a
<hi>pretenſed Parliament unlawfully and by Uſurped Power ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Rebel and Enemy to our Sovereign Lord the King,</hi> Hen. 6.
<hi>late indeed and not of right King of</hi> England. So alſo the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6. (though it was made by <hi>that very King</hi>
who afterwards pretends ſo much to be due to the <hi>King
in Poſſeſſion)</hi> where it ſpeaks of <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. calls him only <hi>Richard
Duke of Glouceſter,</hi> as if he had never worn the Crown. And
the Stat. 1. <hi>Mar.</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Seſs. 2. c. 4.</note> where it <hi>Confirms</hi> the <hi>Recognizances,
Bonds,</hi> &amp;c. which were dated as made <hi>in the Reign of Queen
Jane,</hi> calls her only <hi>the Lady</hi> Jane Dudley <hi>Wiſe of</hi> Guilford
Dudley <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> otherwiſe called the Lady</hi> Jane Grey: and after
wards<note n="w" place="margin">c. 16.</note> where it Attaints her with her <hi>Husband,</hi> and the
<hi>Duke of Northumberland,</hi> &amp;c. it names her with no more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
then barely placing her next to her <hi>Husand,</hi> Guil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ford
Dudley <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and</hi> Jane <hi>his Wiſe.</hi> Now theſe Statutes
ſpeaking thus of thoſe our Kings whom they conſider as
<hi>Uſurpers,</hi> ſhews that our Law has no regard to an <hi>Uſurper</hi>
though <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> but looks upon him as <hi>no King.</hi>
And yet this is very well conſiſtent with <hi>other Statutes</hi> giving
theſe Uſurpers the <hi>name of King,</hi> where they are conſidered
not with a regard to their <hi>Uſurpotion;</hi> but with regard to
their having the <hi>Execution</hi> of the <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> and to ſome
neceſſary and beneficial <hi>Acts of Government</hi> done by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53596:9"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law does not look upon the <hi>Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
done by a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> an <hi>Uſurper, as valid
and authoritative in themſelves.</hi> This is fully and clearly
proved by the Statute 1. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1 (that part of it which
is printed in the Statute Book) the buſineſs whereof is <hi>To
confirm the judicial Acts of</hi> Hen 4, 5, 6. and all <hi>Proceſſes</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their Reigns, and ſeveral of their <hi>Grants,</hi> and <hi>Letters
Pattents,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>Style</hi> wherein it confirms them
((which is <hi>repeated</hi> at the end of every particular head of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Acts, Proceſſes, Grants,</hi> &amp;c.) is, by enacting, <hi>That they
ſhall be of the ſame force and vertue as if they had been made by
any King lawfully Reigning in this Realm, and obtaining the
Crown of the ſame by a juſt Title.</hi> This ſuppoſes that they
looked upon them as not having <hi>in themſelves the ſame force
and vertue,</hi> as if they had been made by <hi>lawful Kings;</hi> and yet
they ought to have had the ſame force and vertue, if the Law
makes the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion King to all intents and purpoſes of
Government while while he is in Poſſeſſion,</hi> Whether he be King <hi>de
Jure</hi> or not. The ſame is further proved from the Stat.
1 <hi>Mar. Seſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 4. the buſineſs whereof is to confirm the
<hi>Recognizances, Indentures, Bonds, Patents,</hi> &amp;c. made with Queen
<hi>Jane's</hi> Name in the date of them during her ſhort Reign;
which it does by enacting, That they <hi>ſhall be as good and
effectual, as if Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Name were expreſsly contained in
them;</hi> I do not ſay that theſe <hi>Recognizances</hi> under Queen
<hi>Jane,</hi> and the <hi>Judicial Acts, Proceſſes,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4, 5, 6.
ought to have been looked upon as <hi>invalid</hi> without this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi>
but though they might have ſtood good without it,
yet that would not have been by vertue of any <hi>Authority</hi>
in theſe Kings, but upon account of the <hi>neceſſity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>preſumed conſent</hi> of the Kings <hi>de Jure</hi> excluded
from their Right.</p>
            <p>It may be Objected that <hi>the Acts of Parliament</hi> made by <hi>Hen.</hi>
4. 5. 6. were <hi>not confirmed</hi> by the Parliament, 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may be concluded that that Parliament looked upon
the Statutes made by an <hi>Uſurper</hi> and his Parliament as <hi>good</hi>
and <hi>effectual,</hi> without the <hi>Confirmation of a King</hi> de Jure. I
Anſwer, There are <hi>ſome</hi> of their Acts of Parliament confirmed
there, <hi>viz.</hi> any <hi>Acts made by them for the founding any Abbeys,
Religious Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. And any made <hi>for the Town of</hi> Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury:
and though the <hi>reſt</hi> of their Acts of Parliament might
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53596:9"/>
be looked upon <hi>as valid</hi> without <hi>confirmation</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. yet their
being looked upon as valid is not to be aſcribed to any <hi>Authority</hi>
in a <hi>King de Facto</hi> ſufficient to make them ſo. For then that
Authority muſt have had the <hi>ſame effect</hi> in all their <hi>other Acts
of Government (their judicial Acts, Grants, Letters, Patents,</hi> &amp;c.)
as it had in the <hi>Statutes</hi> made in the Parliaments holden by
them.</p>
            <p>Theſe inſtances from our <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Purliament</hi>
may be ſufficient to prove (the contrary to what my Lord
<hi>Coke</hi> gives for Law) Viz. <hi>That Treaſon does not lye only againſt
the King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> whether <hi>King de Jure</hi> or no: I come
therefore now to conſider his proofs of his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>We have in his <hi>note</hi> upon the words <hi>Seignior le Roy</hi> in the
Statute of Treaſons, firſt his <hi>main Aſſertion,</hi> That by thoſe
words is meant the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> only, though <hi>he be</hi> de
Facto <hi>and not</hi> de Jure, and <hi>not the King out of Poſſeſſion though</hi>
de Jure: and for the <hi>proof</hi> of this he refers us in the <hi>Margin</hi>
to the <hi>Stat.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Secondly, We have ſome <hi>other
points of Law,</hi> which he brings to <hi>Illuſtrate</hi> and <hi>Confirm</hi> his
main poſition; viz. <hi>That Treaſon againſt a King</hi> de Facto <hi>is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
by the King</hi> de Jure <hi>when he comes to the Crown.</hi> And
<hi>That a Pardon granted by a King</hi> de Jure, <hi>that is not alſo</hi> de
Facto, <hi>is void:</hi> and for the <hi>proof</hi> of theſe he refers to the
<hi>Year-Books</hi> of Law Caſes 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. and 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>The Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. which he refers to for his main
poſition, I have ſet down before as a <hi>distinct</hi> Argument; from
whence it is inferred, that <hi>Allegiance is due to the King in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;</hi>
and therefore I ſhall conſider it <hi>apart</hi> in its proper
place, and conſider here my Lord <hi>Coke's Secondary Points, That
Treaſon againſt a King</hi> de Facto <hi>is puniſhable by the King</hi> de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
when he comes to the Crown; and a Pardon granted by a
King <hi>de Jure out of Poſſeſſion, is void.</hi> And they are rather to be
conſidered firſt; becauſe if they are ſufficient to prove that
Traſon lies againſt a King <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> only, they prove that it
did ſo by the <hi>Common Law before</hi> the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and ſo
overthrow all that has been alledged above to the contrary.
My Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> references for the proof of theſe points are
to the 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. and 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1, 2. in the <hi>Year-Books.</hi> Under
the firſt I find nothing of this <hi>Nature</hi> and have ſome reaſon
to think it is but one and the ſame with the latter: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the latter reference I find a <hi>Plea</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>one Bagot</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53596:10"/>
and to clear <hi>that Plea</hi> ſhall ſet down a ſhort <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his Caſe.
This <hi>Bagott</hi> and one <hi>Shyrenden</hi> were<note n="x" place="margin">7 E. 4. 29. 9 E. 4. 6.</note> diſſeized of the place
of Clerk of the Crown by one <hi>Ive,</hi> and thereupon ſue him.
<hi>Ive's</hi> Plea againſt <hi>Bagott</hi> is, That he was an Alien born in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and ſo could not <hi>hold a Place</hi> here, being not the King's
<hi>leige Subject. Bagott</hi> brings a<note n="y" place="margin">7 E. 4 31. 9 E. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Patent of Naturalization</hi>
granted him by <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. to which <hi>Ive's</hi> Council object, That
<hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was only a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> and that
<hi>Ed.</hi> 4. the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> had in his Firſt Parliament declared
what <hi>Grants of Hen.</hi> 4, 5, 6. Kings <hi>de Facto</hi> ſhould <hi>be valid,</hi>
and had not there made any proviſion to ratify any ſuch
Grants as <hi>Bagott's Patent</hi> was, therefore his Patent was <hi>null.</hi>
To this <hi>Bagott's</hi> Council Anſwer,<note n="z" place="margin">9 E. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That notwithſtanding
that Act of</hi> Ed. 4. <hi>in his Firſt Parliament,</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>Letters Patents
were good, becauſe</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>was King in Poſſeſſion, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
that the Realm have a King, under whom the Laws ſhall
be upheld and maintained: Therefore though be were not King but
only by Uſurpation, yet every judicial Act done by him touching the
Royal juriſdiction ſhall be good, and ſhall bind the King</hi> de Jure
<hi>when he returns to his Crown.</hi> They inſtance in <hi>Pardons, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes
of alienation in Mortmaine, Grants of Wards, Liveries,</hi> &amp;c.
They urge alſo <hi>That the King</hi> de Jure (Ed. 4.) <hi>ſhall have the
advantage of all Forfeitures made to King</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>and for a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
committed in</hi> H. 6<hi>ths. time the Writ ſhall run</hi> contra pacem
<hi>Henrici</hi> 6. nuper de Facto &amp; non de Jure, <hi>&amp;c. And a Man
ſhall be arraigned of Treaſon committed againſt</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Death.</hi> They urge alſo that any <hi>Gifts or Grants made
by King</hi> Henry <hi>that were not to the diminution of the Crown ſhall
ſtand good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Council on the other ſide plead,</hi> That any common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
deſſeized of his Right and returning again ſhall defeat all the
mean Acts, therefore a King <hi>de Jure</hi> returning, invalidates all the
Acts of the Uſurper, <hi>&amp;c. But they do not make any</hi> direct reply
<hi>to the Arguments of</hi> Bagott's <hi>Council. After that</hi> Bagott's
<hi>Council urge at another hearing,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">9 E. 4. 4. 2.</note> That if <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. in King

for every one that Grants a Charter of Pardon ought to be King <hi>de
Facto. This is all the plea of</hi> Council <hi>upon this point; and
all that I find of the</hi> Judges <hi>is, Firſt that</hi> Judge Billing <hi>ſays,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">9 E. 4. 2.</note>That to every King by reaſon of his Office it belongs to do Acts

granting Pardon to Felons, and ſuch a legitimation as this (of

               <note n="c" place="margin">9 E. 4. 1, 2.</note> After they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
with the Judges of the Common Pleas, give Judgement for
<hi>Bagott.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears upon the view of this Account of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That what my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> refers to here, is nothing but
the <hi>Argument</hi> of Bagott's <hi>Council:</hi> That their Argument is
mainly grounded upon the <hi>neceſſity of Government,</hi> becauſe
there <hi>muſt be ſome King to uphold and maintain the Laws,</hi> and
therefore any King's <hi>Acts of Government</hi> (though he be an
<hi>Uſurper)</hi> muſt be held <hi>valid:</hi> That they themſelves limit the
<hi>validity</hi> of the <hi>Grants</hi> of a <hi>King de Facto,</hi> that they be not to
the <hi>diminution of the Crown:</hi> That they do not argue from
any <hi>Statute</hi> of the Realm: That what they ſay is not <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Anſwered</hi> to or <hi>denied</hi> by the <hi>Council</hi> on the other ſide, nor
by any of the <hi>Judges;</hi> but one of the Judges <hi>(Billing)</hi> ſeems
to declare his Opinion, upon the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the thing, <hi>to the
ſame purpoſe;</hi> and all the Judges (with the advice of the
Judges of the <hi>Common Pleas)</hi> determine the Caſe in ſavour
of <hi>Bagott.</hi> This is the utmoſt that can be made of this Caſe;
and<note n="d" place="margin">Tit. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon N. 10</note> 
               <hi>Brooke</hi> in his <hi>grand Abridgment</hi> makes no more of it;

He Obſerves that it is <hi>ſaid (i. e.</hi> by <hi>Bagotts Council)</hi> and not
denied (i. e. <hi>by the Council againſt him</hi> or the <hi>Judges)</hi> That
<hi>Treaſon againſt H.</hi> 6. <hi>Compaſſing</hi> his Death may be <hi>puniſhed

<note n="e" place="margin">N. 28.</note>refers to, in the ſame page, for the ſame thing, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> Tranſcribing theſe quotations out of
<hi>Brooke,</hi> took them for <hi>two</hi> diſtinct quotations, whereas really
are <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be the utmoſt this Caſe amounts to, then firſt
it is not <hi>Authority</hi> ſufficient to make it Law, that this was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53596:11"/>
               <hi>plèadèd</hi> by Council and not <hi>denied</hi> by the Judges or the adverſe
Party. Secondly, Neither if we grant the <hi>particular points</hi> in
the Plea, will it follow, either that <hi>Treaſon</hi> by our Law <hi>lies
only againſt the King in Poſſeſſion;</hi> or that our <hi>Allegiance is due
to him only.</hi> And this will appear by conſidering the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
points contained in the Plea. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>Judicial Acts and Grants of a King</hi> de Facto
<hi>ſhall ſtand good when the King</hi> de Jure, <hi>recovers his Crown.</hi>
This they themſelves limit to ſuch Grants as are not to the
<hi>diminution of the Crown:</hi> And Equity and Reaſon allows, that
the Acts of Government done by an Uſurper, neither to the
prejudice of the <hi>Community,</hi> nor of the <hi>Lawful King's</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
may and ought to be reputed valid after the Lawful
King's return; for thoſe Acts not being againſt his Right
and Intereſt, and being neceſſary to the very being of the
Government under the Uſurper, while he cannot be Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from his Uſurped Power, thoſe Acts ſay, the <hi>King de
Jure</hi> himſelf <hi>is to be preſumed to ratifie</hi> by his Conſent and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
and therefore upon this preſumption they become
<hi>valid and Authoritative,</hi> by vertue of <hi>his Authority,</hi> and not
the Uſurpers. So <hi>all Laws</hi> made by the Uſurper in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the publick Good, all <hi>Sentences</hi> paſſed in Courts, all
Commiſſions granted by him, all the Actions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State and inferiour Magiſtratesacting under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
as far as the <hi>Reaſon of Government requires,</hi> and they
are no prejudice to the <hi>Rightful King,</hi> ought to ſtand in full
force, even when the <hi>King de Jure</hi> comes to the Crown.
And upon this ground <hi>Bagott's Patent</hi> for Naturalization was
looked upon as valid, even againſt the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Statute
1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. which Statute by <hi>Confirming</hi> ſome Grants of
<hi>II.</hi> 4, 5, 6. might ſeem to <hi>anull</hi> all the reſt which it did not
Confirm (and ſo the Council againſt <hi>Bagott</hi> urge it) and yet
<hi>Bagotts Patent</hi> was held good, though not <hi>Conflrmed,</hi> by that
Statute; which ſhews that it was held good not by vertue of
any <hi>Written Law,</hi> but becauſe (as <hi>Bagott's Council</hi> Plead) the
<hi>Reaſon of Government,</hi> and common <hi>Equity,</hi> requires that ſuch
Acts of an <hi>Uſurper</hi> ſhould ſtand <hi>good</hi> as tend not to the <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then this is no proof, that <hi>all other Judicial Acts</hi> and
Grants whatſoever, though tending directly to the <hi>prejudice</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53596:11"/>
the <hi>Lawful King,</hi> ſhould be looked upon to Oblige him at
his return, or to bind the Conſciences of his Subjects, while
he is out of Poſſeſſion; for though the King <hi>de Jure</hi> may be
<hi>preſumed</hi> to conſent to, and the Subjects are allowed to Obey
the Uſurper's other Acts of Government, yet this cannot be
extended to thoſe Acts that ſtrike at the Authority and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the King <hi>de Jure</hi> himſelf: Nor can we ſuppoſe that
<hi>Bagott's</hi> Council Pleading here in <hi>Edw.</hi> 4 time, and before
his Judges, would ſay that any of <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Acts,</hi> done <hi>plainly to
the diſheriſon of King</hi> Edward, were to be looked upon as <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid;</hi>
nor can we conceive that King <hi>Edward</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Judges would
have <hi>admitted</hi> ſuch a Plea if the Council had made it. This
therefore may be enough to ſhew, that the <hi>Plea of</hi> Bagott's
<hi>Council</hi> may be approved of in this point, and yet it is no
good conſequence that every Act of an Uſurper is Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
or that the Subjects are obliged to pay <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Second <hi>point in the Plea of</hi> Bagott's <hi>Council, is,
That the</hi> King de Jure <hi>at his</hi> return to the Crown, ſhall have the
advantage of all <hi>Forfeitures,</hi> for any <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> committed againſt
a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> and that he may <hi>Puniſh Treaſon committed
againſt a King de Facto,</hi> by any one that compaſſed the King <hi>de
Facto</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Death. <hi>This alſo is very true if we reſtrain it to ſuch
Acts</hi> againſt the King de Facto, <hi>as the</hi> Right and Intereſt <hi>of the</hi>
King de Jure <hi>does not</hi> require <hi>or</hi> juſtifie <hi>the doing it. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, There are many Offences which are only againſt
the Order of the Government, and the Peace of the Society,
or the Rights of ſome private Perſons, and not againſt the
<hi>King</hi> de Facto's <hi>Perſon or Crown;</hi> as Theft, Murder, Perjury;
and ſome kinds of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as <hi>Clipping</hi> and <hi>Coyning, killing a
Judge upon the Bench, Counterfeiting the King's Seal, adhering to
a Foreign Enemy,</hi> (that makes War not upon the <hi>Uſurper as ſuch,</hi>
in the Lawful King's behalf, but upon the Nation, and ſo
<hi>implicitely</hi> upon the <hi>Lawful King,</hi> whoſe Intereſt would be
ruined if a Foreigner ſhould Conquer the Nation) <hi>betraying
any Fort or Caſtle, or the like.</hi> Now theſe Offences are juſtly
puniſhable by the <hi>King de Jure himſelf</hi> when he comes to the
Crown, or by the inferiour Magiſtrates, (acting under the <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>'<hi>s</hi>
Commiſſion) while the <hi>King de Jure</hi> is out of Poſſeſſion:
they are juſtly puniſhable by himſelf, becauſe they <hi>terminate</hi>
upon <hi>his Authority,</hi> and upon the intereſt which he has in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53596:12"/>
               <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>orderly Prcceeding</hi> of the Government, though
he is excluded from the Adminiſtration of it: They are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
alſo by the inferiour <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> by vertue of his
<hi>preſumed Will</hi> Authorizing them to act for his, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
Intereſt, though under an Uſurper. And upon this
<hi>ground</hi> we find that <hi>Judge</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's <hi>Life of Judge</hi> Hale, p 36, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Hale</hi> did not ſcruple to Try
<hi>Felons</hi> under <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> though he ſcrupled to Try
any <hi>Offenders againſt the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There may be ſome Acts againſt the very <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and <hi>Crown</hi> of the Uſurper, which may be done out of a
<hi>private ſeditious Principle,</hi> or for the intereſt, not of the <hi>King
de Jure,</hi> but ſome <hi>other</hi> Perſon, merely to diſturb the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
or to ſet up a <hi>Second Uſurper</hi> in the place of the
<hi>Firſt.</hi> Now theſe Acts may be juſtly pnniſhed as Treaſon,
either by the Inferiour Magiſtrates under the Uſurper, or
by the <hi>King de Jure,</hi> when he comes to the Crown. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Theſe Acts ſtrike indirectly at the King <hi>de Jure</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Crown through the Uſurper; and therefore either
<hi>himſelf</hi> may puniſh them as done againſt himſelf, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Magiſtrates may puniſh them by virtue of his <hi>preſumed</hi>
Will and Conſent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Neceſſity of Government</hi> requires that the
Laws and Courts of Judicature ſtand by the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi>
though an Uſurper, againſt <hi>any other</hi> Perſon pretending to the
Crown, but the <hi>Lawful King:</hi> And therefore an attempt to
kill or depoſe him, to make way for <hi>another Uſupation,</hi> may
be juſtly puniſhed as Treaſon even by the <hi>King de Jure</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and his Conſent may be preſumed to authorize the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriour
Magiſtrates to do it, during his Exile. Thus therefore
it might have been juſt for <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. to <hi>attaint of Treaſon</hi> any
Perſon that had <hi>compaſſed the Death of King</hi> Hen. VI. <hi>or levyed
War againſt him,</hi> for any other end and purpoſe than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
King <hi>Edward</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Intereſt, and to bring him to the Crown:
And ſo this ſecond point of the <hi>plea</hi> of <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Council may
be allowed of: But then it is no conſequence, that any Acts
done againſt the Uſurper <hi>in behalf of the King de Jure,</hi> to bring
him to the Crown, may be <hi>justly puniſhed</hi> either by the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or by the inferiour Magiſtrates under him, or much leſs
by the <hi>King de Jure</hi> himſelf when he comes to the Crown.
Neither is it conceivable that <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Council meant this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53596:12"/>
by their <hi>plea;</hi> that thoſe who <hi>Acted againſt</hi> Hen. VI. <hi>to bring</hi>
Ed. IV. <hi>to the Crown</hi> might be <hi>Attainted</hi> by <hi>Ed.</hi> IV. for <hi>Traytors</hi>
and <hi>Rebels,</hi> for <hi>fighting againſt</hi> Hen. VI. <hi>the King in Poſſeſſion</hi>
in <hi>King</hi> Edward's <hi>behalf;</hi> this would have been a <hi>beld</hi> Plea in
<hi>King</hi> Ed. IV's time, and before his Judges; and yet this muſt
be their Plea to prove from it, that <hi>Treaſon can be commited
against only the King in Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be Objected that the <hi>Attaindors</hi> of Peſons by a <hi>King
de Facto</hi> for fightingagainſt him in behalf of the <hi>King de Jure,</hi>
have been looked upon as <hi>valid</hi> by the <hi>Kings de Jure</hi> when
they came to the Crown. For inſtance <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. had <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
thoſe that came againſt him under <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
declare <hi>Richard</hi> to be an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> yet they thought
not fit to let any of them whom he had Attainted <hi>ſit</hi> in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<note n="g" place="margin">Bac. Vit. Hen. 7. p. 1004.</note>till their <hi>Attaindors</hi> were <hi>firſt taken off:</hi> which is
a confeſſion that they looked upon their <hi>attainders</hi> as <hi>valid</hi>
till they were repealed. To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. though he was an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> being not the
<hi>Firſt</hi> of the Blood of the <hi>Houſe of York,</hi> yet his Title to the
Crown was good againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. he being of the <hi>Houſe of
Lancaſter,</hi> and not the Firſt of the Houſe neither, his own
<hi>Mother</hi> being alive.</p>
            <p>2. But Secondly, Granting that <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
looked upon <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. as King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. as
an <hi>Uſurper of the Crown,</hi> as they ſtile him, their thinking it
proper to <hi>take</hi> off the <hi>attaindors</hi> of thoſe whom <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. had
attainted, is no certain proof that they looked upon their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindors
<hi>as valid,</hi> for though they had looked upon them as
<hi>null</hi> in themſelves, yet they might think fit to <hi>Repeal</hi> them for
the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of the Nation, and the ſecurity of the <hi>Perſons
Attainted,</hi> who might otherwiſe have been liable to be <hi>Execi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
upon theſe <hi>Attaindors</hi> if there ſhould have been a <hi>turn:</hi>
So no queſtion <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. looked upon the Proceedings of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
49 <hi>H.</hi> 6. (Summoned by <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. when <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. in the
ninth year of his Reign was <hi>fled</hi> out of his Realm) wherein
himſelf and all his adherents were <hi>Attainted,</hi> as <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid;</hi>
elſe he would have <hi>Repealed</hi> thoſe Proceedings in his next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
yet <hi>eight years after</hi> he thought fit to <hi>Repeal</hi> them,
<note n="h" place="margin">Stat. 17. Ed. 4. c. 7.</note>
               <hi>for the ſurety of his Noble Perſon, his Noble Iſſue, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable
Succeſſion of the ſame, and for the ſurety of all the Lords,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53596:13"/>
Noblemen, and other his Servants and Subjects,</hi> i. e. to <hi>ſecure</hi> them
from any danger, from the <hi>Attaindors</hi> in that Parliament, if
there ever ſhould be a <hi>return</hi> of the <hi>Lancaſtrian Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Granting that King <hi>H.</hi> 7. and his Parliament did
look upon theſe Attaindors as <hi>valid,</hi> what is the conſequence?
<hi>viz.</hi> that they allowed it was <hi>Treaſon,</hi> to fight <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. the
<hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. whom
they conceived to be the <hi>King de Jure.</hi> Then ſure, if they
thought it was <hi>Treaſon to fight againſt</hi> Rich. 3. <hi>the King in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,</hi>
they could not look upon it as Treaſon to <hi>fight for him:</hi>
And yet the very ſame Parliament<note n="i" place="margin">Bac. Vit. H. 7. p. 1004. 1005.</note> 
               <hi>Attaints</hi> both <hi>Rich.</hi> 3.
himſelf, and all thoſe that <hi>fought under him in</hi> Boſworth <hi>Field.</hi>
So that we ſee what <hi>good Law</hi> we are like to have, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every thing which may be given us for Law out of the
<hi>Statute and Year-Books;</hi> for then we may, upon the Authority
of the very <hi>ſame Parliament,</hi> make it Treaſon on <hi>both ſides,</hi>
to <hi>fight</hi> for <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>againſt Rich.</hi> 3. and to <hi>fight</hi> for <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Hen.</hi> 7. The former to <hi>fight againſt Rich.</hi> 3. that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is conceived to allow to be Treaſon, becauſe they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the <hi>Attainders</hi> of thoſe whom <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. had Attainted
for being in Arms againſt him, as <hi>valid,</hi> till they were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed:
and the latter to <hi>fight for Rich.</hi> 3. they declared to
be Treaſon, becauſe they <hi>Attainted</hi> thoſe that were in Arms
under him <hi>againſt Hen.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs on to the laſt point of <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Plea, I may,
from this Second Part of it, give an Anſwer to one of the moſt
<hi>ſpecious</hi> Arguments that is brought, to prove that our <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
is due to the King</hi> de Facto, <hi>though not</hi> de Jure: The
Argument is drawn from the uſual <hi>Form</hi> of the<note n="k" place="margin">Conſidera. for the taking the Oath of Alleg. <hi>P.</hi> 5. n. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for Treaſon, which runs for commiting that Crime
<hi>Contra debitum Fidei &amp; Ligeantiae ſuae quod praefato Domino
Regi naturaliter &amp; de Jure impendere debuit;</hi> or, <hi>Contra Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Regem Supremum &amp; naturalem Dominum ſuum;</hi> or, <hi>Contra
naturalem Ligeantiam Domino Regi debitam.</hi> Now if in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
for Treaſon againſt a King. <hi>de Facto</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi>
the Treaſon be ſaid to be committed <hi>Againſt our Supream and
Natural Leige-Lord, againſt our Natural Allegiance due to him,
againſt that Duty of Faith and Allegiance which we naturally and of
right ought to yield to him;</hi> then ſurely our <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to a
<hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though not <hi>de Jure.</hi> To this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53596:13"/>
Firſt, It is no wonder <hi>if in the Reign of the King</hi> de Facto
<hi>himſelf,</hi> the Indictments for Treaſons committed againſt him
run thus in the <hi>uſual form;</hi> for though he be an Uſurper,
yet being in Poſſeſſion he will no queſtion aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>le and Authority of a <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and while the
Laws and Courts of Judicature are in his Power they muſt
call him their <hi>Supreme and Natural Liege-Lord,</hi> and implead
any one that Acts againſt him for violating the <hi>Allegiance,</hi>
which <hi>naturally</hi> and of <hi>right</hi> he ought to pay him. But the
queſtion is not, whether an Indictment for Treaſon againſt
the <hi>King de Facto</hi> will run thus in his own <hi>Reign;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will run in the ſame form in the Reign <hi>of the King
dde Jure,</hi> after he has recovered his Crown.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though it ſhould run ſo in the Subſequent
<hi>Reign of the King de Jure,</hi> yet this would be no certain
proof that the Law looks upon a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though an
Uſurper; as our <hi>Natural Liege-Lord,</hi> and our <hi>Allegiance as due
to him naturally and of right:</hi> For the Lawyers uſe to <hi>keep cloſe</hi>
to their uſual forms, in <hi>Indictments</hi> eſpecially, and retain in
them many expreſſions, as <hi>improper</hi> to be uſed in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Caſes, as theſe expreſſions are in the Caſe of a <hi>King
de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It does not appear that an Indictment for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
committed againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. brought againſt the Perſon
that committed it in <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. time; would have run in the <hi>ſame
form,</hi> as if he had been <hi>King de Jure.</hi> It does not appear,
becauſe if there were any <hi>ſuch Indictment</hi> to be found, it
would have been <hi>produced</hi> by thoſe that urge this Argument,
but all that they alledge to prove Treaſon againſt a <hi>King de
Facto</hi> is <hi>Baggot</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Caſe, and that rather proves the <hi>contrary,
viz,</hi> that an Indictment under <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. for <hi>Treaſon</hi> committed
againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. would not run in the uſual form, as in the
Caſe of a <hi>King de Jure.</hi> An Indictment for a <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> uſually
runs <hi>Contra pacem Domini Regis, Coronam &amp; dignitatem ſuam;</hi>
and this form is alſo a part of an Indictment for <hi>Treaſon,</hi>
which is both <hi>Contra pacem &amp; contra ligeantiam.</hi> Now 'tis ſaid
expreſly by <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Council, that an Indictment for a <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi>
againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. brought in <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. time, would run thus,
<note n="l" place="margin">9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 71. Sup. (a) pf</note>
               <hi>Contra paoem</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>nuper</hi> de Facto <hi>&amp; non</hi> de Jure, &amp;c.
and if ſo, then by parity of Reaſon the ſame expreſſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53596:14"/>
would be uſed in Indictments for <hi>Treaſon;</hi> and if that
expreſſion be put in; I think it will require that thoſe of
<hi>Natural Liege-Lord,</hi> and <hi>Allegiance due naturally</hi> and of <hi>Right,</hi>
be left out; otherwiſe the Indictments muſt run thus,
<hi>Contra Dominum Regem</hi> Hen. 6. nuper de Facto &amp; non
de Jure, <hi>Supremum</hi> &amp; naturalem <hi>Dominum ſuum;</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
debitum fidei &amp; Legeantiae ſuae quod Domino Regi</hi> Hen. 6:
nuper de Facto &amp; non de Jure, naturaliter &amp; de Jure
<hi>impendere debuit: i. e. againſt his Supreme and</hi> Natural <hi>Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lord</hi>
Hen. 6. <hi>late King in deed, but no in Right;</hi> or, <hi>againſt
that</hi> Duty <hi>of Faith and Allegiance, which he</hi> naturally and
of Right <hi>ought to pay to</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>late King</hi> in Deed, and not
of Right. Theſe expreſſions I think do not very well <hi>ſuit
together;</hi> at leaſt the <hi>addition</hi> of <hi>King de Facto and not do
Jure,</hi> does ſeem ſo to <hi>qualifie</hi> the reſt, that <hi>no Act</hi> can be
made Traſon in any ſuch <hi>Indictment,</hi> that is done againſt
the <hi>King de Facto,</hi> in <hi>behalf of the King de Jure,</hi> to bring him
to the Crown; for then the Indictment muſt run thus,
A. B. <hi>Againſt his</hi> natural Allegiance <hi>due to</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>late King</hi>
de Facto, <hi>and not</hi> de Jure, <hi>was aiding and aſſiſting to our
Sovereign Lord that now is,</hi> (Edw. 4.) <hi>then King</hi> de Jure, <hi>but
not</hi> de Facto, <hi>for the recovery of his Right.</hi> This therefore
may be a ſufficient Anſwer to the Objection from the <hi>form
of the Indictments for Treaſon;</hi> to ſhew that they are no proof
that our <hi>Allegiance is due to the King</hi> de Facto, though he be
not <hi>King de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs on to the laſt point in the Plea of <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<hi>That a Pardon granted by a King</hi> de Jure, <hi>out of Poſſeſſion, is
void,</hi> and this may very well be admitted: For a <hi>King de
Jure out of Poſſeſſion,</hi> while his Subjects are not able to reſtore
him, cannot ſend over a Pardon of Felony, Treaſon, or
the like, to any purpoſe, but only to have his own <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
expoſed,</hi> and his Loyal Subjects <hi>loſe their Lives, or Eſtates,</hi>
by endeavouring to maintain it: For to have this Pardon
take effect, it muſt be <hi>pleaded in Court,</hi> and there it cannot
have its effect to ſave any Perſon whom the Uſurper will
have excuted; beſides that the <hi>Perſon pleading it</hi> would be
in danger to be proceeded againſt as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> for <hi>abetting
the King</hi> de Jure's <hi>Authority</hi> againſt the <hi>Uſurpors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53596:14"/>
This may clear the meaning of that part of the Plea of
<hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Council, that a <hi>Pardon</hi> granted by a <hi>King de Jure
out of Poſſeſſion</hi> is <hi>void, i. e.</hi> it cannot have its Effect, and
be <hi>pleaded</hi> and <hi>received in Court,</hi> while the <hi>King de Jure</hi>
is out of <hi>Poſſeſſion:</hi> But then, it does not follow, becauſe
he cannot execute his Royal Authority in the <hi>pardoning</hi> or
<hi>puniſhing</hi> Treaſon while he is out of Poſſeſſion, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be no Treaſon <hi>Committed</hi> againſt him
while he is out of Poſſeſſion, or that it is Treaſon to
<hi>act for him</hi> againſt the Uſurper; for though the <hi>King de
Jure</hi> have not the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Government, yet he
has a <hi>Right</hi> to it, and the Subjects may thereupon be
obliged in Conſcience to <hi>bring him</hi> into the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of his
Right when they are <hi>able,</hi> and it may be Treaſon in them
to <hi>fight</hi> againſt his <hi>Right</hi> for the <hi>Uſurper,</hi> though <hi>King in
Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, Firſt, It does not appear upon
the view of the particular Points in the Plea of <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi>
Council, that any thing can be alleged from that <hi>Plea</hi> to
make out the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Gloſs upon the
Stat. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>viz. That the Treaſons in that Statute can
be Committed only againſt the King in Poſſeſſion, whether King</hi>
de Jure <hi>or no;</hi> or to prove, <hi>That the Allegiance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is due to the King in Poſſeſſion only,</hi> whether <hi>King de Jure</hi>
or no.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>ly.</hi> Though <hi>Bagott</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Council had made ſuch a Plea, and
the Court had allowed of it; yet this is not enough to make
<hi>it good Law;</hi> eſpecially when the very <hi>Statute of Edw.</hi> 3. and
<hi>other Statutes,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Realm (even in <hi>Edw.</hi>
4<hi>th's.</hi> and after in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7<hi>th</hi>'<hi>s</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'<hi>s</hi> time) prove
the contrary; as was ſhewed above.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>dly.</hi> Though there were <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> for it, <hi>viz.</hi>
That a Man might be Guilty of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and puniſhed as a
<hi>Traytor,</hi> for acting in behalf of his <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>rightful King</hi>
againſt an <hi>Uſurper in Poſſeſſion;</hi> and not Guilty for acting
in an <hi>Uſurper</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Cauſe againſt his <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>rightful King out
of Poſſeſion;</hi> yet ſuch a Statute and Cuſtom would be <hi>null</hi>
and <hi>invalid,</hi> as contrary to the <hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> of
the Realm, and to the <hi>Law of God and Nature,</hi> as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
under the next head, the Stat. 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. which
I come now to conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53596:15"/>
This Statute is my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'<hi>s</hi> main proof of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<hi>That Treaſon lies only againſt the King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and
may be urged as ſufficient by it ſelf to make it Law <hi>ſince that
time,</hi> though it had not been ſo either by Statute, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, <hi>before;</hi> and it is alſo made a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Argument,
to prove directly, <hi>That Allegiance is due to the King in Poſſeſſion
only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The main of the Statute is in theſe Words, <hi>The King
our Sovereign Lord calling to his remembrance <hi>the Duty of
Allegiance</hi> of his Subjects of this his Realm, <hi>and</hi> that they,
by reaſon of the ſame, are bound to ſerve their Prince and
Sovereign Lord, for the time being, in his Wars for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of him and the Land againſt every Rebellion, <hi>Power
and Might</hi> reared againſt him—and that for the ſame Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
what Fortune ever fall by chance in the ſame Battle
againſt the Mind and Will of the Prince—it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but againſt <hi>all Laws, Reaſon, and Good Conſcience,</hi>
that the ſaid Subjects going with their Sovereign Lord in
Wars—any thing ſhould looſe or forfeit for doing their true
Duty and Service of Allegiance. It be therefore ordained,
enacted, and eſtabliſhed, by the King our Sovereign Lord,—
that from henceforth no manner of Perſon or Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he or they be, that attend upon the King and Sovereign
Lord of this Land, <hi>for the time being</hi> in his Perſon, and
do him true and faithful Service of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in the ſame,
or be in other Places by his Commandment in the Wars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Land, or without; that for the ſaid Deed and true
Duty of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> he or they be in no wiſe <hi>Convict or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
of High Treaſon,</hi> ne of other Offences for that Cauſe,
by Act of Parliament, or otherwiſe by any Proceſs of Law,
whereby he or any of them ſhall loſe or forſeit Life, Lands,
&amp;c. but to be for that Deed and Service utterly diſcharged
of any vexation, trouble, or loſs,—provided always, that no
Perſon or Perſons ſhall take any benefit or advantage by this
Act, which ſhall hereafter decline from his or their ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Statute conſiſts of two Parts, the <hi>Preamble,</hi> and the
<hi>Body,</hi> and upon the view of it we may obſerve.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>ſt.</hi> That it is not enacted in the <hi>Body</hi> of the Statute,
that the <hi>Subjects ſhall be obliged to pay Allegiance to the King
for the time being,</hi> ſo that, if what is enacted in the <hi>Body</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53596:15"/>
of a Statute <hi>only,</hi> be Law, then the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
is not due, by Virtue of this Statute, to the <hi>King for
the time being.</hi> The direct intent of the Body of it is to
<hi>indemnifie</hi> thoſe that <hi>fight</hi> under the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and
their being <hi>indemnified</hi> for <hi>fighting</hi> under him, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it is <hi>lawful</hi> for them to do it, much leſs that it
is their <hi>Duty;</hi> for they may be <hi>Guilty in foro interno,</hi> of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Rebellion, for <hi>fighting</hi> under <hi>the King in Poſſeſſion
againſt the King de Jure,</hi> and yet it may not be unjuſt or
improper to <hi>indemnifie them in foro externo,</hi> by ſuch a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe many that <hi>fight</hi> under the <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi>
do it in the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of their Hearts. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe this
would prevent any <hi>revengeful effuſion of Blood</hi> by the <hi>King
de Jure</hi> at his coming to the Crown. All therefore that
the <hi>Body</hi> of the Statute proves, is, that (though by the <hi>Stat.</hi>
25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. it were <hi>Treaſon</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> for an <hi>Uſurper</hi> againſt
the <hi>King de Jure</hi> out of Poſſeſſion, yet) he that fights for
an Uſurper againſt the <hi>King de Jure</hi> out of Poſſeſſion is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified</hi>
by this <hi>Statute;</hi> and ſo he is not <hi>puniſhable</hi> as a
Traytor, though he has the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Treaſon upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
and if he may ſtill be <hi>Guilty</hi> of Treaſon, then ſtill
his <hi>Allegiance</hi> may be due to the <hi>King de Jure</hi> out of <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi>
ſo as to oblige him not to act any thing againſt him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Uſurper.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> We may obſerve upon the view of the Statute,
that the <hi>Preamble</hi> of it does not <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>
that the Allegiance of the Subjects is due to the
<hi>King</hi> for the time being, but only <hi>obliquely ſuppoſes</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates</hi>
it. The <hi>King</hi> is ſaid to <hi>call to his remembrance</hi> his
Subjects Duty of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and that they, by Virtue of
it, are bound to <hi>fight</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> for the time being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This is not to <hi>declare it</hi> to be ſo (by Virtue of the <hi>Authority</hi>
of King and Parliament to <hi>interpret</hi> the former Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Subjects <hi>Allegiance,)</hi> but to ſuppoſe it as a thing
certainly <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>determined</hi> by the Law <hi>already;</hi> and ſo
alſo it is <hi>obliquely inſinuated</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> of the Act, that their
fighting under a <hi>King de Facto,</hi> is <hi>doing their true Duty and
Service of Allegiance.</hi> And if this be only <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> and
that <hi>Suppoſition</hi> have <hi>no ground</hi> neither in the <hi>Fundamental
Conſtitution</hi> of the Realm, nor in any former <hi>Statute</hi> or
<hi>Cuſtom,</hi> but theſe all, do all of them, clearly demonſtrate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53596:16"/>
the <hi>contrary,</hi> as was ſhewed above; then I think the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble</hi>
of this Statute cannot be urged upon the <hi>Conſciences</hi>
of the Subjects, as a <hi>Law</hi> obliging them to <hi>tranſfer their
Allegiance</hi> from their <hi>lawful King</hi> to any <hi>Uſurper</hi> getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Poſſeſſion of the Throne, and to <hi>Fight under the
Uſurper againſt their lawful King,</hi> if he attempt to recover
his Crown.</p>
            <p>3ly. <hi>We may obſerve upon the view of this Statute that
one</hi> thing <hi>laid down in the</hi> Preamble, <hi>as the ground for the
indemnifying part of the Act, is</hi> expreſly falſe, viz. That
it is not reaſonable, but againſt all Laws, Reaſon, and Good
Conſcience, that the Subjects going with their Sovereign Lord
in Wars—<hi>(even though</hi> againſt the King de Jure <hi>as it muſt
be underſtood)</hi> any thing ſhould loſe or forfeit for doing this
their true Duty and Service of Allegiance. <hi>Now this if it be
meant (as it muſt be) concerning thoſe</hi> that Fight <hi>for an</hi>
Uſurper againſt their lawful King, <hi>that it is aginſt the</hi> Laws,
Reaſon, <hi>and good</hi> Conſcience <hi>to puniſh them in the leaſt for
ſo doing, is very high indeed. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Though <hi>our Law</hi> might think fit to Indemnify them,
yet it is not ſo clear that <hi>all other</hi> Laws, <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
even the Laws of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> do
make it unjuſt to puniſh them, who (not in the <hi>Simplicity</hi>
of their Hearts, but upon a <hi>Traytereus</hi> and <hi>Rebellious</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple)
fight in Defence of an <hi>Uſurper</hi> in the Throne againſt
their lawful <hi>Prince,</hi> excluded or depoſed from his juſt
<hi>Rights.</hi> It would not, I ſuppoſe, have been unlawful for
<hi>David</hi> to have puniſhed thoſe which came in Arms againſt
him, under <hi>Abſalom,</hi> to keep him from recovering his
Throne. Nor, I believe, would <hi>his Heart have ſmote hem</hi>
if he had executed any of them for Traytors, as it did
when he <hi>cut off</hi> Saul's <hi>Skirt.</hi> In ſhort, to ſay this is <hi>contrary
to Reaſon and Good Conſcience</hi> is to ſet up a new <hi>Standard</hi>
of Reaſon and Religion; and to make it <hi>contrary to all
Laws,</hi> is to accuſe all <hi>Nations</hi> but our own, of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and
<hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Nay, it is to accuſe <hi>our own</hi> Nation too, and
ſeveral of our <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and among the reſt
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> and his <hi>Firſt Parliament,</hi> who did not
think it againſt <hi>all Laws, Reaſon, and Good Conſcience</hi> to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">ſup. p.</note>
thoſe that fought againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> under <hi>Ric.</hi> the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53596:16"/>
3<hi>d the King in Poſſeſſion</hi> (and <hi>de Jure</hi> too againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 7<hi>th)</hi>
in <hi>Boſworth-Field.</hi> So that to me the <hi>wording</hi> of this Act ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to be a <hi>Copy of King Hen.</hi> 7<hi>th's countenance,</hi> who
could <hi>call to his remembrance</hi> that it <hi>is againſt all Laws,
Reaſon and good Conſcience,</hi> that the Subjects ſhould be
<hi>attainted</hi> for fighting <hi>under the King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and could
forget to repeal his own <hi>Statute,</hi> whereby thoſe that adhered
to <hi>Ric.</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> ſtood <hi>attainted</hi> for doing this their true <hi>Duty</hi>
and <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> And with what Face could he,
or his Parliament, ſay it was againſt <hi>all Laws,</hi> when it was
not againſt <hi>his own?</hi> When both <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>other Kings</hi>
before him, with their Parliaments had <hi>attainted</hi> both the
<hi>adherents</hi> of the <hi>Kings in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and the very <hi>Kings in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi>
themſelves?</p>
            <p>But granting this were <hi>the Body</hi> of the Statute, and <hi>a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi>
Law <hi>enacting</hi> that the Subjects <hi>ſhall pay their Allegiance
to an Uſurper in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and fight for him againſt their
lawful King, and be Indemnified for it: Then it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be conſidered, whether the Statute can be looked
upon as <hi>valid</hi> and <hi>obligatory.</hi> And I conceive it ought not
to be looked upon as valid and obligatory, upon theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it was made by an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> and a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
no farther <hi>Legal,</hi> than as it had its Authority from
him, and it was made for this <hi>end</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> to <hi>ſecure</hi> the
<hi>Uſurper</hi> himſelf in <hi>the Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Throne, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his Soldiers to his Party, by Indemnifying them, if
they ſtood by him, aud depriving them (by the Proviſo at
the end of the Statute) of the benefit of the Statute, if they
ſhould doſert him. That <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> was an <hi>Uſurper</hi> upon
the Rights of the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> I need not prove: And
that this Statute was made to <hi>ſecure</hi> him in his Uſurpation,
againſt any one pretending, or having Right and Title of

which was when <hi>Perkin</hi>

lawful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be objected that the ſubſequent lawful <hi>Kings</hi> have
conſented to this Statute. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They have not <hi>conſented</hi> to it any farther then by
their not <hi>expreſly repealing</hi> it, or <hi>declaring</hi> it to be <hi>null</hi> in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53596:17"/>
ſome of their Parliaments; and this does not amount to a
<hi>conſent.</hi> For their cauſe of their not repealing it, may be,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the ſubſequent Kings ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi>
have not had any occaſion to ſee the evil <hi>conſequences</hi> of
it, by any <hi>general complyance</hi> of the Nation, with an <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
againſt their <hi>lawful King,</hi> under colour of being <hi>obliged</hi>
thereto by this Statute. Secondly, The Statute has been
generally underſtood to do no more than <hi>Indemnifie</hi> thoſe
that fight under the <hi>King de Facto;</hi> and this our Kings might
not look upon as <hi>unjuſt,</hi> or <hi>inexpedient;</hi> and therefore might
ſee no neceſſity of repealing the Statute. But it cannot
be conceived, but that any <hi>lawful King</hi> who had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
or depoſed by an Uſurper, and had ſeen that the
Nation had looked upon themſelves as <hi>obliged</hi> by this
Act to <hi>ſtand by the Uſurper againſt him,</hi> would, if ever he
had come to the Crown, have made it his buſineſs to <hi>declare
it null and invalid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Statute has, in <hi>effect,</hi> been declared to be
<hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid,</hi> by the ſubſequent lawful <hi>Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
I ſay, it has been in effect declared null and invalid,
though <hi>not expreſly repealed,</hi> by the ſubſequent Kings and
Parliaments; and that in two ways,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By their <hi>proceeding</hi> expreſly <hi>contrary to the Letter</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their laying a <hi>contrary Obligation</hi> on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi>
of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By their <hi>proceeding</hi> expreſly <hi>contrary to the Letter</hi> of
this Statute. The Statute enacts, <q>That thoſe that ſerve
the King for the time being in his Wars, ſhall be in no wiſe
convict or attaint of High Treaſon by Act of Parliament,
or otherwiſe by any proceſs of Law: And that if any Act
or Acts, or other proceſs of Law, hereafter thereupon
for the ſame happen to be made, contrary to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that then that Act, or Acts, or other Proceſs of
the Law, whatſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and be utterly
void.</q> Now if notwithſtanding this, any Perſons have, for
acting that for which this Statute <hi>Indemnifies</hi> them, been
<hi>convicted</hi> and <hi>attainted</hi> of <hi>High Treaſon</hi> by Proceſs of <hi>Law,</hi>
and executed thereupon; and this Conviction and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and their execution thereupon, has been declared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53596:18"/>
by Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> to be Lawful and Juſt, and according to
the Laws of the Realm: It follows that the <hi>Authority</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they were convicted; attainted and executed, and their
attaindors confirmed in Parliament, muſt be looked upon
to declare this Statute <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid.</hi> And yet we did a
plain inſtance of this, in the caſe of the Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lund,
&amp;c.</hi> in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'<hi>s</hi> time. The Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi>
had been ſent down with an Army, by <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Council,</hi> and
by a <hi>Warrant</hi> under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> in behalf of Queen <hi>Jane,</hi>
the then <hi>alone Proclaimed</hi> Queen, againſt Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> for
this Treaſon he is afterwards tryed by his Peers, attainted,
and executed, and his attaindor confirmed in the next
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Mar. Seſſ. 2. c. 16.</note>Parliament, and therein he and other Perſons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to have been lawfully, juſtly, and according to the
Laws of the Realm convicted, or attainted, and to have
ſuffered the pains of Death according to their <hi>demerits.</hi> And
yet this could not be looked upon as according to Law, if
the <hi>Stat.</hi> 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. were looked upon as <hi>valid:</hi> Which
will more clearly appear if we conſider that the very <hi>Plea</hi>
of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſeems to be grounded on
this Statute. His Plea conſiſted in two points, which he
propoſed to the Court, one whereof was,<note n="b" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Hiſt. Reform. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 248. <hi>ld.</hi> Reflection on the 3<hi>d.</hi> and 4<hi>th.</hi> Tomes of Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> as <hi>p.</hi> 126. Though this was a point in Law that might have ſome <hi>colour</hi> in it, yet it was far from <hi>confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any;</hi> for a <hi>Council,</hi> or a <hi>Great Seal</hi> flowing from an <hi>Uſurper</hi> is <hi>nothing;</hi> ſo this Authorty could not juſtify him.</note> Whether a
Man acting by the Authority of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and the
<hi>Order</hi> of the Privy Council, could become thereby guilty
of <hi>Treaſon?</hi> To this the <hi>Court,</hi> with the advice of the <hi>Judges,</hi>
made anſwer, That the <hi>Great Seal</hi> of one that was not
lawful <hi>Quen</hi> could give no <hi>Authority</hi> nor <hi>Indemnity</hi> to thoſe
that acted on ſuch a Warrant. Now if this Plea were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
over-ruled upon this Ground, and he thereupon
attainted and executed, and his attaindor confirmed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as Juſt and Legal; it plainly follows that the
<hi>Judges</hi> and and his <hi>Peers</hi> which over-ruled his Plea, and the
<hi>Parliament</hi> which confirmed their proceedings, do in effect
declare the <hi>Statute</hi> 11 <hi>H</hi> 7. <hi>null and invalid,</hi> and muſt be
conceived, either not to have <hi>though</hi> of it, or if they did
to have looked upon it either as <hi>temporary</hi> only for King
<hi>Henry</hi>'<hi>s</hi> Reign, or as of no Force or <hi>Authority,</hi> becauſe tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>diſheriſon</hi> of the lawful <hi>Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53596:18"/>
But it may be ſaid, <hi>Queen Jane</hi> was not in <hi>full Poſſeſſion</hi>
of the Crown, being only <hi>Proclaimed</hi> Queen, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in the Throne more then ten days. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> She was Proclaimed Queen by the <hi>Lords of the
Council</hi> and by the <hi>City,</hi> and in moſt <hi>great Places</hi> of the
Kingdom, and had taken upon her the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the
Government, and had her <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Great Seal, &amp;c.</hi> And
if this be not <hi>enough</hi> to make her <hi>Queen in Poſſeſſion,</hi> it is to
be ſhewed what <hi>more</hi> was neceſſary to make her ſo, and
upon what <hi>Grounds;</hi> eſpecially, when it appears, that
<hi>Queen Mary</hi> her ſelf was no more then <hi>Proclaimed,</hi> when
the <hi>Duke of Northumberland, &amp;c.</hi> was tryed, attainted
and executed by <hi>her Authority:</hi> Neither was ſhe <hi>ſo much as
Proclaimed,</hi> when he committed this Treaſon againſt her,
for immediately after ſhe was Proclaimed by the Lords of
the Council, he, before he received their Orders, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and<note n="a" place="margin">Dr. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's hiſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. P. 2. p. 239.</note> 
               <hi>Proclaimed her himſelf</hi> at <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this be ſufficient to take off the Argument
from the Proceedings againſt the <hi>Duke,</hi> then <hi>this</hi> rather
ſhould be the <hi>Ground</hi> whereupon his Plea was <hi>over-ruled,</hi>
but it is plain that both his <hi>Plea,</hi> and the <hi>Anſwer</hi> the Court
made to it by the Advice of the Judges, ſuppoſe <hi>Queen Jane</hi> to
have been <hi>Queen in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and his Plea was not over-ruled
becauſe ſhe was not in <hi>full Poſſeſſion,</hi> but becauſe ſhe was not
<hi>lawful Queen,</hi> and therefore her <hi>Great Seal could give no</hi>
Authority, <hi>nor</hi> Indemnity <hi>to thoſe that acted by ſuch a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
And if this Ground be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> (as we ſee it
was conceived to be by the <hi>Judges,</hi> and allowed of by the
<hi>Peers</hi> and the <hi>Parliament)</hi> it plainly <hi>nulls</hi> King <hi>Henry's
Statute</hi> and juſtifies the <hi>Attainting</hi> for Treaſon any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that fights againſt a <hi>King de jure out of Poſſeſſion,</hi> though
by a Warrant under the <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> and an Order from
the <hi>Council</hi> of an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper in full Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. has been in effect <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
null</hi> by the <hi>ſucceeding lawful Kings</hi> and Parliaments,
in as much as they have laid the <hi>contrary obligation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conſciences of the Subjects. For if the ſucceeding
Kings and Parliaments have expreſsly made it High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to <hi>ſtand by any Uſurper</hi> againſt the <hi>King de jure</hi> or his
Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, whom the Uſurper has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
or excluded from the Crown; if they have obliged
the Subjects to <hi>Swear to maintain</hi> the <hi>King de jure</hi> and his
lwful Heirs and Succeſſors <hi>againſt</hi> any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> who ſhall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53596:19"/>
depoſe or exclude them: Then herein they have obliged
the Subjects <hi>to act contrary</hi> to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi>
which requires them to <hi>maintain and defend the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the lawful King,</hi> his Heirs and Succeſſors. Now that
the Succeeding Kings and Parliaments ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi>
have done this, will appear from clear and undenyable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They have expreſsly made it High Treaſon to
<hi>ſtand by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper againſt the King,</hi> or his Heirs and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Succeſſors, whom the Uſurper has depoſed or excluded.
This is done by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. in the ſeveral Acts<note n="a" place="margin">Stat. 25. H. 8. c. 12. 28. H. 8. c. 7. 35. H. 8. c. 1.</note> for
the ſecurity of his <hi>Succeſſion</hi> made in the 25, 28, and 35<hi>th.</hi>
Years of his Reign in each whereof after the Settlement of
the Succeſſion, it is made Treaſon for any Perſons to <hi>do
any thing whereby</hi> either the <hi>King himſelf,</hi> or his <hi>Heirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Settlement,</hi> may be <hi>diſturbed or interrupted</hi> in
the enjoyment or inheritance of the Crown; and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in all that ſhould <hi>abbet, aid or maintain them.</hi> And in
the Act 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is enacted, that <hi>if any of the Kings
Children, or any to whom he ſhould diſpoſe the Crown by his
Will ſhould <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſarpe</hi> upon any who were to inherit the
Crown before them, they and all their <hi>abettors and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
ſhould be adjudged High Traitors.</hi> So alſo 1 <hi>Edw.</hi>
the 6. it is made Treaſon <hi>for any to whom the Crown was
limited by the Act</hi> 35 H. 8. <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpe upon one another,</hi>
and Treaſon alſo in their <hi>Abettors, Aiders and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers.</hi>
I do not pretend to <hi>juſtifie</hi> the Proceedings of <hi>Hen.</hi>
the 8<hi>th,</hi> and his Parliaments touching the <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> only
this I may rightly infer from them, that they without any
regard to the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7<hi>th,</hi> made it Treaſon to
<hi>maintain</hi> any one in <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, but thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who ſhould ſucceed <hi>according to the limitations</hi> made
by them; and therefore did not leave the Subjects free
to yield their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> according to King <hi>Hen</hi> the 7<hi>th</hi>'<hi>s</hi>
Statute, to <hi>every Perſon</hi> whatſoever that ſhould get <hi>into
Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>They have obliged the Subjects</hi> to ſwear to
maintain and defend the King and his lawful Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
againſt any Uſurper <hi>that ſhould depoſe or exclude
them. So each Act for the Settlement of the</hi> Succeſſion <hi>in</hi>
King Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th's <hi>time, had an</hi> Oath <hi>annexed to be
taken by the Subjects for the obſervance and defence and
maintenance of it. I ſhall ſet down the</hi> firſt<note n="a" place="margin">Stat. 26. H. 8. c. 2.</note> Oath <hi>(from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53596:19"/>
which the others vary but little, only in that of the</hi> 35th
H. 8. <hi>the</hi> Pope's Supremacy <hi>is abjured)</hi> ye ſhall ſwear
to bear faith, truth and obedience al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nely to the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and to his Heirs of his Body of Queen <hi>Ann</hi> begotten, or to
be begotten, and further to the Heirs of our Sovereign Lord
according to the limitation in the Statute made for ſurety of his
Succeſſion—and not to any other within this Realm, nor Foreign
Authority or Potentate—and that to your cunning wit, and to
the uttermoſt of your Power, without guile, fraud or other
undue means, ye ſhall obſerve, keep, maintain and defend the
ſaid Act of Succeſſion, and all the whole effects and contents
thereof—And this ye ſhall de againſt all manner of Perſons
of what Eſtate, dignity, degree or condition whatſoever they
be. And in no wiſe do, or attempt, nor to you Power
ſuffer to be done or attempted directly or indirectly any thing
to the let, hindrance, damage or derogation thereof, by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of means, or for any manner of pretence. So help you God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Oath <hi>and others of the like form were annexed to
the Acts about the</hi> Succeſſion <hi>in</hi> King Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th's <hi>time,
to be taken by the Subjects; and it is plain they laid
an obligation upon their Conſciences directly,</hi> contrary
to the Stat. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>They are obliged to pay their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to</hi> no other Perſon <hi>Native or Foreigner, but the</hi>
King and his Heirs according to thoſe Acts: <hi>And therefore
cannot be at liberty to pay their Allegiance to</hi> every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>that gets</hi> into Poſſeſſion <hi>of the Crown. They are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with their</hi> utmoſt Wit and Power to maintain thoſe Acts
of Succeſſion againſt all manner of Perſons whatſoever, and
therefore <hi>cannot fight againſt the</hi> King de jure <hi>H.</hi> 8. or his
Heirs according to thoſe Acts, in defence of any other Perſon,
<hi>though he may become the</hi> King for the time being. <hi>They
are to their Power</hi> not to ſuffer any thing to be done in dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of thoſe Acts, <hi>and therefore</hi> not to ſuffer any Perſon in
the Throne, <hi>that gets into it</hi> contrary to them: <hi>So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they can</hi> reconcile contradictions, <hi>their obligation to</hi>
theſe Acts <hi>is inconſiſtent with any obligation to King</hi> Henry
<hi>the</hi> 7th's Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the ſame Argument, to come nearer to</hi> our own time,
<hi>may be drawn from the</hi> Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance
<hi>enacted in Parliament by Queen</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Stat. 1 Eliz. c. 1. 3 Jac. c. 4.</note> Elizabeth <hi>and</hi> K. James,
<hi>whereby the Subjects are alſo ſworn, to bear</hi> Faith and
true Allegiance to the King his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors,
and him and them to defend to the utmoſt of their Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53596:20"/>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> 
               <hi>all Conſpiracies</hi> and Attempts whatſoever: <hi>which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with their</hi> transferring their Allegiance <hi>to an</hi> Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>and</hi> maintaining <hi>him</hi> in Poſſeſſion <hi>of the Crown againſt
the</hi> lawful King <hi>depoſed, or his</hi> Heir <hi>excluded by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid that our <hi>ſworn Allegiance</hi> is ſuch
only as is due by the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land, if therefore the
Law transfers our Allegiance from the <hi>lawful King and his
Heirs to a King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> then our Allegiance muſt be
underſtood to be ſworn to them with that reſerve. I anſwer,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> The Oaths impoſed by the <hi>Acts of Succeſſion</hi> in <hi>H.</hi>
the 8<hi>th</hi>'<hi>s</hi> time do plainly <hi>contradict</hi> the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and
the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy and Allegiance</hi> made by Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> muſt be underſtood to do ſo too,
being partly couched in the ſame words, and the <hi>Oath</hi> of
<hi>Supremacy</hi> drawn from the <hi>former</hi> Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by the Stat. 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and both equally intended for the
<hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>lawful King</hi> and the <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> and therefore,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> When a <hi>ſubſequent Statute</hi> impoſes an Oath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory</hi>
to the <hi>Letter</hi> of a <hi>former Statute,</hi> it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
<hi>virtually to repeal</hi> that former Statute. So for
inſtance the Stat. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. obliges the Subjects to
ſwear to <hi>maintain</hi> the Settlement of the Succeſſion made
by that Statute, even <hi>againſt</hi> any of the <hi>King's Children that
ſhall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp the Crown</hi> before their time; how can this be
underſtood with a <hi>reſerve,</hi> that if any of them ſhould <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp
and get into the Throne,</hi> the Subjects then ſhould be
obliged <hi>to abett and maintain them:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But 3<hi>ly.</hi> the Queſtion is not ſo much, whether the
ſucceeding Kings and Parliaments have <hi>repealed</hi> the Statute
11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as whether they have not <hi>looked upon it</hi> always as
<hi>null</hi> and of <hi>no Authority:</hi> and I think their paſſing <hi>Acts of
Attaindor, contrary to the Letter of it,</hi> and making it Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to <hi>ſtand by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> and obliging the Subjects to
<hi>Swear to defend the lawful King and the Succeſſion againſt
all Perſons whatſoever,</hi> is a ſufficient proof that our Kings
and Parliaments ever ſince the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. have <hi>look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon</hi> the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as of <hi>no Authority,</hi> and in
<hi>effect declared</hi> it to be <hi>null and invalid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. But granting that this Statute was made by a <hi>Legal
Authority,</hi> and has ſtood ever ſince <hi>unrepealed,</hi> I proceed
to ſhew in the ſecond place that it is to be looked upon as
<hi>in it ſelf null and invalid</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>matter</hi> of it.
A Statute though made at firſt by a <hi>lawful Authority,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53596:20"/>
not after <hi>repealed</hi> by any ſubſequent Parliament, may yet
be looked upon as <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invallid,</hi> if the <hi>matter</hi> of it
be <hi>impoſſible</hi> or <hi>unjuſt,</hi> if it be repugnant to <hi>Common Senſe</hi>
or <hi>contrary to the Law of God and Nature.</hi> So the Lord
Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> obſerves <hi>(Inflit. P.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 587.) in his
Commentary upon the <hi>Stat. de aſportatis Religioſorum one
branch</hi> of which Statute he ſays was <hi>declared by the Court of
Common-Pleas to be void,</hi> becauſe <hi>impoſſible and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to be obſerved,</hi> and quotes <hi>Bracton</hi> for the Properties
of a Law, <hi>Lex eſt ſanctio juſta, jubens honeſta, &amp; prohibens
contraria;</hi> It may be therefore a ſufficient proof of the
nullity of this Statute, that it is not, as <hi>Bracton</hi> requires,
<hi>Sanctio juſta, jubens honeſta &amp; prohibens contraria;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as I ſhall proceed to ſhew, a Statute <hi>eſtabliſhing Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
by a Law.</hi> For it either <hi>deveſts</hi> the lawful King of
his <hi>Right to the Crown,</hi> and gives it to the Uſurper; or
it ſtill <hi>reſerves his right to him,</hi> but yet notwithſtanding,
orders the Subjects to <hi>obey and ſtand by the King in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
tho an Uſurper. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe cannot fairly be
pretended, for if it <hi>gives away the Right</hi> of the lawful
King; then,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> He <hi>ceaſes to be King de jure,</hi> the lawful and rightful
King of this Realm, and this (beſides that it is contrary to
what our Lawyers allow) takes away the ground of this
whole diſpute, the <hi>diſtinction between King de jure and the
King de facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> He cannot then juſtly <hi>make War</hi> upon the Nation
for the <hi>recovery</hi> of his Crown, but muſt ſit down quietly
by his loſs, and is anſwerable for all the <hi>Blood</hi> that is ſhed
in the <hi>War</hi> he makes, if he attempt to <hi>reſtore himſelf by a
Foreign Force:</hi> for if his Right be <hi>tranferred</hi> he cannot then
juſtly <hi>demand</hi> the Subjects <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and what he cannot
juſtly <hi>demand,</hi> that he has no right to uſe force for the
<hi>recovery</hi> of; and therefore muſt be content to ſtay till the
Uſurper <hi>dye,</hi> and then perhaps his Right may <hi>revive</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
unleſs the Uſurper be ſo wiſe as to provide himſelf a
Succeſſor, and leave him <hi>in Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> It will follow (if this Statute give away the Right of
the lawful King to the Uſurper) that <hi>one King</hi> with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
may make a <hi>Statute</hi> to <hi>alienate</hi> and transfer the
Right to the Crown, from thoſe that are the <hi>lawful Kings</hi>
by the <hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> of the Realm, to ſuch as
by the <hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> are not the lawful Kings,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53596:21"/>
but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> Now this I conceive is not in the Power of
any <hi>King and Parliament</hi> however <hi>Legal,</hi> much leſs of
ſuch as <hi>Henry</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> and his Parliament was. We have a
<hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> whereby <hi>England</hi> is determined
to be a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that antecedently to any <hi>Statute
Lan.</hi> This <hi>Conſtitution</hi> veſts a <hi>Right</hi> in ſome certain
Perſon in every Age, who is by Vertue of the Right veſted
in him the <hi>lawful and rightful King</hi> of this Realm, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Perſon be he <hi>next in Blood to</hi> the former King, or
another of the Royal Line to whom the Crown deſcends
by Vertue of a <hi>Limitation of the Succeſſion</hi> from the <hi>next in
Blood to him;</hi> for whether the one or the other of theſe is
the rightful King, he is ſo by Vertue of the <hi>Fundamental
Conſtitution,</hi> which veſts the right to the Crown in him.
Now for any one King with a Parliament to make a <hi>Law,</hi>
that for the future not the <hi>next Heir</hi> of the Blood nor any
<hi>other</hi> to whom the Succeſſion is <hi>limited,</hi> but any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
that ſhall get <hi>into Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Throne, tho it be by
<hi>depoſing</hi> a rightful King regnant and <hi>uſurping</hi> his Crown,
ſhall from thence forth become the <hi>rightful</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi>
King, and the right of the Prince that he has diſpoſſeſs'd
be <hi>devolved</hi> upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> is effectually to <hi>ſubvert</hi>
the <hi>Fundamental Conſtitution</hi> of the Realm: and if it be in
the Power of the King regnant, and his Parliament to do
this, then it follows that any King with a Parliament may
deprive the <hi>lawful Iſſue</hi> of his <hi>Brother</hi> and ſet up a <hi>Baſtard
of his own;</hi> that they may exclude and diſinherit the
whole <hi>Royal Line</hi> and entail the Crown upon the <hi>King of
France</hi> or any other <hi>Foreign</hi> Prince, they may lay aſide
the whole right of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and make the Monarchy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive:
that they may change the form of the Government
into a <hi>Republick,</hi> and make the Kings no more then <hi>Conſuls</hi>
or <hi>Dukes of Venice;</hi> and veſt the Supreme Authority in the
<hi>Senate or People:</hi> In ſhort, that <hi>England</hi> is no longer a
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Hereditary,</hi> then the <hi>King regnant</hi> and his
<hi>Parliament pleaſes.</hi> And yet if theſe things were done by
any King and Parliament, I believe it would be looked
upon as an <hi>Injury</hi> to the <hi>ſubſequent Kings</hi> or to the <hi>Royal
Line,</hi> and they would be juſtified if they would not allow
any ſuch <hi>Statute</hi> to have <hi>any force</hi> but proteſt againſt it as
<hi>Illegal</hi> and of <hi>no Authority:</hi> and yet all this might be done
<hi>according to Law,</hi> if the King and Parliament have a

            <p>But I needed not to have <hi>proved</hi> this, which is <hi>ſuppoſed</hi>
in the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Statute does not <hi>give away
the Right</hi> of the lawful King depoſed or excluded, but
ſtill leaves him King <hi>de jure,</hi> and reſerves to him a right
to <hi>claim</hi> and <hi>recover his Crown;</hi> only it obliges the <hi>Subjects</hi>
notwithſtanding to <hi>ſtand by the King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though
an Uſurper. I ſhall therefore proceed upon this <hi>Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and ſhew that this Statute as it requires the Subjects to
ſtand by the Uſurper in Poſſeſſion againſt their rightful
and lawful King, is to be looked upon as <hi>in it ſelf null</hi>
and <hi>invalid.</hi> And this I underſtand not of the Caſe of
an <hi>intricate diſpute</hi> about the Title to the Crown, where
the Subjects cannot diſcern who has the Right, but of the
caſe where a King whoſe Right to the Crown is <hi>clear and
undoubted,</hi> is excluded or depoſed by an Uſurper. And I
conceive the Statute, as underſtood of this caſe, null and
invalid upon theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> It implies a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> that ſuch a Perſon ſhould
be ſtill the <hi>King de jure,</hi> and yet the Subjects (knowing
him to be ſo) ſhould be obliged to pay their Allegiance to
<hi>another.</hi> For if he is a <hi>King de jure</hi> he has a <hi>Right,</hi> and
that Right is to <hi>ſomthing or other,</hi> but there is nothing he
can have a Right to as King, but the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he ſhould be their <hi>Governour</hi> and they his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>
unleſs we will ſay he has a Right only to the <hi>material
Crown</hi> and <hi>Scepter,</hi> and not to that, which they are only
the <hi>Enſigns</hi> of, the <hi>Government</hi> of the Nation. And if
he has a <hi>Right,</hi> then the Subjects, knowing him to have
it, muſt be under an <hi>Obligation</hi> anſwering to that Right.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> The <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Subjects is <hi>proprium quarto

3<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Subjects, and <hi>ſome parts</hi> of
it eſpecially, are due to the <hi>lawful King only,</hi> by the Law
of <hi>Nature:</hi> and therefore no <hi>Human Law,</hi> can take the
<hi>whole</hi> Allegiance of the Subjects, or the <hi>indiſpenſable parts
of it,</hi> away from him and transfer them to the Uſurper.
The Law of <hi>Nature</hi> extends it ſelf to all the <hi>Conditions</hi>
and <hi>Relations</hi> of Men: it conſiders them as <hi>Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
with relation to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>themſelves only,</hi> and there
preſcribes to them the Duties of <hi>Godlineſs and Sobriety:</hi>
It conſiders them as in a <hi>Family,</hi> and there preſcribes the
Duties of <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Parents</hi> to their
<hi>Children, Husbands</hi> to their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> to their
<hi>Husbands, Maſters</hi> to their <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> to their
<hi>Maſters:</hi> It conſiders them as in a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> and there
preſcribes to <hi>Subjects</hi> their Duty to their <hi>Prince</hi> and to the
<hi>Prince</hi> his Duty towards his <hi>Subjects.</hi> The Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
does not <hi>make one Man King and the reſt his Subjects;</hi>
but when it once <hi>finds them made ſo</hi> (whether by their
own or any other Perſons Act) then it lays before them
ſome <hi>Duties</hi> which they are to Practice, whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Laws of the Realm enjoyn them or not, and ſuch
as no <hi>Human Authority</hi> can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with as long as they
ſtand in that <hi>Relation.</hi> Now theſe Duties on the <hi>Subjects</hi>
part are ſignified by the Words <hi>Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
And ſo we find my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays <hi>(Calvin's</hi> Caſe, <hi>f.</hi> 13.)
That <hi>Ligeance, Faith and Obedience of the Subjects to their
Sovereign was before any municipal or judicial Laws. Iſt. For
that Government and Subjection were long before any munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
or judicial Laws. 2ly, For that it had been in vain to
have preſcribed Laws to any, but to ſuch as ought obedience,
Faith and Ligeance before, in reſpect whereof they were bound
to obſerve them.</hi> And from this he draws this Conſequence,
<hi>ſeeing then that Faith, Obedience and Ligeance are due by
the Law of Nature, it followeth that the ſame cannot be
changed or taken away.</hi> It is therefore plain and undeniable
that there are ſome Duties owing <hi>by Nature</hi> to that Perſon
who is our <hi>lawful Prince</hi> by the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and theſe Duties at leaſt <hi>as far as they can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>
for his <hi>real Service</hi> are due to him as long as he is
ſuppoſed to <hi>continue</hi> our lawful Prince. And upon this
ground we may juſtly pronounce the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>null</hi>
and <hi>invald:</hi> for it ſuppoſes the excluded or depoſed
Prince to be ſtill the <hi>rightful</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> King, and
yet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53596:22"/>
1<hi>st.</hi> This Statute tranfers the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>entire Allegiance</hi>
of the Subjects from the <hi>rightful</hi> King to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi> Now
tho the Statute of the Realm may in ſome caſes <hi>diſengage</hi>
the Subjects from doing <hi>ſome</hi> Offices to their King which
otherwiſe their <hi>natural</hi> Duty would call upon them to
perform, yet no human Law can take away <hi>all their Duty</hi>
from him, without being directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Law of
Nature,</hi> and conſequently <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> This Statute obliges the Subjects to deny their
rightful King thoſe <hi>parts</hi> of their Allegiance which are
moſt <hi>indiſpenſable,</hi> and to act quite <hi>contrary</hi> to them.
There can be no part of the Subjects Duty more <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable</hi>
then to <hi>defend the lawful King's Perſon, Crown and
Dignity,</hi> to maintain his Right and Title to the Crown
who is to defend his Subjects Right to their Lives and
Eſtates. For thus they are to <hi>hazard their Lives in Battle</hi>
againſt his Enemies, and that not only in <hi>One</hi> Battle, but
alſo in a <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third,</hi> and though in all they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
yet if they can they are obliged to raiſe <hi>New Forces,</hi>
to make head <hi>once more</hi> againſt the Enemy. Neither is
there any more reaſon why they ſhould wholly give up
their Princes cauſe when an Uſurper has <hi>got into the
Throne,</hi> then there is that they ſhould deſert him upon his
<hi>looſing the firſt Battle:</hi> for then they are <hi>diſabled at preſent</hi>
to ſtand up againſt the Uſurper and to meet him in the
Field, and yet that does not free them from their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Fight him again</hi> as ſoon as they have <hi>Forces</hi> enough
and <hi>Opportunity</hi> to do it: and if the Uſurper become not
only <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Field</hi> but the <hi>Throne</hi> too, this is only
a <hi>higher degree of Succeſs</hi> and a greater Victory, which puts
the Subjects in a greater <hi>incapacity</hi> to aſſert the cauſe of
their injured Prince, but does not free them from their
obligation to aſſert his juſt Right to the Crown when they
are <hi>capable.</hi> They are therefore ſtill under an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
obligation to <hi>reſtore</hi> their rightful King to his Throne
when they have ſufficient <hi>Strength,</hi> and a fair <hi>Opportunity</hi>
preſents it ſelf to them.</p>
            <p>But their Obligation to do this will farther be clear if we
conſider the Subjects in <hi>a double regard;</hi> as,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Thoſe that were truly <hi>Loyal</hi> and did not contribute
to the depoſing or exlcuding their rightful King and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up the Uſurper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53596:23"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> Thoſe that <hi>rebelled</hi> againſt their rightful Prince and
ſet up the Uſurper in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>The <hi>former</hi> are obliged to <hi>reſtore</hi> their lawful Prince to
his Right when they have force enough and opportunity
to do it, becauſe their <hi>Allegiance</hi> does not <hi>ceaſe</hi> upon their
King's being out of Poſſeſſion of his Throne, but it is
only under a <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> as far as they are under an <hi>Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
of exerting it for his Service, and revives again as
ſoon as they find themſelves in a <hi>capacity</hi> of acting. But
the others are obliged to it upon a <hi>double</hi> account. Firſt by
Vertue of <hi>Allegiance.</hi> Secondly by Vertue of that <hi>Law of
Nature</hi> which requires every Man to make <hi>reſtitution</hi> for
the <hi>Injuries</hi> he has done to any other, and therefore obliges
them that contributed to the <hi>depoſing</hi> or <hi>excluding</hi> their
rightful King to make him <hi>recompenſe</hi> for that Injury by
their being as active in <hi>bringing him back</hi> into the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Crown. If therefore to reſtore their rightful
King be an <hi>indiſpenſable Duty</hi> incumbent by the <hi>Law of
Nature</hi> upon his <hi>Loyal</hi> and much more upon his <hi>Diſloyal</hi>
Subjects: then the <hi>Stat.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invallid</hi> as
<hi>contrary to Nature:</hi> for it ſuppoſes the King out of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to have a <hi>Right,</hi> and yet obliges the Subjects not to
<hi>pay him his right</hi> when they are capable: It ſuppoſes them
that depoſed or excluded him to have <hi>done him wrong,</hi>
and yet obliges them not <hi>to reſtore him to his Right,</hi> nor
to make him any <hi>Reparation</hi> for the <hi>Injury</hi> they have
done him.</p>
            <p>But if this be <hi>unjuſt,</hi> to oblige his Subjects <hi>not to help</hi>
him to the recovery of his Right, it is not only ſo, but
<hi>Inhumane</hi> and <hi>Barbarous</hi> to oblige them by Vertue of their
Allegiance to <hi>Fight againſt him</hi> in Defence of the Uſurper,
and to <hi>oppoſe him to the Death,</hi> if he attempt to recover
his Crown without their Aſſiſtance. For how can his
<hi>Misfortune</hi> in the loſs of his Crown, while his <hi>Right</hi> to it
ſtands as good as ever, create ſuch a change in regard of
their Obligation to him, that they ſhould now be bound
to <hi>Fight him to the Death,</hi> for whom they were ſo lately
obliged <hi>to hazard their Lives.</hi> Is he ſtill their <hi>lawful King</hi>
and the King in Poſſeſſion an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper?</hi> how can it then be
conſiſtent with the common Principles of <hi>Humanity</hi> to
oblige them who were born his Subjects <hi>to Fight for his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53596:23"/>
Enemy againſt him,</hi> upon no other change of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
but only his being <hi>unjuſtly deprived</hi> of his Crown?
This is contrary to the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe it obliges the Subjects to fight in an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi>
againſt a <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous Cauſe,</hi> againſt the Perſon that
<hi>has the Right</hi> for him that <hi>has it not,</hi> but is Guilty of the
higheſt Injuſtice and Violence: for him that <hi>has no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
to commiſſionate the Subjects to act under him,
againſt him that is <hi>invested</hi> with that Authority.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe it makes the <hi>ſame thing</hi> juſt and unjuſt,
and the <hi>ſame Perſons</hi> both Loyal Subjects and Rebels and
Traytors in the very <hi>ſame Cauſe,</hi> for conſider it either in
regard to thoſe that depoſed or excluded their King and
ſet up an Uſurper, or to thoſe that ſtood firm to their
Allegiance. It ſuppoſes the former to be <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in depoſing</hi> or <hi>excluding</hi> their King, and yet makes them
<hi>Loyal Subjects in ſtanding by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> and oppoſing their
lawful Kings return: it ſuppoſes the latter to be <hi>Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
for <hi>defending</hi> their King's Perſon and Crown, and yet
makes them Rebels for attempting to <hi>reſtore</hi> him to his
Crown tho his <hi>Right</hi> be ſtill <hi>the ſame</hi> and as good as ever.
To be ſhort, what is it that makes the Subjects that depoſe
their King and ſet up an Uſurper Rebels and Traytors <hi>in
the very act</hi> of depoſing him and ſiding with the Uſurper?
Is it not their <hi>withdrawing</hi> from him that <hi>Allegiance</hi> which
is due to him and giving it to another? and what is it that
makes the others Loyal Subjects, but their <hi>adhering firm</hi>
to their <hi>Allegiance?</hi> And how then ſhall the one become
<hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects by continuing in the ſame act of <hi>Treachery</hi>
and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and others <hi>Rebels</hi> by continuing in the
ſame Act of <hi>Loyalty?</hi> And might not ſuch a Law as well
oblige a Man to fight againſt his own <hi>Father</hi> in Defence
of an <hi>Adulterer</hi> that has <hi>turned him out of Doors,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Lord it over his <hi>Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this will ſtill appear more unjuſt and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if we compare the <hi>King'S Caſe</hi> with the <hi>Caſe of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
as to what <hi>Protection</hi> he is obliged to give them. The
King is obliged to maintain his Subjects in their Rights
and Properties againſt any Invader, and that not only
while they are <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> of them, but alſo when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has <hi>diſſeized</hi> them by fraud or violence: Then the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53596:24"/>
King is obliged to <hi>relieve</hi> the injured Perſon, to do him
<hi>juſtice</hi> againſt the <hi>oppreſſor,</hi> and to <hi>reſtore</hi> him again to his
right by <hi>Law</hi> or by <hi>Force;</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> in a <hi>Legal Tryal</hi> of
the Cauſe, and award of judgment: by Force, by ordering
a <hi>Poſſe comitatus</hi> to Execute the Sentence of his Courts, and
to <hi>reinſtate</hi> his Subjects in the Poſſeſſion of their Rights.
Nay he is obliged to hazzard his own <hi>Sacred Perſon and
Crown,</hi> in a Caſe <hi>of neceſſity</hi> in Defence of his Subjects, to
engage himſelf in a <hi>War with a Foreign Prince or State,</hi>
for an injury done to his <hi>Merchants in their Trade and
Commerce,</hi> to Reſcue his Subjects from the Oppreſſion of
a Powerful <hi>Faction</hi> at home, or the Plunder and Rapine
of an <hi>Army</hi> from abroad, <hi>to Head their Armies,</hi> and <hi>Fight
their Battels himſelf</hi> in Perſon, which we find looked upon in

               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 20.</note> as a <hi>Principal</hi> part of the <hi>Kingly Office,</hi> and not <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 183. 21. 17.</note>
with but out of regard rather to the <hi>Public Intereſt,</hi>
then the King's <hi>Perſonal Eaſe or Safety.</hi> And how unjuſt
and inhuman would ſuch a Law be taken to be, which
ſhould enact, that while the <hi>Subjects are in Poſſeſſion</hi> of
their Eſtates and Liberties, the King ſhould be obliged to
Protect and Defend them againſt any Oppreſſor or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
But if they were once <hi>Ejected, Robbed, Plundered</hi> or
<hi>Enſlaved,</hi> and their Eſtates or Perſons in the Poſſeſſion of
another, that then the King ſhould <hi>not be obliged to concern
himſelf</hi> any farther for them, but rather on the contrary
<hi>to maintain the Oppreſſor or Invader,</hi> in the Poſſeſſion of
what he has gotten by fraud or violence? And if ſuch a
Law were <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>inhumane</hi> in the Caſe of a <hi>Subject,</hi> ſhall
it be <hi>juſt and obligatory</hi> in the Caſe of a <hi>Prince?</hi> Shall his
Right be ſo <hi>precarious,</hi> and his Subjects Rights ſo <hi>ſecured</hi> to
them, that he ſhall be obliged <hi>to reſtore</hi> them, and they
obliged <hi>to keep him out?</hi> He obliged to Defend them againſt
any <hi>Oppreſſor or Invader,</hi> and they obliged to ſtand by an
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> againſt him?</p>
            <p>All theſe Reaſons ſhew that the Law, <hi>as it is now urged</hi>
(not as <hi>indemnifying</hi> only thoſe that act under the King in
Poſſeſſion, but as obliging the Subjects <hi>in point of Conſcience,</hi>
to ſtand by the King in Poſſeſſion againſt the King <hi>de jure)
is unreaſonable, unjuſt and inhuman:</hi> And then it is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Man, though it were of the moſt lawful King
and Parliament, can oblige the Subjects to ſuch a
Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53596:24"/>
But to all this it may be ſaid, that it were indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
thus to oblige the Subjects to transfer their Allegiance
from the rightful King, were it not that the <hi>Public Good
and Peace of the Nation,</hi> required it to be ſo; that when
an Uſurper is once ſettled in the Poſſeſſion of the Crown, all
that <hi>Bloodſhed and Confuſion</hi> may be prevented, which would
be the conſequence of the Subjects attempting to <hi>diſpoſſeſs
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper and to reſtore the King de jure.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The King is worth ten thouſand<note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> of his Subjects,
ſo that he is not to be <hi>kept out of his Right,</hi> meerly for
their <hi>eaſe and quiet:</hi> Elſe they might as well ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the trouble and hazzard of fighting for the King in
Poſſeſſion, and oblige him to decide his quarrel with the
<hi>King de jure,</hi> or any Foreign Prince by a <hi>Private Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>great part</hi> of the Nation in an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> are
ſuch as have <hi>forfeited their lives</hi> by Treaſon and Rebellion,
by their deſerting or their riſing up againſt their lawful
King: Therefore no reaſon <hi>as to them</hi> at leaſt, that a Law
ſhould be made to ſet aſide the Lawful Prince's Right for
their eaſe and quiet, to exclude him from a <hi>Poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his Crown,</hi> that they may freely enjoy the <hi>Fruits
of their Treachery and Rebellion</hi> under the Uſurper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But then ſuch a Law (if we look <hi>beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time,</hi> when the Uſurper is newly got into Poſſeſſion)
does not ſo much contribute to the <hi>Peace and Security</hi> as
it does in all human proſpect, to the <hi>diſturbance and ruin</hi>
of the Nation. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It obliges the exiled Prince to endeavour to obtain
<hi>Foreign Aſſiſtance</hi> for the recovery of his Crown, and gives
a juſt right to any Foreign Prince to make War upon the
Uſurper, and the Nation in the exiled Prince's behalf, as he
is unjuſtly deprived of his Crown. Now this puts the
Nation in continual danger, as long as the Uſurpation
laſts, of being <hi>Conquered and brought under a Foreign Yoke,</hi>
and being made a prey to <hi>Mercenary Souldiers,</hi> who mind
nothing but Plunder and Rapine, having no regard for a
Country which is not their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It gives all encouragement <hi>to Ambitious Spirits
to attempt upon the Crown,</hi> when they find it by ſuch a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53596:25"/>
Statute as this, made as it were the <hi>Prize</hi> of any <hi>one that
can win it by Force,</hi> and he that gets it by unjuſt violence,
is as ſecure as he that has the moſt lawful Title, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
being as much obliged to ſtand by him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It does not only keep out the Lawful King, but
alſo precludes his <hi>Heirs</hi> too from the <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> For there
is no Uſurper but after he has ſettled himſelf in the Throne,
makes it his next buſineſs to <hi>entail</hi> the Crown upon his
<hi>Line,</hi> and to leave his <hi>Son</hi> in Poſſeſſion of it: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this is <hi>two Families</hi> (as of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter)</hi>
continually watching all opportunities to dethrone each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And the reading <hi>how much blood was ſpilt</hi> during the
conteſt between thoſe two <hi>Houſes,</hi> is enough to ſatisfy any
Man, how much ſuch a Law contributes to the Peace of
a Nation, which both encourages any Uſurper to ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Crown, and enables him both to maintain himſelf
in Poſſeſſion, and to ſet up his <hi>Poſterity</hi> after him, and ſo
to lay the Foundation of <hi>a certain War</hi> upon the Nation,
as often as either the Heirs of the Family of the lawful
Prince, are able to make a <hi>deſcent</hi> here with ſufficient Force,
and to gain a Party here to joyn them; or his own Family,
if they are routed, are able to make a new attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
themſelves of the Crown.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add one Argument more againſt the Statute,
and the conſequences which are drawn from it, and that is
by applying them to a <hi>particular inſtance. Allegiance</hi> is
due by this Statute to him only that is King in Poſſeſſion,
and Treaſon lyes againſt him only: Therefore if <hi>Cromwell</hi>
had been made <hi>King</hi> (we know it was almoſt come to
a concluſion, that he ſhould <hi>take that Title upon him)</hi> then
theſe had been the conſequences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>ds</hi> Party had been <hi>Rebels</hi>
and <hi>Traitors,</hi> if after that they had attempted to <hi>reſtore him</hi>
to the Crown, or given him any <hi>aid or comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they would have been obliged <hi>by vertue
of their Allegiance to fight him to the death,</hi> if he himſelf
had attempted the recovery of his Right. And all this
notwithſtanding the clear conviction of their Conſciences,
that King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> was their Sole Rightful and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King; And <hi>Cromwell</hi> an Uſurper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:53596:25"/>
Nay farther though <hi>Cromwell</hi> was not made <hi>King, i e.</hi> did
not aſſume the Title, yet ſeeing he had the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the
<hi>Regal Authority</hi> though under another <hi>Name,</hi> the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
in all equity and reaſon ought to be the ſame.
For the Law muſt be ſuppoſed not to regard <hi>the Name</hi>
and <hi>Title,</hi> but the <hi>Power and Authority and Office</hi> of a King,
as it is certain he had, then the Nation were bound to pay
him <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and thoſe that dyed for <hi>riſing againſt him</hi>
for King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Intereſt, were not <hi>Martyrs</hi> for their <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi>
but <hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi> for acting againſt <hi>their bounden
Allegiance.</hi> Neither can it be conſiſtent with <hi>Common Senſe,
or Honeſty,</hi> to urge upon the Conſciences of Men, the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Law againſt <hi>the reaſon and equity of it,</hi> and to
make <hi>the ſame thing Treaſon</hi> in one moment, and the <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Allegiance</hi> of the Subjects in the next, upon <hi>the change
of a Word Treaſon,</hi> to be <hi>adherent</hi> to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> while he
had only the Supream Authority without the <hi>Name</hi> of
<hi>King,</hi> but their <hi>bounden Allegiance</hi> to <hi>adhere to him,</hi> as ſoon
as he had taken that <hi>Name</hi> upon him.</p>
            <p>It will not now I hope be thought any great <hi>Preſumption</hi>
if upon theſe reaſons I charge that Statute with <hi>injuſtice,</hi> of
which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> gives ſo<note n="a" place="margin">Dit. H. 7. P. 1077.</note> fair a Character, and
diſcovers in it not only the <hi>depth of prudence and foreſight,</hi>
but <hi>juſtice</hi> alſo and <hi>magnanimity,</hi> and <hi>a Spirit wonderfully
Pious and Noble.</hi> The <hi>Cunning</hi> and <hi>State Policy</hi> of it does
eaſily appear, but it is not ſo eaſie to diſcover any <hi>Piety</hi> or
<hi>Juſtice</hi> in a Law, that makes <hi>evil good and good evil.</hi> I
cannot parallel it to any other, but that which he made in
his <hi>firſt Parliament,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Bac. p. 1003.</note> That the <hi>Inheritance of the Crown
ſhould be, reſt, remain and abide in the King, &amp;c. This</hi> Act
<hi>made</hi> him an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> upon the rights of the <hi>Houſe of York,</hi>
and <hi>the other confirmed</hi> him ſo. <hi>This</hi> which put him <hi>in
Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, had created him much trouble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and was likely to create him more when <hi>Perkin
Warbeck</hi> was up; yet he was reſolved <hi>to ſtand or fall</hi> by it,
and ſtudied only how to <hi>ſecure</hi> himſelf in his unjuſt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion;
and rather then <hi>depart</hi> from what he had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
to the <hi>diſheriſon of one Family,</hi> he was content to
make a Law, which effectually <hi>diſinherits his own Children,</hi>
or any other <hi>Lawful King</hi> or <hi>Heir of the Crown,</hi> if they are
ſo unhappy as to have an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper ſtep before them</hi> into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53596:26"/>
Throne, or <hi>diſpoſſeſs them</hi> when they are in it. Yet both
theſe Statutes fully diſcover the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of the
<hi>Legiſlator;</hi> for they carry in them the faireſt <hi>ſhew and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
of equity and juſtice, but ſerve in <hi>reality</hi> to the contrary
deſign. What more <hi>juſt</hi> then that <hi>the Inheritance of the
Crown ſhould be, reſt, remain and abide in the King?</hi> (if it
were <hi>lawfully veſted in him already)</hi> and what more true
and eaſie for a King <hi>(lawfully</hi> poſſeſſed of the Crown) <hi>to call
to his remembrance,</hi> then that his <hi>Subjects owe him Allegiance,</hi>
and <hi>by vertue of it are bound to fight for him againſt</hi> a <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and ought not to be <hi>attainted for it by
any ſubſequent King or Parliament.</hi> This in the <hi>Preamble</hi>
of the <hi>Stat.</hi> 11. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. And nothing can be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>all Laws, Reaſon and good Conſcience,</hi> if it be meant
of the <hi>rightful King regnant;</hi> But if it be meant (as really
it was by King <hi>Henry</hi> at leaſt) of <hi>the King for the time being
as ſuch whether rightful King or no;</hi> It is <hi>Abſolutely falſe</hi>
within the <hi>Practice</hi> as well as <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>King Henry.</hi> 7.
who himſelf had <hi>attainted Richard</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> the then <hi>King for
the time being</hi> and thoſe that <hi>fought for him in Boſworth
Field,</hi> and ſhould not have <hi>forgot</hi> to repeal that Statute
whereby they ſtood attainted, when he <hi>remembred</hi> that it
was <hi>againſt all Laws, Reaſon and good Conſcience</hi> to attaint
any Man for Serving in the Wars, <hi>under the King for the
time being.</hi> It appears therefore that this Law was not
made <hi>bona fide;</hi> and ſuch a Law may <hi>enſnare</hi> and <hi>impoſe
upon</hi> the Conſciences of the Subjects, but is not fit to <hi>direct</hi>
or <hi>oblige</hi> them: Unleſs we can conceive that his Saying,
he <hi>remembred</hi> it to be ſo for <hi>the time paſt,</hi> when he knew
it to be otherwiſe, is enough to <hi>make</hi> it to be ſo <hi>for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have conſidered as fairly and impartially as I could the
Grounds whereupon ſome now give it for Law, that <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is due only to a King in Poſſeſſion</hi> I ſhall add one or
two Arguments againſt this Poſition. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Allegiance is not due only to a King in Poſſeſſion,
becauſe <hi>England</hi> is an <hi>hereditary</hi> Monarchy, where there is
no <hi>Interregnum,</hi> but the Right Heir of the Crown is <hi>actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
King</hi> at the very moment when his Predeceſſor dyes:
And yet it may be a conſiderable time before he can take
upon him the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Government, as ſuppoſe he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53596:26"/>
be in a Foreign Country. If therefore he be actully King
before he can be <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then the Nation are his Subjects before he is <hi>King in
Poſſeſſion</hi> in the ſenſe of this queſtion, and conſequently he
has a right to their Allegiance, though not yet King <hi>in
Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this ſome would anſwer by a diſtinction of <hi>a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Conſident for the taking of the Oath of Allegiance. <hi>.</hi> 32.</note>
               <hi>right: ARight to the Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, and <hi>a
Right</hi> to the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the <hi>Subjects:</hi> The Right to the
Poſſeſſion of the Crown, they would ſay deſcends to the
Right Heir immediately upon his Predeceſſor's deceaſe,
and in that Senſe he is <hi>actually King:</hi> But the Right to the
Subjects Allegiance, is <hi>annexed to the Poſſeſſion</hi> of the
Crown, and therefore does not accrue to the Heir of the
Crown till he is in Poſſeſſion. And for this diſtinction
they produce ſome kind of Authority from the form of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
in the <hi>Act of recognition</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Bagott's Caſe. 6. E. 4. p. 9. 10.</note> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>ths.</hi> Right
to the Crown where he is declared to have been <hi>in right from
the death of the Noble Prince his Father (Richard Duke of
York,</hi> who was ſlain at the <hi>Battel of Wakefield,</hi> Dec. 30.
1460.) <hi>very juſt King of the Realm; yet becauſe he did not
take upon him to uſe the ſaid Right and Title to the</hi> ſaid
Realm, till on <hi>the</hi> 4<hi>th of March</hi> following, and <hi>then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Exerciſe of the Royal Eſtate,</hi> &amp;c. and to <hi>the
Reign and Government of the ſaid Realm;</hi> From thence
is dated his being <hi>in lawful Poſſeſſion of the ſame
Realm with the Royal Power, Preheminence, Eſtate and
Dignity belonging to the Crown thereof;</hi> and his being <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Seized and Poſſeſſed of the Crown of</hi> England <hi>in his ſaid
Right and Title, and from thenceforth to have to him and
his Heirs all Mannors, Caſtles, Honours, Services, Gifts of
Offices, Prerogatives,</hi> &amp;c. To this may be replyed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Other Parliaments expreſs themſelves in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
inconſiſtent with this diſtinction. So moſt fully the
Parliament.<note n="a" place="margin">Seſſ. 2. c. 4.</note> 1. <hi>Mar. By and immediately after whoſe</hi>
(Edw. 6ths) <hi>Deceaſe, the Imperial Crown of this Realm, with
all</hi> Dignities, Dominions, Honours, Preheminences, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
Stiles, Authorities and Juriſdictions, <hi>to the ſame
united annexed or belonging did not only</hi> deſcend, remain and
come <hi>unto our moſt dread Sovereign Lady, the Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
but alſo the ſame was then</hi> immediately and lawfully
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53596:27"/>
inveſted <hi>deemed and judged</hi> in Her Highneſs's moſt Royal
Perſon, <hi>by the due courſe of Inheritance, and by the Laws and
Statutes of the Realm. Nevertheleſs the ſame her Highneſs's</hi>
moſt lawful Poſſeſſion, <hi>was for a time</hi> diſturbed and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted
<hi>by the Traiterous Rebellion</hi> and Uſurpation <hi>of the Lady
Jane Dudley,</hi> &amp;c. This is Prefaced in that Act, as the
Ground whereupon the Queen and her Parliament ſaw a
neceſſity of <hi>confirming</hi> thoſe <hi>Recognizances, Bonds,</hi> &amp;c. That
bore date as in <hi>the Firſt Year of the Reign of Queen Jane:
viz.</hi> Becauſe, though Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was not yet <hi>in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
by the Lady <hi>Jane's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, yet all Authority and
juriſdiction being inveſted in her Perſon,</hi> any thing under
the Name of <hi>Queen Jane</hi> wanted a juſt and lawful <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
I may add to this the <hi>Recognition</hi> of<note n="b" place="margin">1 Jac. c. 1.</note> King <hi>James</hi>
1<hi>ſt,</hi> where the Parliament declares that <hi>immediately upon the
Diſſolution and Deceaſe of</hi> Queen Elizabeth, <hi>the Imperial Crown
of the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and all the Kingdoms, Dominions</hi>
and Rights <hi>belonging to the ſame, did by inherent Birthright
and lawful and undoubted Succeſſion deſcend and come unto
his moſt Excellent Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have ſufficiently proved above,<note n="c" place="margin">Sup. p.</note> that <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
lay always againſt our Kings</hi> even <hi>before they were in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:</hi>
And if ſo, then a <hi>Right to the Allegiance</hi> of the
Subjects is not a <hi>conſequent of Poſſeſſion;</hi> but <hi>antecedent</hi> to it.
I may add to the Proofs brought above, the <hi>reſolution</hi> of
all <hi>the Judges</hi> in King <hi>James's</hi> the 1ſts. time in the caſe of <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
and <hi>Clerk,</hi> whoſe Plea was, that what they had Acted
againſt <hi>King James</hi> was not <hi>Treaſon,</hi> becauſe done <hi>before his
Coronation;</hi> But the Judges over-ruled the Plea upon this
Ground.<note n="a" place="margin">Coke Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's Caſe. f. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>That preſently by deſcent his Majeſty was</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
and abſolutely King, <hi>without any eſſential</hi> Ceremony
ex poſt facto. Now if he was <hi>preſently by deſcent</hi> ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
and abſolutely King, <hi>that Treaſon lay againſt him,</hi>
then he was ſo fully King that the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of the Subjects
<hi>was due to</hi> him. I may add likewiſe that thoſe who had acted
againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d,</hi> between his Father's death
and his coming <hi>into Poſſeſſion,</hi> were thought to need an
Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> though it pleaſed him to <hi>except</hi> none out
of that Act; but thoſe who were the <hi>Murtherers</hi> of his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53596:27"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to <hi>Edward</hi> the 4<hi>th's</hi> Caſe, this may be looked
upon as particular in it, that when <hi>Richard Duke of York</hi>
his Father had laid Claim to the Crown in <hi>Henry</hi> the 6<hi>th's</hi>
time, he and his Son ſigned an <hi>Agreement,</hi> that<note n="b" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 39. H. 6. n. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Henry</hi> the
6<hi>th ſhould enjoy the Poſſeſſion of the Crown during his life:</hi> And
therefore, though <hi>Richard,</hi> and after his death <hi>Edward</hi>
the 4<hi>th</hi> his Son, was in <hi>right very juſt King</hi> of the Realm, yet
he could not lay claim to the <hi>Subjects Allegiance,</hi> till either
<hi>Henry</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> were <hi>dead,</hi> or the <hi>Agreement</hi> between them
<hi>Cancelled</hi> by King <hi>Henry's</hi> breach of his part in it, and ſo <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the 4<hi>th</hi> ſeized upon the <hi>actual Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown:
Therefore the Parliament might well date his being <hi>ſeized
of the Rights and Prerogatives</hi> of the Crown from the day
when he <hi>took upon him to uſe his Right and Title,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
King Henry</hi> for the breach of the <hi>Agreement</hi> made
between them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But to take this evaſion as fully and clearly
as I can, it may be enquired what is this <hi>Right to Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
contradiſtinct and antecedent <hi>to the Right to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Allegiance,</hi> it muſt be either,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> A Right in the Heir of the Crown <hi>to lay Claim</hi> to
the Exerciſe of the Government, and to <hi>take upon himſelf</hi>
to act as King; or,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> It is a Right that the <hi>Subjects</hi> ſhould <hi>accept and
take</hi> him for their King and ſubmit themſelves to him as
King, and put the Exerciſe of the Government into his
hands.</p>
            <p>If it be a Right to <hi>lay Claim</hi> to the Exerciſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and to <hi>take upon himſelf</hi> to act as King, this
is to be done by the <hi>Heir of the Crown on his part,</hi> who
will not be wanting as far as in him lyes to <hi>put himſelf
into Poſſeſſion</hi> if this will do it. And truly the very form
of <hi>Recognition</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. above cited, may ſeem to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this Notion; for that dates his being <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi>
from his <hi>taking upon him to uſe his Right and Title to the
Realm,</hi> and ſo alſo does the Lords Carriage towards his
Father <hi>Richard D. of York</hi> in the Parliament 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6.
<note n="a" place="margin">Rot. Parl. 39. H. 6. n. 18. Sup. p.</note>where upon his making out his Claim they confeſs
<hi>his Title could not be defeated,</hi> but propoſe to him the
<hi>ſaving King</hi> Henry's <hi>Honour and Eſtate</hi> by letting him <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Crown for his Life,</hi> if he would: which is as good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53596:28"/>
as to acknowledge, that <hi>if he would not,</hi> himſelf muſt be
in <hi>immediate Poſſeſſion of the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this <hi>Right to Poſſeſſion</hi> be a Right, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ſhould <hi>accept and take</hi> the right Heir of the Crown for
their King, and ſubmit themſelves to his Authority, and
put the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Government in his hands; whence
is it that they are under this Obligation? Is it not by Vertue
of their <hi>natural and ſworn Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>King his Heirs
and Succeſſors?</hi> So Queen <hi>Mary</hi> looked upon it in her
<hi>Letter</hi> to the Lords of the Council upon Kings <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Death,<note n="b" place="margin">Fox's Acts and Mon. Vol. 3. p. 14. Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's Hiſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. p. 157.</note> 
               <hi>We require you and charge you and every of you,
of your</hi> Allegiance, <hi>which you owe to</hi> God and Us and
none other, <hi>that every of you for our Honour and the Surety
of</hi> our Perſon only <hi>Employ your ſelves; and forthwith
upon the Receipt hereof, cauſe our Right and Title to the
Crown and Governance of the Realm to be</hi> proclaimed <hi>in our
City of</hi> London <hi>and other places.—And this our Letter
ſigned with our Hand ſhall be your ſufficient Warrant in
that behalf.</hi> Neither do they return her for Anſwer that
they owed her <hi>no Allegiance,</hi> ſhe being <hi>not in Poſſeſſion</hi> of
the Crown; but ſay, <hi>For as much as our Sovereign Lady
Queen</hi> Jane <hi>is after the Death of our Sovereign Lord,</hi>
Edw. 6.—<hi>invested</hi> and poſſeſt <hi>with the juſt and right
Title in the Imperial Crown of this Realm.—We muſt
therefore</hi> as of moſt bounden Duty and Allegiance <hi>aſſent
unto her ſaid Grace</hi> and none other, <hi>except we ſhould</hi> (as
faithful Subjects <hi>cannot) fall into greivous and unſpeakable
Enrmities.</hi> And this Anſwer they ſend to Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
before they proceed to <hi>Proclaim</hi> Queen <hi>Jane:</hi> and I need not
add that ſome of them were ſoon after attainted of <hi>High
Treaſon</hi> for this breach of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore the <hi>Right to the Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, be
a Right in the true Heir of the Crown, that <hi>Subjects
ſhould accept and take</hi> him for their King, and put the
<hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Government into his hands; and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are obliged to take him for their King, and to put
the Exerciſe of the Government into his hands by Vertue
of their bounden <hi>Allegiance,</hi> on pain of incurring the
Guilt of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> if they take any other for their
King: then the Allegiance of the Subjects is due to the
Heir of the Crown before he is <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> of it; then
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53596:28"/>
their <hi>putting him in Poſſeſſion,</hi> with all the Ceremony of
proclaiming, Recognizing, Crowning him, doing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and taking an Oath of Allegiance to him is but a
<hi>part</hi> and the <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> of their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and their
<hi>one whole entire Allegiance</hi> conſiſts both in their firſt <hi>owning</hi>
and <hi>accepting</hi> him for their King, and ever after <hi>ſerving,
honouring, and obeying</hi> him as ſuch: as the <hi>one whole entire
Duty</hi> we owe to <hi>God,</hi> comprehends our <hi>Beleif</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi>
of him for our God, and the payment of
all <hi>Worſhip, Service</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>And this is not to be applyed only to the <hi>Heir</hi> of the
Crown conſider'd <hi>before</hi> he is in Poſſeſſion, but to a <hi>King de
jure diſpoſſeſſed</hi> of his Throne. I argued above that the
very Statute, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which requires the Subjects to fight
againſt him, ſuppoſes him ſtill to be <hi>King de jure:</hi> if ſo, he
has a <hi>Right;</hi> true, but that is only a<note n="a" place="margin">Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. for taking Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. p. 32.</note> 
               <hi>mediate Right to

but if he have a <hi>Right to be in Poſſeſſion</hi> again, then he
has a right that his Subjects ſhould again <hi>accept and take</hi>
him for their King and <hi>reſtore</hi> him to the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the
Government, and this is nothing but their <hi>returning to
their Allegiance;</hi> ſo that his being the King <hi>de jure</hi> implies
a <hi>direct Right</hi> to his Subjects <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and therefore the
Stat. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is a more <hi>contradiction to it ſelf,</hi> for it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
him to be <hi>King de jure,</hi> and yet requires the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to <hi>transfer</hi> their <hi>Allegiance</hi> from him to the <hi>King de
facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides I have ſhewed that the Heir of the Crown is
<hi>actually King</hi> at the very moment when his Predeceſſor
dyes: now a <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>relative</hi> Term, and the <hi>correlatum</hi>
of it are the <hi>Subjects,</hi> the Nation therefore muſt become
the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the Heir of the Crown at the Death of his
Predeceſſor, and the <hi>Relation of Subjects</hi> implies that their
<hi>Allegiance</hi> muſt be due to him.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> A Second Argument to prove, that the Allegiance
of the Subjects is not due to a King in Poſſeſſion only,
may be drawn from the difficulty of <hi>determining, who is King
in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>what is ſufficient</hi> to make him ſo: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his being <hi>Proclaimed</hi> or <hi>Crowned,</hi> his being <hi>ſubmitted</hi>
to and <hi>received</hi> as King by the <hi>Council,</hi> the <hi>Nobility;</hi> the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53596:29"/>
Aſſembly of the <hi>Three Eſtates,</hi> or the whole <hi>Realm:</hi>
whether <hi>all this</hi> is required to make him truly <hi>King in
Poſſeſſion,</hi> or <hi>how much</hi> is ſufficient to make him ſo. This
the <hi>Law</hi> does not tell us: it tells us rather that the <hi>King
de jure</hi> is <hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> King <hi>without</hi> any thing
of all this <hi>Ceremony;</hi> and for a <hi>King de facto</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> does
not ſay <hi>how</hi> he is to be made, it does not ſet a <hi>Rule</hi> to a
Proceeding that is wholly <hi>irregular,</hi> nor preſcribe the
<hi>modus</hi> of an Action which is the moſt <hi>contrary to Law</hi>
that the Subjects can do. Neither does <hi>Reaſon</hi> clear the
difficulty; For,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> All the <hi>other</hi> requiſites (ſaving only the being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to by the whole <hi>Realm)</hi> are conſiſtent with our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>many</hi> Kings in Poſſeſſion at once: for there may be
many <hi>proclaimed</hi> in ſeveral places, and each have a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and have a great number of the
<hi>Nobility, Clergy and People</hi> that adhere to them: now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>all theſe</hi> would be Kings <hi>in Poſſeſſion,</hi> or <hi>none;</hi> and if
they were <hi>all</hi> in Poſſeſſion, then either the Subjects muſt
pay Allegiance <hi>to all at once,</hi> or <hi>each</hi> to the King that <hi>has
him</hi> in his Poſſeſſion; and I think <hi>right Reaſon</hi> as well as
the <hi>Peace of the Kingdom</hi> would preſcribe, that the Nation
ought rather to <hi>lay them all aſide,</hi> but him that has the
<hi>true Right and Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> If the being ſubmitted to by the <hi>whole Realm</hi> be
that which makes King <hi>in Poſſeſſion;</hi> then,</p>
            <p>1. It will be to be enquired <hi>what</hi> is to be looked upon
as the ſubmiſſion of the <hi>whole Realm.</hi> The <hi>Repreſentatives</hi>
cannot act in the name of the <hi>whole Nation,</hi> without <hi>every
Man's Conſent,</hi> in any thing contrary to the <hi>Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
or the Subjects <hi>Allegiance,</hi> for then if they ſhould
paſs a <hi>treaſonable Vote,</hi> the <hi>whole Nation</hi> muſt anſwer for
it. And if every <hi>individual Subject's</hi> conſent is required
to a <hi>King de facto,</hi> it may be long before he can be in <hi>full
Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> In this Senſe the <hi>Notion</hi> of a King <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> will
<hi>interfere with it ſelf:</hi> for if the ſubmiſſion of the <hi>whole
Nation</hi> be that which makes a <hi>King de facto,</hi> and puts him
<hi>into Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Crown, then his <hi>being in Poſſeſſion</hi>
cannot be made an <hi>Argument</hi> why the greateſt part of the
Nation, or a leſſer part, who have <hi>not yet ſubmitted, ſhould
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53596:29"/>
be is</hi> in Poſſeſſion <hi>before he is</hi> truly in Poſſeſſion, if the Sub.
<hi>ſubmit</hi> to him: for this is requiting them to ſubmit, <hi>becauſe</hi>
miſſion of the <hi>whole Nation</hi> be neceſſary to make him ſo:
and indeed according to this Notion a King <hi>de facto's</hi> being
in Poſſeſſion can be only urged as a Reaſon why thoſe that
<hi>have ſworn</hi> Alligiance ſhould bear Faith and Allegiance
to him; and not as a reaſon why any <hi>ſhould ſwear</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.
But the <hi>true Notion</hi> of a King <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> will
rather at laſt be found to be, <hi>the Perſon that has the Power
in his hands,</hi> and is ſtrong enough to <hi>enforce the Submiſſion</hi>
of thoſe that adhere to the King <hi>de jure,</hi> and this brings me
to conſider one of the greateſt <hi>Objections</hi> againſt what I
have ſaid: and that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. That <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Allegiance are reciprocal;</hi>
and therefore becauſe we are under the <hi>Protection</hi> of the
King <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> only, our <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to <hi>him only.</hi>
To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>This <hi>Maxim</hi> may be underſtood in <hi>Three</hi> Senſes.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Relations</hi> of King and Subject are <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>Duties</hi> of Protection on the King's, and
Allegiance on the Subject's part are <hi>reciprocal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That actual Protection and Allegiance are <hi>reciprocal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt</hi> That the <hi>Relations</hi> of King and Subject are <hi>reciprocal:
i. e.</hi> if ſuch a Perſon be our <hi>King,</hi> then we are his <hi>Subjects,</hi>
if we are his <hi>Subjects,</hi> then he is our <hi>King;</hi> And on the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
if he be <hi>not</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> then we are <hi>not</hi> his <hi>Subjects,</hi> if
we are <hi>not</hi> his Subjects, then he is <hi>not</hi> our King: According
to the known Rule in <hi>Logic, Relata reciprocantur,</hi> i. e. <hi>ſe
mutuo ponunt &amp; tollunt.</hi> Now this is ſo far from proving,
that <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to the King <hi>in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though not <hi>de
jure,</hi> that it is the very Ground of all our Arguments to
prove the <hi>contrary:</hi> For it is not <hi>be</hi> that is our King, but
the <hi>King de jure,</hi> and therefore it is not to <hi>him</hi> that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be Subject, but to the King <hi>de jure:</hi> For the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of King</hi> conſiſts not in the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the <hi>Regal Authority;</hi> and the <hi>Ground</hi> of this
<hi>Relation</hi> is a <hi>Right to the Crown,</hi> by <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
in an <hi>hereditary,</hi> by the <hi>choice</hi> of the <hi>Electors</hi> in an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective</hi>
Monarchy, and not in either by mere <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> or
<hi>Invaſion;</hi> for if that gave a right then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53596:30"/>
1<hi>ſt.</hi> The old maxim muſt be falſe, <hi>jus non naſcitur ex
injuria;</hi> and he muſt not be called a <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Robber</hi> that
<hi>comes not in by the door into the ſheepfold</hi> but the <hi>true Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A <hi>People</hi> would then have no <hi>right</hi> to <hi>reſtore</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to <hi>Liberty,</hi> nor a <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>recover his Crown,</hi> from an
<hi>Uſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Then we lay aſide the <hi>diſtinction</hi> between the King <hi>de
facto</hi> and <hi>de jure</hi> which is the Ground of the whole diſpute.</p>
            <p>2. A ſecond Senſe of this Maxim may be this, that the
<hi>duties</hi> of Protection on the King's, and Allegiance on the
Subjects part are <hi>reciprocal,</hi> and do mutually infer and
take away each other, <hi>viz.</hi> As the Subjects are bound to
bear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the King, ſo the King is bound to give
<hi>Protection</hi> to his Subjects: And on the contrary. As the
King is not bound to <hi>Protect</hi> thoſe that are not his Subjects
and owe him no Allegiance, ſo the Subjects are not
bound to pay their Allegiance to him that is not their King,
and owes them no Protection. Now this alſo is very true,
that God and Nature has laid <hi>mutual obligations</hi> upon
Kings and their Subjects, as he has in all other <hi>Relations</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Man and Man, as of <hi>Parents</hi> and their <hi>Children</hi>
and the like. And this is the Senſe of the Maxim in our
<hi>Law,</hi> as appears from the plain and expreſs words of the
Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Coke.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Calvin's Caſe. f. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Between the Sovereign and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
there is duplex &amp; reciprocum ligamen, quia ſicut ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Regi tenetur ad obedientiam, ita Rex ſubdito tenetur ad
protectionem; mento igitur ligeantia dicitur a ligando, quia
continet in ſe duplex ligamen—and with this agreeth Mr.</hi>
Skene <hi>in his Book de expoſitione verborum—Ligeance is the
mutual Bond and obligation between the King and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
whereby the Subjects are called his Liege-Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are bound to obey and ſerve him; And the King
is called their Liege-Lord, becauſe he ſhould maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them.—Therefore it is truly ſaid, that</hi> Protectio trahit
Subjectionem and Subjectio Protectionem.</p>
            <p>But then though theſe <hi>Duties</hi> are <hi>reciprocal,</hi> yet the
ground of the obligation to perform them is the <hi>relation</hi>
to which theſe Duties are annexed, and not the <hi>reciprocal
Obligation</hi> on the other ſide. A Father is bound to take
care of his Children, not becauſe they are under a <hi>mutual
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53596:30"/>
Obligation</hi> to Honour their Parents, but becauſe he is their
<hi>Father:</hi> And a Son is not bound to perform his Duty to his
Father becauſe his Father is <hi>reciprocally obliged</hi> to take care
of him, but becauſe he is his <hi>Son:</hi> So the <hi>ground</hi> of the
Subjects <hi>Duty</hi> to their King is not becauſe he is <hi>bound to
protect them,</hi> but becauſe they are his <hi>Subjects;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi>
is bound to protect his <hi>Subjects,</hi> not becauſe they are alſo
<hi>obliged to pay him Allegiance,</hi> but becauſe he is their <hi>King.</hi>
God and Nature deſignes Men to love in a <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Civil
Society,</hi> and has appointed a means to preſerve them there,
by their <hi>mutual Duties</hi> to each other. It is therefore the <hi>Hall
of God</hi> annexing ſuch Duties to each <hi>Relation</hi> of Father and
Son, King and Subject, which is the ground why they are
<hi>due,</hi> and why the one part is <hi>obliged</hi> to perform theſe Duties,
and the other has a Right to injoy the benefit of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance:
and God's making the <hi>Obligation reciprocal</hi> is not
the <hi>ground</hi> of the Duties on either ſide, but an <hi>Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Motive</hi> to the performance of them. And hence it
will follow,</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Obligations</hi> to the Duties of <hi>Protection,</hi> or
<hi>Allegiance,</hi> hold as long as the <hi>Relations</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That where there are not the <hi>mutual Relations</hi> of <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Subject,</hi> there, there are not theſe Obligations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duties of <hi>Protection</hi> or <hi>Allegiance</hi> annexed to theſe
Relations. And this will be a good <hi>ground</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> of the
Truth of this Maxime in the 3<hi>d</hi> Senſe, which is,</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>actual Protection</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> are reciprocal,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Subjects are bound to pay their Allegiance
to him from whom they receive <hi>actual Protection,</hi> but
are not obliged to pay their Allegiance to him who does
not <hi>actually Protect</hi> them. And in this ſenſe it is brought
as an Argument to enforce our paying Allegiance to a
King <hi>in Poſſeſſion,</hi> though not <hi>de Jure:</hi> But it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it is as. falſe in this Senſe, as it is true in the
other two Senſes: For if the <hi>Relations</hi> of King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be reciprocal, and the Duty of Allegiance be annexed
to the <hi>Relation</hi> of a Subject, and holds as long as the
Subjects ſtand in that Relation; then, if the <hi>King de
Jure</hi> be ſtill their <hi>King,</hi> and they his <hi>Subjects,</hi> though they
have not <hi>actual Protection</hi> from him, yet their <hi>Allegiance</hi>
is due to him as far as they are capable of exorting it,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53596:31"/>
for his Service. Again, if there be no obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duty of Allegiance, but where there is the <hi>Relation</hi>
of a Subject to which that Duty is annexed, then if the <hi>Nation</hi>
are not <hi>Subjects</hi> to a <hi>King de Facto,</hi> nor he their <hi>King,</hi> they
are not bound to pay him Allegiance, though he is ready
to give them <hi>actual Protection;</hi> ſo that Protection without the
true <hi>Relation</hi> of <hi>King,</hi> does not infer an Obligation to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
nor the want of Protection take away that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in him, who is ſtill under the <hi>Relation of a Subject</hi> to
another that is his King. Which is farther clear, becauſe
<hi>actual Allegiance</hi> and Protection are not reciprocal, <hi>i e. actual
Performance</hi> of the Duty of Allegiance does not infer an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
in the King to give <hi>Protection</hi> to every <hi>Alien,</hi> who
is willing to make himſelf the King's Subject; neither does
the <hi>neglect</hi> of paying his Duty of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in any Subject
diſcharge the <hi>King</hi> of his Duty of giving him his <hi>Protection,</hi>
as far as is conſiſtent with the <hi>other</hi> part of the King's <hi>Duty,</hi>
to <hi>govern</hi> his Subjects; for he is ſtill obliged to give him
all that which the Law allows to a <hi>Criminal,</hi> a Legal
<hi>Tryal</hi> by a Jury, &amp;c. and may be obliged to extend his
Royal <hi>Clemency</hi> to him, where it may tend to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Perſon, and is conſiſtent with the due
ends of Government. To be ſhort, there is not any Man
but enjoys the Benefits of his <hi>Father's Care,</hi> and his
<hi>Prince's Protection,</hi> for a long time before he is capable to
perform either the <hi>Duty</hi> of a <hi>Son,</hi> or the <hi>Allegiance</hi> of a
<hi>Subject, viz.</hi> from the moment of his <hi>Birth</hi> to his riper
Years; and therefore if <hi>actual Allegiance</hi> be the ground
of the King's <hi>Duty</hi> to Protect his <hi>Subjects,</hi> he is not
obliged to extend his Protection to an Infant or a Child;
or if the <hi>incapacity</hi> or <hi>neglect</hi> of his <hi>Subjects</hi> do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
him from performing towards them the <hi>Duty</hi> of
a <hi>King,</hi> why ſhould his <hi>incapacity or fault</hi> diſcharge
them from performing their <hi>Duty</hi> of Allegiance to him,
much leſs authorize them to transfer what is his Right to
another, becauſe from him only they have <hi>actual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection?</hi>
But to proceed farther in Confutation of this
falſe Principle, that <hi>actual Protection</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal.</p>
            <p>1. This Principle obliges the <hi>Subjects</hi> to pay Obedience
to <hi>every Uſurpation,</hi> whether the Perſon that Uſurps be
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53596:31"/>
               <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> whether he be <hi>King or no:</hi> So any one in the
<hi>late times</hi> would have been obliged upon this Principle to
have born Faith and true Allegiance to the <hi>Rump,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
of Safety,</hi> the <hi>Protector,</hi> and all other <hi>Uſurped Powers,</hi>
who got the Government into their Hands during that time;
for they having got the Sovereign Power into their Hands,
from thenceforth all the People of <hi>England</hi> were under their
<hi>Protection,</hi> and therefore might have ſworn to bear Faith and
true Allegiance to them, and were obliged to Aſſiſt and
Defend them in the Poſſeſſion of their Uſurped Authority,
and to fight for them againſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family,</hi>
and they that acted againſt them were to be judged <hi>Rebels</hi>
and <hi>Traytors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) The Truth of this Principle ſeems to depend upon
one of theſe two Grounds; either <hi>1ſt.</hi> becauſe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
enjoy all the Common <hi>Benefits of Civil Government</hi>
from this <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>King de Facto,</hi> and in return for
them are bound to pay him their Allegiance by the Law of
<hi>Gratitude.</hi> Or 2<hi>ly.</hi> becauſe the <hi>King de Facto</hi> has the <hi>Lives</hi>
and <hi>Fortunes</hi> of the Subjects at his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and therefore it
is at leaſt Lawful for them, when their rightful King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſcue them out of his Hands, to ſwear a new Allegiance
to him.</p>
            <p>1. The Subjects enjoy all the Common <hi>Benefits of
Civil Government,</hi> from this <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>King de
Facto,</hi> and therefore in return for them are obliged to pay
him their Allegiance by the Law of <hi>Gratitude.</hi> To this I
anſwer,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> I granted above that the <hi>Subjects</hi> are to pay <hi>ſome
degree</hi> of Submiſſion and Obedience to a King <hi>in Poſſeſſion,</hi>
though an Uſurper, for their own <hi>Safety,</hi> and the publick
Order and Peace of the Nation, and upon the preſumed
Will of the <hi>King de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It does not appear that they are obliged to pay him
even this degree of Submiſſion and Obedience on the
ſcore of <hi>Gratitude;</hi> for the Power and Authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he takes upon him to protect them is not <hi>his own</hi> but
the <hi>lawful King</hi>'s; and he firſt <hi>deprives</hi> the Subjects of
the <hi>lawful King's Protection</hi> before he tenders them his
own, and therefore in effect <hi>takes away</hi> from them as
much as he <hi>gives;</hi> and beſides invades the Subjects
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53596:32"/>
               <hi>Rights</hi> who were not obliged to be Subject to any but their
<hi>Lawful Prince,</hi> and his not depriving them of <hi>Protection,</hi>
is only forbearing doing them a farther <hi>Injury;</hi> ſo that
though they reap ſome benefit from his Protection, and
ought in <hi>Prudence</hi> to comply with him as far as it is <hi>Lawful,</hi>
yet it does not ſeem that they are obliged to it upon the ſcore
of <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But though they were obliged in point of gratitude to
pay him <hi>ſome degree</hi> of Submiſſion and Obedience, it does not
follow, that they can lawfully <hi>transfer their Allegiance</hi> to
him; for that is not their own to give, but there is ſtill a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
of it due to the rightful King, when it can be Exerted
for his Service.</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>King de Facto</hi> has their <hi>Lives</hi> and
<hi>Fortunes</hi> at his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and therefore it is at leaſt Lawful for
them, when the <hi>King de Jure</hi> cannot Reſcue them out of
his Hands, to ſave their <hi>Lives, and Means of ſubſiſtence,</hi> by
ſwearing Allegiance to that Perſon who has them in his
<hi>Power.</hi> To this I Anſwer, That ſwearing <hi>Allegiance</hi>' implies
two things.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>full and entire Submiſſion,</hi> ſo as never to attempt
any thing <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>King de Facto,</hi> for the <hi>King de Jure.</hi> And
this, when they muſt do it or <hi>dye,</hi> may ſeem to be Lawful,
becauſe their <hi>Death</hi> deprives the <hi>King</hi> of ſo many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and their <hi>engaging never to Act for him</hi> does no more;
and is but the ſame as if they ſhould <hi>take Quarter</hi> of an
<hi>Enemy in War,</hi> that has them at his Mercy: And this may
be true, where there is ſo Service to be done to their <hi>King's</hi>
Cauſe, and the true Profeſſion of the Principles of <hi>Loyalty,</hi>
by their <hi>ſuffering Death,</hi> and Sacrificing their own Lives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the recovery of a Nation from a Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to a true Senſe of their Allegiance: But in moſt <hi>Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations</hi>
there is firſt a <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the Subjects, and an <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi>
from he Principles of <hi>Loyalty;</hi> and in this caſe it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
whether any, whoſe <hi>Examples</hi> might have influence
upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Nation, may not be obliged even to
<hi>looſe their Lives</hi> for the King <hi>de Jure;</hi> becauſe here their
Deaths may do <hi>ſome ſervice</hi> to Religion and the <hi>King</hi>'s Cauſe,
whereas in <hi>War</hi> their dying rather then <hi>to take Quarter,</hi> and

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53596:32"/>
2. <hi>Allegiance</hi> imports an Engagement of the Subjects to
<hi>ſtand by and maintain the King in Poſſeſſion</hi> againſt the <hi>King de
Jure;</hi> and this if any of them engages to do, the <hi>King de
Jure</hi> does more then than <hi>loſe a Subject,</hi> for he <hi>gets an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
who, if he Act according to his new <hi>Engagement,</hi> is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi>
even to <hi>oppoſe him to the Death,</hi> if he endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his Crown: But why may not this be done, ſince the
end for which Men are placed under a Government is
the <hi>Preſervation of their Lives and Properties;</hi> and therefore
when that <hi>Protection</hi> fails them, whereby they ſhould be
<hi>Preſerved</hi> without any fault of their own, their <hi>rightful
King</hi> being depoſed or excluded, and unable at preſent to
recover his <hi>Right,</hi> and they at preſent reduced to thoſe
Streights; that they muſt either make themſelves the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the King in Poſſeſſion, or ſuffer <hi>Death,</hi> or loſe the
neceſſary <hi>means of Subſiſtence;</hi> why may they not in this caſe
give themſelves up to him that has them in his <hi>Power,</hi> and
<hi>ſwear Allegiance</hi> to him? This then is the main Ground. The
end for which we are placed under a Government is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;</hi>
when that Protection fails us, <hi>and our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are at Stake,</hi> then we may for our own <hi>Preſervation</hi> put
our ſelves under <hi>another Protection,</hi> and <hi>ſwear Allegiance</hi> to
the Perſon who has us in his <hi>Power.</hi> Let us conſider whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Principle will carry us,</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> It allows us to ſwear Allegiance to <hi>any Perſon</hi> that
gets our Perſons, and the means of our Subſiſtence into
his hands, and before we can have Protection from the
Government, will either <hi>kill</hi> or <hi>ruine</hi> us if we do not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neunce
our King,</hi> and put our ſelves <hi>under his Command,</hi> to
ſtand by him againſt all Perſons whatſoever. This Perſon
may be the <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>Rabble,</hi> a <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> a <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> a
<hi>Maſſaniello,</hi> or who not? For it is not the <hi>Perſon</hi> that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes
our Subjecting our ſelves to his Government, but
the <hi>Power</hi> he has to force us to it, at the Peril of our
<hi>Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> It is not only our <hi>duty to the King,</hi> that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
juſtifies the Deſerting of, but alſo all <hi>other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
which are incumbent upon us, as we are Members of
a Civil Society, and Subjects to a Government: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(in our conſtitution) the obligation we are under
to the Succeſſion of the <hi>Royal Line,</hi> to the <hi>Fundamental
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53596:33"/>
Constitution</hi> of the Monarchy (as it is not <hi>Deſpotick</hi> and
<hi>Arbitrary,</hi> but <hi>limitted by Law</hi> in the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Royal
Authority) and alſo to the preſent <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment,</hi>
wherein are included the <hi>Rights of all our fellow Subjects</hi>
to their Lives, Liberties, and Properties: To theſe Rights
we are obliged, as Subjects of the Engliſh Monarchy; as
well as to the King's Perſon, Crown, and Dignity. Now
ſuppoſe a King ſhould deſign to deſtroy any one of theſe,
for inſtance the <hi>Right of Succeſſion</hi> in the next Heir; ſuppoſe
he were reſolved to force the Nation, by the Aſſiſtance of
a Party that would ſtand by him, to <hi>ſet aſide the next Heir,</hi>
and to <hi>ſwear Allegiance to another Perſon;</hi> ſuppoſe he ſhould
begin to impoſe this <hi>Oath</hi> upon ſome of them, whoſe <hi>lives</hi>
or their means <hi>means of Subſiſtence</hi> were moſt in his Power,
and require them <hi>upon pain of Death,</hi> to take an <hi>Oath</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>Right of Succeſſion.</hi> Suppoſe the <hi>Succeſſor</hi> not
able to hinder this, and the Nation either not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
or not all of a mind in that point: What here muſt theſe
Men do? They are indeed Members of this Society, and
were made ſo (ſuppoſe) by the Act of their Forefathers,
who ſubjected themſelves and their Poteſterity to an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
Monarchy,</hi> as the beſt form of Government, and
likely to give them the beſt and ſecureſt <hi>Protection.</hi> Here
theſe poor Men find they fail of their end, the King has
their <hi>Lives in his Power,</hi> and will take them away, unleſs
they renounce their natural and ſworn Obligations, to the
<hi>Right of Succeſſion;</hi> the <hi>Succeſſer</hi> is not preſent or able to
Protect them, and they can do him no ſervice now, but
only to <hi>dye Martyrs</hi> for his right, and this they are not
engaged to do as Members of this Society, and Subjects
of this Government, neither are they obliged to it for
the Right of the <hi>King himſelf,</hi> but may if another gets
his <hi>Crown,</hi> and has their <hi>Lives at his Mercy, transfer their
Allegiance</hi> to him, and therefore much rather may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the right of the <hi>next Heir.</hi> when they muſt either
do it, or <hi>dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might make juſt the ſame ſuppoſition as to out obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
to the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Form of Government,</hi> and to the
Lives, Liberties, and Properties of the reſt of our Fellow-Subjects
included therein; ſuppoſe a King a deſigns to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all theſe,</hi> and to make thoſe of his Subjects that moſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53596:33"/>
depend upon him, <hi>ſwear</hi> that they will <hi>concur</hi> with him in
betraying the Rights of their Fellow-Subjects included there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
ſuppoſe he require ſome of them to take this <hi>Oath</hi> at
the Peril of their Lives, or the loſs of all their <hi>means of
Subſiſtence</hi> if they reſuſe; they ſcruple it, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their <hi>Obligations</hi> to the <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment.</hi> But
what is the <hi>Ground</hi> of that Duty? The <hi>Protection</hi> they enjoy
under this Form of Government: Here that <hi>Protection</hi> ſails
them, the King is too hard for his People, and they <hi>cannot,</hi>
or think they <hi>ought not,</hi> riſe up in the common Cauſe, why
then theſe Perſons have nothing to do but to ſubmit, and
<hi>ſwear to ſtand by the King</hi> in the Exerciſe of his <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and
<hi>Deſpotick Power:</hi> For why ſhould they be obliged either to
<hi>die or ſtarve,</hi> rather than the reſt of the Nation (who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
protect them) ſhould be brought under <hi>another</hi> Form
of Government, and made to ſubmit themſelves to a <hi>lower</hi>
degree of Subjection?</p>
            <p>Theſe I think are the plain Conſequences of this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:</hi>
We are under an Obligation to the Rights of the
<hi>King,</hi> his <hi>Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi> and our <hi>Fellow-Subjects.</hi>
If when our Lives are at Mercy, and the <hi>King</hi> is not able
to <hi>protect</hi> us, we may then renounce his Right, and <hi>ſwear
Allegiance to another King;</hi> then by parity of Reaſon,
when our Lives are at ſtake, and the <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> or our
<hi>Fellow-Subjects,</hi> are not able to <hi>reſcue</hi> us, we may then
renounce the <hi>Right of Succeſſion,</hi> or ſwear to joyn in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment,</hi> and the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of our <hi>Fellow-Subjects</hi> ſecured thereby: For we are
brought under Obligations only for our own <hi>Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and are not obliged to <hi>die Martyrs</hi> for any <hi>Humane
Right,</hi> but may, to ſave our own Lives, engage to do any
thing againſt the Rights of our King, his Heirs, and our
Country.</p>
            <p>There was a time when moſt of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi>
and every one in <hi>Publick Station</hi> in the <hi>Court, Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi>
the <hi>Army,</hi> and the <hi>Country,</hi> were brought under ſuch
a <hi>Tryal</hi> as this, and required either to quit their Places,
or to joyn with the King in <hi>taking off the Penal Laws and
Teſts;</hi> ſome of theſe there were whoſe Places were a
<hi>Livelihood</hi> to themſelves and their Families, and the
Quality they had lived in, made it the ſame thing in a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53596:34"/>
manenr to them to <hi>dye</hi> as to <hi>beg.</hi> We know what then was
the Senſe of the Nation, that <hi>any thing</hi> ought to e ſuffered,
rather than contribute the Aſſiſtance of <hi>one Vote</hi> to the doing
of that, the effect whereof might be the introducing of
<hi>Popery and Arbitrary Government.</hi> And yet if this be a good
Principle, that <hi>to ſave our Lives, or means of ſubſiſtence, we may
renounce any Humane Right,</hi> I thing theſe Perſons needed not
to have been <hi>State-Martyrs,</hi> but might lawfully have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with him who had the <hi>means of their ſubſiſtence in his
Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if we are obliged not to betray the <hi>Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of our Fellow-Subjects,</hi> nor the <hi>Right of Succeſſion,</hi> but
rather to ſubmit <hi>to dye</hi> or <hi>ſtarve</hi> than to joyn with the
<hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Subverſion</hi> of either of theſe; why are we not
under the ſame Obligation to the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, Crown,
and <hi>Dignity?</hi> Why are we not equally obliged not to
<hi>renounce his Right</hi> though at the Peril of our <hi>Lives?</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
Man could not (though for the ſaving of his Life)
joyn with any other in an Act of <hi>Injustice</hi> or <hi>Violence</hi> upon
the Perſon or Eſtate of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of his <hi>Fellow-Subjects;</hi>
and if ſo, ſure he ought rather to dye a thouſand Deaths
than to make <hi>himſelf a partaker with other Men</hi> in their
Sins of Uſurpation or Rebellon, by engaging to <hi>joyn</hi> with
a <hi>King de Facto,</hi> and his Adherents, to keep a <hi>King de Jure
from his Right.</hi> There have been who were thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
when they were brought under a ſevere Tryal
for their Loyalty to <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Martyr,</hi> and his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;</hi>
and there have been who have had occaſion to ſhew
themſelves as <hi>true</hi> to the <hi>Right of Succeſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Legal
Eſtabliſhment</hi> in Church and State. It is indeed very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy</hi>
to be under ſuch a <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> where a Man is ſo
often brought in danger of looſing his <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>means of
Subſiſtence,</hi> or parting with his <hi>Integrity;</hi> but if <hi>England</hi>
be ſuch a place where there is <hi>no living</hi> except a Man
will be <hi>ready at every turn</hi> to <hi>renounce</hi> either his <hi>King,</hi> or the
<hi>Succeſſion,</hi> or the <hi>Rights of his Country;</hi> if, I ſay, <hi>England</hi> be
ſuch a place, and yet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be looked upon as the <hi>beſt
Conſtitution</hi> in the World, I think then an honeſt Man need
<hi>look no farther,</hi> but prepare to go <hi>into a better Country,</hi> i. e.
<hi>an Heavenly.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:53596:34"/>
I ſhall anſwer one <hi>Objection</hi> more, and that is drawn
from the Caſe of a <hi>Tenant</hi> to a private Eſtate, who
ſwears <hi>fealty</hi> and pays all his <hi>Rents and Services</hi> to the
<hi>Lord of the Manour in Poſſeſſion,</hi> tho he have not the
<hi>Right Title</hi> to the Eſtate: therefore the Subjects by parity
of Reaſon, ought to pay their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to a <hi>King in
Poſſeſſion,</hi> tho not <hi>de jure.</hi> I anſwer, this is plainly a
<hi>different caſe,</hi> and the ground of the difference lyes here,
that in all Controverſies between <hi>Private Perſons</hi> about
a Title to an Eſtate there is a <hi>Court of Judicature</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
to determine who has the Right Title, but in a
Competition of <hi>two Princes</hi> for the <hi>Crown</hi> there is no
ſuch <hi>Court of Judicature</hi> provided. For where there is
ſuch a Court of Judicature, there the very <hi>Reaſon of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
requires, that any Perſon who is <hi>in Poſſeſſion</hi> of
an Eſtate (tho it be by <hi>unjuſtly diſſeizing or excluding</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who has the Right to it) is to be looked upon (as to the
<hi>jus externum)</hi> by every Subject of that Government as if he
were the <hi>rightful Poſſeſſor,</hi> till upon a <hi>Tryal in Court</hi> he
be adjudged not to be ſo; and if upon a <hi>Tryal</hi> he, tho
<hi>againſt Truth and Right</hi> (by Perjury of Witneſſes, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Judgment, or falſe Verdict) be <hi>adjudged by the Court</hi>
to be the rightful Poſſeſſor, he is then ſtill by the Subjects
of that Government to be looked upon and treated as
ſuch, till the other Perſon who is thus injured can have
his remedy againſt him in a <hi>legal Way,</hi> and recover his
Eſtate by <hi>another Tryal.</hi> Hence therefore it follows, that
the <hi>diſſeized or excluded</hi> Landlord is not any other way
to diſturb the others unjuſt <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> but by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Tenants</hi> are to ſwear <hi>fealty</hi> to
the Lord <hi>in Poſſeſſion,</hi> and to pay him their <hi>Rents and
Services,</hi> and can do no other Service to their <hi>rightful
Landlord</hi> then by giving him their Aſſiſtance towards
the recovery of his Right in a <hi>Legal way:</hi> for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>Rents and Services</hi> to another cannot be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to the rightful Landlord, becauſe as a Member of
the Government he <hi>ſubmits his Rights</hi> to the <hi>Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi>
and beſides may recover <hi>Damages</hi> of the unjuſt
Poſſeſſor for the <hi>profits</hi> of the Eſtate, which he has enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
during the time he has been in Poſſeſſion: but it
would be an Injury to the <hi>Tenants</hi> to pay their Rent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53596:35"/>
               <hi>twice over,</hi> once to him to whom the <hi>Law</hi> conſtrains
them to pay it, and again to him to whom their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi>
tell them it ſhould be paid of Right.</p>
            <p>And the ſame would be the Caſe in a Competition of
<hi>two Princes</hi> for the <hi>Crown,</hi> if there were a <hi>Court of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi>
ſettled in the Kingdom to <hi>take Cognizance</hi> of their
Claims, and to <hi>determine</hi> the Controverſy between them
<hi>judicially,</hi> and to oblige the <hi>Parties</hi> contending for the
Crown to acquieſce in their Judgment, and the <hi>Subjects</hi>
to <hi>ſtand by him</hi> whoſe Right they determine it to be: for
then any <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> were to be looked upon and
obeyed as <hi>King de jure</hi> till by a <hi>Sentence of this Court</hi> he
were pronounced to be an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper,</hi> and another Prince
declared to be the <hi>rightful King:</hi> and the Prince deprived
or excluded by the Sentence of this Court were to ſit <hi>down
and quit his Pretenſions;</hi> and the <hi>Subjects</hi> would be to be
<hi>directed wholly</hi> by this Court, and to <hi>ſwear Allegiance</hi> to
that Perſon and to ſtand by him with their Lives and
Fortunes, to whom this high Court ſhould <hi>adjudge</hi> the
Right to the Crown. But then, if there be no ſuch
Court, it will then be left to the Subjects to inform their
own Conſciences, who it is in whom the Crown is <hi>inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
deemed and judged</hi> (to uſe the Expreſſion of the Stat. 1
<note n="a" place="margin">Seſſ. 2. c. 4.</note>
               <hi>Mar.) by the Law,</hi> not any ſuch Court, and when
they know it they are to follow the <hi>jus internum</hi> and to
ſtand by him who has the Right—tho a <hi>Tenant</hi> in the
caſe of a <hi>Private Landlord</hi> is obliged to follow the <hi>jus
externum,</hi> and to be directed by the <hi>Courts of Judicature,</hi>
where he is to pay his Rents and Services, and to ſwear
<hi>fealty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not take upon me to prove, that there is no ſuch
<hi>Court</hi> ſettled in our <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> It is not the <hi>Nobility</hi> or
<hi>Council</hi> of the former King, for their <hi>Proclaming</hi> of the
<hi>New King</hi> is not a <hi>judicial decretory Sentence</hi> of his Right
and Title, but the <hi>firſt Act</hi> of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him,
<hi>preſuppoſing</hi> his Right; if it were otherwiſe, <hi>Queen Jane</hi> had
then been the <hi>lawful</hi> i. e. <hi>Legal</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and not
<hi>Queen Mary;</hi> But we find it ſo far from that, that the
Lords of the <hi>Council</hi> were looked upon as Guilty of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in Proclaiming <hi>Queen Jane,</hi> and adhering to her when
Proclaimed. Neither is it the <hi>three Eſtates aſſembled in

it was not found difficult to bring the <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> in full
<hi>Parliament</hi> to make this <hi>their own Act,</hi> and not only to ſubmit to <hi>King
Richard</hi> as <hi>King de facto,</hi> but to recognize Him to be <hi>King de jure.
Prynn's Remarks</hi> upon it in the <hi>Margin</hi> are ſufficient to ſhew their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi>
and <hi>Sincerity</hi> in this proceeding, how well qualified they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
themſelves for an <hi>Infallible Judge of Controverſies about the
Right to the Crown;</hi> by their baſe and ſervile Flattery in extolling the
<hi>ſingular Vertues</hi> of that <hi>bloody Tyrant;</hi> by their declaring Him the <hi>true
and undoubted Heir of the Crown;</hi> by their eſtabliſhing a new and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unheard
of <hi>Right of Inheritance</hi> whereby it belong'd to an <hi>Hereditary
King</hi> to be <hi>choſen</hi> by the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and laſtly, after they had acted
thus, contrary to the Light and Conviction of their own Conſciences,
pretending to an <hi>Inconteſtable Authority</hi> to <hi>quiet the Conſciences</hi> of the
<hi>Nation.</hi> How they quieted their Conſciences, appears by the <hi>Sequel</hi>
of the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> when the Nation within <hi>two Years</hi> call'd in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi>
to depoſe this <hi>Tyrant,</hi> upon his Oath to Marry the <hi>Daughter of</hi> Edw.
<hi>the</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> the Heir of the Crown: and there we find the <hi>Parliament</hi>
ſoon change their <hi>Note,</hi> and prononnce the late <hi>True and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted
Heir</hi> of the Crown a <hi>Traitor</hi> and <hi>

            <head>An Advertiſement to the Reader, in relation to the foregoing Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>There are ſome paſſages in this diſcourſe, which may ſeem to allow
too much to an Uſurper in Poſſeſſion;</hi> viz, That ſome degree of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
may, and ought to be paid to his Acts of Government; that ſome of
his Judicial Acts, Grants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought in equity to be looked upon as valid;
and that ſome Acts against hi may be puniſhed as Treaſon. <hi>To prevents
theſe paſſaes being miſtaken or perverted, I thought it proper to
to add ſome farther explanation of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion touching the Subject's complyance under an <hi>Uſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in Poſſeſſion,</hi> ſuppoſes theſe two things:</p>
            <p>1. That the Uſurper is got into the Throne, and that he has
ſeized the Power of the Nation into his Hands; ſo that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who ſtill adhere to their Loyalty and Allegiance, are not an
preſent able to make Head againſt him to remove him from the
Throne, and to reſtore their Lawful King to his Right.</p>
            <p>2. That whether the Loyal Party will or no, the Government
will from thenceforth proceed under the Name, and as by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Uſurper, till the Lawful Prince, and his Party, are
in a condition to diſplace him. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Uſurper will Name his
Council, Judges, and inferiour Magiſtrates, Officers of his Court,
and his Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will call Parliaments, make Laws, levy Taxes,
grant Commiſſions, and take upon him to execute all other Acts of
<hi>Royal Authority;</hi> and will have a Party to act under him in all
Places of Truſt, and Power, during his Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>Upon this ground, therefore, it will not be difficult to explain
the abovementioned paſſages, and to ſhew that they do not allow
too much to an Uſurper in Poſſeſſion. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſome degree of Submiſſion and Obedience may be paid to his
Acts of Government, i. e.</hi> Whilſt the Loyal Party are not able to
make head againſt him, to deprive him of the Crown, they may be
allowed and obliged to pay a Submiſſion and Obedience to thoſe
Acts of Government done by the Uſurper, which tend to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Safety</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> and are not prejudicial to the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
of their <hi>Lawful King.</hi> For this <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Does not imply any Recognition of the leaſt <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
in the <hi>Uſurper;</hi> for the <hi>ground</hi> of it is not any ſuch <hi>Authority,</hi> but
a <hi>prudent regard</hi> to their <hi>own Safety,</hi> the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> and their <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Prince's Intereſt</hi> involed in both; whoſe <hi>Will</hi> therefore they muſt
<hi>preſume</hi> allowing, nay requiring them to act thus, as moſt for his
Service in their preſent circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53596:37"/>
2. It does not at all contribute to the <hi>Settlement</hi> of the <hi>Uſurpation,</hi>
and the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>Uſurper;</hi>
for the Government will proceed, as by his Authority, whether
they will or no, till they are in a condition to oppoſe it effectually;
and may be more ſettled, if they ſhould throw away their own
Lives, and ruine the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>Lawful Prince,</hi> by any raſh and
weak attempt.</p>
            <p>3. It does not diſ-ingage them from imbracing all opportunities
of acting any thing, that may be really ſerviceable to their <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince's Intereſt,</hi> and may make way for his recovery of his <hi>just
Rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is allowed in the Diſcourſe, <hi>That ſome Judicial Acts,
and Grants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of an Uſurper, ought in Equity to be looked upon as
valid,</hi> viz. Such as are not to the prejudice of the Intereſt of the
<hi>Lawful King,</hi> or of the <hi>Publick.</hi> This is grounded upon the ſame
ſuppoſition, that the <hi>Government</hi> will be carried on by the <hi>Uſurper</hi>
and <hi>his Adberents,</hi> whether the <hi>Lawful Prince</hi> and his <hi>Party</hi> will or
ſo; and then it is for the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Lawful Party,</hi> and
he <hi>Lawful Prince,</hi> that <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhould be <hi>adminiſtred,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi>
of <hi>Government preſerved,</hi> and conſequently that the <hi>Sentences</hi> paſſed
in Courts under the <hi>Uſurper,</hi> and his Commiſſions, and Grants, &amp;c.
be looked upon as <hi>valid,</hi> as far as they are not againſt the Right
of the <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and tend to the preſervation of <hi>publick Juſtice</hi>
and <hi>Order;</hi> For the allowing this does not imply.</p>
            <p>1. An allowance of any <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Uſurper;</hi> for the
Government may ſtill be conceived to ſubſiſt, and the Laws to ſtand
in force, by virtue of the <hi>Lawful King's Authority;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe Judicial Acts, &amp;c. may be looked upon as uſeful, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his preſumed <hi>Will</hi> whereby they are ratified and confirmed.</p>
            <p>2. Neither does it juſtifie the Adherents of the <hi>Uſuper,</hi> in their
joyning to act under him, as the Inſtruments of his Uſurped Power;
for this is Treaſon in them, their ſwearing Allegiance to him,
taking Commiſſions from him, and acting for his Intereſt againſt
their <hi>Lawful Prince;</hi> and yet ſome Acts done by them, to preſerve
<hi>Publick Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> may be looked upon as convenient,
not by virtue of any <hi>Legal Authority</hi> which they have, but as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Neceſſity requires that theſe Acts ſhould have their effect.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Diſcourſe, <hi>That ſome Acts againſt an Uſurper may be
puniſhed as Treaſon:</hi> This alſo ſuppoſes the Government and Power
of the Nation to be in the <hi>Uſurper</hi>'s Hands; and that it is requiſite
and juſt, that while it is ſo, Murder, Robery, and ſuch other
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53596:37"/>
Offences againſt <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> be puniſhed, though by the
<hi>Uſurper</hi>'s Commiſſion and Warrant. The ſame therefore is to be
granted, as to any Acts within the <hi>Stat.</hi> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which are
committed under the Reign of an Uſurper, againſt the Order of
Government, and the Royal Authority conſidered in it ſelf, and
not againſt the Uſurper's Perſon or Government as ſuch; ſuch are
Clipping and Coining, betraying any place of ſtrength to any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince invading the Nation, not on the Lawful King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe Acts may be allowed as puniſhable under an
<hi>Uſurper,</hi> without implying an allowance of any Authority in him;
for they are puniſhed by Virtue of the Lawful Prince's Authority,
and without implying that the inferiour Magiſtrates under him
have any Legal or Juſt Commiſſion any farther, than as they may
be conceived to have the Will and Conſent of the abſent Prince
authorizing them to execute Juſtice upon ſuch Criminals, or at
leaſt ratifying the thing done, thought without a Legal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>This I thought proper to add for the farther explanation of theſe
Paſſages, to prevent their being miſtaken or perverted. I have
nothing more, but to deſire that they may be conſidered as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
in relation to the Plea of <hi>Bagott's Council,</hi> which is ſo much
inſiſted upon for the Lawfulneſs of transferring <hi>Allegeance</hi> to a <hi>King
de Facto;</hi> and I have though it the faireſt way of <hi>anſwering</hi> the
<hi>Argument</hi> from that <hi>Plea,</hi> not to reject it where it ſeems not to be
unreaſonable; but to ſhew that the Lawyers might have ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
grounds to argue in that manner for the validity of <hi>Bagott's
Patent;</hi> and yet their Plea cannot be made uſe of, to prove that
Allegiance is due to a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion,</hi> if an <hi>Uſurper.</hi>
