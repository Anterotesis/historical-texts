         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Regard</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi> JO. TA.</byline>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is needleſſe to demand, from what Shire, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
City, Corporation, Town, Burrough, Village,
Hundred, Hamlet, Houſe, Family, Perſons or
perſon this Complaint comes, for it were a rare
ſearch, and would trouble the braines of all the
cunning men, and wiſeſt <hi>Mathemagicians,</hi> with all the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> and Fortune-telling Figure-flingers, to tell us
truly where this complaint is not. It is ſo univerſall epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
generall, that whoſoever hath not a greivous ſence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morcefull
feeling of it, hath a ſoule ſtupified, and a conſcience
benum'd mortally with a dead Palſie.</p>
            <p>We the moſt miſerable amongſt men, do make humble ſuite
to you, who (next to our ſinnes and ſelves) are the cauſe and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113193:2"/>
cauſers of our miſeries, you do beſt know the nature and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our greifes, you had the power, will and skill to wound
us, and you have the art and knowledge to make us whole;
you have the ſecret vertue which is faigned to have been in
<hi>Achilles</hi> his Launce, to hurt and cure. We are ſure that the
King moſt graciouſly eas'd and removed all our greivances, (or
as many as we complaind on) there was not a monopoly, a tax,
toll or tribute left, that was greivous or juſtly offenſive, but
they were all either made voyd, or mitigated, neither did his
Majeſty deny you any thing that you did demand, nor you ever
grant him any thing that he requeſted; and to our griefes we
ſpeak it, it had bin better he had been more ſparing of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
grants, except you had more. Loyally and gratefully dealt
with him, and acknowledg'd them. We need not tell you, that
the Proteſtant Religion is almoſt caſt out of the Kingdom by
you. It is impertinent to give you notice how you have us'd
the King, ſo that the meaneſt of your ſelves would be loath to
be ſo dealt withall; How we have been beggard and ruin'd by
you, we know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how you have inrich'd your ſelves by undoing
us, you know, and when you will endeavour to ſeek peace, and
ceaſe thoſe miſchiefes which we ſuffer, God knowes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selfe do, ſelfe have,</hi> is an old Engliſh proverb. It is only our
own doings that hath undon us, it was our tongues that extold
you, it was our voyces that was your advancement, it was our
noyſes that Elected you to that power, which you have turn'd
into intollerable Tyranny, it was we that did rend our throates
for a <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> a <hi>Hampden,</hi> a <hi>Pym,</hi> a <hi>Martin,</hi> a <hi>Haſlerigge,</hi> a
<hi>Hollis,</hi> and a great many more then a good many. It was we
that made you Knights and Burgeſſes for the Shires, Counties,
Cities, Townes, Burroughs, Corporations; and for us, it was
our follies to do all this for you, for which it is too too manifeſt
what you have done for us. Thus by our meanes you were
rais'd, and by our ruines you are inrich't. The premiſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
we humbly beſeech you to take theſe few following
lines into your ſerious conſiderations, and at your pleaſure or
leiſure, confute them if you can.</p>
            <p>It is a maine point of Romiſh doctrine, that the <hi>Pope cannot
erre in matters of Faith,</hi> (which error of theirs is far from our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113193:2"/>
opinions) but this we are too ſure of, that <hi>you have all erred in
matters of truſt.</hi> We the Freeholders and Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
do lamentably know and feell it; folly and fooliſhneſſe,
are the only oppoſites to wiſdome, and <hi>Knowledge hath no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
but Ignorance,</hi> this being confeſt, we pray you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that our raſh folly elected you to be the repreſentative
body of the Kingdome, which we did acknowledge you to be;
and we moſt humbly deſire you to conſider, that we are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdome repreſented; now as a thing repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is but a derivative from that which is the repreſented, ſo
is your power derived from us, and from us who are but men
full of infirmities and errors; though our voyces had power to
give you power, to be a houſe of Commons in Parliament; yet
from thoſe voyces and folly of ours, we had not power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
infallible and inerrable wiſedom into you.</p>
            <p>Wee (as men) confident of your integrity, did chuſe you
as our Proctors and Atturnies, the Kings Majeſty, with his beſt
Councell, and we (the poore Commons) entruſted you with
all we had, but we had no miſtruſt that you would deceive us
of all we had, we truſted you to maintaine our Peace, and not
to imbroile us in an univerſall endleſſe bloudy War. We truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you with our Eſtates, and you have Rob'd, Plunder'd, and
undon us; we truſted you with our freedomes, and you have
loaden us with ſlavery and bondage, we truſted you with our
lives, and by you we are ſlaughter'd and murther'd every day.
We truſted you not with our ſoules, and yet you with a new
Legerdemain doctrine, a jugling kind of Preaching, a peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſwarme of Preachers, a Mechanick kennell of illiterate
knaves, with the threats and Tyranny that you have uſed to us,
and the execrable Covenants which you have forc'd us to
take, we might with as much ſafety, and leſſe hazard, have
truſted our ſoules with <hi>Judas, Julian</hi> th' Apoſtate, or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
himſelfe, as with you, or your Doctrines.</p>
            <p>Many thouſands of Soules, (loaden with their ſinnes) are
Impenitently parted from the Bodies of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(by your ſeducements and inforcements) and (alas)
few of them knew the Cauſe wherefore they fought, or
wherefore they ſo cruelly kill'd one another. You will ſay,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113193:3"/>
that you fought for the Proteſtant Religion, (that's a lye) it is
known, that it was never offer'd to be taken from you, and that
His Majeſty will live and dye in it, and the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it; doe you fight againſt the King, as fearing He
would take from us our Lawes and Liberties, in thoſe points
we plainly perceive, that He never intended any ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe?
But if He had had any ſuch unkingly and Tyrannicall
intention, you have prevented Him, and done it your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Doe you fight againſt Him, and Murther His loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
for feare that He ſhould bring in Forreigne-Nations to
deſtroy us, (which thought never entred into His Royall
Heart) but you have done the ſame, both againſt His Majeſty
and us, you have at exceeding Rates and prices (with our
Monies) bought Rebellious <hi>Scots,</hi> who have ſold themſelves
to you, and to work wickedneſſe, no purpoſe to ruine the
King, the Kingdome, you and us, and as the Divell could not
overthrow man without the help of the woman, ſo you could
never deſtroy this Church and State without your Golden
temptation of thoſe accurſed hirelings, which if you were to
fell them againe, at halfe a quarter of the price they coſt, it
muſt be at a very deere Market.</p>
            <p>It is an old ſaying, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is a King of Men,
becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as men and Loyall Subjects to him)
doe honour, obey, and ſerve him. That the <hi>French</hi> King is a
King of Aſles, becauſe of the inſupportable heavy burthens,
Taxes, and ſlavery which they undergoe and tamely beare.
But ('tis ſaid) the King of <hi>England</hi> is a King of Devills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of their diſobedient murmurings, and often Rebellion.
For <hi>the nature of an Engliſh man is, not to know when things
are well,</hi> which if we would have knowne, things had not
now been ſo bad as they are.</p>
            <p>Doe you fight againſt the King to remove ſome Evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
from him? we know that you have long fidled upon
that ſtring, yet you could never name one of thoſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
nor relate any particulars againſt them, that might ſo
much, as put a ſcratch, ſcarre, or ſpot upon their Integrity,
either to His Majeſty or the publique good; all that can be
ſaid, either againſt the King, Queene, Nobility, or any Loyall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113193:3"/>
Royaliſt, is vented through your learned Conduite Pipe, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius
Britanicus,</hi> who (by your eſpeciall favour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
Railes and Reviles, Sheetly, weekly, moſt wickedly
weakly, <hi>Cum Privilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we perceive, that you pretend to fight for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, and all the World may ſee and ſay, you have
made a delicate dainty <hi>Directory,</hi> new Religion of it. And
you have fought for the King, (and that is moſt certaine)
you have fought and ſought for the King, but it hath been to
Catch him, and make him no King. You have fought for our
Liberties, and have taken them from us, you have fought for
the Goſpell, and have ſpoyl'd the Church, you have fought
for our Goods, and yee have em, and you have fought to
deſtroy the Kingdome, and you have done it. What can you
doe, or what would you doe more? and ſtill you perſiſt in
theſe impious Courſes, and there is no hope of any end of
our ſufferings.</p>
            <p>The many Gulleries, that you have put upon us, would fill
a large Volume, if they ſhould be written or Printed; and
becauſe you ſhall not think us to be fenceleſſe, or ſuch Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
as you would make us, you ſhall know that we know
ſomewhat. And to lay aſide all old Dogge-tricks, how this
Rebellion hath been a Brewing more then 60 yeares, we
will let you know, that we know many of your State ſleights
and Policies within theſe three yeares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have extorted great Summes of Mony from us, under
the pretence of Relieving of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with the ſame
Monies, you have maintain'd a bloudy Warre in <hi>England,</hi> ſo
that whatſoever was Raked from us, for the preſervation of
one Kingdome, you have imployed for the deſtruction of
three; for <hi>England</hi> is cheated, <hi>Ireland,</hi> defeated, and <hi>Scotland</hi>
is heated in her owne diſſentious flames.</p>
            <p>You have pretended Treaties for Peace, when (God
knowes) Peace was never in your Thoughts, (as by your
impudent Propoſitions and demands may appeare) for if the
<hi>Turke</hi> had made a Conqueſt here, he could not have deviſed,
or would not have enjoyn'd and tyed the King, and his true
Liedge People to harder Conditions, and then (to ſalve your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113193:4"/>
Reputations) you have cauſed your lying Lecturers, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
Pamphlets to revile the King, and lay all the fault on
him for the breaking off of the Treaties, when as you had
Conſulted, and knew before, that your unreaſonable demands,
neither would or could be granted.</p>
            <p>You have abuſed and mock'd God, with falſe and forged
Thankeſgivings, for ſuch Victories as never were, and with
your Sophiſticated Triumphs of Guns, B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls, Bonefires, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,
Libells, and other Impoſture-like expreſſions, whereby
we have been ſeduc'd and encouraged to give more and more
Contributions, and buy our owne utter undoeings, for (like
corrupted and covetous Lawyers) you would not take ſo
much paines, or doe us the curteſie to begger us <hi>Gratis,</hi> to
ruine us for nothing; And you would not by any entreaty
make us miſerable at a cheap rate, or except we gave you our,
Monies, almoſt to the uttermoſt farthing.</p>
            <p>Many of your Faction (like decoy Ducks) brought in their
Plate and Monies at the beginning of this Rebellion, in large
proportions to the <hi>Gull-Hall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> whereby thouſands
of people were gull'd, by deed of guift, (or deeds of ſhift)
and new found Loanes, and Contributions, to maintaine your
greatneſſe, and feed your bottomleſſe Avarice, whileſt we, and
the reſt of your new ſhorne ſheep, had no other aſſurance, but
the Ayery pawne of a Confounding <hi>Faith,</hi> call'd <hi>Publique;</hi>
and thoſe cheating <hi>Decoyes,</hi> who firſt gave, and lent to draw
poore Fooles on, Thoſe Knaves had their Plate and Monies
privately delivered to them againe, whileſt ours was accurſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imployed againſt the true Religion, a juſt King, and all His
Loyall Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>You have (to make your Victories ſeem great) cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your owne Tattard Enſignes, Cornets, or Colours of
Foot and Horſe, with many Armes, to be privately ſent out of
the City in an Evening at one Port, and brought in at another
Port in the morning in Triumph, making the People beleeve,
that thoſe Colours and Armes, were taken from the King at
ſuch and ſuch a Battell; and this trick hath hook'd us into
more chargeable and Rebellious Contributions.</p>
            <p>You have cauſed thouſand of Armes to be bought and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113193:4"/>
brought from Forreigne Nations, and thoſe Armes, you have
proclaim'd to be taken at Sea, and that either the King had
bought them to make Warre againſt the Parliament, or that
they were ſent Him for that purpoſe, from ſome Catholique
Prince; and this ſlight of Hand, hath often jugled away
our Monies.</p>
            <p>You have many times, made Women believe that their
ſlaine Husbands who went forth with you alive, were alive
ſtill, in ſuch or ſuch Garriſons of yours, when you knew the
ſame men were killed, and left dead in ditches for Crowes
meat, but that His Majeſty gratiouſly cauſed the dead to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and the maimed and wounded, to be relieved and cured.</p>
            <p>You have contrived Letters in Private Chambers, and you
have ſubſcribed them from Forraigne Kings and States, or
from the Queene to the King, or to ſome other Perſons of
Worth and Eminency neer His Majeſty, which Letters have
been as full of forged dangerous conſequences, as your wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
braines could thruſt or foiſt into them; And by ſome mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
way, the ſaid Letters have been either intercepted on
the Land (by ſome vigilant great Commander of yours) or
they have been ſaid to be taken at Sea by your valiant Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
then are thoſe Letters openly Read, and copied out
a thouſand waies, Printed ten Thouſand waies, diſperſt a
Hundred Thouſand waies, and believed by Millions of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by the prateing of your Preachers and Pamphlets, which
tricks have coſt us ſome Millions of money, with many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
of our lives.</p>
            <p>You have many times taken (or intercepted) Letters
which have been ſent from ſome of His Majeſties Armies,
Garriſons, or ſome other true and Loyall places or Perſons, or
from the King or Queene, one to another; and thoſe Letters
have been publiquely Read and Printed, but you have new
moulded them, you have made your own Conſtructions and
Interpretations on them, and in a word, you have not only the
procreating Art, to beget and engender ſuch newes, as you
pleaſe to have; but alſo you are fruitfull in conceiving, and
producing ſuch Letters as hath or may be moſt for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
as Lately you have uſed in His Majeſties Cabinet, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113193:5"/>
you took at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and brake open at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and made
the Letters therein, to ſpeake what you would have them;
But (maugre all your malice) the ſaid Letters are as ſo many
Chriſtall Mirrours, wherein His Kingly care, His Chriſtian
Piety, His immoveable Conſtancy, in the ſervice of God, in
the Proteſtant Religion, in the Peace of His Kingdoms, and in
the well-fare of His Subjects, all theſe His Letters doe ſhew
(in deſpight of your wreſted compariſons, and mingle, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
jugling alterations) His Tranſcendent goodneſſe, and
moſt gratious inclination, and Royall Reſolution, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
your miſchievous intentions are plainly manifeſted, in
that you ſtill perſiſt in your wicked courſes againſt ſo gratious
a Soveraigne. But there are more judicious, learned, and
grave writers then any of us (your oppreſſed Complainants)
whoſe Pens have better deſcribed your playing faſt and looſe
in this kind, to whoſe better Informations we leave you.</p>
            <p>We doe moſt heartily wiſh, that you were all as weary of
being Tyrants, as we are in bearing the inſupportable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
of your Tyranny; we doe humbly beſeech you to be
pleaſed to give over beggering and killing of us, we pray you
to ſuffer us to live and enjoy the Proteſtant Religion, we deſire
you to let us feed and ſubſiſt upon that little which you have
left us (againſt your wills;) and laſtly, we entreat you not to
enforce us into a deſperate Condition, and make us doe we
know not what.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, as a true Defender of the true Faith, doth with
Truth defend that Faith, and He hath moſt graciouſly often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
you <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> both which you pretend, but you
intend neither. Lay down your Armes, that's the neareſt way
to a <hi>Peace,</hi> and leave Lying, and you ſhall have <hi>Truth.</hi> If you
will not, we would have you know, that we muſt take a courſe,
that neither our Purſes or Perſons, ſhall not long maintaine
you and your Rebellious Garriſons, (who are no other but
dens of Theeves) and as our Tongues did lift you up, and made
you able to abuſe the King, the Religion, Church, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
ſo our Hands muſt help to pull, or knock you downe,
to recover part of that of which you have bereft us, and to keep
about us to Relieve us, that little which yet we have left us.</p>
