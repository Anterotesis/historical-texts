            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your self injur'd by such a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from a Man that honours You; nor condemn my Ambition, when I publish to the World, that I am not altogether unknown to You.

My Lord, I cannot, I would not flatter you, I do not think your Lordship capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flatter'd, neither am I inclin'd
<pb facs="tcp:53645:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to do it to those that are: but I cannot forbear to say, that I then receiv'd such an impression of your Vertue, and Noble Nature, as will stay with me for ever. This will either excuse the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty I presume to take in this Dedication, or, at least, make it no wonder; and I am so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in your Lordships Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, that I assure my self you will not deny your Protection to a Man whose greatest Publick Crime is that of an <hi>ill Writer.</hi> A bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Book</hi> (if there be a better of the <hi>kind</hi> (in the <hi>Original</hi> I mean) had been a Present more fitly suited to your Lordships <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> and to my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>:

                  <head>THE TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>MY Design in attempting this Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was to present my Country with a true Copy of a very brave Original; How far I have succeeded in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is left to every one to judge; and I expect to be the more gently censured, for having my self so modest an Opinion of my own Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, as to confess that the Author has suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, as well as the former Translator; though I hope, and dare affirm, that the misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I shall be found guilty of, are neither so numerous, nor so gross. I cannot discern my own Errours, it were impardonable in me if I could, and did not mend them; but I can see his (except when we are both mistaken) and those I have corrected; but am not so ill natur'd as to shew where. In truth, both Mr. <hi>Florio,</hi> and I are to be excused, where we miss of the sence of the Author, whose Language is such in many Places, as Grammar cannot reconcile, which renders it the hardest Book to make a justifiable
<pb facs="tcp:53645:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
version of that I yet ever saw in that, or any other Language I understand: insomuch, that though I do think, and am pretty confident, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand French as well as many Men, I have yet sometimes been forc'd to grope at his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Peradventure the greatest Critick would in some Places have found my Author abstruse enough. Yet are not these Mistakes I speak of either so many, or of so great importance, as to cast any scandalous blemish upon the Book; but such as few Readers can discover, and they that do, will I hope easily excuse.</p>
                  <p>The Errors of the Press, I must in part take upon my self, living at so remote a distance from it, and supplying it with a slubber'd Copy from an illiterate Amanuensis; the last of which is provided against in the Quires that must succeed.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF MICHAEL SEIGNEUR DE MONTAIGNE, Almost entirely taken out of his own WORKS.</head>
                  <p>THE Race of <hi>Michael Seigneur de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne,</hi> in <hi>Perigord,</hi> was Noble, but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without any great lustre till his time: As to Estate, he was seiz'd of above two thousand Crowns of yearly Revenue. He was born to his Father the third in order of Birth of his Children, and by him delivered to Gossips of the meanest Condition to be baptized, with a Design rather to oblige, and link him to those who were likely to stand in need of him, than to such as he might stand in need of. He moreover sent him from his Cradle to be brought up in a poor Village of his, and there continued him all the while he was at Nurse, and longer, forming him to the lowest, and most common manner of Living: Wherein he certainly so well inur'd himself
<pb facs="tcp:53645:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Frugality and Austerity, that they had much ado, during all the time of his Infancy espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to correct the refusals he made of things that Children of his age are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greedy of, as Sugars, Sweet-meats, March-panes, and the like.</p>
                  <p>No doubt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues are a very Fair and a very great Advance; but, as he himself observes, they are now a days too dear bought. His Father having made all diligent inquiry that possibly could be amongst the Learned Men for an exquisite method of Education, was caution'd of the inconvenience then in Use, and told, that the tedious time that is employ'd in the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which cost them nothing, is the only reason, that we cannot arrive to that grandeur of Soul, and perfection of Knowledge that was in them. The expedient that he found out for this was, that whilst he was at Nurse, and before he began to Speak, he delivered him to the Care of a <hi>German,</hi> who since died a famous Physician in <hi>France,</hi> totally ignorant of our Language, and very well vers'd in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. This Man, that he had brought out of his own Country, and entertain'd with a very great Salary for this purpose, had the Child continually in his Arms, to whom there were added two others more moderately Learned, to attend him, and to Relieve the first, which three
<pb facs="tcp:53645:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
entertain'd him with no other Language but <hi>Latin.</hi> As to the rest of the Family, it was an inviolable Rule, that neither his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor so much as his Mother, Man or Maid, spoke any Word in his hearing, but such as every one had learn't only to prattle with him. And 'tis not to be believ'd how all of them profited by this Method; his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother learn't by this means <hi>Latin</hi> enough to understand, and to serve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves withal at need, as also those Servants did, who were most about his Person. To be short, they did Latin it at such a Rate, that it overflowed to the Neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, where, by Use, several Latin Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Artizans and their Tools, have got footing, and there remain to this day. For his part, he was above six years old before he understood any more of <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigordin,</hi> than of <hi>Arabick,</hi> and without Art, Books, Grammar, or Precepts, without Whipping, and without Tears, he had learn't to speak as pure <hi>Latin</hi> as his Master, for he could neither alter it nor mix it. If, for Example, they gave him a Theam after the Colledge Mode; they gave it to others in <hi>French,</hi> but they were fain to give it him in ill <hi>Latin</hi> to put it into good: And <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Gronchi,</hi> who has writ a Book <hi>de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiis Romanorum, Guiliaume Guerente,</hi> who has writ a Commentary upon <hi>Aristotle, George Buchanan,</hi> that great <hi>Scotch</hi> Poet, and <hi>Mark
<pb facs="tcp:53645:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Anthony de Mureta,</hi> whom both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> acknowledge for the best Orator of his Time, his Domestick Tutors, have oft since told him, that he had that Language in his Childhood so ready, and at hand, they were afraid to accost him.</p>
                  <p>As to the Greek, his Father design'd to have it taught him by Art, but by a new Method, and that by way of Sport and Recreation. they tost their Declensions to and fro, after the manner of those, who by certain Tricks upon the Chess-board, learn <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi>: so, amongst other things, he had been advis'd to make him relish Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Duty, by an unforc'd Will, and his own Device, and to Educate his Soul with all Sweetness and Liberty, without Austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Compulsion. Which he also did to such a degree of Superstition, that seeing some are of Opinion, that it troubles the Brain of Children to be suddenly rows'd in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to be snatch't away from sleep, wherein they are much deeper plung'd than men, with haste and violence; he always cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be waked by the sound of some Musical Instrument, and was never unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a Musician for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>But, as they who are impatient to be cur'd, submit to all sorts of Remedies, and every ones Advice; the good Man, being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly timorous of failing in a thing he had so much set his Heart upon, suffered himself at

last to be carried away by the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which, like Cranes, always follow that which went before, and submitted to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, having now no more those Persons about him, who had given him the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that he had brought out of <hi>Italy.</hi> And about the sixth Year of his Age sent him to the Colledge of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> at that time very flourishing, and the best in <hi>France.</hi> And there it was not possible to add any thing to the Care he had in choosing for him the best Chamber-Tutors, and in all other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Education, wherein he reserv'd seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particular Forms, contrary to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Usance; but so it was, that it was a Colledge still, and this unusual method of Education, was here of no greater advantage to him, than at his first coming to prefer him to one of the higher Classes, for at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years of Age, he had run thorough his whole Course.</p>
                  <p>At the Age of three and thirty he married a Wife, though, might he have been left free to his own Choice, he would have avoided marrying, even <hi>Wisdom</hi> her self, had she been willing. But 'tis to much purpose, says he, to resist Custom, and the common Usance of Life will have it so. Nevertheless, this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his was not Spontaneous, he was put upon it, and led to it by odd Accidents. And as great a Libertine as he confesses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be, he more strictly observ'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
<pb facs="tcp:53645:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vow, than he expected from, or had propos'd to himself.</p>
                  <p>His Father left him <hi>Montaigne</hi> in Partage, as the eldest of his Sons, Prophecying that he would Ruine it, considering his Humour, so little dispos'd to live at home: But he was deceiv'd, for he liv'd upon it as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it, excepting, that it was something better, and yet without Office, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forreign helps. As to the rest, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune never did him any violent or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Offence, so she never shewed him any signal Favour: Whatever he had in his House that proceeded from her Liberality, was there before he came to it, and above a hundred Years before his Time: He never in his own particular had any solid and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Advantages, for which he stood indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Bounty. She shew'd him Airy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary, and Titular Favours, without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; She procur'd for him the Collar of the Order of <hi>St. Michael,</hi> which, when young, he coveted above all other things, it being at that time the utmost mark of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>French</hi> Nobless, and very Rare. But of all her Favours, there was none with which he was so well pleas'd, as an Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Bull of a <hi>Roman</hi> Burgess, that was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him with great civility and bounty, in a Journey he made to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd in Form in the sixth Chapter of the third Book of his Essays.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:53645:8"/>
                     <hi>Messieurs de Bourdeaux,</hi> elected him Mayor of their City, being then out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet more Remote from any such Expectation, which made him excuse himself; but that would not serve his turn, and moreover the King interpos'd his Command. 'Tis an Office that ought to be look'd upon with the greatest Esteem, as it has no other Perquisits and Benefits belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, than the meer honour of its Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. It lasts but two years, but may, by a second Election, be continued longer, though that rarely happens. It was to him, and had been so twice before, once some years since to <hi>Monsieur de Lausac,</hi> and more lately to <hi>Monsieur de Byron, Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in whose place he succeeded, and left his to <hi>Monsieur de Matiguon,</hi> also <hi>Mareschal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> proud of so noble a Fraternity. His Father, a Man of great Honour and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had formerly also had the same Dignity. All the Children his Wife brought died at Nurse saving <hi>Leonor</hi> an only Daughter, whom he dispos'd in marriage some two Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death.</p>
                  <p>The first printing of his Essaies was in the Year 1580, at which time the publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause gave him, as he says, a little more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance than he expected. He has since ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but corrected nothing: His Book having been always the same, saving that upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new Impression, he took the Priviledge
<pb facs="tcp:53645:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to add something, that the Buyer might not go away with his Hands quite empty. His Person was strong, and well knit; his Face not fat, but full, his Complexion betwixt Jovial and Melancholick, moderately San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and hot; his Constitution healthful and spritely, rarely troubled with Diseases, till he grew into Years, that he begun to be afflicted with the Cholick and Stone: As to the rest, very obstinate in his hatred, and contempt of Physicians Prescriptions; an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Antipathy; his Father having liv'd threescore and fourteen Years, his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father threescore and nine; and his great Grand-father almost fourscore Years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having ever tasted any sort of Medicine.</p>
                  <p>He died in the Year 1592, the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi>: a very constant, and Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Death, being aged fifty nine Years, six Months, and eleven Dayes; and was buried at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in the Church of a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> now given to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Feuillantines</hi>: where his Wife <hi>Francoise de la Cassaigne,</hi> and his Daughter, have erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him an honourable Monument, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, like his Ancestors, past over his Life and Death in the Catholick Religion.</p>

The one, or the other, of these two ways, would with great Facility work upon my Nature; for I have a marvellous Propensity to Mercy and Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53645:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <p>It is true, that to suffer a Man's Heart to be totally subdued by Compassion, may be imputed Facility, Effeminacy, and Over-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness; whence it comes to pass, that the weakest Natures, as of Women, Children, and the common sort of People, are the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it: but after having resisted, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd the Power of Sighs and Tears, to surrender a Man's Animosity to the sole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the sacred Image of Vertue, this can be no other than the Effect of a strong and inflexible Soul, enamour'd of, and ravish'd with a Masculine and obstinate Valour.

For we are never present with, but always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our selves.

                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53645:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>We find this great Precept often repeated in <hi>Plato, Do thine own Work, and know thy self.</hi> Of which two Parts, both the one and the other generally comprehend our whole Duty, and consequently do each of them complicate and involve the other; for, who will do his own Work aright, will find that his first Lesson is to know himself: and who rightly understands himself will never mistake another Man's Work for his own, but will love and improve himself above all other things, will refuse superfluous Employments, and reject all unprofitable Thoughts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. And, as Folly on the one side, though it should enjoy all it can possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, would notwithstanding never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, so on the other, Wisdom does ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce with the present, and is never dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with its immediate Condition: and that is the reason why <hi>Epicurus</hi> dispenses his Sages from all Fore-sight and Care of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Amongst those Laws that relate to the Dead, I look upon that to be the best, by which the Actions of Princes are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and sifted after their Decease. They are equal at least, whilst living, if not above the Laws, and therefore what Justice could not inflict upon their Persons, 'tis but reason should be executed upon their Reputations, and the Estates of their Successors; Things that we often value above Life it self: A Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of singular Advantage to those Countries
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53645:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where it is in use, and by all good Princes as much to be desir'd, who have reason to take it ill, that the Memories of the Tyrannical and Wicked should be us'd with the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Respect with theirs. We owe, 'tis true, Subjection and Obedience to all our Kings, whether good or bad, alike, for that has respect unto their Office; but as to Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Esteem, those are only due to their Vertue. Let it be granted, that by the Rule of Government we are with Patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure unworthy Princes, to conceal their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to assist them in their indifferent Actions, whilst their Authority stands in need of our Support: yet, the Relation of Prince and Subject being once at an end, there is no reason we should deny the Publication of our real Wrongs and Sufferings to our own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and common Justice, and to interdict good Subjects the Glory of having submissive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully serv'd a Prince, whose Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were to them so perfectly known, ne'r to deprive Posterity of so good an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and such as out of respect to some private Obligation, shall, against their own Knowledge and Conscience, espouse the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and vindicate the Memory of a faulty Prince, do a particular Right at the Expence and to the Prejudice of the Publick Justice. <hi>Livy</hi> does very truly say, That the Language of Men bred up in Courts is always sounding of vain Ostentation, and that their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53645:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is rarely true, every one indifferently mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his own Master, and stretching his Commendation to the utmost extent of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Sovereign Grandeur: and 'tis not impossible but some may condemn the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of those two Souldiers, who so roundly answer'd <hi>Nero</hi> to his Face, the one being ask'd by him, <hi>Why he bore him ill Will? I lov'd thee,</hi> answer'd he, <hi>whilst thou wert wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, but since thou art become a Parricide, an Incendiary, a Waterman, a Fidler, a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a Coachman, I hate thee as thou dost deserve:</hi> and the other, <hi>Why he should attempt to kill him? Because,</hi> said he, <hi>I could think of no other Remedy against thy perpetual Mischiefs.</hi> But the publick and universal Testimonies that were given of him after his Death (and will be to all Posterity, both of him and all other wicked Princes like him) his Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and abominable Deportment considered, who, of a sound Judgment, can reprove them? I am scandaliz'd, I confess, that in so sacred a Government as that of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> there should be mix'd so hypocritical a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at the Enterrment of their Kings; where all their Confederates and Neighbours, and all sorts and Degrees of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as well as their Slaves,<note place="margin">Ceremony of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at the Enterr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Kings.</note> cut and slash'd their Fore-heads in Token of Sorrow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating in their Cries and Lamentations, That that King (let him have been as wicked as the Devil) was the best that ever they had; by

this means attributing to his Quality the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that only belong to Merit, and that of Right is properly due to the most supream Desert, though lodg'd in the lowest and most inferiour Subject. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (who will still have a hand in every thing) makes a <hi>Quaere</hi> upon the Saying of <hi>Solon, That none can be said to be happy untill he be dead.</hi> Whether then any one of those who have liv'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their Hearts Desire, if he have left an ill Repute behind him, and that his Posterity be miserable, can be said to be happy? Whilst we have Life and Motion, we convey our selves by Fancy and Preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whither and to what we please; but once out of Being, we have no more any manner of Communication with what is yet in Being: and it had therefore been better said of <hi>Solon, That Man is never happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause never so till after he is no more.</hi>

                        <hi>Bertrand de Glesquin,</hi> dying before the Castle of <hi>Rancon</hi> near unto <hi>Puy</hi> in <hi>Auvergne,</hi> the Besieg'd were afterwards, upon Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, enjoyn'd to lay down the Keys of the Place upon the Corps of the dead General. <hi>Bartolomew d' Alviano,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> General, hapning to dye in the Service of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in <hi>Brascia</hi>; and his Corps being to be carried thorough the Territory of <hi>Verona,</hi> an Enemy's Country, most of the Army were of Opinion to demand safe Conduct from the <hi>Veronese,</hi> supposing, that upon such an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it would not be denied: but <hi>Theodoro Trivulsio</hi> highly oppos'd the Motion, rather choosing to make his way by force of Arms, and to run the hazard of a Battel, saying, it was by no means decent, and very unfit, that he who in his Life was never afraid of his Enemies should seem to apprehend them when he was dead. And in truth, in Affairs of almost the same Nature, by the <hi>Greek</hi> Laws, he who made Suit to an Enemy for a Body to give it Burial, did by that Act renounce his Victory, and had no more Right to erect a Trophy; and he to whom such Suit was made, was ever, whatever otherwise the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess had been, reputed Victor. By this means it was, that <hi>Nicias</hi> lost the Advantage he had visibly obtain'd over the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> on the contrary, assur'd that he had before very doubtfully gain'd of the <hi>Baeotians.</hi> These Proceedings might appear
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53645:22"/>
very odd, had it not been a general Practice in all Ages, not only to extend the Concern of our Persons beyond the Limits of Life, but moreover, to fancy that the Favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does not only very often accompany us to the Grave, but has also, even after Life, a Concern for our Ashes: of which there are so many ancient Examples (waving those of our own Observation of later date) that it is not very necessary I should longer insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and the first of that Name, having in the long Wars betwixt him and <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had sufficient Experience of how great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance his own immediate Presence was to the Success of his Affairs, having ever been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious in whatever he undertook in his own Person; when he came to dye, bound his Son in a solemn Oath, that so soon as he should be dead, he should boyl his Body till the Flesh parted from the Bones, and reserve them to carry continually with him in his Army, so often as he should be oblig'd to go against the <hi>Scots</hi>; as if Destiny had inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly grapled Victory even to those miserable Remains. <hi>Jean Zisca,</hi> the same who so often in Vindication of <hi>Wicliffe</hi>'s Heresies, infested the <hi>Bohemian</hi> State, left order that they should flea him after his Death, and of his Skin to make a Drum, to carry in the War against his Enemies, fancying it would much contribute to the Continuation of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53645:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had always obtain'd in the War against them. In like manner, certain of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in a Day of Battel with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> carried with them the Bones of one of their Captains, in consideration of the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they had formerly obtain'd under his Conduct. And other People of the same new World do yet carry about with them in their Wars the Relicks of valiant Men who have died in Battel, to incite their Courage, and advance their Fortune: of which Examples, the first reserve nothing for the Tomb, but the Reputation they have acquir'd by their former Atchievements; but these proceed yet further, and attribute a certain Power of Operation. The last Act of Captain <hi>Bayard</hi> is of a much better Composition; who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself wounded to Death with a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze Shot, and being by his Friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd to retire out of the Fight, made Answer, That he would not begin at the last Gasp to turn his Back to the Enemy; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly still fought on, till feeling himself too faint, and no longer able to sit his Horse, he commanded his Steward to set him down against the Root of a Tree, but so that he might dye with his Face towards the Enemy, which he also did. I must yet add another Example equally remarkable, for the present Consideration, with any of the former. The Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> great Grand-father to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53645:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prince endowed throughout with great and extraordinary Qualities, and amongst the rest, with a singular Beauty of Person; but had withall, a Humour very contrary to that of other Princes, who for the dispatch of their most Important Affairs convert their Close-stool into a Chair of State, which was, that he would never permit any of his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">Modesty of <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> in what familiar degree of Favour soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to see him in that Posture; and would steal aside to make Water as religiously as a Virgin, and was as shy to discover either to his Physician, or any other whatever, those Parts that we are accustomed to conceal: and I my self, who have so impudent a way of Talking, am nevertheless naturally so modest this way, that unless at the Importunity of Necessity, or Pleasure, I very rarely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly communicate to the Sight of any, either those Parts or Actions that Custom or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us to conceal, wherein I also suffer more Constraint than I conceive is very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Man, especially of my Profession: but he nourish'd this modest Humour to such a degree of Superstition, as to give express Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in his last Will, that they should put him on Drawers so soon as he should be dead; to which methinks he would have done well to have added, that he should have been hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd too that put them on.

                        </note> I attribute to some superstitious Devotion of his, both his Historian, and Himself, amongst other great Qualities, having strew'd the whole Course of their Lives with a singular Respect to Religion. I was by no means pleas'd with a Story was told me by a Man of very great Quality, of a Relation of mine, and one who had given a very good Account of himself both in Peace and War; that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to dye in a very old Age, of an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Pain of the Stone, he spent the last Hours of his Life in an extraordinary Solitude about ordering the Ceremony of his Funeral, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the Men of Condition who came to see him, to engage their Word to attend him to his Grave, importuning this very Prince, who came to visit him at his last Gasp, with a most earnest Supplication, that he would order his Family to be assisting there, and withall representing before him several Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Examples to prove that it was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect due to a Man of his Condition; and seem'd to dye content, having obtain'd this Promise, and appointed the Method and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Funeral Parade. I have seldom heard of so long-liv'd a Vanity. Another, though contrary Solitude (of which also I do not want domestick Example,) seems to be somewhat a Kin to this; That a Man shall cudgel his Brains at the last Moments of his Life, to contrive his Obsequies to so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53645:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unusual a Parcimony, as to conclude it in the sordid expence of one single Servant with a Candle and Lanthorn. And yet I see this Humour commended, and the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his Heirs to bestow upon his Hearse even the common Ceremonies in use upon such Occasions. Is it yet Temperance and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality to avoid the Expence and Pleasure of which the use and knowledge is impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us? See here an easie and cheap Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

Happy are they who can gratifie their Senses by Insensibility, and live by their Death!

And in good earnest, as the Arm when it is advanc'd to strike, if it fail of meeting with that upon which it was design'd to discharge the blow, and spends it self in vain, does offend the Striker himself; and as also, that to make a pleasant Prospect the Sight should not be lost and dilated in a vast extent of empty Air, but have some Bounds to limit and circumscribe it at a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable distance,

And after this manner Brute Beasts direct their Fury to fall upon the Stone or Weapon that has hurt them, and with their Teeth even execute their Revenge upon themselves, for the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they have receiv'd from another.</p>

It was for this that in our Fathers days the Seigneurs <hi>de Montmard</hi> and <hi>d' Assigni</hi> defending <hi>Mouson</hi> against the Count <hi>de Nassau,</hi> were so highly censur'd; yet in this Case it would be excusable in that Governour, who going out, should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing do it in such manner, that the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Advantage should be on his side; as <hi>Count Guido de Rangoni</hi> did at <hi>Reggio</hi> (if we are to believe <hi>Bellay,</hi> for <hi>Guicciardin</hi> says it was he himself) when Monsieur <hi>de l' Escut</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd to parle, who stept so little a way from his Fort, that a Disorder hapning in the <hi>interim</hi> of Parle, not only Monsieur <hi>de l' Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> and his Party who were advanc'd with him found themselves by much the weaker, (insomuch that <hi>Alessandro de Trivulcio</hi> was there slain) but he himself was constrain'd, as the safest way, to follow the Count, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon his Honour to secure himself from the danger of the Shot within the very Walls of the Town. <hi>Eumenes,</hi> being shut up in the City of <hi>Nora</hi> by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53645:30"/>
to come out to speak with him, as he sent him word it was fit he should to a better Man than himself, and one who had now an Advantage over him, return'd this notable Answer, Tell him, said he, that <hi>I shall never think any Man better than my self, whilst I have my Sword in my hand:</hi> and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consent to come out to him, till first, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Demand, <hi>Antigonus</hi> had deliver'd him his own Nephew <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> in Hostage. And yet some have done rather better than worse in going out in Person to parle with the Assailant; witness <hi>Henry de Vaux,</hi> a Cavalier of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who being besieg'd by the <hi>English</hi> in the Castle of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew de Bone,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at the <hi>Leaguer,</hi> having so sapp'd the greatest part of the Castle without, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remain'd but setting Fire to the Props to bury the Besieg'd under the Ruines, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested the said <hi>Henry</hi> to come out to speak with him for his own Good; which the other accordingly doing, with three more in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, and his own evident Ruine being made apparent to him, he conceiv'd himself singularly oblig'd to his Enemy, to whose Discretion after he and his Garrison had surrendred themselves, Fire being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently apply'd to the Mine, the Props no sooner began to fail, but the Castle was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turn'd topsy turvy, no one Stone being left upon another. I could, and do, with great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53645:30"/>
Facility, relye upon the Faith of another; but I should very unwillingly do it in such a Case, as it should thereby be judg'd that it was rather an Effect of my Despair, and want of Courage, than voluntary, and out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Security in the Faith of him with whom I had to do.</p>

                     <p>I Saw notwithstanding lately at <hi>Mussidan,</hi> a Place not far from my House, that those who were driven out thence by our Army, and others of their Party, highly complain'd of Treachery, for that during a Treaty of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and in the very <hi>interim</hi> that their Deputies were treating, they were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and cut to pieces: a thing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure in another Age, might have had some colour of foul Play; but (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Practice of Arms in these days is quite another thing, and there is now no Confidence in an Enemy excusable, till after the last Seal of Obligation; and even then the Conquerour has enough to do to keep his Word: so hazardous a thing it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust the Observation of the Faith a Man has engag'd to a Town that surrenders upon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and favourable Conditions, to the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,

Avarice, and License of a victorious Army, and to give the Souldier free Entrance into it in the heat of Blood.<note place="margin">The Faith of military Men very uncertain.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucius Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Regillus,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor, having lost his time in attempting to take the City of <hi>Phocaea</hi> by force, by reason of the singular Valour wherewith the Inhabitants defended themselves against him, condition'd at last to receive them as Friends to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to enter the Town, as into a Confederate City, without any manner of Hostility; of which he also gave them all possible Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but having for the greater Pomp brought his whole Army in with him, it was no more in his Power, with all the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he could use, to command his People: so that Avarice and Revenge despising and trampling under foot both his Authority and all Military Discipline, he there at once saw his own Faith violated, and a considerable part of the City sack'd and ruin'd before his Face. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was wont to say, <hi>That what Mischief soever a Man could do his Enemy in time of War was above Justice, and nothing accountable to it in the Sight of Gods and Men.</hi> And according to this Principle, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Cessation with those of <hi>Argos</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, the third Night after he fell upon them when they were all buried in Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sleep, and put them to the Sword; alledging for his Excuse, That there had no Nights been mention'd in the Truce: but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53645:31"/>
the Gods punish'd his Perfidy. In a time of Parle also, and that the Citizens were intent upon their Capitulation, the City of <hi>Cassili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> was taken by Surprize, and that even in the Age of the justest Captains, and the best Discipline of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia: for it is not said, that it is not lawful for us in Time and Place to make Advantage of our Enemies want of Understanding, as well as their want of Courage: and doubtless War has a great many Priviledges, that appear reasonable, even to the Prejudice of Reason. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here the Rule fails, <hi>Neminem id agere ut ex alterius praedetur inscitia,</hi>

An Author of very great Authority, I confess, in those Affairs, as being in his own Person both a great Captain and a Philosopher of the first Form of <hi>Socrates</hi> his Disciples; and yet I cannot consent to such a measure of License as he dispenses in all Things and Places. Monsieur <hi>d' Aubigny,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving besieged <hi>Capua,</hi> and play'd a furious Battery against it, Signior <hi>Fabricio Colonne,</hi> Governour of the Town, having from a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion begun to parle, and his Souldiers in the mean time being a little more remiss in their Guard, our People took advantage of their Security, enter'd the Place at unawares, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53645:32"/>
put them all to the Sword. And of later Memory, at <hi>Yvoy,</hi> Signior <hi>Juliano Romero</hi> having play'd that part of a Novice to go out to Capitulate with the Constable, at his Return found his Place taken. But, that we might not scape Scot-free, the Marquess of <hi>Pescara</hi> having laid Siege to <hi>Genoa,</hi> where Duke <hi>Octavio Fregosa</hi> commanded under our Protection, and the Articles betwixt them being so far advanc'd that it was look'd upon as a done thing, and upon the Point to be concluded, several <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time being slip'd in under the Priviledge of the Treaty, seiz'd on the Gates, and made use of this Treachery as an absolute and fair Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: and since at <hi>Ligny</hi> in <hi>Barrois,</hi> where the Count <hi>de Brienne</hi> commanded, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour having in his own Person beleaguer'd that Place, and <hi>Bartheville,</hi> the said Count's Lieutenant, going out to parle, whilst he was Capitulating the Town was taken.

                     <head>CHAP. VII. That the Intention is Judge of our Actions.</head>
                     <p>'TIS a Saying, <hi>That Death discharges us of all our Obligations.</hi> However, I know some who have taken it in another Sense. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, King of <hi>England,</hi> articled with <hi>Don Philip</hi> Son to <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, and Father to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, when he had him upon <hi>English</hi> Ground, that the said <hi>Philip</hi> should deliver up the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> of the <hi>White Rose,</hi> his mortal Enemy, who was fled into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> into his Hands; which <hi>Philip</hi> (not knowing how to evade it) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly promis'd to do, but upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nevertheless, that <hi>Henry</hi> should attempt nothing against the Life of the said Duke, which, during his own Life he perform'd; but coming to dye, in his last Will, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Son to put him to Death imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his Decease. And lately, in the Tragedy, that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> presented to us in the Persons of two Counts, <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> at <hi>Brussels,</hi> there were very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Passages, and one amongst the rest, that the said Count <hi>Egmont</hi> (upon the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of whose Word and Faith Count <hi>Horne</hi> had come and surrendred himself to the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>) earnestly entreated that he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53645:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might first mount the Scaffold, to the end that Death might disingage him from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation he had past to the other. In which Case, methinks Death did not acquit the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of his Promise, and the second was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the good Intention of the other, even though he bad not died with him: for we cannot be oblig'd beyond what we are able to perform, by reason that the Effects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of what we promise are not at all in our Power, and that indeed we are Masters of nothing but the Will, in which, by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, all the Rules and whole Duty of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is founded and establish'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> conceiving his Soul and Will bound and indebted to his Promise, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had not the Power to make it good, had doubtless been absolv'd of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even though he had out-liv'd the other; but the King of <hi>England</hi> wilfully and preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditately breaking his Faith, was no more to be excus'd for deferring the Execution of his Infidelity till after his Death, than <hi>Herodotus</hi> his Mason, who having inviolably, during the time of his Life, kept the Secret of the Treasure of the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> his Master, at his Death discover'd it to his Children. I have taken notice of several in my time, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd by their Consciences of unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Goods of another, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make amends by their Will, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Decease: but they had as good do
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53645:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing, and delude themselves both in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so much time in so pressing an Affair, and also in going about to repair an Injury with so little Demonstration of Resentment and Concern. They owe over and above something of their own, and by how much their Payment is more strict and incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themselves, by so much is their Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution more perfect, just, and meritorious; for Penitency requires Penance: but they yet do worse than these, who reserve the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a mortal Animosity against their Neighbour to the last Gasp, having conceal'd it all the time of their Lives before, wherein they declare to have little regard of their own Honour whilst they irritate the Party offended against their Memory; and less to their Conscience, not having the Power, even out of Respect to Death it self, to make their Malice dye with them; but extending the Life of their Hatred even beyond their own. Unjust Judges, who defer Judgment to a time wherein they can have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Cause! For my part, I shall take Care, if I can, that my Death discover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that my Life has not first openly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, and publickly declar'd.</p>

                     <p>THere is not a Man living, whom it would so little become to speak of Memory as my self, for I have none at all; and do not think that the World has again another so treacherous as mine. My other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are all very ordinary and mean; but in this I think my self very singular, and to such a Degree of Excellence, that (besides
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53645:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Inconvenience I suffer by it, which merits something) I deserve, methinks, to be famous for it, and to have more than a common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: though, in truth, the necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of Memory consider'd, <hi>Plato</hi> had Reason when he call'd it a great and powerful God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess. In my Country, when they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher a Man that has no Sence, they say, such a one has no Memory; and when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of mine, they seem not to believe I am in earnest, and presently reprove me, as tho I accus'd my self for a Fool, not discerning the Difference betwixt Memory and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; wherein they are very wide of my Intention, and do me Wrong: Experience rather daily shewing us on the contrary, that a strong Memory is commonly coupled with infirm Judgment: and they do me more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over (who am so perfect in nothing as the good Friend) at the same time a greater Wrong in this, that they make the same Words which accuse my Infirmity, represent me for an ingrateful Person; wherein they bring my Integrity and good Nature into Question upon the account of my Memory, and from a natural Imperfection, unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a defect of Conscience. He has forgot, says one, this Request, or that Promise; he no more remembers his Friends, he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to say or do, or to conceal such and such a thing for my sake. And truly, I am apt enough to forget many things, but to neglect any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53645:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing my Friend has given me in charge, I never do it. And it should be enough, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, that I feel the Misery and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, without branding me with Malice, a Vice so much a Stranger, and so contrary to my Nature. However, I derive these Comforts from my Infirmity; first, that it is an Evil from which principally I have found reason to correct a worse, that would easily enough have grown upon me, namely, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this Defect being intolerable in those who take upon them the Negotiations of the World, an Employment of the greatest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Trust among Men: secondly, that (as several like Examples in the Progress of Nature demonstrate to us) she has fortified me in my other Faculties, proportionably as she has unfurnish'd me in this; I should otherwise have been apt implicitely to have repos'd my Wit and Judgment upon the bare Report of other Men, without ever setting them to work upon any Inquisition whatever, had the strange Inventions and Opinions of the Authors I have read been ever present with me by the Benefit of Memory: thirdly, That by this Means I am not so talkative, for the Magazine of the Memory is ever better furnish'd with matter than that of the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and had mine been faithful to me, I had e're this, deaf'd all my Friends with my eternal Babble, the Subjects themselves row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and stirring up the little Faculty I have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53645:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of handling, and applying them, heating and extending my Discourse. 'Tis a great Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and what I have observ'd in several of my intimate Friends, who, as their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries supply them with a present and entire Review of things, derive their Narrative from so remote a Fountain, and crowd them with so many impertinent Circumstances, that though the Story be good in it self, they make a shift to spoil it; and if otherwise, you are either to curse the Strength of their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or the Weakness of their Judgment: and it is a hard thing to close up a Discourse, and to cut it short, when you are once in, and have a great deal more to say. Neither is there any thing wherein the Force and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of a Horse is so much seen, as in a round, graceful, and sudden stop; and I see even those who are pertinent enough, who would, but cannot stop short in their Career: for whilst they are seeking out a handsome Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to conclude the Sense, they talk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and are so perplex'd, and entangled in their own Eloquence, that they know not what they say. But above all, old Men, who yet retain the Memory of things past, and forget how often they have told them, are the most dangerous Company for this fault; and I have known Stories from the Mouth of a Man of very great Quality, otherwise very pleasant in themselves, become very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, by being a hundred times repeated over
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53645:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and over again. The fourth Obligation I have to this infirm Memory of mine, is, that by this means I less remember the Injuries I have receiv'd; insomuch, that (as the Ancient said) I should have a <hi>Protocole,</hi> a Register of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or a Prompter, like <hi>Darius,</hi> who, that he might not forget the Offence he had receiv'd from those of <hi>Athens,</hi> so oft as he sat down to Dinner, order'd one of his Pages three times to whoop in his Ear, <hi>Sir, remember the Athenians:</hi> and also, the Places which I revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, and the Books I read over again, still smile upon me with a fresh Novelty. It is not without good Reason said, That he who has not a good Memory should never take upon him the Trade of Lying. I know very well, that the <hi>Grammarians</hi> distinguish betwixt an <hi>Vntruth</hi> and a <hi>Lye,</hi> and say, that to tell an <hi>Vntruth</hi> is to tell a thing that is false, but that we our selves believe to be true; and that to <hi>Lye,</hi> is to tell a thing which we know in our Conscience to be utterly false and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; and it is of this last sort of Lyers only that I now speak. Now these do either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrive and invent the Untruths they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or so alter and disguise a true Story, that it always ends in a Lye; and when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise and often alter the same Story accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Fancy, 'tis very hard for them at one time or another to escape being trap'd, by reason that the real Truth of the Thing having first taken Possession of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53645:38"/>
Memory, and being there lodg'd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by the way of Knowledge and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it will be ever ready to present it self to the Imagination, and to shoulder out any Falshood of their own contriving, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not there have so sure and settled Footing as the other; and the Circumstances of the first true Knowledge evermore running in their Minds, will be apt to make them forget those that are illegitimate, and only forg'd by their own Fancy. In what they wholly invent, forasmuch as there is no contrary Impression to justle their Invention, there seems to be less danger of tripping; and yet even this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, by reason it is a vain Body, and without any other Foundation than Fancy only, is very apt to escape the Memory, if they be not careful to make themselves very perfect in their Tale. Of which I have had very pleasant Experience, at the Expence of such as profess only to form, and accommodate their Speech<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to the Affair they have in hand, or to the Humour of the Person with whom they have to do; for the Circumstances to which these men stick not to enslave their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and their Faith being subject to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Changes, their Language must according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vary: from whence it happens, that of the same thing they tell one Man, that it is this, and another that it is that, giving it several Forms and Colours; which Men, if they once come to confer Notes, and find out the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53645:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cheat, what becomes of this fine Art? To which may be added, that they must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity very often ridiculously trap themselves; for, what Memory can be sufficient to retain so many different Shapes as they have forg'd upon one and the same Subject? I have known many in my Time, very ambitious of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of this fine piece of Discretion; but they do not see, that if there be a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being wise, there is really no Prudence in it. In plain Truth, Lying is a hateful and an accursed Vice. We are not Men, nor have other Tye upon one another, but our Word. If we did but discover the Horror and ill Consequences of it, we should pursue it with Fire and Sword, and more justly than other Crimes. I see that Parents commonly, and with Indiscretion enough, correct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for little innocent Faults, and torment them for wanton childish Tricks, that have neither Impression, nor tend to any Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: whereas, in my Opinion, Lying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (what is of something a lower Form) Stomach, are the Faults which are to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely whip'd out of them, both in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and Progress of the Vices, which will otherwise grow up and increase with them; and after a Tongue has once got the Knack of lying, 'tis not to be imagined how impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible almost it is to reclaim it. Whence it comes to pass, that we see some, who are otherwise very honest Men, so subject to this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53645:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vice. I have an honest Lad to my Taylor, who I never knew guilty of one Truth, no not when it had been to his Advantage. If <hi>Falshood</hi> had, like <hi>Truth,</hi> but one Face only, we should be upon better Terms; for we should then take the contrary to what the <hi>Lyer</hi> says for certain Truth; but the Reverse of <hi>Truth</hi> has a hundred thousand Figures, and a Field indefinite without Bound or Limit. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> make <hi>Good</hi> to be certain and finite, and <hi>Evil,</hi> infinite and uncertain; there are a thousand ways to miss the White, there is only one to hit it. For my own part, I have this Vice in so great horror, that I am not sure I could prevail with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to secure my self from the most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and extream Danger, by an impudent and solemn Lye. An ancient Father says, <hi>That a Dog we know is better Company than a Man whose Language we do not understand.</hi> Ut externus non alieno sit hominis vice,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plin. Nat. Hist. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> 
                        <hi>As a Foreigner, to one that understands not what he says, cannot be said to supply the Place of a Man,</hi> because he can be no Company. And how much less sociable is false Speaking than Silence? King <hi>Francis</hi> the First brag'd, that he had, by this means, non-plus'd <hi>Franciso Taverna,</hi> the Embassador of <hi>Francisco Sforza,</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> a Man very famous for his Eloquence in those days. This Gentleman had been sent to excuse his Master to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty about a thing of very great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53645:39"/>
which was this: King <hi>Francis,</hi> to maintain evermore some Intelligence in <hi>Italy,</hi> out of which he had lately been driven, and particularly in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> had thought it (to that end) convenient to have evermore a Gentleman on his Behalf to lye Leiger in the Court of that Duke; an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in Effect, but in outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance no other than a private Person who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reside there upon the single Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own particular Affairs; which was so carried, by reason that the Duke, much more depending upon the Emperour, especially at a time when he was in a Treaty of a Marriage with his Neece, Daughter to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and since Dowager of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> could not own any Friendship or Intelligence with us, but very much to his own Prejudice. For this Commission then one <hi>Merveille</hi> a <hi>Millanois</hi> Gentleman, and a Querry to the King, being thought very fit, he was accordingly dispatch'd thither with private Letters of Credence, his Instructions of Ambassadour, and other Letters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to the Duke about his own private Concerns, the better to colour the Business; and so long continued in that Court, that the Emperour at last had some Incling of his real Employment there, and complain'd of it to the Duke, which was the Occasion of what followed after, as we suppose; which was, that under Pretence of a Murther by him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53645:40"/>
committed, his Tryal was in two days dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, and his Head in the Night strook off in Prison. Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> then being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account, came to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and, prepar'd with a long counterfeit Story to excuse a thing of so dangerous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, (for the King had apply'd himself to all the Princes of <hi>Christendom,</hi> as well as to the Duke himself, to demand Satisfaction for this Outrage upon the Person of his Minister) had his Audience at the morning Council; where, after he had for the Support of his Cause, in a long premeditated Oration, laid open several plausible Justifications of the Fact, he concluded, that the Duke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had never look'd upon this <hi>Merveille</hi> for other than a private Gentleman, and his own Subject, who was there only in order to his own Business, neither had he ever liv'd after any other manner; absolutely disowning that he had ever heard he was one of the King's Domestick Servants, or that his Majesty so much as knew him, so far was he from taking him for an Ambassadour. When having made an end, and the King pressing him with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Objections and Demands, and sifting him on all hands, gravell'd him at last, by asking, why then the Execution was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Night, and as is were by Stealth? At which the poor confounded Ambassador, the more handsomly to disingage himself, made Answer, That the Duke would have been
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53645:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very loath, out of Respect to his Majesty, that such an Execution should have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in the Face of the Sun. Any one may guess if he was not well school'd when he came home, for having so grosly trip'd in the Presence of a Prince of so delicate a Nostril as King <hi>Francis.</hi> Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent an Ambassadour to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to animate him against King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> the Ambassadour having had his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the King, before he would give a positive Answer, insisting upon the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he found in setting on foot so great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration as would be necessary to attack so potent a King, and urging some Reasons to that Effect, the Ambassadour very unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reply'd, that he had also himself consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the same difficulties, and had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as much to the Pope. From which Saying of his, so directly opposite to the Thing propounded, and the Business he came about, which was immediately to incite him to War, the King first deriv'd Argument, (which also he afterwards found to be true) that this Ambassadour, in his own private Bosom, was a Friend to the <hi>French</hi>; of which having advertis'd the Pope, his Estate at his Return home was confiscate, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self very narrowly escap'd the losing of his Head.</p>

                     <p>AS we see in the Gift of Eloquence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in some have such a Facility and Promptness, and that which we call a <hi>present</hi> Wit, so easie, that they are ever ready upon all Occasions, and never to be surpriz'd: and others more heavy and slow, never venture to utter any thing but what they have long premeditated, and taken great Care and Pains to fit and prepare. Now, as we teach young Ladies those Sports and Exercises which are most proper to set out the Grace and Beauty of those Parts wherein their chiefest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Perfection lye; so in these two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Eloquence, to which the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Preachers of our Age seem princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to pretend. If I were worthy to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, the slow Speaker, methinks, should be more proper for the Pulpit, and the other for the Bar; and that because the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the first does naturally allow him all the Leisure he can desire to prepare himself, and besides, his Career is perform'd in an even
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53645:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unintermitted Line, without stop or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; whereas, the Pleader's Business and Interest compells him to enter the Lists upon all Occasions, and the unexpected Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and Replies of his adverse Party, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle him out of his Course, and put him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Instant, to pump for new and <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Answers and Defences. Yet, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview betwixt Pope <hi>Clement</hi> and King <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> it hapned quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that <hi>Monsieur Poyett,</hi> a man bred up all his Life at the Bar, and in the highest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for Eloquence, having the Charge of making the Harangue to the Pope committed to him, and having so long meditated on it before-hand, as (as it was said) to have brought it ready made along with him from <hi>Paris</hi>; the very day it was to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, the Pope, fearing something might be said that might give Offence to the other Princes Ambassadors who were there attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, sent to acquaint the King with the Argument which he conceiv'd most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Time and Place, but by chance quite another thing to that <hi>Monsieur de Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ett</hi> had taken so much Pains about: so that the fine Speech he had prepared, was of no use, and he was upon the Instant to contrive another; which finding himself unable to do, Cardinal <hi>Bellay</hi> was constrain'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Office. The Pleader's Part is, doubtless, much harder than that of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53645:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Preacher; and yet, in my Opinion, we see more passable Lawyers than Preachers. It should seem that the nature of Wit is, to have its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration prompt and sudden, and that of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to have it more deliberate, and more slow: but he who remains totally silent for want of leisure to prepare himself to speak well, and he also whom leisure does no ways benefit to better speaking, are equally unhappy. 'Tis said of <hi>Severus,</hi> that he spoke best <hi>extempore,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Severus Cassius.</hi>
                        </note> that he stood more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Fortune, than his own Diligence, that it was an advantage to him to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in speaking, and that his Adversaries were afraid to nettle him, lest his Anger should redouble his Eloquence. I know experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, a Disposition so impatient of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and elaborate Premeditation, that if it do not go frankly and gayly to work, can perform nothing to purpose. We say of some Compositions, that they stink of Oyl, and smell of the Lamp, by reason of a certain rough harshness that the laborious handling imprints upon those where great Force has been employ'd: but besides this, the solicitude of doing well, and a certain striving and contending of a mind too far strain'd, and over-bent upon its Undertaking, breaks, and hinders it self, like Water, that by force of its own pressing violence and abundance, cannot find a ready issue through the neck of a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or a narrow Sluce. In this condition of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53645:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nature, of which I was now speaking, there is this also, that it would not be disorder'd, and stimulated with such a Passion as the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Cassius</hi>; for such a Motion would be too violent and rude: it would not be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but sollicited, and would be rouz'd and heated by unexpected, sudden, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Occasions. If it be left to it self, it flags and languishes, Agitation only gives it grace and vigour. I am alwayes worst in my own possession, and when wholly at my own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, Accident has more title to any thing that comes from me, than I; Occasion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and even the very rising and falling of my own Voice, extract more from my Fancy, than I can find when I examin and employ it by my self; by which means, the things I say are better than those I write, if either were to be prefer'd, where neither are worth any thing. This also befalls me, that I am at a loss, when I seek, and light upon things more by chance, than by any inquisition of my own Judgment. I perhaps sometimes hit upon something when I write that seems queint and spritely to me, but will appear dull and heavy to another. But let us leave this Subject. Every one talks thus of himself according to his Talent. For my part, I am already so lost in it, that I know not what I was about to say, and in such cases, a stranger often finds it out before me.

Upon the Rumour of which, all the People ran to see the sight, by whom his Words and Science, containing the Principles and means to attain to this Art, were recorded, and kept for many Ages. A Birth sutable to its Progress! I for my part should sooner regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late my Affairs by the chance of a Die, than by such idle and vain Dreams. And indeed, in all Republicks, a good share of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has ever been referr'd to chance. <hi>Plato,</hi> in the civil Regiment that he models according to his own Fancy, leaves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of several things of very great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance wholly to it, and will, amongst other things, that such Marriages as he reputes legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and good, be appointed by Lot, and attributing so great Vertue, and adding so great a Priviledge to this accidental choice, as to ordain the Children begot in such Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock to be brought up in the Country, and those begot in any other to be thrust out as spurious and base; yet so, that if any of those Exiles, notwithstanding, should peradventure in growing up give any early hopes of future Vertue, they were in a Capacity of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, as those also who had been retain'd were of being exil'd in case they gave little Expectation of themselves in their greener Years. I see some who are mightily given to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53645:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Study, pore and comment upon their Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, and produce them for Authority when any thing has fall'n out pat: though it is hardly possible, but that these well-Wishers to the Mathematicks in saying so much, must sometimes stumble upon some Truths amongst an infinite Number of Lies. <hi>Quis est enim qui totum diem jaculans non aliquando conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neet?</hi>

Besides, no Body records their Flim-flams and false Prognosticks, forasmuch as they are infinite and common; but if they chop upon one Truth, that carries a mighty Report, as being rare, incredible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious. So <hi>Diogenes,</hi> surnam'd the <hi>Atheist,</hi> answer'd him in <hi>Samothrace,</hi> who shewing him in the Temple the several Offerings and Stories, in Painting, of those who had escap'd Shipwrack, said to him, <hi>Look you</hi> (said he) <hi>you who think the Gods have no care of humane things, what do you say by so many Persons preserv'd from Death by their especial Favour? Why, I say,</hi> (answer'd he) <hi>that their Pictures are not here who were cast away, which were by much the greater number. Cicero</hi> observes, that of all the Philosophers who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd a Deity, <hi>Xenophanes</hi> only has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to eradicate all manner of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

which makes it the less a Wonder, if we have sometimes seen some of our Princes, to their own cost, relye too much upon these Fopperies. I wish I had given any thing, that I had with my own Eyes seen those two great Rarities, the Book of <hi>Joachim</hi> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrian</hi> Abbot, which foretold all the future Popes, their Names, and Figures; and that of the Emperour <hi>Leo,</hi> which prophecied of all the Emperours and Patriarchs of <hi>Greece.</hi> This I have been an Eye-witness of, that in publick Confusions, men astonish'd at their Fortune, have abandoned their own Reason superstitiously to seek out in the Stars the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Causes and Menaces of their present mishaps, and in my time have been so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly successful in it, as to make men believe, that this Study, being proper to fix and settle piercing and volatile Wits, those who have been any thing vers'd in this knack of unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and untying Riddles, are capable in any sort of Writing, to find out what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. But above all, that which gives them the greatest Room to play in, is the obscure, ambiguous, and fantastick Gibberish of their prophetick Canting, where their Authors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver nothing of clear Sense, but shroud all in Riddle, to the end that Posterity may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, and apply it according to their own Fancy. <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Daemon,</hi> or <hi>Familiar,</hi> might perhaps be no other but a certain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of the Will, which obtruded it self

upon him without the advice or consent of his Judgment; and in a Soul so enlightned as his was, and so prepar'd by a continual exercise of Wisdom and Virtue, 'tis to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, those Inclinations of his, though sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and undigested, were ever very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and worthy to be follow'd. Every one finds in himself some Image of such Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of a prompt, vehement, and foetuitous Opinion. 'Tis I that am to allow them some Authority, who attribute so little to our own Prudence, and who also my self have had some, weak in Reason, but violent in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion and Disswasion, (which were most frequent with <hi>Socrates</hi>) by which I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd my self to be carried away so foetunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so much to my own Advantage, that they might have been judg'd to have had something in them of a Divine Inspiration.</p>

honest ways and means of securing our selves from Harms, are not only permitted, but moreover commendable, and the Business of Constancy chiefly is, bravely to stand to, and stoutly to suffer those Inconveniences which are not otherwise possibly to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Of which kind of Fighting, the <hi>Turks</hi> yet retain something in their Practice of Arms to this day; and <hi>Socrates,</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> laughs at <hi>Laches,</hi> who had defin'd Fortitude to be a standing firm in their Ranks against the Enemy: <hi>What</hi> (says he) <hi>would it then be a reputed Cowardize to overcome them by giving Ground?</hi> urging at the same time the Authority of <hi>Homer,</hi> who commends <hi>Aeneas</hi> for his Skill in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away.

And yet in the Expedition that the Emperour

                        <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth made into <hi>Provence,</hi> the <hi>Marquis de Guast</hi> going to discover the City of <hi>Arles,</hi> and venturing to advance out of the Blind of a Wind-mill, under favour of which he had made his Approach, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the Seigneurs <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the <hi>Seneschal</hi> of <hi>Agenois,</hi> who were walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Theatre Aux arenes</hi>; who having shewed him to the Sieur <hi>de Villiers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Theatre where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Shews of Riding, Fencing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were exhibited.</note> Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of the Artillery, he travers'd a Culverine so admirable well, and levell'd it so exactly right against him, that had not the Marquis, seeing Fire given to it, slip'd aside, it was certainly concluded, the Shot had taken him full in the Body. And in like manner, some Years before, <hi>Lorenzo de Medici,</hi> Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> and Father to the Queen-Mother of <hi>France,</hi> laying Siege to <hi>Mondolpho,</hi> a Place in the Territories of the <hi>Vicariat</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cannoneer give Fire to a Piece that pointed directly against him, it was well for him that he duck'd, for otherwise, the Shot, that only raz'd the top of his Head, had doubtless hit him full in the Breast. To say truth, I do not think that these Evasions are perform'd upon the account of Judgment; for how is any Man living able to judge of high or low Aim on so sudden an Occasion? And it is much more easie to believe, that Fortune favour'd their Apprehension, and that it might be a means at another time, as well to make them step into the danger, as to teach
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53645:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to avoid it. For my own part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I cannot forbear starting when the Rattle of a Harquebuze thunders in my Ears on a sudden, and in a Place where I am not to expect it, which I have also observ'd in others, braver Fellows than I; neither do the Stoicks pretend, that the Soul of their Philosopher should be proof against the first Visions and Fantasies that surprize him; but as a natural Subject, consent that he should tremble at the terrible noise of Thunder, or the sudden Clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of some falling Ruine, and be affrighted even to Paleness and Convulsion. And so in other Passions, provided a Man's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remain sound and entire, and that the Scite of his Reason suffers no Concussion nor Alteration, and that he yields no consent to his Fright and Discomposure. To him who is not a Philosopher, a Fright is the same in the first part of it, but quite another thing in the second; for the Impression of Passions does not remain only superficially in him, but penetrates further, even to the very Seat of Reason, and so, as to infect and to corrupt it. He judges according to his Fear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms his Behaviour to it. But in this Verse you may see the true State of the wise Stoick learnedly and plainly express'd:

                     <p>THere is no Subject so frivolous, that does not merit a Place in this Rapsody. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Rule of Civility, it would be a kind of an Affront to an Equal, and much more to a Superiour, to fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, when he has given you notice he will come to visit you. Nay, Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Navarr</hi> further adds, that it would be a Rudeness in a Gentleman to go out to meet any that is coming to see him, let him be of what condition soever; and that it is more respective, and more civil to stay at home to receive him, if only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of missing of him by the way, and that is enough to receive him at the door, and to wait upon him to his Chamber. For my part, who as much as I can endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Ceremonies of my House, I very often forget both the one and the other of these vain Offices, and peradventure some one

may take Offence at it; if he do, I am sorry, but I cannot find in my heart to help it; it is much better to offend him once, than my self every day, for it would be a perpetual slavery; and to what end do we avoid the servile attendance of Courts, if we bring the same, or a greater trouble, home to our own private houses? It is also a common Rule in all Assemblies, that those of less quality are to be first upon the Place, by reason that it is a State more due to the better Sort to make others wait and expect them. Nevertheless, at the Interview betwixt Pope <hi>Clement</hi> and King <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Marselles,</hi> the King, after he had in his own Person taken order in the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Preparations for his Reception and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, withdrew out of the Town, and gave the Pope two or three dayes respite for his Entry, and wherein to repose and refresh himself before he came to him. And in like manner, at the Assignation of the Pope and the Emperour at <hi>Bolognia,</hi> the Emperour gave the Pope leave to come thither first, and came himself after; for which, the reason then given was this; that at all the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views of such Princes, the greater ought to be first at the appointed Place, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, in whose Territories the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview is appointed to be, intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a kind of deference to the other, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing proper for the less to seek out, and to apply themselves to the greater, and not

the greater to them. Not every Country on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but every City, and so much as every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, have their particular Forms of Civility. There was care enough taken in my Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I have liv'd in good Company enough to know the Formalities of our own Nation, and am able to give Lesson in it; I love also to follow them, but not to be so servilely tyed to their observation, that my whole Life should be enslav'd to Ceremony; of which there are some, that provided a man omits them out of Discretion, and not for want of Breeding, it will be every whit as handsom. I have seen some People rude, by being over-civil, and troublesome in their Courtesie: though, these Excesses excepted, the knowledge of Courtesie and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is a very necessary study. It is, like Grace and Beauty, that which begets liking and an inclination to love one another at the first sight, and in the beginning of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and Familiarity; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which first opens the door, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tromits us to Better our selves by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others, if there be any thing in their Society worth taking notice of.</p>

                     <p>VAlour has its bounds, as well as other Vertues, which once transgress'd, the next step is into the Territories of Vice, so that by having too large a Proportion of this Heroick Vertue, unless a man be very perfect in its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, which upon the Consines are very hard to discern, he may very easily unawares run into Temerity, Obstinacy, and Folly. From this consideration it is, that we have deriv'd the Custom in times of War, to punish even with Death those who are obstinate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a Place that is not tenable by the Rules of War. In which case, if there were not some Examples made, men would be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident upon the hopes of Impunity, that not a Hen-roost but would resist, and stop a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Army. The Constable <hi>Monsieur de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> having at the Siege of <hi>Pavie</hi> been order'd to pass the <hi>Tesine,</hi> and to take up his Quarters in the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antonie,</hi> being hindred so to do by a Tower that was at the end of the Bridge, which was so impudent as to endure a Battery, hang'd every man he found within it for their labour. And again since, accompanying the <hi>Daulphin</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53645:51"/>
beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> and taking the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Villane</hi> by Assault, and all within it being put to the Sword, the Governour and his Ensign only excepted, he caus'd them both to be truss'd up for the same reason; as also did Captain <hi>Martin du Bellay,</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Turin,</hi> the Governour of <hi>St. Bony,</hi> in the same Country, all his People being cut in pieces at the taking of the Place. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Strength or Weakness of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress is always measur'd by the Estimate and Counterpoise of the Forces that attack it (for a Man might reasonably enough despise two Culverines, that would be a Mad-man to abide a Battery of thirty pieces of Cannon) where also the Greatness of the Prince who is Master of the Field, his Reputation, and the Respect that is due unto him, is always put into the Ballance, 'tis dangerous to affront such an Enemy: and besides, by compelling him to force you, you possess him with so great an Opinion of himself and his Power, that thinking it unreasonable any Place should dare to shut their Gates against his victorious Army, he puts all to the Sword, where he meets with any Opposition, whilst his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune continues; as is very plain in the fierce and arrogant Forms of summoning Towns, and denouncing War, savouring so much of <hi>Barbarian</hi> Pride and Insolence in use amongst the Oriental Princes, and which their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to this day do yet retain and practice.

And even in that remote Part of the World where the <hi>Portuguese</hi> subdued the <hi>Indians,</hi> they found some States where it was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and inviolable Law amongst them, that every Enemy, overcome by the King in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or by his representative Lieutenant, was out of Composition both of Ransome and Mercy. So that above all things, a Man should take heed of falling into the hands of a Judge who is an Enemy and victorious.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Punishment of Cowardize.</head>
                     <p>I Once heard of a Prince, and a great Captain, having a Narration given him as he sat at Table of the Proceeding against Monsieur <hi>de Vervius,</hi> who was sentenc'd to Death for having surrendred <hi>Bullen</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> openly maintain'd, that a Souldier could not justly be put to Death for his want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And, in truth, a Man should make a great Difference betwixt Faults that merely proceed from Infirmity, and those that are visibly the Effects of Treachery and Malice: for in the last they will fully act against the Rules of Reason, that Nature has imprinted in us; whereas in the former it seems as if we might produce the same Nature, who left us in such a state of Imperfection, and defect
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53645:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Courage for our justification. Insomuch, that many have thought we are not justly questionable for any thing but what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit against the Light of our own Conscience. And it is partly upon this Rule, that those ground their Opinion, who disapprove of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and Sanguinary Punishments inflicted upon Hereticks and Miscreants; and theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, who hold that an Advocate or a Judge are not accountable for having ignorantly fail'd in their Administration. But as to Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, it is most certain, that the most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way of chastising that is by Ignominy and Disgrace; and it is suppos'd that this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was first brought into use by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator <hi>Cherondas</hi>; and that before his time the Laws of <hi>Greece</hi> punish'd those with Death who fled from a Battel; whereas he ordain'd only that they should be three days expos'd in the publick Place dress'd in Womens At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, hoping yet for some Service from them, having awak'd their Courage by this open Shame; <hi>Suffundere malis hominis sanguinem quÃ m effundere,</hi> choosing rather to bring the Blood into their Cheeks than to let it out of their Bodies. It appears also, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Laws did anciently punish those with Death who had run away: for <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> says, that the Emperour <hi>Julian</hi> commanded ten of his Souldiers, who had turn'd their Backs in an Encounter against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> to be first degraded, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53645:53"/>
put to death, according (says he) to the ancient Laws, and yet else-where, for the like Offence, he only condemns others to remain amongst the Prisoners under the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Ensign. The punishment the People of <hi>Rome</hi> inflicted upon those who fled from the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> and those who run away with <hi>Cneius Fulvius,</hi> at his Defeat, did not extend to death. And yet methinks Men should consider what they do in such Cases, lest disgrace should make such Delinquents desperate, and not only faint Friends, but implacable and mortal Enemies. Of late memory, the <hi>Seigneur de Franget,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Mareschal <hi>de Chattilion</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, having by the Mareschal <hi>de Chabanes</hi> been put in Governour of <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> in the Place of <hi>Monsieur de Lude,</hi> and having sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd it to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he was for that condemn'd to be degraded from all Nobility, and both himself and his Posterity declar'd ignoble, taxable, and for ever incapable of bearing Arms; which severe Sentence was afterwards accordingly executed at <hi>Lions:</hi> and since that, all the Gentlemen who were in <hi>Guise</hi> when <hi>Count Nassau</hi> enter'd into it underwent the same Punishment, as several others have done since for the like Offence. Notwithstanding, in case of such a manifest Ignorance or Cowardize as exceeds all other ordinary Example, 'tis but reason to take it for a sufficient Proof of Treachery and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53645:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And to this purpose, in reading Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which is every Body's Subject, I use to consider what kind of Men are the Authors; which, if Persons that profess nothing but mere Learning, I, in and from them principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe and learn the Stile and Language; if Physicians, I upon that account the rather incline to credit what they report of the Temperature of the Air, of the Health and Complexions of Princes, of Wounds, and Diseases; if Lawyers, we are from them to take notice of the Controversies of Right and Title, the Establishment of Laws and Civil Government, and the like; if Divines, the Affairs of the Church, Ecclesiastical Censures, Marriages and Dispensations; if Courtiers, Manners and Ceremonies; if Souldiers, the things that properly belong to their Trade, and principally the Accounts of such Actions and Enterprizes wherein they were personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged; and if Ambassadours, we are to observe their Negotiations, Intelligences, and Practices, and the Manner how they are to be carried on. And this is the reason why (which perhaps I should have lightly pass'd over in another) I dwelt upon and maturely consider'd one Passage in the History writ by Monsieur <hi>de Langey</hi> (a Man of very great
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53645:55"/>
Judgment in things of that nature) which was, after having given a Narrative of the fine Oration <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had made in the Consistory at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Presence of the Bishop of <hi>Mascon</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Velley</hi> our Ambassadours there, wherein he had mixed several tart and injurious Expressions to the Dishonour of our Nation; and amongst the rest, <hi>That if his Captains and Souldiers were not Men of another kind of Fidelity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and sufficiency in the Knowledge of Arms, than those of the King, he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go with a Rope about his Neck and sue to him for Mercy,</hi> (and it should seem the Emperour had really this, or a very little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of our military Men, for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, twice or thrice in his Life, said the very same thing) as also, that he challenged the King to fight him in his Shirt with Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Poigniard in a Boat: the said <hi>Sieur de Langey</hi> pursuing his History, adds, that the forenam'd Ambassadours, sending a Dispatch to the King of these things, conceal'd the greatest part, and particularly the two last Passages. At which I could not but wonder, that it should be in the Power of an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour to dispence with any thing which he ought to signifie to his Master, especially of so great Importance as this, coming from the Mouth of such a Person, and spoke in so great an Assembly; and should rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it had been the Servant's Duty faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to have represented to him the whole and naked Truth as it past, to the end, that the Liberty of disposing, judging, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, might absolutely have remain'd in him: for either to conceal, or to disguise the Truth for fear he should take it otherwise than he ought to do, and lest it should prompt him to some extravagant Resolution, and in the mean time to leave him ignorant of his Affairs, should seem, methinks, rather to belong to him who is to give the Law, than to him who is only to receive it; to him who is in supream Command, and best can judge of his own Interests, and not to him who ought to look upon himself as inferiour in Authority, so also in Prudence and good Counsel: but let it be how it will, I for my Part would be loth to be so serv'd in my little Concerns. We do so willingly slip the Collar of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon any Pretence whatever, and are so ready to usurp upon Dominion, and every one does so naturally aspire to Liberty and Power, that no Utility whatever deriv'd from the Wit or Valour of those he does employ, ought to be so dear to a Superiour, as a down-right and sincere Obedience. To obey more upon the Account of Understanding than of Subjection, is to corrupt the Office, and to subvert the Power of Command; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>P. Crassus,</hi> the same whom the <hi>Romans</hi> reputed five times happy, at the time when he was Consul in <hi>Asia,</hi> having sent to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53645:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Greek Engineer to cause the greater of two Masts of Ships that he had taken notice of at <hi>Athens,</hi> to be brought to him, to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about some Engine of Battery he had a design to make; the other, presuming upon his own Science, and sufficiency in those Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, thought fit to do otherwise than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and to bring the less; which also, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Art, was really more proper for the use to which it was design'd: but <hi>Crassus,</hi> though he gave ear to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with great Patience, would not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever take them, how sound or convincing soever, for current Pay, but yet remained so highly offended at his Disobedience, that he caus'd him to be sufficiently whip'd for his Pains, valuing the Interest of Discipline much more than of the thing. Notwithstanding, we may on the other side consider, that so precise and implicite an Obedience as this, is only due to positive and limited Commands. The Employment of an Ambassadour is never so confin'd; several things in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs, and in the various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen Occurrences and Accidents that may fall out in the Management of a Negotiation of this nature, being wholly referr'd to the absolute Sovereignty of their own Conduct: neither do they simply execute only, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to their own Discretion and Wisdom form and model their Master's Pleasure; and I have in my time known Men of Command who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53645:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have been check'd for having rather obeyed the express Words of the King's Letters, than the necessity of the Affairs they had in hand. Men of Understanding do yet to this day condemn the Custom of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> to give their Lieutenants and Agents so little Rein, that upon the least arising Difficulties they must evermore have Recourse to their further Commands; this delay in so vast an extent of Dominion having often very much prejudic'd their Affairs. And <hi>Crassus,</hi> writing to a man whose Profession it was best to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand those things, and pre-acquainting him to what use this Mast was design'd, did he not seem to consult his Advice, and in a manner invite him to interpose his better Judgment?</p>

                     <p>I Am not so good a Naturalist as to discern by what secret Springs <hi>Fear</hi> has its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us; but I am wise enough to know, that it is a strong Passion, and such a one,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53645:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Physicians say there is no other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that sooner disthrones our Judgment from its proper Seat; which is so true, that I my self have seen very many become frantick tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Fear; and even in those of the best setled Temper, it is most certain, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a terrible Astonishment and Confusion during the Fit. I omit the Vulgar sort, to whom it one while represents their Great-Grandsires, risen out of their Graves in their Shrowds, another while <hi>Hob-Goblins, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> and <hi>Chimaera</hi>'s: but even amongst Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (a sort of men over whom, of all others, it ought to have the least Power) how often has it converted Flocks of Sheep into armed Squadrons, Reeds and Bull-rushes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pikes and Launces, Friends into Enemies, and the <hi>French</hi> White into the Red Crosses of <hi>Spain!</hi> When <hi>Monsieur de Bourbon</hi> took the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> an Ensign who was upon the Guard at the Bourg <hi>St. Pierre,</hi> was seiz'd with such a Fright upon the first Alarm, that he threw himself out at a Breach with his Colours upon his Shoulder, and ran directly upon the Enemy, thinking he had retreated toward the inward Defences of the City, and with much ado, seeing <hi>Monsieur de Bourbon's</hi> People, who thought it had been a Sally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, draw up to receive him, at last came to himself, and saw his Error; and then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing about, he retreated full speed thorough the same Breach by which he had gone out;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53645:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but not till he had first blindly advanc'd above three hundred Paces into the open Field. It did not however fall out so well with Captain <hi>Julius</hi> his Ensign at the time when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taken from us by the Count <hi>de Bures</hi> and Monsieur <hi>du Reu,</hi> for he, being so astonish'd with Fear, as to throw himself and his Fellows out at a Skyt-gate, was immediately cut to pieces by the Enemy; and in the same Siege it was a very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fear, that so seiz'd, contracted, and froze up the Heart of a young Gentleman, that he sunk down stone dead in the Breach, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Wound or Hunt at all. The like Madness does sometimes push on a whole Multitude; for in one of the Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that <hi>Germanicus</hi> had with the <hi>Germans,</hi> two great Parties were so amaz'd with Fear, that they ran two opposite ways, the one and the other to the same place, from which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had fled before. Sometimes it adds Wings to the Heels, as in the two first, and sometimes nails them to the Ground, and fetters them from moving; as we read of the Emperour <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who, in a Battel he lost against the <hi>Agarens,</hi> was so astonish'd and stupified, that he had no Power to fly; <hi>adeo pavor etiam auxilia formidat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Quint. Curt. l.</hi> 3.</note> so much does Fear dread even the means of Safety; till such time as <hi>Manuel,</hi> one of the principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his Army, having jogg'd and shak'd him so as to rouze him out of his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53645:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Trance, said to him, <hi>Sir, if you will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, I will kill you: for it is better you should lose your Life, than, by being taken, to lose your Empire.</hi> But Fear does then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest its utmost Power and Effect, when it throws us upon a valiant Despair, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depriv'd us of all sense both of Duty and Honour. In the first pitch'd Battel the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> lost against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> under the Consul <hi>Sempronius,</hi> a Body of ten thousand Foot, that had taken a Fright, seeing no other Escape for their Cowardize, went, and threw themselves head-long upon the great Battalion of the Enemies, which also with wonderful force and fury they charg'd thorough and thorough, and routed with a very great slaughter of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by that means purchasing an ignominious flight at the same price they might have done a glorious Victory. The thing in the World I am most afraid of is <hi>Fear,</hi> and with good reason, that Passion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, in the trouble of it, exceeding all other Accidents. What Affliction could be greater or more just than that of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Followers and Friends, who, in his Ship, were Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that horrid and inhumane murther? Yet so it was, that the Fear of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Vessels they saw coming to board them, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd them with so great a Fear, that it is observ'd they thought of nothing, but calling upon the Mariners to make haste, and by force of Oars to escape away, till being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53645:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and deliver'd from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of further danger, they then had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to turn their thoughts to the loss of their Captain, and to give vent to those tears and lamentations that the other more prevalent Passion had till then suspended.</p>

Such as are in immediate Fear of losing their Estates, of Banishment, or of Slavery, live in perpetual Anguish, and lose all Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and Repose; whereas such as are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor, Slaves and Exiles, oft-times live as merrily as Men in a better Condition: and so many People, who, impatient of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Alarms of Fear, have hang'd and drown'd themselves, give us sufficiently to understand, that it is more importunate and insupportable than Death it self.

God Almighty has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd all things as it has best pleas'd him: But I have in my time seen three of the most execrable Persons that ever I knew in all manner of abominable living, and the most infamous to boot, who all dyed a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Death, and in all Circumstances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd even to Perfection.

his course, at the Place to which his Ambition pretended, with greater Glory, than he could himself either hope or desire, and anticipated by his Fall the Name and Power to which he aspir'd, by perfecting his Career.

                        <hi>CIcero</hi> says, <hi>That to study Philosophy is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to prepare a Man's self to dye.</hi> The reason of which is, because Study and Contemplation do in some sort withdraw from us, and deprive us of our Souls, and employ it separately from the Body, which is a kind of Learning to dye, and a resemblance of Death; or else because all the Wisdom and reasoning in the World, does in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in this Point, to teach us not to fear to dye. And to say the Truth, either our Reason does grosly abuse us, or it ought to have no other Aim but our Contentment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor to endeavour any thing but in Sum to make us live well, and, as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture says, at our Ease. All the Opinions of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53645:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the World agree in this, That Pleasure is our end, though we make use of divers means to attain unto it, they would otherwise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected at the first motion; for who would give Ear to him that should propose Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Misery for his end? The Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Disputes of the Philosophical Sects upon this Point are merely verbal, <hi>Transcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus solertissimas nugas,</hi>

                        </note> Let us skip over those learned and subtle Fooleries and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; there is more in them of Opposition and Obstinacy than is consistent with so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred a Profession: but what kind of Person soever Man takes upon him to personate, he over-mixes his own part with it; and let the Philosophers all say what they will, the main thing at which we all aim, even in Virtue it self, is Pleasure. It pleases me to rattle in their Ears this Word, which they so nauseate to hear; and if it signifie some supream Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and excessive Delight, it is more due to the Assistance of Vertue, than to any other Assistance whatever. This Delight, for being more gay, more sinewy, more robust, and more manly, is only to be more seriously vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, and we ought to give it the Name of Pleasure, as that which is more benign, gentle, and natural, and not that of Vigour, from which we have deriv'd it: the other more mean and sensual part of Pleasure, if it could deserve this fair Name, it ought to be upon the Account of Concurrence, and not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53645:62"/>
of Priviledge; I find it less exempt from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses and Inconveniences, than Vertue it self; and besides that, the Enjoyment is more momentary, fluid, and frail, it has its Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Fasts, and Labours, even to Sweat and Blood; and moreover, has particular to it self so many several sorts of sharp and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Passions, and so stupid a Saciety attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as are equal to the severest Penance. And we mistake to think that Difficulties should serve it for a Spur, and a seasoning to its Sweetness, as in Nature one Contrary is quickned by another, and to say when we come to Vertue, that like Consequences and Difficulties overwhelm and render it austere and inaccessible; whereas, much more aptly than in Voluptuousness, they enable, shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and heighten the perfect and divine Pleasure they procure us. He renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unworthy of it who will counterpoise his Expence with the Fruit, and does neither understand the Blessing, nor how to use it. Those who Preach to us, that the quest of it is craggy, difficult, and painful, but the Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition pleasant and grateful, what do they mean by that, but to tell us that it is always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing? The most perfect have been forc'd to content themselves to aspire unto it, and to approach it only without ever possessing it. But they are deceiv'd, and do not take notice, that of all the Pleasures we know, the very Pursuit is pleasant. The Attempt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53645:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ever relishes of the quality of the thing to which it is directed, for it is a good part of, and consubstantial with the Effect. The Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and Beatitude that glitters in Vertue, shines throughout all her Apartments and Avenues, even to the first Entry, and utmost Pale and Limits. Now of all the Benefits that Vertue confers upon us, the Contempt of Death is one of the greatest, as the means that accommodates Humane Life with a soft and easie Tranquillity, and gives us a pure and pleasant Taste of Living, without which all other pleasure would be extinct; which is the Reason why all the Rules by which we are to live center and concur in this one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And altho they all in like manner with one consent endeavour to teach us also to despise Grief, Poverty, and the other Accidents to which humane Life, by its own Nature and Constitution, is subjected, it is not neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less with the same Importunity, as well by reason the fore-named Accidents are not of so great necessity, the greater part of Mankind passing over their whole Lives without ever knowing what Poverty is, and some without Sorrow or Sickness; as <hi>Xenophilus</hi> the Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who liv'd a hundred and six Years in a perfect and continual Health; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, at the worst, Death can, whenever we please, cut short, and put an end to all these Inconveniences. But as to Death, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable.

'tis no wonder if he be often trap'd in the Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. They use to fright People with the very mention of Death, and many cross themselves, as it were the name of the Devil; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the making a mans Will is in reference to dying, not a man will be perswaded to take a Pen in hand to that purpose, till the Physician has pass'd sentence upon him, and totally given him over, and then betwixt Grief and Terror, God knows in how fit a condition of Understanding he is to do it. The <hi>Romans,</hi> by reason that this poor sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Death</hi> was observ'd to be so harsh to the Ears of the People, and the sound so ominous; had found out a way to soften and spin it out by a <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> and instead of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing bluntly, such a one is dead, to say, <hi>such a one has liv'd,</hi> or <hi>such a one has ceas'd to live</hi>; for, provided there was any mention of Life in the case, though past, it carried yet some sound of Consolation. And from them it is that we have borrow'd our expression of <hi>the late Monsieur such and such a one.</hi> Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as the Saying is) the term we have liv'd is worth our money.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's birth</note> I was born betwixt eleven and twelve a clock in the Forenoon the last of <hi>February</hi> 1533. according to our Computation, beginning the Year the first of <hi>January,</hi> and it is now but just fifteen dayes since I was compleat nine and thirty years old; I make account to live at least as many more. In the mean time, to trouble a mans self with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53645:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thought of a thing so far off, is a sensless Foolery. But what? Young and Old dye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the very same manner, and no one departs out of Life otherwise, than if he had but just before enter'd into it; neither is any so old and decrepid, who has heard of <hi>Methusalem,</hi> that does not think he has yet twenty years of Constitution good at least. Fool that thou art, who has assur'd unto thee the term of Life? Thou depend'st upon Physicians Tales and Stories, but rather consult Experience, and the fragility of Humane Nature: for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common course of things, 'tis long since that thou liv'dst by extraordinary Favour. Thou hast already out-liv'd the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary term of Life, and that it is so, reckon up thy Acquaintance, how many more have died before they arriv'd at thy Age, than have attain'd unto it, and of those who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled their Lives by their Renown, take but an Account, and I dare lay a Wager, thou wilt find more who have dyed before than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter five and thirty years of age. It is full both of Reason and Piety too, to take Example by the Humanity of Jesus Christ himself, who ended his Life at three and thirty years. The greatest man, that ever was no more than a man, <hi>Alexander,</hi> died also at the same Age. How many several ways has Death to surprize us?

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53645:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bring in an Example of my own Blood; A Brother of mine, Captain <hi>St. Martin,</hi> a young man, of three and twenty years old, who had already given sufficient testimony of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, playing a match at Tennis, receiv'd a blow of a Ball a little above his right Ear, which, though it was without any manner of sign of Wound, or depression of the Skull, and though he took no great notice of it, nor so much as sate down to repose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he nevertheless died within five or six hours after, of an Apoplexy occasion'd by that blow.

What matter is it, you will say, which way it comes to pass, provided a man does not terrifie himself with the expectation?

But 'tis folly to think of doing any thing that way. They go, they come, they gallop and dance, and not a word of Death. All this is very fine: but withall, when it comes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to themselves, their Wives, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Friends, surprizing them at unawares, and unprepar'd, then what torment, what out-cries, what madness and despair!

A man must therefore make more early tryal of it; and this bruitish neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, could it possibly lodge in the Brain of any man of Sense (which I think utterly impossible) sells us its merchandize too dear. Were it an Enemy that could be avoided, I would then advise to borrow Arms even of Cowardize it self to that effect: but seeing it is not, and that it will catch you as well flying, and playing the Poltron, as standing to't like a man of Honour.</p>

Let us disarm him of his Novelty and Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, let us converse, and be familiar with him, and have nothing so frequent in our thoughts as Death; Let us upon occasions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him in all his most dreadful shapes to our imagination; at the stumbling of a Horse, at the falling of a Tile, at the lest prick with a Pin, let us presently consider, and say to our selves, Well, and what if it had been Death it self? and thereupon let us encourage and fortifie our selves.

I find I have much more ado to digest this Resolution of dying when I am well in Health than when sick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of a Fever; and by how much I have less to do with the Commodities of Life, by reason I even begin to lose the use and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of them, by so much I look upon Death with less Terror and Amazement; which makes me hope, that the further I remove from the first, and the nearer I approach to the latter, I shall sooner strike a Bargain, and with less Unwillingness exchange the one for the other. And, as I have experimented in other Occurrences, that, as <hi>Caesar</hi> says, things often appear greater to us at distance than near at hand, I have found, that being well, I have had Diseases in much greater Horror than when really afflicted with them. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour wherein I now am, and the Jollity and Delight wherein I now live, make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Estate appear in so great a disproportion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53645:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to my present condition, that by imagination I magnifie, and make those inconveniences twice greater than they are, and apprehend them to be much more troublesome, than I find them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be, when they lie the most heavy upon me, and I hope to find Death the same. Let us but observe in the ordinary changes and Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons our Constitutions daily suffer, how Nature deprives us of all sight and sense of our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decay. What remains to an old man of the vigour of his Youth and better days?

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53645:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>

But also seeing we are threatned by so many sorts of Death, is it not infinitely worse eternally to fear them all, than once to undergo one of them? And
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53645:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what matter is it when it shall happen, since it is once inevitable? To him that told <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, the thirty Tyrants have sentenc'd thee to Death; and Nature them,</hi> said he. What a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing it is to trouble and afflict our selves, about taking the only Step that is to deliver us from all Misery and Trouble? As our Birth brought us the Birth of all things, so in our Death is the Death of all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. And therefore to lament and take on, that we shall not be alive a hundred Years hence, is the same Folly as to be sorry we were not alive a hundred Years ago. Death is the beginning of another Life. So did we weep, and so much it cost us to enter into this, and so did we put off our former Veil in entring into it. Nothing can be grievous that is but once, and is it reasonable so long to fear a thing that will so soon be dispatch'd? Long Life, and short, are by Death made all one; for there is no long, nor short, to things that are no more. <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, that there are certain little Beasts upon the Banks of the River <hi>Hypanis,</hi> that never live above a day: they which dye at eight of the Clock in the Morning, dye in their Youth, and those that dye at five in the Evening, in their extreamest Age: which of us would not laugh to see this Moment of Continuance put into the consideration of Weal or Woe?

Give place to others, as others have given place to you. Equality is the Soul of Equity. Who can complain of being comprehended in the same Destiny wherein all things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd? Besides, live as long as you can, you shall by that nothing shorten the space you are to lye dead in the Grave; 'tis all to no purpose; you shall be every whit as long in the condition you so much fear, as if you had died at Nurse.

to man than what I have already design'd him. If you had not Death to ease you of your Pains and Cares, you would eternally curse me for having depriv'd you of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Dying. I have, 'tis true, mix'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bitterness with it, to the end, that seeing of what Conveniency and Use it is, you might not too greedily and indiscreetly seek and embrace it: and that you might be so esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd in this Moderation, as neither to nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate Life, nor have an Antipathy for dying, which I have decreed you shall once do, I have temper'd the one and the other betwixt Pleasure and Pain: and was I that first taught <hi>Thales,</hi> the most eminent of all your <hi>Sages,</hi> that to Live and to Dye were indifferent; which made him very wisely answer who ask'd him, Why then he did not dye? because (says he) <hi>it is indifferent.</hi> The Elements of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, and the other Parts of this Creation of thine, are no more the Instruments of thy Life than they are of thy Death. Why dost thou fear thy last day, it contributes no more to thy dissolution than every one of the rest? The last Step is not the cause of Cassitude, it does but confess it. Every Day travels towards Death, the last only arrives at it. These are the good Lessons our Mother Nature teaches. I have often consider'd with my self whence it should proceed, that in War the Image of Death, whether we look upon it as to our own particular danger, or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53645:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that of another, should without Comparison appear less dreadful than at home in our own Houses, (for if it were not so, it would be an Army of whining Milk-sops) and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in all Places the same, there should be notwithstanding much more Assurance in Peasants, and the meaner sort of People, than others of better Quality and Education: and do verily believe, that it is those terrible Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Preparations wherewith we set it out, that more terrifie us than the thing it self; a new quite contrary way of living, the Cries of Mothers, Wives and Children, the Visits of astonish'd and afflicted Friends, the Attendance of pale and blubber'd Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, a dark Room set round with burning Tapers, our Beds environed with Physicians and Divines; in sum, nothing but Ghostliness and Horror round about us, render it so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, that a Man almost fancies himself dead and buried already. Children are afraid even of those they love best, and are best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, when disguised in a Vizor, and so are we; The Vizor must be removed as well from Things as Persons; which being taken away, we shall find nothing underneath but the very same Death that a mean Servant, or a poor Chamber-maid, died a day or two ago, without any manner of Apprehension or Concern. Happy therefore is the Death that deprives us of the leisure to prepare things requisite for this unnecessary Pomp, a Pomp

The very sight of anothers Pain does materially work upon me, and I naturally usurp the Sence of a third Person to share with him in his Torment. A perpetual Cough in another tickles my Lungs and Throat. I more unwillingly visit the sick I love, and am by Duty interested to look after, than those I care not for, and from whom I have no expectation.

St. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes mention of another, who, upon the hearing of any lamentable or doleful Cries, would presently fall into a Swoon, and be so far out of himself, that it was in vain to call, hollow in his Ears, pinch, or burn him, till he voluntarily came to himself; and then he would say, that he had heard Voices as it were a-far off, and did feel when they pinch'd and burn'd him: and to prove that this was no obstinate Dissimulation in defiance of his Sense of Feeling, it was manifest, that all the while he had neither Pulse nor Breathing, 'Tis very probable, that Visions, Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all extraordinary Effects of that Nature, derive their Credit principally from the Power of Imagination, working and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its chiefest Impression upon vulgar and more easie Souls, whose Belief is so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impos'd upon as to think they see what they do not: I am not satisfied, and make a very great Question, Whether those pleasant Ligatures with which this Age of ours is so fetter'd, that there is almost no other Talk, are not mere voluntary Impressions of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension

and fear; for I know by experience, in the Case of a particular Friend of mine, one for whom I can be as Responsible as for my self, and a Man that cannot possibly fall under any manner of Suspition of insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and as little of being enchanted, who having heard a Companion of his make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of an unusual Frigidity that surpriz'd him at a very unseasonable time; being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himself engag'd upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Horror of the former Story on a sudden so strangely possess'd his Imagination, that he ran the same Fortune the other had done; and from that time forward (the scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Remembrance of his Disaster running in his Mind, and tyrannizing over him) was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly subject to Relapse into the same Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. He found some Remedy, however, for this Inconvenience, by himself franckly confessing, and declaring before-hand to the Party with whom he was to have to do, the Subjection he lay under, and the Infirmity he was subject to, by which means the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul was in some sort appeas'd; and knowing that now some such Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was expected from him, the Restraint upon those Faculties grew less, and he less suffer'd by it, and afterwards, at such times as he could be in no such Apprehension, as not being about any such Act (his Thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then disengag'd and free, and his Body being in its true and natural Estate) by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53645:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those Parts to be handled and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Knowledge of others, he was at last totally freed from that vexatious Infirmity. After a Man has once done a Woman right, he is never after in danger of misbehaving himself with that Person, unless upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a manifest and excusable Weakness. Neither is this Disaster to be fear'd, but in Adventures where the Soul is over-extended with Desire or Respect, and especially where we meet with an unexpected Opportunity that requires a sudden and quick Dispatch; and in those Cases, there is no possible means for a Man always to defend himself from such a Surprize as shall put him damnably out of Countenance. And yet I have known some, who have secur'd themselves from this Mischance by coming half sated else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, purposely to abate the ardour of his Fury, and others, who by being grown old, find themselves less impotent by being less able; and particularly one, who found an Advantage by being assur'd by a Friend of his, that he had a Counter-charm against cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Enchantments that would defend him from this Disgrace. The Story it self is not much amiss, and therefore you shall have it. A Count of a very great Family, and with whom I had the Honour to be very familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate, being Married to a very fair Lady, who had formerly been pretended to, and importunately courted by one who
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53645:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was invited to, and present at the Wedding, all his Friends were in very great Fear, but especially an old Lady his Kinswoman, who had the ordering of the Solemnity, and in whose House it was kept, suspecting his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val would, in Revenge, offer foul Play, and procure some of these kind of Sorceries to put a Trick upon him; which Fear she also communicated to me, who, to comfort her, bad her not trouble her self, but relye upon my Care to prevent or frustrate any such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. Now I had, by chance, about me a certain flat Plate of Gold whereon were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven some Coelestial Figures, good to prevent Frenzy occasion'd by the Heat of the Sun, or for any Pains of the Head, being applied to the Suture; where, that it might the better remain firm, it was sowed to a Ribban to be tyed under the Chin. A Foppery Cousin-German to this of which I am speaking, and by <hi>Jaques Pelletier,</hi> who liv'd in my House, presented to me for a singular Rarity, and a thing of Sovereign Vertue. I had a fancy to make some use of this Knack, and therefore privately told the Count, that he might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly run the same Fortune other Bridegrooms had sometimes done; especially some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being in the House, who no doubt would be glad to do him such a Courtesie, but let him boldly go to Bed, for I would do him the Office of a Friend, and if need were, would not spare a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53645:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it was in my Power to do, provided he would engage to me, upon his Honour, to keep it to himself, and only when they came to bring him his Cawdle,<note place="margin">A Custom in <hi>France</hi> to bring the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom a Cawdle in the middle of the night, on his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding night.</note> if Matters had not gone well with him, to give me such a Sign, and leave the rest to me. Now he had his Ears so batter'd, and his Mind so prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd with the eternal Tattle of this Business, that when it came to't he did really find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tied with the Trouble of his Imagination, and accordingly at the time appointed gave me the Sign. Whereupon, I whisper'd him in the Ear, That he should rise under Pretence of putting us out of the Room, and after a jesting manner pull my Night-gown from my Shoulders, throw it over his own, and there keep it till he had perform'd what I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to do, which was, that when we were all gone out of the Chamber he should withdraw to make Water, should three times repeat such and such Words, and as often do such and such Actions: that at every of the three times he should tye the Ribban I put into his Hand about his Middle, and be sure to place the Medal was fastened to it (the Figures in such a Posture) exactly upon his Reins, which being done, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the last of the three times so well girt and fast tyed the Ribban that it could neither untye nor slip from its Place, let him confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently return to his Business, and withall not to forget to spread my Gown upon the Bed,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53645:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so that it might be sure to cover them both. These ridiculous Circumstances are the main of the Effect, our Fancy being so far seduc'd, as to believe, that so strange and uncouth Formalities must of necessity proceed from some abstruse Science. Their Inanity gives them Reverence and Weight. However, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that my Figures approv'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more <hi>Venerian</hi> than <hi>Solar,</hi> and the fair Bride had no reason to complain. Now I cannot forbear to tell you, it was a sudden Whimsey, mix'd with a little Curiosity, that made me do a thing so contrary to my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for I am an Enemy to all subtle, and counterfeit Actions, and abominate all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fraud, though it be but for Sport; for though the Action may not be wicked in it self, yet 'tis done after a wicked manner. <hi>Amasis,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> married <hi>Laodicea</hi> a marvellous beautiful <hi>Greek</hi> Virgin, who, tho famous for his Abilities elsewhere, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self quite another Man with his Wife, and could by no means enjoy her; at which he was so enrag'd, that he threatned to kill her, suspecting her to be a Witch. As 'tis usual in things that consist in Fancy; she put him upon Devotion, who having accordingly made his Vows to <hi>Venus,</hi> he found himself divinely restor'd the very first Night after his Oblations and Sacrifices. Now in plain truth, Women are to blame to entertain us with that disdainful, coy, and angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53645:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they commonly do, which extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes our Vigour, as it kindles our Desire; which made the Daughter in Law of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> to say, That <hi>the Woman who goes to Bed to a Man, must put off her Modesty with her Petticoat, and put it on again with the same.</hi> The Soul of the Assailant being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd with many several Alarms, is easily astonish'd, and soon loses the Power of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and whoever the Imagination has once put this Trick upon, and confounded with the Shame of it, (and she never does it but at the first Acquaintance, by reason Men are then more ardent and eager, and also at this first Account a Man gives of himself, he is much more timerous of miscarrying) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made an ill Beginning, he enters into such Indignation and Despite at the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as will in following Opportunities be apt to remain, and continue him in the same Condition. As to what concerns Married People, having the Year before them (as we say) they ought never to compell, or so much as to offer at the Feat, if they do not find themselves very ready: and it is better indecently to fail of handselling the Nuptial Sheets, and of paying the Ceremony due to the Wedding-night, when a Man perceives himself full of Agitation and Trembling, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting another opportunity at a better and more private Leisure, when his Fancy shall be better compos'd, than to make himself per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53645:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
miserable, for having misbehav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and been baffled at the first assault. Till possession be taken, a man that knows himself subject to this Infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees make several little tryals and light offers, without obstinately attempting at once to force an absolute conquest over his own mutinous and indispos'd Faculties; such as know their members to be naturally obedient to their desires, need to take no other care but only to counterplot their Fancy. The indocile and rude liberty of this scurvy Member, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently remarkable, by its importunate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, and unseasonable tumidity and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at such times as we have nothing for it to do, and by its more unseasonable stupidity and disobedience, when we stand most in need of his vigour, so imperiously contesting the authority of the Will, and with so much obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy denying all sollicitation both of hand and fancy. And yet though his Rebellion is so universally complain'd of, and that proofs are not wanting to condemn him, if he had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless feed me to plead his Cause, I should peradventure bring the rest of his fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into suspition of complotting this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief against him, out of pure envy at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and ravishing pleasure particular to his Employment, so as to have by Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy arm'd the whole World against him, by malevolently charging him alone with their common offence. For let any one consider,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53645:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether there is any one Part of our Bodies that does not often refuse to perform its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the Precept of the Will, and that does not often exercise its Function in defiance of her Command. They have every one of them proper Passions of their own, that rouze and awake, stupifie and benum them, without our Leave or Consent. How often do the involuntary motions of the Countenance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our inward Thoughts, and betray our most private Secrets to the Knowledge of the Standers by? The same Cause that animates this Member, does also, without our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, animate the Lungs, Pulse, and Heart, the sight of a pleasing Object imperceptibly diffusing a Flame thorough all our Parts with a febrifick motion. Is there nothing but these Veins and Muscles that swell, and flag without the Consent, not only of the Will, but even of our Knowledge also? We do not command our Hairs to stand an end, nor our Skin to shiver either with Fear or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. The Hands often convey themselves to Parts to which we do not direct them. The Tongue will be interdict, and the Voice sometimes suffocated when we know not how to help it. When we have nothing to eat, and would willingly forbid it, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of Eating and Drinking does not for all that forbear to stir up the Parts that are subjected to it, no more nor less than the other Appetite we were speaking of, and in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53645:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like manner does as unseasonably leave us. The Vessels that serve to discharge the Belly have their proper Dilatations and Compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without, and beyond our Intelligence, as well as those which are destin'd to purge the Reins. And that which to justifie the Prerogative of the Will, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> urges, of having seen a Man who could command his Backside to discharge as often together as he pleas'd, and that <hi>Vives</hi> does yet fortifie with another Example in his time of one that could Fart in Tune, does nothing suppose any more pure Obedience of that Part; for is any thing commonly more tumultuary or indiscreet? To which let me add, that I my self knew one so rude and ungovern'd, as for forty Years together made his Master-Vent with one continued and unintermitted Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane, and 'tis like will do till he expire that way, and vanish in his own Smoak. And I could heartily wish, that I only knew by Reading, how oft a Man's Belly, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of one single Puff, brings him to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry door of an exceeding painful Death; and that the Emperour, who gave Liberty to let fly in all Places, had at the same time given us Power to do it. But for our Will, in whose Behalf we prefer this Accusation, with how much greater Similitude of Truth may we reproach even her her self with Mutiny and Sedition for her Irregularity and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Does she always will what we would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53645:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have her to do? Does she not often will what we forbid her to will, and that to our manifest Prejudice? Does she suffer her self any more than any of the other, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd and directed by the Results of our Reason? To conclude, I should move in the Behalf of the Gentleman,<note place="margin">

But be it how it will, protesting against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Advocates and Judges, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will, in the mean time, proceed after her own way: who had done but well, if she had endow'd this Member with some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priviledge, The Author of the sole immortal Work of Mortals, A divine Work according to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and of Love, Desire of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and himself an immortal <hi>Daemon.</hi> Some one perhaps by such an Effect of Imagination may have had the good luck to leave <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53645:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
such cases require a mind prepar'd for the thing they are to do. Why do the Physicians tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with, and prepossess before-hand their Patients credulity with many false promises of Cure, if not to the end, that the effect of imagination may supply the imposture and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Aposeme? They know very well, that a great Master of their Trade has given it under his hand, that he has known some with whom the very sight of a potion would work: which Examples of Fancy and Conceit come now into my head, by the remembrance of a story was told me by a domestick Apothecary of my Father's, a blunt <hi>Swisse</hi> (a Nation not much addicted to vanity and lying) of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant he had long known at <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a valetudinary, &amp; much afflicted with Fits of the Stone, had often occasion to take Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, of which he caus'd several sorts to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd him by the Physicians, according to the accidents of his Disease: one of which being one time brought him, and none of the usual forms, as feeling if it were not too hot, and the like, being omitted, he was laid down on his Belly, the Syringe put up, and all Ceremonies perform'd, injection excepted; after which, the Apothecary being gone, &amp; the Patient accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated as if he had really receiv'd a Clyster, he found the same operation and effect that those do who have taken one indeed; and if at any time the Physician did not find the Operation sufficient, he would usually give
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53645:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him two or three more after the same manner. And the Fellow moreover swore to me, that to save charges (for he pay'd as if he had really taken them) this sick mans Wife, having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made tryal of warm Water only, the effect discover'd the Cheat, and finding these would do no good, was fain to return to the old way. A Woman fancying she had swallow'd a pin in a piece of Bread, cry'd out of an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable pain in her Throat, where she thought she felt it stick: but an ingenious Fellow that was brought to her, seeing no outward Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour nor alteration, supposing it to be only Conceit taken at some Crust of Bread that had hurt her as it went down, caus'd her to vomit, and cunningly, unseen, threw a crooked Pin into the Bason, which the Woman no sooner saw, but believing she had cast it up, she presently found her self eas'd of her pain. I my self knew a Gentleman, who having treated a great deal of good Company at his house, three or four dayes after brag'd in jest (for there was no such thing) that he had made them eat of a bak'd Cat; at which, a young Gentlewoman, who had been at the Feast, took such a horror, that falling into a violent vomiting and a Fever, there was no possible means to save her. Even brute Beasts are also subject to the force of Imagination as well as we; as is seen by Dogs, who dye of grief for the loss of their Masters, and are seen to quest, tremble, and start, as Horses
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53645:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will kick and whinney in their sleep. Now all this may be attributed to the affinity and relation betwixt the Souls and Bodies of Brutes, but 'tis quite another thing when the Imagination works upon the Souls of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, and not only to the prejudice of their own particular Bodies, but of others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. And as an infected Body communicates its Malady to those that approach, or live near it, as we see in the Plague, the small Pox, and sore Eyes, that run through whole Families and Cities;

So the Imagination being vehemently agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, darts out Infection capable of offending the stranger Object.

It is the same with Beasts, witness <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ring-streaked and spotted Goats, and Sheep, and the Hares and Partridges that the Snow turns white upon the Mountains. There was at my House a little while ago, a Cat seen watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bird upon the top of a Tree, who for some time mutually fixing their Eyes upon one another, the Bird at last let her self fall as dead into the Cats Claws, either dazled and astonish'd by the Force of her own Imagination, or drawn by some attractive Power of the Cat. Such as are addicted to the Pleasures of the Field, have, I make no question, heard the Story of the Faulconer, who having ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly fix'd his Eyes upon a Kite in the Ayr, lay'd a Wager, that he would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53645:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bring her down with the sole Power of Sight, and did so, as it was said; for the Tales I borrow, I charge upon the Consciences of those from whom I have them. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are my own, and found themselves upon the Proofs of Reason, not of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; to which every one has Liberty to add his own Examples: and who has none, (the Number and Varieties of Accidents consider'd) let him not forbear to believe that these I set down are enough: and if I do not apply them well, let some other do it for me. And also in the Subjects of which I treat, <hi>viz.</hi> of our Manners and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Testimonies and Instances I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, how fabulous soever, provided they are possible, serve as well as the true; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it has really happen'd or no, at <hi>Rome</hi> or at <hi>Paris,</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> 'tis still within the Verge of Possibility, and humane Capacity, which serves me to good use, and supplies me with Variety in the things I write. I see, and make my Advantage of it as well in Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as in Substance; and amongst the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examples I every where meet with in History, I cull out the most rare and memorable to fit my own Turn. There are some Authors whose only end and Design it is, to give an Account of things that have hapned; mine, if I could arrive unto it, should be to deliver what may come to pass. There is a just
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53645:88"/>
Liberty allow'd in the Schools, of supposing and contriving <hi>Simile</hi>'s, when they are at a Loss for them in their own Reading: I do not, however, make any use of that Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and as to that Affair in superstitious Religion surpass all Historical Authority. In the Examples which I here bring in, of what I have heard, read, done, or said, I have forbid my self to dare to alter even the most light and indifferent Circumstances: my Conscience does not falsifie one Tittle, what my Ignorance may do I cannot say. And this it is that makes me sometimes enter into Dispute with my own Thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, a Divine, or a Philosopher, Men of so exact and tender Wisdom and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are fit to write History: for, how can they stake their Reputation upon the Publick Faith? how be responsible for the Opinions of Men they do not know? and with what Assurance deliver their Conjectures for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Pay? Of Actions perform'd before their own Eyes, wherein several Persons were Actors, they would be unwilling to give Evidence upon Oath before a Judge; and cannot be so familiarly and thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any for whose Intentions they would become absolute Caution.

Trust. I am sollicited to write the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of my own Time, by some who fancy I look upon them with an Eye less blinded with Prejudice, or Partiality, than another, and have a clearer Insight into them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the free Access Fortune has given me to the Heads of both Factions: but they do not consider, that to purchase the Glory of <hi>Salust,</hi> I would not give my self the Trouble, being a sworn Enemy as I am to all Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Assiduity, and Perseverance: besides that, there is nothing so contrary to my Stile, as a continued and extended Narrative, I so often interrupt, and cut my self short in my Writing only for want of Breath. I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fancy, nor Expression worth any thing, and am ignorant beyond a Child, of the Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and even the very Words proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the most common things; and for that Reason it is, that I have undertaken to say only what I can say, and have accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Subject to my Force. Should I take one to be my Guide, peradventure I should not be able to keep Pace with him, and in the Precipitancy of my Career might deliver Things, which upon better Thoughts, in my own Judgment, and according to Reason, would be criminal, and punishable in the highest degree. <hi>Plutarch</hi> would tell us of what he has deliver'd to the Light, that it is the Work of others, that his Examples are all, and every where exactly true, that they

are useful to Posterity, and are presented with a Lustre that will light us the way to Vertue, which was his Design: but it is not of so dangerous consequence as in a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Drugg, whether an old Story be so or so.</p>

                     <p>HE seems to me to have had a right and true apprehension of the power of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, who first invented the Story of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-woman, who having accustom'd her self to play with, and carry a young Calf in her Arms, and daily continuing to do so as it grew up, obtain'd this by Custom, that when grown to be a great Ox she was still able to bear it. For, in truth, Custom is a violent and treacherous School-mistris. She, by little and little, slily, and unperceiv'd, slips in the foot of her Authority, but having by this gentle and humble beginning, with the benefit of Time, fix'd and establish'd it, she then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masks a furious and tyrannick Countenance, against which we have no more the courage or the power so much as to lift up our Eyes. We see it at every turn forcing and violating the Rules of Nature: <hi>Vsus efficacissimus rerum omnium magister</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 6.</note> Custom is the great Master of all things. I believe <hi>Plato</hi>'s care in his Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Physicians, who so often submit the Reasons of their Art to the authority of Habit; as also the story of that King, who by Custom brought his Stomach to that pass, as to live by Poison, and the Maid that <hi>Albertus</hi>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53645:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reports to have liv'd upon Spiders; and in that new World of the <hi>Indies,</hi> there were found great Nations, and in very differing Climates, who were of the same Diet, made provision of them, and fed them for their Tables; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, they did Grashoppers, Mice, Bats and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards; and in a time of scarcity of such Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, a Toad was sold for six Crowns, all which they cook, and dish up with several Sawces. There were also others found, to whom our Diet, and the Flesh we eat were venemous and mortal. <hi>Consuetudinis magna vis est: Pernoctant venatores in nive:</hi>

                        <hi>in mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus uri se patiuntur: Pugiles, Caestibus contusi, ne ingemiscunt quidem.</hi> The power of Custom is very great: Hunts-men will one while lye out all night in the Snow, and another suffer themselves to be parch'd in the Mountains; and Fencers, inur'd to beating, when bang'd almost to pulp with Clubs and Whirde-Bats, disdain so much as to groan. These are strange Examples, but yet they will not appear so strange if we consider what we have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry experience of, how much Custom stupifies our Senses; neither need we go to be satisfied of what is reported of the Cataracts of <hi>Nile</hi>; and of what Philosophers believe of the Musick of the Spheres, that the Bodies of those Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being solid and smooth, and coming to touch, and rub upon one another, cannot fail of creating a wonderful Harmony, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and cadencies of which, cause the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53645:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Dances of the Stars: but that the hearing Sense of all Creatures here below, being universally, like that of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> deaf'd, and stupified with the continual Noise, cannot, how great soever perceive it. Smiths, Millers, Pewterers, Forge-men, and Armorers, could never be able to live in the perpetual Noise of their own Trades, did it strike their Ears with the same Violence that it does ours. My perfum'd Doublet gratifies my own Smelling at first, as well as that of others; but after I have worn it three or four Days together, I no more perceive it; but it is yet more strange, that Custom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the long Intermissions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, should yet have the Power to unite and establish the Effect of its Impressions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Senses, as is manifest in such as live near unto Steeples, and the frequent noise of the Bells. I my self lye at home in a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where every Morning and Evening a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Bell rings out the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> the Noise of which shakes my very Tower, and at first seem'd insupportable to me; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now a good while kept that Lodging, I am so us'd to't, that I hear it without any manner of Offence, and often without awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at it. <hi>Plato</hi> reprehending a Boy for playing at some childish Game, Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'st me (says the Boy) for a very little thing: <hi>Custom</hi> (reply'd <hi>Plato) is no little Thing.</hi> And he was in the right; for I find
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53645:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that our greatest Vices derive their first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity from our most tender Infancy, and that our principal Education depends upon the Nurse. Mothers are mightily pleas'd to see a Child writhe off the Neck of a Chicken, or to please it self with hurting a Dog or a Cat; and such wise Fathers there are in the World, who look upon it as a notable Mark of a Martial Spirit, when he hears his Son mis-call, or sees him domineer over a poor Peasant, or a Lacquey, that dares not reply, nor turn again; and a great sign of Wit when he sees him cheat and over-reach his Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow by some malicious Trick of Treachery and Deceit; but for all that, these are the true Seeds and Roots of Cruelty, Tyranny, and Treason. They bud and put out there,<note place="margin">Deceit ought to be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greenest Years.</note> and afterwards shoot up vigorously, and grow to a prodigious Bulk and Stature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cultivated and improv'd by Custom: and it is a very dangerous Mistake to excuse these vile Inclinations upon the Tenderness of their Age, and the triviality of the Subject: first, it is Nature that speaks, whose Declaration is then more sincere, and inward Thoughts more undisguised, as it is more weak and young: secondly, the Deformity of Cousen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age does not consist, nor depend upon the Difference betwixt Crowns and Pins; but merely upon it self, for a Cheat is a Cheat be it more or less; which makes me think it more just to conclude thus, Why should he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53645:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not cozen in Crowns since he does it in Pins, than as they do, who say, they only play for Pins, he would not do it if it were for Money. Children should carefully be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to abhor even the Vices of their own contriving; and the natural Deformity of those Vices ought so to be represented to them, that they may not only avoid them in their Actions, but especially so to abominate them in their Hearts, that the very Thought should be hateful to them, with what Mask soever they may be palliated or disguis'd. I know very well, for what concerns my self, that for having been brought up in my Childhood to a plain, and sincere way of dealing, and for having then had an Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all manner of jugling and foul Play in my Childish Sports and Recreations (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is to be noted, that the Plays of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not perform'd in Play, but are to be judg'd in them as their most serious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) there is no Game so small wherein from my own Bosome naturally, and without stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or endeavour, I have not an extream Aversion for Deceit. I shuffle, and cut, and make as much clatter with the Cards, and keep as strict Account for Farthings, as it were for double Pistols, when winning or losing against my Wife and Daughter is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to me, as when I play in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest with others for the roundest Sums. At all Times, and in all Places, my own Eyes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53645:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are sufficient to look to my Fingers; I am not so narrowly watch'd by any other, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any I more fear to be discover'd by, or to offend.</p>
                     <p>I saw the other day, at my own House, a little Fellow who came to shew himself for Money, a Native of <hi>Nants,</hi> born without Arms, who has so well taught his Feet to perform the Services his Hands should have done him, that indeed they have half forgot their natural Office, and the use for which they were design'd; the Fellow too calls them his Hands, and we may allow him so to do, for with them he cuts any thing, charges and discharges a Pistol, threds a Needle, Sows, Writes, and puts off his Hat, combs his Head, plays at Cards and Dice, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll this with as much Dexterity as any other could do who had more, and more proper Limbs to assist him; and the Money I gave him he carried away in his Foot, as we do in our Hand. I have seen another, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet a Boy, flourish'd a two-handed Sword, and (if I may so say) handled a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert vvith the mere Motions and Writhing of his Neck and Shoulders for vvant of hands, tost them into the Air, and catch'd them again, darted a Dagger, and crack'd a Whip as vvell as any Coach-man in <hi>France.</hi> But the Effects of Custom are much more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the strange Impressions she imprints in our Minds, vvhere she meets vvith less Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,

and has nothing so hard a Game to play. What has she not the Power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon our Judgments and Belief? Is there any so fantastick Opinion (omitting the gross Impostures of Religions, with which we see so many populous Nations, and so many understanding men, so strangely besotted; for this being beyond the reach of Humane Reason, any Error is more excusable in such as thorough the Divine Bounty are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an extraordinary Illumination from above) but of other Opinions are there any so senseless and extravagant, that she has not planted and establish'd for Laws in those Parts of the World upon which she has been pleased to exercise her Power? And therefore that ancient Exclamation was exceeding just,<note place="margin">

I do believe, that no so absurd or ridiculous Fancy can enter into Humane Imagination, that does not meet with some Example of Publick Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and that consequently our Reason does not ground, and support it self upon. There are People, amongst whom it is the Fashion to turn their Backs upon him they salute, and never look upon the Man they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53645:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intend to honour. There is a place, where, whenever the King spits, the greatest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his Court put out their hands to receive it; and another Nation, where the most eminent Persons about him stoop to take up his Ordure in a Linnen-cloth. Let us here steal room to insert a Story. A <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, of my acquaintance, was alwayes wont to blow his Nose with his Fingers, (a thing very much against our Fashion) would justifie himself for so doing, and was a man very famous for pleasant Repertees, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occasion, ask'd me, what Priviledge this filthy Excrement had, that we must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about us a fine Handkerchief to receive it, and which was more, afterwards to lap it carefully up, and carry it all day about in our Pockets, which, he said, could not but be much more nauseous and offensive, than to see it thrown away, as we did all other Evacuations. I found that what he said was not altogether without Reason, and by being frequently in his Company, that slovenly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his was at last grown familiar to me; which nevertheless we make a face at, when we hear it reported of another Country. Miracles appear to be so, according to our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Nature, and not according to the Essence of Nature. The continually being accustom'd to any thing, blinds the eye of our Judgment. <hi>Barbarians</hi> are no more a wonder to us, than we are to them; nor with any more
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53645:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reason, as every one would confess, if after having travell'd over those remote Examples, Men could settle themselves to reflect upon, and rightly to confer them. Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is a Tincture equally infus'd almost into all our Opinions and Customs, of what form soever they are, infinite in Matter, infinite in Diversity. But I return to my Subject.</p>
                     <p>There are a People, where (his Wife and Children excepted) no one speaks to the King but through a Trunk. In one and the same Nation the Virgins discover those Parts that Modesty should perswade them to hide, and the married Women carefully cover and conceal. To which, this Custom in another Place has some Relation, where Chastity, but in Marriage, is of no Esteem, for unmarried Women may prostitute themselves to as many as they please, and being got with Child, may lawfully take Physick in the sight of every one to destroy their Fruit. And in another Place, if a Tradesman marry, all of the same Condition, who are invited to the Wedding, lye with the Bride before him; and the greater number of them there is, the greater is her Honour, and the Opinion of her Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Strength: if an Officer marry, 'tis the same, the same with a Nobleman, and so of the rest, excepting it be a Labourer, or one of mean Condition, for then it belongs to the Lord of the Place to perform that Office; and yet a severe Loyalty during Marriage is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53645:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afterward strictly enjoyn'd. There is a place where Bawdy-houses of Young-men are kept for the Pleasure of Women, as we know there are of Women for the Necessities of Men; and also Marriages, where the Wives go to War as well as the Husbands, and not only share in the dangers of Battel, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over in the Honours of Command. Others, where they wear Rings not only through their Noses, Lips, Cheeks, and on their Toes, but also weighty Gymmals of Gold thrust through their Paps and Buttocks: Where, in eating, they wipe their Fingers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Thighs, Genitories, and the Soles of their Feet: Where Children are excluded and Brothers and Nephews only inherit; and elsewhere, Nephews only, saving in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, and the Succession of the Crown: where, for the Regulation of Community in Goods and Estates observ'd in the Country, certain Sovereign Magistrates have committed to them the universal Charge, and over-seeing of the Agriculture, and Distribution of the Fruits according to the Necessity of every one: Where they lament the Death of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Feast at the Decease of old Men: Where they lye ten or twelve in a Bed, Men and their Wives together: Where Women, whose Husbands come to violent Ends, may marry again, and others not: Where the servile Condition of Women is look'd upon with such Contempt, that they kill all the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53645:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
native Females, and buy Wives of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to supply their Use; Where Husbands may repudiate their Wives, without shewing any Cause, but Wives cannot part from their Husbands, for what cause soever. Where Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands may sell their Wives in case of sterility; Where they boyl the Bodies of their dead, and afterwards pound them to a pulp, which they mix with their Wine, and drink it; Where the most coveted Sepulture is to be eaten with Dogs, and elsewhere by Birds; Where they believe the Souls of the happy live in all manner of Liberty, in delightful Fields, furnish'd with all sorts of Delicacies, and that it is those Souls, repeating the words we utter, which we call <hi>Eccho.</hi> Where they fight in the Water, and shoot their Arrows with the most mortal Aim, swimming; Where, for a sign of Subjection, they lift up their Shoulders, and hang down their Heads, and put off their shooes when they enter the King's Palace. Where the Eunuchs, who take charge of the Religious Women, have moreover their Lips and Noses cut away, and disguis'd, that they may not be lov'd; and the Priests put out their own Eyes, to be better acquainted, with their <hi>Daemons,</hi> and the better to receive and retain their Oracles; Where every one creates to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Deity of what he likes best, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Fancy; the Hunter, a Lyon or a Fox, the Fisher, some certain
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53645:95"/>
Fish, and Idols of every Humane Action or Passion; in which place the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are the principal Deities, and the form of taking an Oath is, to touch the Earth, looking up to Heaven; and there both Flesh and Fish is eaten raw; Where the greatest Oath they take is, to swear by the Name of some dead Person of Reputation, laying their hand upon his Tomb; Where the New-years Gift the King sends every Year to the Princes, his Subjects, is Fire, which being brought, all the old Fire is put out, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People are bound to fetch of the new, every one for themselves, upon pain of Treason; Where, when the King, to betake himself wholly to Devotion, retires from his Administration, (which often falls out) his next Successor is oblig'd to do the same; by which means the Right of the Kingdom devolves to the third in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; Where they vary the Form of Government, according to the seeming ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Affairs; Depose the King when they think good, substituting ancient men to govern in his stead, and sometimes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it into the hands of the Common-People; Where Men and Women are both Circumciz'd and also Baptiz'd; Where the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, who in one, or several Engagements, has been so fortunate, as to present seven of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53645:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Enemies Heads to the King, is made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: where they live in that rare and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinion of the Mortality of the Soul: Where the Women are deliver'd without Pain or Fear: Where the Women wear Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fetters upon both their Legs, and if a Louse bite them, are bound in Magnanimity to bite them again, and dare not marry till first they have made their King a Tender of their Virginity, if he please to accept it: Where the ordinary way of Salutation is by putting a Finger down to the Earth, and then pointing it up towards Heaven: Where Men carry Burthens upon their Heads, and Women on their Shoulders, the Women pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing standing, and the Men cowring down: Where they send their Blood in token of Friendship, and unsee the men they would nour, like Gods: Where not only to the fourth, but in any other remote Degree, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are not permitted to marry: Where the Children are four Years at Nurse, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twelve; in which Place also it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted mortal to give the Child suck the first day after it is born: Where the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the male Children is peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to the Fathers, and to the Mothers of the Females; the Punishment being to hang them by the Heels in the Smoak: Where they eat all sorts of Herbs, without other Scruple, than of the Illness of the Smell: Where all things are open, the finest Houses, and that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53645:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are furnish'd with the richest Furniture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors, Windows, Trunks, or Chests to lock, a Thief being there punish'd double to what they are in other Places: Where they crack Lice with their Teeth like Monkeys, and abhor to see them kill'd with ones Nails: Where in all their Lives they neither cut their Hair, nor pare their Nails; and in another Place, pare those of the Right-hand only, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the left grow for Ornament and Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Where they suffer the Hair on the right side to grow as long as it will, and shave the other; and in the neighb'ring Provinces, some let their Hair grow long before, and some behind, shaving close the rest: Where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents let out their Children, and Husbands their Wives, to their Guests to hire: Where a Man may get his own Mother with Child, and Fathers make use of their own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or their Sons, without Scandal or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: Where at their solemn Feasts they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably lend their Children to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any consideration of Nearness of Blood. In one Place Men feed upon Humane Flesh, in another, 'tis reputed a charitable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a Man to kill his Father at a certain Age; and elsewhere, the Fathers dispose of their Children whilst yet in their Mothers Wombs, some to be preserv'd and carefully brought up, and others they proscribe either to be thrown off, or made away. Elsewhere the old Husbands lend their Wives to Young-men;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53645:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in another place they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, without offence; in one place particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the Women take it for a mark of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have as many gay fring'd Tassels at the bottom of their Garment, as they have lain with several men. Moreover, has not Custome made a Republick of Women se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately by themselves? Has it not put Arms into their Hands, made them to raise Armies, and fight Battels? and does she not by her own Precept instruct the most ignorant Vulgar, and make them perfect in things which all the Philosophy in the World could never beat into the Heads of the wisest men? For we know entire Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where Death was not only despis'd, but entertain'd with the greatest Triumph; where Children of seven years old offer'd themselves to be whip'd to death, without changing their Countenance; where Riches was in such Contempt, that the poorest and most wretched Citizen would not have deign'd to stoop to take up a Purse of Crowns. And we know Regions very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all manner of Provisions, where, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the most ordinary Diet, and that they are most pleas'd with, is only Bread, Cresses, and Water. Did not Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom moreover work that Miracle in <hi>Chios,</hi> that of seven hundred Years it was never known, that ever Maid or Wife committed any act to the prejudice of her Honour?

To conclude; there is nothing in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that she does not, or may not do; and therefore with very good reason it is, that <hi>Pindar</hi> calls her the Queen, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of the World. He that was seen to beat his Father, and reprov'd for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made answer, that it was the Custom of their Family; that in like manner his Father had beaten his Grand-father, his Grand-father his great Grand-father, and this, sayes he, pointing to his Son, when he comes to my Age, shall beat me. And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom the Son dragg'd and hal'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the streets, commanded him to stop at a certain Door, for he himself, he said, had dragg'd his Father no farther, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmost limit of the hereditary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence the Sons us'd to practice upon the Fathers in their Family. It is as much by Custom as Infirmity, (sayes <hi>Aristotle</hi>) that Women tear their Hair, bite their Nails, and eat Coals, Chalk, and such Trash, and more by Custom than Nature, that men abuse themselves with one another. The Laws of Conscience, which we pretend to be deriv'd from Nature, proceed from Custome; every one having an inward Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for the Opinions and Manners, approv'd and receiv'd amongst his own People, cannot without very great Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy depart from them, nor apply himself
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53645:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them without applause. In times past, when those of <hi>Creet</hi> would curse any one, they pray'd the Gods to engage them in some ill Custom. But the principal effect of the power of Custom is, so to seize and ensnare us, that it is hardly in our power to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our selves from its gripe; or so to come to our selves, as to consider of, and to weigh the things it enjoyns. To say the truth, by reason that we suck it in with our Milk, and that the face of the World pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it self in this posture to our first sight, it seems as if we were born upon condition to pursue this Practice; and the common Fancies that we find in repute every where about us, and infus'd into our Minds with the Seed of our Fathers, appear to be most universal and genuine. From whence it comes to pass, that whatever is off the hinge of Custom, is believ'd to be also off the hinges of Reason; and how unreasonably for the most part, God knows. If, as we who study our selves, have learn'd to do, every one who hears a good Sentence, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately consider how it does any way touch his own private Concern, every one would find, that it was not so much a good Saying, as a severe Lash to the ordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiality of his own Judgment: but men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Precepts and Admonitions of Truth, as generally directed to the Common Sort, and never particularly to themselves;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53645:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and instead of applying them to their own manners, do only very ignorantly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably commit them to memory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffering themselves to be at all instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or converted by them; But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Empire of Custom. Such Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as have been bred up to Liberty, and subject to no other Dominion but the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own Will, every one being a Sovereign to himself,<note place="margin">Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> or at least govern'd by no wiser Heads than their own, do look upon all other Form of Government as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, and contrary to Nature.<note place="margin">Monarchy.</note> Those who are inur'd to Monarchy do the same; and what opportunity soever Fortune presents them with to change, even then, when with the greatest difficulties they have disengag'd themselves from one Master, that was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and grievous to them, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently run, with the same difficulties, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate another; being not able, how roughly dealt with soever, to hate the Government they were born under, and the obedience they have so long been accustom'd to. 'Tis by the mediation and perswasion of Custom, that every one is content with the place where he is planted by Nature; and the <hi>High-landers</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> no more pant after the better Air of <hi>Tourain,</hi> than the starv'd <hi>Scythian</hi> after the delightful Fields of <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly. Darius</hi> asking certain <hi>Greeks</hi> what they would take to assume the Custom of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>

of eating the dead Corps of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (for that was their Use, believing they could not give them a better, nor more noble Sepulture, than to bury them in their own Bodies) they made answer, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World should hire them to do it; but having also tryed to persuade the <hi>Indians</hi> to leave their barbarous Custom, and, after the <hi>Greek</hi> manner, to burn the Bodies of their Fathers, they conceiv'd a much greater horrour at the motion. Every one does the same, for as much as Use veils from us the true Aspect of things.</p>

For Example, I shall ask him, what can be more strange than to see a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple oblig'd to obey and pay a Reverence to Laws they never understood, and to be bound in all their Affairs, both of private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Concern, as Marriages, Donations, Wills, Sales, and Purchases, to Rules they cannot possibly know, being neither writ nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd in their own Language, and of which they are of Necessity to purchase both the Interpretation and the Use? Not according to the ingenious Opinion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who counsell'd his King to make the Trafficks and Negotiations of his Subjects, free, frank, and of Profit to them, and their Quarrels and Debates burdensome, and tart, and loaden with heavy Impositions and Penalties; but by a prodigious Opinion to make sale of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it self, and to allow the Law a course of Traffick. I think my self oblig'd to Fortune that (as our Historians report) it was a <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> Gentleman, a Country-man of mine, who first oppos'd <hi>Charlemain,</hi> when he attempted to impose upon us Latine and Imperial Laws.

see a Nation, where, by lawful Custom, the Office of a Judge is to bought and sold, where Judgments are paid for with ready Money, and where Justice may legally be denied to him that has not wherewithall to pay; a Merchandize in so great Repute, as in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to serve a fourth Estate of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lawyers, to add to the three ancient ones of the Church, Nobility, and People; which fourth Estate, having the Laws in their hands, and sovereign Power over Mens Lives and Fortunes, make another separate Body of Nobility: from whence it comes to pass, that there are double Laws, those of Honour, and those of Justice, in many things positively opposite to one another, the Nobles as rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously condemning a <hi>Lye</hi> taken, as the other do a <hi>Lye</hi> reveng'd: By the Law of Arms, he shall be degraded from all Nobility and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who puts up an Affront; and by the Civil Law, he who vindicates his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Revenge incurs a Capital Punishment: who applies himself to the Law for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Offence done to his Honour, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces himself; and who does not, is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd and punish'd by the Law.

'Tis a Number (if it make any number) that would be able to procure us very little Disturbance: but what becomes of all the rest, under what Ensigns do they march, in what Quarter do they lye? Theirs have the same Effect with other weak and ill apply'd Medicines, they have only set the Humours they would Purge, more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently in working, stirr'd and exasperated them by the Conflict, and left them still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. The Aposeme was too weak to Purge, but strong enough to weaken us; so that it does not work, but we keep it still in our Bodies, and reap nothing from the Operation but intestine Gripes and Dolours; so it is nevertheless, that Fortune still reserving her Authority in Defiance of whatever we are able to do or say, does sometimes present us with a Necessity so urgent, that 'tis requisite the Laws should a little yield, and give way; and when one opposes the Encrease of an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <hi>JAques Amiot,</hi> great Almoner of <hi>France,</hi> one day related to me this Story, much to the Honour of a Prince of ours (and ours he is upon several very good Accounts, though originally of Foreign Extraction) that in the time of our first Commotions at the Siege of <hi>RoÃ¼en,</hi> this Prince, having been advertis'd by the Queen-Mother of a Conspiracy against his Life, and in her Letters particular notice being given him of the Person who was to execute the Business, (who was a Gentleman of <hi>Anjou,</hi> or else of <hi>Mayne,</hi> and who to this Effect did frequently haunt this Prince's House) discover'd not a Syllable of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to any one whatever, but going the next day to St. <hi>Katherines</hi> Mount, from whence our Battery play'd against the Town (for it was during the Time of a Siege) and having in Company with him the said Lord Almoner, and another Bishop, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53645:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aware of this Gentleman, who had been denoted to him, and presently caus'd him to be call'd to his Presence; to whom, being come before him, seeing him pale, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with the Conscience of his Guilt, he thus said, <hi>Monsieur</hi> such a one, <hi>You already guess what I have to say to you, your Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance discovers it, and therefore 'tis in vain to disguise your Practice; for I am so well inform'd of your Business, that it will but make worse for you, to go about to conceal or to deny it: you know very well such and such Passages,</hi> (which were the most secret Circumstances of his Conspiracy) <hi>and therefore be sure, as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your own Life, to confess to me the whole Truth of your Design.</hi> The poor Man seeing himself thus trap'd, and convinc'd (for the whole Business had been discover'd to the Queen by one of the Complices) was in such a Taking, he knew not what to do; but joyning his Hands to beg and sue for Mercy, he meant to throw himself at this Prince's Feet, who taking him up, proceeded to say, <hi>Come on Sir, and tell me, have I at any time heretofore done you any Injury? or have I, through my particular Hatred or private Malice, offended any Kinsman or Friend of yours? It is not above three Weeks that I have known you; What Inducement then could move you to attempt my Death?</hi> To which the Gentleman, with a trembling Voice, reply'd, <hi>That it was no particular Grudge he had to his Person, but
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53645:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the general Interest and Concern of his Party, and that he had been put upon it by some who had perswaded him it would be a meritorious Act, by any means to extirpate so great and so powerful an Enemy of their Religion. Well,</hi> said the Prince, <hi>I will now let you see, how much more charitable the Religion is that I maintain, than that which you profess; Yours has perswaded you to kill me, without hearing me speak, and without ever having given you any cause of Offence; and mine commands me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you, convict as you are, by your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, of a Design to murther me without Reason. Get you gone, that I see you no more; and if you are wise, choose henceforward honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Men for your Counsellors in your Designs.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> being in <hi>Gaule,</hi> had certain information of a Conspiracy <hi>L. Cinna</hi> was contriving against him, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resolv'd to make him an Example; and to that end sent to summon his Friends to meet the next morning in Counsel; but the night between he past over with great unquietness of Mind, considering that he was to put to death a young man, of an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Family, and Nephew to the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> which made him break out into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ejaculations of Passion: What then, said he, Shall it be said, that I shall live in perpetual Anxiety, and continual Alarm, and suffer my Assassinates in the mean time to walk abroad at Liberty? Shall he go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

after having conspir'd against my Life, a Life that I have hitherto defended in so many Civil Wars, and so many Battels both by Land and Sea? And after having setled the Universal Peace of the whole World, shall this man be pardoned, who has conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only to Murther, but to Sacrifice me? For the Conspiracy was to kill him at Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. After which, remaining for some time silent, he re-begun louder, and straining his Voice more than before to exclaim against himself, and say, Why liv'st thou? If it be for the good of many that thou should'st Dye? must there be no end of thy Revenges and Cruelties? Is thy Life of so great value, that so many Mischiefs must be done to preserve it? His Wife <hi>Livia,</hi> seeing him in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; Will you take a Woman's Counsel, said she? Do as the Physicians do, who, when the ordinary <hi>Recipe</hi>'s will do no good, make Tryal of the contrary. By severity you have hitherto prevail'd nothing; <hi>Lepidus</hi> has follow'd <hi>Savidienus, Murena Lepidus, Caepio Murena,</hi> and <hi>Egnatius Caepio.</hi> Begin now, and try how Sweetness and Clemency will succeed. <hi>Cinna</hi> is convict, forgive him, he will never henceforth have the Heart to hurt thee, and it will be an Act of Glory. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> was glad that he had met with an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of his own Humour; wherefore, having thank'd his Wife, and in the Morning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded his Friends he had before sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53645:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Council, he commanded <hi>Cinna</hi> all alone to be brought to him; who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly come, and a Chair by his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment set him, having commanded every one out of the Room, he spake to him after this manner: In the first place, <hi>Cinna,</hi> I demand of thee patient Audience; do not interrupt me in what I am about to say, and I will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards give thee Time and Leisure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Thou know'st, <hi>Cinna,</hi> that having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee Prisoner in the Enemies Camp, and that an Enemy not only made, but born so, I gave thee thy Life, restor'd thee all thy Goods, and finally put thee in so good a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, by my Bounty, of living well, and at thy ease, that the Victorious envy'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd. The Sacerdotal Office which thou mad'st Suit to me for, I conferr'd upon thee, after having deny'd it to others, whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ever borne Arms in my Service: and after so many Obligations thou hast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to kill me. At which <hi>Cinna</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, that he was very far from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any so wicked a Thought; Thou dost not keep thy Promise, <hi>Cinna,</hi> (continued <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>) that thou would'st not interrupt me. Yes, thou hast undertaken to murther me in such a Place, such a Day, in such and such Company, and in such a Manner. At which Words seeing <hi>Cinna</hi> astonish'd and silent, not upon the Account of his Promise so to be, but interdict with the Conscience of his
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53645:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Crime; Why, proceeded <hi>Augustus,</hi> to what end would'st thou do it? Is it to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Believe me, the Republick is in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill Condition, if I am the only Man betwixt thee and the Empire. Thou art not able so much as to defend thy own House, and but t'other day wast baffled in a Suit, by the oppos'd Interest of a mean manumitted Slave. What, hast thou neither Means nor Power in any other thing, but only to attempt against <hi>Caesar?</hi> I quit claim to the Empire, if there is no other but I to obstruct thy Hopes. Can'st thou believe, that <hi>Paulus,</hi> that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> that the <hi>Cassians</hi> and <hi>Servilians,</hi> and so many Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> not only so in Title, but who by their Virtue honour their Nobility, would suffer or endure thee? After this, and a great deal more that he said to him, (for he was two long Hours in speaking) Well, <hi>Cinna,</hi> go thy way, said he, I again give thee that Life in the Quality of a Traytor and a Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, which I once before gave thee in the Quality of an Enemy. Let Friendship from this time forward begin betwixt us, and let us try to make it appear whether I have given, or thou hast receiv'd thy Life with the better Faith; and so departed from him. Some time after, he preferr'd him to the Consular Dignity, complaining, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53645:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had not the Confidence to demand it; had him ever after for his very great Friend, and was at last made by him sole Heir to all his Estate. Now from the time of this Accident, which befell <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> in the fortieth Year of his Age, he never had any Conspiracy or Attempt against him, and therein reap'd the due Reward of this his so generous and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Clemency. But it did not so well succeed with our Prince in the former Story, his Moderation and Mercy not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient so to secure him, that he did not afterwards fall into the Toils of the like Treason, so vain and frivolous a thing is Humane Prudence; and in spite of all our Projects, Counsels, and Praecau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Fortune will still be Mistress of Events. We repute Physicians fortunate when they hit upon a lucky Cure, as if there was no other Art but theirs that could not stand upon its own Legs, and whose Foundations are too weak to support it self upon its own Basis; and as if no other Art stood in need of Fortunes Hand to assist in its Operations. For my part, I think of Physick as much good or ill as any one would have me: for, Thanks be to God, we have no great Traffick together. I am of a quite contrary Humour to other men, for I always despise it; but when I am sick, instead of recanting, or entring into Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53645:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with it, I begin yet more to hate, nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate, and fear it, telling them who impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune me to enter into a course of Physick, that they must give me time to recover my Strength and Health, that I may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to support and encounter the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and danger of the Potion: so that I still let Nature work, supposing her to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently arm'd with Teeth and Claws to defend her self from the Assaults of Infirmity, and to uphold that Contexture, the Dissolution of which she flies and abhors: for I am afraid, lest instead of assisting her when grappled, and strugling with the Disease, I should assist her Adversary, and procure new Work, and new Accidents to encounter. Now I say, that not in Physick only, but in other more certain Arts, Fortune has a very great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and share. The Poetick Raptures, and those prodigious flights of Fancy, that ravish and transport the Author out of himself, why should we not attribute them to his good Fortune, since the Poet himself confesses they exceed his Sufficiency and Force, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges them to proceed from something else than himself, and has them no more in his Power than the Orators say they have those extraordinary Motions and Agitations that sometimes push them beyond their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. It is the same in Painting, where Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es shall sometimes slip from the hand of the Painter, so surpassing both his Fancy and his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53645:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Art, as to beget his own Admiration. But Fortune does yet more accidently manifest the share she has in all things of this kind, by the Graces and Elegancies are found out in them, not only beyond the Intention, but even without the Knowledge of the Artist. A judicious Reader does often find out in other Mens Writings, other kind of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and finds in them a better Sence and more quaint Expression than the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self either intended or perceiv'd. And, as to military Enterprizes and Executions, every one sees how great a hand Fortune has in all those Affairs; even in our very Counsels and Deliberations there must certainly be something of Chance and good Luck mix'd with Humane Prudence, for all that our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can do alone is no great matter; the more piercing, quick, and apprehensive it is, the weaker it finds it self, and is by so much more apt to mistrust its own Vertue. I am of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Opinion, and when I most strictly and nearer hand examine the most glorious Exploits of War, I perceive, methinks, that those who carry them on, make use of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Debate only for Customs sake, and leave the best part of the Enterprize to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and relying upon her Favour and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, transgress at every turn the Bounds of Military Conduct, and the Rules of War. There happen sometimes accidental Alacrities and strange Furies in their Deliberations, that
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53645:111"/>
for the most part prompt them to follow the worst, and worst grounded Counsels, and that swell their Courages beyond the Limits of Reason:<note place="margin">

                        </note> from whence it falls out, that many great Captains, to justifie those temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deliberations, have been forc'd to tell their Souldiers, that they were by some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration and good <hi>Omen</hi> encourag'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to such Attempts. Wherefore, in this Doubt and Uncertainty that the short-sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of Humane Wisdom to see and choose the best, (by reason of the Difficulties that the various Accidents and Circumstances of things bring along with them) does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex us withall, the surest way in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, did no other Consideration invite us to it, more to pitch upon that wherein is the greatest Appearance of Honesty and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and not being certain of the shortest, to go the straitest and most direct way; as in these two Examples I have before laid down; there is no question to be made but it was more noble and generous in him who had receiv'd the Offence, to pardon it, as they both did, than to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and if the former miscarried in it, he is not nevertheless to be blam'd for his good Intention: neither does any one know if he had proceeded otherwise, whether by that means he had avoided the end his Destiny had appointed for him; and he had however lost the Glory of so generous an Act. You
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53645:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will find in History, of many who have been in this apprehension, that the most part have taken the course to meet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Conspiracies by Punishment and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; but I find but very few who have reap'd any Advantage by this proceeding; witness so many <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours: and whoever finds himself in this danger, ought not to expect much either from his Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Power; for how hard a thing is it for a man to secure himself from an Enemy, who lies conceal'd under the countenance of the most officious Friend we have, and to discover and know the Wills and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Thoughts of those who are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doing us service. 'Tis to much purpose to have a Guard of Strangers about a man's Person, and to be always fenced about with a Pale of armed men; whosoever despises his own Life, is always Master of that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man. And moreover, this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al suspition, that makes a Prince jealous of all the World, must of necessity be a strange Torment to him, and therefore it was, that <hi>Dion,</hi> being advertis'd that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> watch'd all opportunities to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Life, had never the Heart to enquire more particularly into it, saying, that he had rather dye, than live in that misery, that he must continually stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Guard, not onely against his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but his Friends also; which <hi>Alexander</hi>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:53645:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much more lively manifested in effect, when having notice by a Letter from <hi>Parmenio,</hi> that <hi>Philip,</hi> his most beloved Physician, was by <hi>Darius</hi> his money corrupted to poyson him, at the same time that he gave the Letter to <hi>Philip</hi> to read, sup'd off the Potion he had brought him. Was not this by such a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to express, that if his Friends had a mind to dispatch him out of the World, he was willing to give them opportunity to do it? This Prince is indeed the Sovereign Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of all hazardous Actions; but I do not know whether there be another passage in his Life wherein there is so much steadiness and constancy as in this, nor so illustrious an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the greatness of his Mind. Those who preach to Princes so circumspect and vigilant a jealousie and distrust, under colour of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, preach to them ruine and dishonour. Nothing Noble can ever be perform'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Danger. I know a Person, naturally of a very great daring and enterprizing Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, whose good fortune is continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and fore-stall'd by such persuasions, that he must retire into the gross of his own Body, and keep those he knows are his Friends continually about him, that he must not hearken to any Reconciliation with his antient Enemies, that he must stand off, and not trust his Person in hands stronger than his own, what promises or offers soever they may make him, or what advantages soever he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53645:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may see before him. And I know another, who has unexpectedly made his Fortune by following a contrary Advice. Courage, the Reputation and Glory of which men seek with so greedy an Appetite, represents and sets it self out when need requires, as magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently in Querpo, as in the neatest Arms, in a Closet, as well as a Camp; and this over-circumspect and wary Prudence is a mortal Enemy to all high and generous Exploits. <hi>Scipio,</hi> to sound <hi>Syphax</hi> his intention, leaving his Army, and abandoning <hi>Spain,</hi> not yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, nor well settled in his new Conquest, could pass over into <hi>Africk</hi> in two contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Bottoms, to commit himself, in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, to the power of a <hi>Barbarian</hi> King, to a Faith untry'd and unknown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Precaution, without Hostage, under the sole security of the greatness of his own Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, his good Fortune, and the promise of his elevated Hopes.<note place="margin">

                     <p>But it is true withall, that this undaunted assurance is not to be represented in its true and lively form, but by such whom the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Death, and the worst that can happen, does no way terrifie and affright; for to represent a pretended Resolution with a pale and doubtful Countenance, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Limbs for the forc'd Service of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Reconciliation, will effect nothing to purpose. 'Tis an excellent way to gain the Heart, and conquer the Will of another, to go submit, and intrust a man's Person to him, provided it appear to be frankly done, and without the constraint of Necessity, and in such a condition, that a man manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does it out of a pure and entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Party, at least with a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance clear from any Cloud of suspition. I saw, when I was a Boy, a Gentleman, who was Governour of a great City, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Popular Commotion and Fury, not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53645:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowing what other course to take, go out of a Place of very great Strength and Security, and commit himself to the mercy of the seditious Rabble, in hopes by that means to appease the Tumult before it grew to a more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Head: but it was ill for him that he did so, for he was there miserably slain. But I am not nevertheless of opinion, that he committed so great an Errour in going out, as men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach his Memory withall, as he did in choosing a gentle and submissive way for the effecting his purpose, and in endeavouring to quiet this storm, rather by obeying than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and by Entreaty rather than Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance; and am inclin'd to believe, that a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Severity, with a Souldier-like way of commanding, full of Security, and confidence suitable to the Quality of his Person, and the Dignity of his Command, would have succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better with him; at least, he had perish'd with greater Decency and Reputation. There is nothing so little to be expected, or hop'd for from this many-headed Monster, when so incens'd, as Humanity and good Nature; it is much more capable of Reverence and Fear. I should also reproach him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken a Resolution (in my Judgment rather brave than rash) to expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self weak and naked in this tempestuous Sea of enraged Franticks, he ought boldly to have stemm'd the Current, and to have born himself bravely aloft; whereas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53645:114"/>
to discover his Danger nearer hand, and his Nose thereupon hapning to bleed, he again chang'd that demiss and fawning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance he had at first put on, into another of Fear and Amazement, and filling both his Voice and Eyes with Entreaties and Tears, and in that Posture endeavouring to withdraw and secure his Person, that Carriage more enflam'd their Fury, and soon brought the Effects of it upon him. It was upon a time in a certain Place ordered by some, who had no very good Meaning in it, that there should be a general Muster of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Troops in Arms (for that is the most proper Scene of secret Revenges, and there is no Place where they can be executed with greater Safety) and there were publick and manifest Appearances, that there was no safe coming for some, whose principal and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Office it was to view them. Whereupon, a Consultation was call'd, and several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were propos'd, as in a case that was very nice, and of great Difficulty; and moreover, of important consequence. Mine, amongst the rest, was, that they should by all means avoid giving any sign of Suspicion, but that the Officers who were most in danger should boldly go, and with cheerful and erect Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances ride boldly and confidently tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Files and Divisions, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of sparing Fire (which the Counsels of the major part tended to) they should entreat
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53645:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Captains to command the Souldiers to give round and full Volleys in Honour of the Spectators, and not to spare their Powder: which was accordingly done, and serv'd to so good use, as to please and gratifie the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Troops, and thenceforward to beget a mutual and wholsome Confidence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence amongst them. I look upon <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s way of winning Men to him as the best, and most plausible, that can possibly be put in practice. First, he try'd by Clemency to make himself belov'd even by his very Enemies, contenting himself in detected Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, only publickly to declare, that he was pre-acquainted with them; which being done, he took a noble Resolution to expect, without Sollicitude or Fear, whatever might be the Event, wholly resigning up himself to the Protection of the Gods and Fortune: for questionless in this very Estate he was at the time when he was kill'd. A Stranger having publickly said, that he could teach <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> an infallible way to find out and discover all the Conspiracies his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should contrive against him, if he would give him a good Sum of Money for his Pains: <hi>Dionysius,</hi> hearing of it, caus'd the Man to be brought to him, that he might learn an Art so necessary to his Preservation; and having ask'd him by what Art he might make such Discoveries, the Fellow made Answer, That all the Art he knew, was, That he should
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53645:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give him a Talent, and afterwards boast that he had obtain'd a singular Secret from him. <hi>Dionysius</hi> lik'd the Invention, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caus'd six hundred Crowns to be counted out to him. It was not likely he should give so great a Sum to a Person unknown, but upon the account of some extraordinary Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the belief of which serv'd to keep his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in awe. Princes however do very wisely, to publish the Informations they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of all the Practices against their Lives, to possess men with an opinion they have so good Intelligence, and so many Spies abroad, that nothing can be plotted against them, but they have present notice of it. The Duke of <hi>Athens</hi> did a great many ridiculous things to establish his new Tyranny over <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>: but this especially was most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, that having receiv'd the first intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conspiracies the People were hatching against him, by <hi>Mattheo di Moroso,</hi> one of the Conspirators, he presently put him to death, to suppress that Rumour, that it might not be thought any of the City dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik'd his Government. I remember I have formerly read a Story of some <hi>Roman</hi> of great Quality, who, flying the Tyranny of the <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> had a thousand times, by the subtilty of as many Inventions, escap'd from falling into the hands of those that pursu'd him. It hap'ned one day, that a Troop of Horse which was sent out to take him, pass'd
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53645:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
close by a Brake where he was squat, and miss'd very narrowly of spying him: but he considering, upon the instant, the Pains and Difficulties wherein he had so long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to evade the strict and continual Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were every day made for him, the little Pleasure he could hope for in such a kind of Life, and how much better it was for him to dye once for all, than to be perpetually at this pass, he start from his Seat himself, call'd them back, shew'd them his Form, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily deliver'd himself up to their Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by that means to free both himself and them from further Trouble. To invite a man's Enemies to come and cut his Throat, was a Resolution that appears a little extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and odd; and yet I think he did bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take that course, than to live in a <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian</hi> Ague; and for which there was no Cure. But seeing all the Remedies a Man can apply to such a Disease, are full of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness, and uncertain, 'tis better with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courage to prepare ones self for the worst that can happen, and to extract some Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from this, That we are not certain the thing we fear will ever come to pass.</p>

                     <p>I Was often, when a Boy, wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to see in the <hi>Italian</hi> Farces, a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> alwayes brought in for the Fool of the Play, and that the Title of <hi>Magister</hi> was in no greater Reverence amongst us: for being deliver'd up to their Tuition, what could I do less than be jealous of their Honour and Reputation? I sought, I confess, to excuse them by the natural incompatibility betwixt the Vulgar sort, and men of a finer thread, both in Judgment and Knowledge, for as much as they go a quite contrary way to one another: But in this, the thing I most stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at was, that the bravest men were those who most despis'd them; witness our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet <hi>du Bellay,</hi>
                        <q>

And they us'd to do so in former times; for <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, that <hi>Graecian,</hi> and <hi>Scholar,</hi> were names of reproach and contempt amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi> But since, with the better experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Age, I find they had very great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                        <hi>non sunt magis magnos sapientes.</hi> The greatest Clerks are not the wisest men. But whence it should come to pass, that a Mind enrich'd with the knowledge of so many things, should not become more quick and spritely, and that a gross and vulgar understanding should yet inhabit there, without correcting and improving it self, where all the Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Judgments of the greatest Wits the World ever had, are collected, and stor'd up, I am yet to seek. To admit so many strange Conceptions, so great and so high Fancies, it is necessary, (as a young Lady, and one of the greatest Princesses of the Kingdom, said to me once) that a man's own be crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and squeez'd together into a less compass, to make room for the other. I should be apt to conclude, that as Plants are suffocated, and drown'd with too much nourishment, and Lamps with too much Oyl, so is the active part of the Understanding with too much study and Matter, which being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barass'd, and confounded with the diversity of things, is depriv'd of the Force and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to disengage it self; and that by the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this weight, it is bow'd, subjected, and rendred of no use. But it is quite otherwise, for a Soul stretches and dilates it self propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably as it fills. And in the Examples <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and great States-men, very Learned withall; whereas the Philosophers, a sort of men retir'd from all Publick Affairs, have been sometimes also despis'd, and render'd contemptible by the Comical liberty of their own Times; their Opinions, and singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Manners, making them appear to men of another method of living, ridiculous and absurd. Would you make them Judges of a Controversie of common Right, or of the Actions of Men? they are ready to take it upon them, and straight begin to examine, if he has Life, if he has Motion, if Man be any other than an Oxe? What it is to do, and to suffer? and what Animals Law and Justice are? Do they speak of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, 'tis with a rude, irreverent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent liberty. Do they hear a Prince, or a King commended for his Vertue, they make no more of him, than of a Shepheard, Goat-heard, or Neat-heard; a lazy <hi>Coridon,</hi> that busies himself only about milking, and shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Herds and Flocks, and that after the rudest manner. Do you repute any man the greater for being Lord of two thousand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of Land? they laugh at such a pitiful Pittance, as laying claim themselves to the whole World for their possession. Do you boast of your Nobility and Blood, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing descended from seven rich successive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors? they will look upon you with an eye of Contempt, as men who have not a

right Idea of the Universal Image of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that do not consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Predecessors every one of us has had, Rich, Poor, Kings, Slaves, Greeks, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. And though you were the fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth descent from <hi>Hercules,</hi> they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a great vanity, so highly to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue this, which is only a gift of Fortune. And even so did the Vulgar sort of men nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate them, as men ignorant of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things, where all things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, accusing them of Presumption and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence. But this <hi>Platonick</hi> Picture is far different from that these Pedants are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by: For those were envied for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves above the common sort of men, for despising the ordinary Actions and Offices of Life, for having assum'd a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and inimitable way of living, and for using a certain Method of Bumbaste and obsolete Language, quite different from the ordinary way of speaking: but these are contemn'd for being as much below the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al form, as incapable of Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for leading a Life, and conforming themselves to the mean and vile manners of the Vulgar. <hi>Odi homines ignava opera, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopha Sententia.</hi>

But some of them, seeing the Reins of Government in the hands of ignorant and unskilful Men, have avoided all Places and Interest in the Management of Affairs; and he who demanded of <hi>Crates,</hi> How long it was necessary to Philosophize, receiv'd this Answer, Till our Armies (said he) are no more commanded by Fools and Coxcombs. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> resign'd the Royalty to his Brother, and to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> who reproach'd him that he spent his time in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Boys before the Temple; <hi>Is it not better,</hi> said he, <hi>to do so, than to sit at the Helm of Affairs in your Company?</hi> Others having
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53645:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Imagination advanc'd above the thoughts of the World and Fortune, have look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tribunals of Justice, and even the Thrones of Kings, with an Eye of Contempt and Scorn; insomuch, that <hi>Empedocles</hi> refus'd the Royalty that the <hi>Agrigentines</hi> offer'd to him. <hi>Thales,</hi> once inveighing in Discourse against the Pains and Care Men put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to, to become rich; was answer'd by one in the Company, that he did like the Fox, who found fault with what he could not obtain. Whereupon, he had a mind, for the Jest's sake, to shew them to the contrary; and having upon this Occasion for once made a muster of all his Wits, wholly to employ them in the Service of Profit, he set a Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick on foot, which in one Year brought him in so great Riches, that the most experienc'd in that Trade could hardly in their whole Lives, with all their Industry, have rak'd so much together. That which <hi>Aristotle</hi> reports of some who said of him, <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and others of their Profession, that they were wise but not prudent, in not applying their Study to more profitable things (though I do not well digest this nice Distinction) that will not however serve to excuse my Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick sort of Men, for to see the low and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous Fortune wherewith they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we have rather Reason to pronounce that they are neither wise, nor prudent. But letting this first Reason alone, I think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53645:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to say, that this Inconvenience proceeds from their applying themselves the wrong way to the Study of Sciences; and that after the manner we are instructed, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if neither the Scholars nor the Masters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, though more learned, ever the wiser, or more fit for Business. In plain Truth, the Cares and Expence our Parents are at in our Education<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> point at nothing, but to furnish our Heads with Knowledge; but not a Word of Judgment and Vertue. Cry out of one that passes by, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, O, what a Learned! and of another, O, what a good man goes there! they will not fail to turn their Eyes, and address their Respect to the former. There should then be a third Cryer, O the Puppies and Coxcombs! Men are apt presently to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Does such a one understand Greek? Is he a Critick in Latine? Is he a Poet? or does he only pretend to Prose? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be grown better or more discreet, which are Qualities of greater Value and Concern, those are never enquir'd into; whereas, we should rather examine, who is better learned, than who is more learned. We only toyl and labour to stuff the Memory, and in the mean time leave the Conscience and the Understanding unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd and void. And, like Birds who fly abroad to forrage for Grain, bring it home in the Beak, without tasting it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53645:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to feed their Young; so our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants go picking Knowledge here and there, out of several Authors, and hold it at the Tongues end, only to spit it out, and distribute it amongst their Pupils. And here I cannot but smile to think how I have paid my self in shewing the Foppery of this kind of Learning, who my self am so manifest an Example; for, do I not the same thing throughout almost this whole Treatise? I go here and there, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of several Books the Sentences that best please me, not to keep them (for I have no Memory to retain them in) but to transplant them into this; where, to say the Truth, they are no more mine than in their first Places. We are, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, knowing only in present Knowledge, and not at all in what is past, no more than in that which is to come. But the worst on't is, their Scholars and Pupils are no better nourish'd by this kind of Inspiration, nor it makes no deeper Impression upon them, than the other, but passes from hand to hand, only to make a shew, to be tolerable Company, and to tell pretty Stories, like a counterfeit Coyn in Counters, of no other use nor value, but to reckon with, or to set up at Cards. <hi>Apud alios loqui didicerunt, non ipsi secum.</hi>

And this kind of Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puts me in mind of that rich Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been sollicitous, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Expence, to procure men that were excellent in all sorts of Science, which he had always attending his Person, to the end, that when amongst his Friends any Occasion fell out of speaking of any Subject whatsoever, they might supply his Place, and be ready to prompt him, one with a Sentence of <hi>Seneca,</hi> another with a Verse of <hi>Homer,</hi> and so forth, every one according to his Talent; and he fancied this Knowledge to be his own, because in the Heads of those who liv'd upon his Bounty. As they also do whose Learning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53645:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in having noble Libraries. I know one, who, when I question him about his Reading, he presently calls for a Book to shew me, and dare not venture to tell me so much, as that he has Piles in his Posteriours, till first he has consulted his Dictionary, what Piles and what Posteriours are. We take other Mens Knowledge and Opinions upon Trust; which is an idle and superficial Learning: we must make it our own. We are in this very like him, who having need of Fire, went to a Neighbours House to fetch it, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very good one there, fate down to warm himself without remembring to carry any with him home. What good does it do us to have the Stomach full of Meat, if it do not digest, and be not incorporated with us, if it does not nourish and support us? Can we imagine that <hi>Lucullus,</hi> whom Letters, without any manner of Experience made so great and so exact a Leader, learnt to be so after this perfunctory manner? We suffer our selves to lean and relye so over-strongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arm of another, that by so doing we prejudice our own Strength and Vigour. Would I fortifie my self against the fear of Death? it must be at the Expence of <hi>Seneca</hi>: Would I extract Consolation for my self or my Friend? I borrow it from him, or <hi>Cicero</hi>; whereas I might have found it in my self, had I been train'd up to make use of my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. I do not fancy this relative, mendicant,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53645:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and precarious Understanding; for though we could become learned by other Mens Reading, I am sure a Man can never be wise but by his own Wisdom.

To what Use serves Learning, if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be away? Would to God, that, for the good of our Judicature, those Societies were as well furnish'd with Understanding and Conscience, as they are with Knowledge. <hi>Non Vitae, sed Scolae discimus</hi>;<note place="margin">

So that it is no so great wonder, as they make of it, that our Ancestors had Letters in no greater E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem, and that even to this day, they are but rarely met with in the Privy Councils of Princes; and if this End and Design of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Riches (which is the onely thing we propose to our selves, by the means of Law, Physick, Pedantry, and even Divinity it self) did not uphold, and keep them in credit, you would without doubt see them as poor and unregarded as ever. And what loss would it be, if they neither instruct us to think well, nor to do well? <hi>Postquam docti prodierunt, boni desunt</hi>; After once they become Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they cease to be good. All other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is hurtful to him, who has not the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Honesty and good Nature.

Gain, addict themselves to Letters; or for so little a while (being taken from their Studies before they can come to have any taste of them, to a Profession that has nothing to do with Books) that there ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no other to apply themselves wholly to Learning, but People of mean Condition, who in that only study to live, and have Preferment only in their Prospect; and by such People, whose Souls are both by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Education, and domestick Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the basest Metal and Allay, the Fruits of Knowledge are both immaturely gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ill-digested, and deliver'd to their Pupils quite another thing. For it is not for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to enlighten a Soul that is dark of it self; nor to make a blind man to see. Her Business is not to find a man Eyes, but to guide, govern, and direct his steps, provided he have found Feet, and strait Legs to go upon. Knowledge is an excellent Drug, but no Drug has vertue enough to preserve it self from Corruption and Decay, if the Vessel be tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep. Such a one may have a Sight clear and good enough, who looks a squint, and consequently sees what is good, but does not follow it, and sees Knowledge, but makes no use of it. <hi>Plato</hi>'s principal Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Republick is, to fit his Citizens with Employments suitable to their Nature.

whose Charge it was to keep his Body health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and in good plight; and after he came to seven Years of Age, to teach him to ride, and to go a Hunting: when he arriv'd at fourteen he was transferr'd into the hands of four, the wisest, the most just, the most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and most valiant of the Nation; of which, the first was to instruct him in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the second to be always upright and sincere, the third to conquer his Appetites and Desires, and the fourth to despise all Danger. 'Tis a thing worthy of very great Consideration, that in that excellent, and, in truth, for its Perfection, prodigious form, and civil Regiment set down by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> though so sollicitous of the Education of Children, as a thing of the greatest Concern, and even in the very Seat of the Muses, he should make so little mention of Learning; as if their generous Youth, disdaining all other Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that of Vertue only, ought to be supply'd, instead of Tutors to read to them Arts and Sciences, with such Masters, as should only instruct them in Valour, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Justice. An Example that <hi>Plato</hi> has followed in his Laws; the manner of whose Discipline was to propound to them Questions upon the Judgments of Men, and of their Actions; and if they commended or condemned this or that Person, or Fact, they were to give a Reason for so doing; by which means they at once sharp'ned their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,

and became skillful in the Laws. <hi>Mandane,</hi> in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> asking her Son <hi>Cyrus</hi> how he would do to learn Justice, and the other Vertues amongst the <hi>Medes,</hi> having left all his Masters behind him in <hi>Persia?</hi> He made Answer, That he had learn'd those things long since; that his Master had often made him a Judge of the Differences amongst his School-Fellows, and had one day whip'd him for giving a wrong Sentence; and thus it was, A great Boy in the School, having a little short Cassock, by force took a longer from another that was not so tall as he, and gave him his own in exchange: whereupon, I being appointed Judge of the Controversie, gave Judgment, That I thought it best either of them should keep the Coat he had, for that they both of them were better fitted with that of one another than with their own: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, my Master told me, I had done ill, in that I had only consider'd the Fitness and Decency of the Garments, whereas I ought to have consider'd the Justice of the thing, which requires that no one should have any thing forcibly taken from him that is his own.

and seeing that Science, when most rightly apply'd, and best understood, can do no more but teach us Prudence, moral Honesty, and Resolution, they thought fit to initiate their Children with the knowledge of Effects, and to instruct them, not by Hear-say, and by Rote, but by the Experiment of Action, in lively forming and moulding them; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Words and Precepts, but chiefly Works and Examples; to the end it might not be a Knowledge of the Mind only, but a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion and a Habit: and not an Acquisition, but a natural Possession.

And therefore it is nothing strange, if, when <hi>Antipater</hi> demanded of them fifty Children for Hostages, they made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, quite contrary to what we should do, That they would rather give him twice as many full grown Men, so much did they value the loss of their Country's Education. When <hi>Agesilaus</hi> courted <hi>Xenophon</hi> to send his Children to <hi>Sparta</hi> to be bred, it is not, said he, there to learn Logick or Rhetorick, but to be instructed in the noblest of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, namely, the Science to Obey, and to Command. It is very pleasant to see <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> after his manner, rallying <hi>Hippias,</hi> who recounts to him what a World of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he has got, especially in certain little Villages of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by teaching School, and that he got never a Penny at <hi>Sparta.</hi> What a sottish and stupid People (says <hi>Socrates</hi>) are they, without Sense or Understanding, that make no Account either of Grammars, or Poetry, and only busie themselves in studying the Genealogies and Successions of their Kings, the Foundations, Rises, and Declensions of States, and such Tales of a Tub! After which, having made <hi>Hippias</hi> particularly to acknowledge the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Form of Publick Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Felicity and Vertue of their Private Life, he leaves him to guess at the

Examples have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to us, that in Military Affairs, and all others of the like Active Nature, the Study of Sciences does more soften and untemper the Courages of Men, than any way fortifie and invite them. The most Potent Empire, that at this Day appears to be in the whole World, is that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> a People equally inclin'd to the Estimation of Arms, and the Contempt of Letters. I find, <hi>Rome</hi> was more Valiant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she grew so Learned; and the most Warlike Nations at this time in Being, are the most ignorant: of which, the <hi>Scythians, Parthians,</hi> and the great <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> may serve for sufficient Proof. When the <hi>Goths</hi> over-ran <hi>Greece,</hi> the only thing that preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Libraries from the Fire, was, that some one possess'd them with an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they were to leave this kind of Furniture entire to the Enemy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most proper to divert them from the Exercise of Arms, and to fix them to a lazy and sedentary Life.

                     <p>I Never yet saw that Father, but let his Son be never so decrepid, or deform'd, would not notwithstanding own him: not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, if he were not totally besotted, and blinded with this Paternal Affection, that he did not well enough discern his Defects: but that all Defaults notwithstanding, he is still his. Just so do I, I see better than any other, that all I write are but the idle Whimsies of a man that has only nibbled upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Crust of Sciences in his Nonage, and only retain'd a general and formless Image of them, who have got a little snatch of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and nothing of the whole <hi>a la mode de France</hi>: For I know in general, that there is such a thing as Physick, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Laws, four Parts in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and, in part, what all these aim and point at; and peradventure I yet know far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what Sciences in general pretend unto, in order to the Service of Humane Life: but to dive farther than that, and to have
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53645:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cudgell'd my Brains in the study of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the Monarch of all Modern Learning; or particularly addicted my self to any one Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I have never done it; neither is there any one Art of which I am able to draw the first Lineaments and dead colour; insomuch that there is not a Boy of the lowest Form in a School, that may not pretend to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than I, who am not able to pose him in his first Lesson, which if I am at any time forc'd upon, I am necessitated in my own defence, to ask him some Universal Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such as may serve to try his natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; a Lesson as strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, as his is to me. I never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously settled my self to the reading any Book of solid Learning, but <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>; and there, like the <hi>Danaides,</hi> I eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fill, and it as constantly runs out; something of which drops upon this Paper, but very little or nothing stayes behind. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story is my delight, as to matter of Reading, or else Poetry, for which I have, I confess, a particular kindness and esteem: for, as <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes</hi> said, as the Voice, forc'd through the narrow passage of a Trumpet, comes out more forcible and shrill; so, methinks, a Sentence couch'd in the Harmony of Verse, darts more briskly upon the Understanding, and strikes both my Ear and Apprehension with a smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more pleasing Power. As to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts I have, of which this is the Essay,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53645:130"/>
I find them to bow under the burthen; my Fancy and Judgment do but grope in the dark, trip and stumble in their way, and when I have gone as far as I can, I discover still a new and greater extent of Land before me, but with a troubled and imperfect sight, and wrapt up in Clouds, that I am not able to penetrate. And taking upon me to write indifferently of whatever comes into my Head, and therein making use of nothing but my own proper and natural Force and Ammunition, if it befell me, as oft-times it does, accidentally to meet in any good Author, the same Heads and Common-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon which I have attempted to write, (as I did but a little before in <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Discourse <hi>of the Force of Imagination</hi>) to see my self so weak and so forlorn, so heavy, and so flat, in comparison of those better Writers, I at once pity and despise my self. Yet do I flatter, and please my self with this, that my Opinions have often the honour and good fortune to jump with theirs, and that I follow in the same Path, though at a very great distance; I am farther satisfied to find, that I have a Quality, which every one is not blest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which is, to discern the vast difference betwixt them and me; and notwithstanding all that, suffer my own Inventions, low, and contemptible as they are, to run on in their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53645:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Career, without mending or plaistering up the Defects that this Comparison has laid open to my own View; and in plain Truth, a Man had need of a good strong Back to keep Pace with these People. The indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Scriblers of our Times, who, amongst their laborious Nothings, insert whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Paragraphs, and Pages, out of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors, with a Design by that means to illustrate their own Writings, do quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for this infinite Dissimilitude of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments renders the Complexion of their own Compositions, so pale, sallow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that they lose much more than they get. The Philosophers, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> were, in this, of two quite contrary Humours; for the first did not only in his Books mix the Passages and Sayings of other Authors, but entire Pieces, and in one the whole <hi>Medea</hi> of <hi>Euripides</hi>; which gave <hi>Apollodorus</hi> occasion to say, That should a Man pick out of his Writings all that was none of his, he would leave him nothing but blank Paper: whereas the latter, quite contrary, in three hundred Volumes that he left behind him, has not so much as any one Quotation. I hapned the other day upon this Piece of Fortune; I was reading a <hi>French</hi> Book, where after I had a long time run dreaming over a great many Words, so dull, so insipid, so void of all Wit, or common Sence, that indeed they
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53645:131"/>
were only words; after a long and tedious travel, I came at last to meet with a piece that was lofty, rich, and elevated to the very Clouds: of which, had I found either the Declivity easie, or the Ascent accessible, there had been some excuse; but it was so perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular a Precipice, and so wholly cut off from the rest of the Work, that by the six first words I found my self flying into the other World, and from thence discover'd the Vale from whence I came so deep and low, that I had never since the Heart to descend into it any more. If I should set out my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with such rich Spoils as these, the Plagiary would be too manifest in his own Defects, and I should too much discover the imperfection of my own Writing. To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the fault in others, that I am guilty of my self, appears to me no more unreasonable, than to condemn, as I often do, those of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in my self. They are to be every where reprov'd, and ought to have no Sanctuary allow'd them. I know very well how impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently I my self at every turn attempt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual my self to my thefts, and to make my style go hand in hand with them, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a temerarious hopes of deceiving the eyes of my Reader from discerning the difference; but withall, it is as much by the benefit of my Application, that I hope to do it, as by that of my Invention, or any Force of my own. Besides, I do not offer to contend with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53645:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the whole Body of these Champions, nor hand to hand to any one of them, 'tis only by slights and little light attempts that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them; I do not grapple with them, but try their strength only, and never engage so far as I make a shew to do; and if I could hold them in play, I were a brave Fellow; for I never attaque them, but where they are most sinewy and strong. To cover a man's self (as I have seen some do) with another man's Arms, so as not to discover so much as their fingers ends; to carry on a Design (as it is not hard for a Man that has any thing of a Scholar in him, in an ordinary Subject to do) under old Inventions, patcht up here and there with his own Trumpery, and then to endeavour to conceal the theft, and to make it pass for his own, is first injustice, and meanness of Spirit in whoever do it, who having nothing in them of their own fit to procure them a Reputation, endeavour to do it by attempting to impose things upon the World in their own Name, which they have really no manner of title to; and then a ridiculous Folly to content themselves with acquiring the ignorant approbation of the Vulgar by such a pitiful Cheat, at the price at the same time of discovering their insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to men of Understanding, who will soon smell out and trace them in those bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd Allegories, and from whom alone they are to expect a legitimate Applause. For my
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53645:132"/>
own part, there is nothing I would not soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do than that, neither have I said so much of others, but to get a better Opportunity to excuse my self: neither in this do I in the least glance at the Composers of Canto's, who declare themselves for such; of which sort of Writers, I have in my time known many very ingenious, and have their Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodies in very great Esteem, and particularly one, under the Name of <hi>Capilulus,</hi> besides the Ancients. These are really Men of Wit, and that make it appear they are so, both by that and other ways of Writing; as for Example, <hi>Lipsius,</hi> in that learned and laborious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his Politicks. But, be it how it will, and how inconsiderable soever these Essays of mine may be, I will ingeniously confess, I never intended to conceal them, no more than my old bald grizled Picture before them, where the Graver has not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented you with a perfect Face, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of mine. And these also are but my own particular Opinions and Fancies, and I deliver them for no other, but only what I my self believe, and not for what is really to be believ'd. Neither have I any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in this Writing, but only to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my self, who also shall peradventure be another thing to morrow, if I chance to meet any Book, or Friend, to convince me in the mean time. I have no Authority to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, neither do I desire it, being too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53645:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of my own inerudition to be able to instruct others.</p>
                     <p>A Friend of mine then having read the precedent Chapter, the other day told me, that I should a little longer have insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Education of Children; and farther have extended my Discourse upon so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a point: which, how fit I am to do, let my Friends flatter me if they please, I have in the mean time no such Opinion of my own Talent, as to promise my self any very good success from my endeavour; but (Madam) if I had any sufficiency in this Subject, I could not possibly better employ it, than to present my best Instructions to the little Gentleman that threatens you short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a happy Birth; (for you are too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to begin otherwise than with a male) for having had so great a hand in the treaty of your Marriage, I have a certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar right and interest in the greatness and prosperity of the Issue that shall spring from it; besides that, your having had the best of my Services so long in possession, does sufficiently oblige me to desire the Honour and Advantage of all wherein you shall be concerned. But, in truth, all I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as to that particular is only this, that the greatest and most important difficulty of Humane Science is the Education of Children. For as in Agriculture, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry that is to precede Planting, as also
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53645:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
planting it self, is certain, plain, easie, and very well known; but after that which is planted comes to take root, to spread, and shoot up, there is a great deal more to be done, more Art to be us'd, more care to be taken, and much more difficulty to cultivate and bring them to Perfection: so it is with Men; it is no hard matter to get Children; but after they are born, then begins the Trouble, Sollicitude, and Care, vertuously to train, Principle, and bring them up. The Symptoms of their Inclinations in that young and tender Age are so obscure, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises so uncertain and fallacious, that it is very hard to establish any solid Judgment or Conjecture upon them. As <hi>Simon,</hi> for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and a thousand others, who have very much deceiv'd the little Expectation the World had of them: Cubs of Bears, and Bitches Puppies, do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indeed discover their natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but Men, so soon as ever grown up, immediately applying themselves to certain Habits, engaging themselves in certain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and conforming themselves to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws and Customs, do easily alter, or at least disguise, their true and real Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet it is hard to force the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of Nature; whence it comes to pass, that for not having chosen the right Course, a Man often takes very great Pains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53645:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a good part of his Age in training up Children to things, for which, by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Aversion, they are totally unfit. In this Difficulty, nevertheless, I am clearly of Opinion, that they ought to be elemented in the best and most advantageous Studies, without taking too much notice of, or being too superstitious in those light Prognosticks they give of themselves in their tender Years; to which <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Republick, gives, methinks, too much Authority. But (<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) Science is doubtless a very great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a thing of marvellous use, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Persons rais'd to that degree of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you are; and in truth, in Persons of mean and low Condition, cannot perform its true and genuine Office, being naturally more prompt to assist in the Conduct of War, in the Government of Armies and Provinces, and in negotiating the Leagues and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of Princes and foreign Nations, than in forming a Syllogism in Logick, in pleading a Process in Law, or in prescribing a Dose of Pills in Physick. Wherefore, <hi>Madam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving you will not omit this so necessary Embelishment in the Education of your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, who your self have tasted the Fruits of it, and of a Learned Extraction (for we yet have the Writings of the ancient Counts of <hi>Foix,</hi> from whom my Lord, your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and your self, are both of you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,

and <hi>Monsieur de Candale,</hi> your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, does every day oblige the World with others, which will extend the knowledge of this Quality in your Family so many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages) I will upon this occasion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to acquaint your Ladiship with one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Fancy of my own, contrary to the common Method, which also is all I am able to contribute to your Service in this Affair. The charge of the Tutor or Governour you shall provide for your Son, upon the choice of whom depends the whole Success of his Education, has several other great and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Parts and Duties requir'd in so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Trust, besides that of which I am about to speak, which however I shall not mention, as being unable to add any thing of moment to the common Rules, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who is qualified for a Governour is perfect in: and also in this wherein I take upon me to advise, he may follow it so far only as it shall appear rational, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the end at which he does aim and intend.</p>
                     <p>For a Boy of Quality then, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Letters not upon the account of Profit, (for so mean an Object as that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the grace and favour of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and moreover, in that a man directs his Service to, and professes to depend upon
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53645:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others) nor so much for outward ornament, as for his own proper and peculiar use, and to furnish and enrich himself within, having ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Desire to go out an accomplish'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, and a fine Gentleman, than a mere Scholar, and a Learned Man; for such a one, I say, I would also have his Friends sollicitous to find him out a Tutor, who has rather an Elegant than a Learned Head, and both, if such a Person can be found; but however, to prefer his Manners and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before his Reading, and that this Man should pursue the Exercise of his Charge after a new method. 'Tis the Custom of School-masters, to be eternally thundring in their Pupils Ears, as they were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Funnel, whilst their Business is only to repeat what the other have said before: Now I would have a Tutor to correct this Error, and that at the very first, he should, according to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he has to deal with, put it to the Test, permitting his Pupil himself to taste and relish things, and of himself to choose and discern them, sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes making him to break the Ice himself; that is, I would not have him alone to invent and speak, but that he should also hear his Pupil speak in turn. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and since him <hi>Arcesilaus,</hi> made first their Scholars speak, and then they spoke to

He is not oblig'd to discover whence he had his Ammunition, but only to produce what he has himself compos'd.

should know his good Condition. The Advantages of our Study are to become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more wise. 'Tis (says <hi>Epicharmus</hi>) the Understanding that sees and hears, 'tis the Understanding that improves every thing, that orders every thing, and that acts, rules, and reigns: all other Faculties are blind, and deaf, and without Soul; and certainly, we render it timerous and servile, in not allowing it the Liberty and Priviledge to do any thing of it self. Who ever ask'd his Pupil what he thought of Grammar and Rhetorick, or of such and such a Sentence of <hi>Cicero?</hi> Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters dart and stick them full feather'd in our Memories, and there establish them like Oracles, of which the very Letters and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are of the substance of the thing. To know by rote, is no Knowledge, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more but only to retain what one has intrusted to his Memory. That which a man rightly knows and understands, he is the free Disposer of at his own full Liberty, without any regard to the Author from whence he had it, or fumbling over the Leaves of his Book. A mere Bookish Learning is both troublesome and ungraceful; and though it may serve for some kind of Ornament, there is yet no Foundation for any Superstructure to be built upon it,<note place="margin">What true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato.</hi>

the other Sciences, that are directed to other ends, to be adulterate and false. I could wish, that <hi>Paluel</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> the two famous Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Masters of my Time, could have taught us to cut Capers, by only seeing them do it, without stirring from our Places, as these men pretend to inform the Understanding, without ever setting them to work; or that we could learn to Ride, handle a Pike, touch a Lute, or Sing, without the trouble of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as these attempt to make us Judge, and Speak well, without exercising us in Judging and Speaking. Now in this Initiation of our Studies, and in the Progress of them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever presents it self before us is Book suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; a Roguy Trick of a Page, a sottish Mistake of a Servant, or a Jest at the Table, are so many new Subjects. And for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reason, Conversation with men is of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Use, and Travel into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of singular Advantage; not to bring back (as most of our young Monsieurs do) an Account only of how many Paces <hi>Santa Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonda</hi> is in Circuit; or of the Richness of <hi>Signiora Livia</hi>'s Attire; or, as some others, how much <hi>Nero</hi>'s Face, in a Statue in such an old Ruine, is longer and broader than that made for him at such another Place: but to be able chiefly to give an Account of the Humours, Manners, Customs, and Laws of those Nations where he has been. And, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53645:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we may whet and sharpen our Wits by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them upon those of others. I would that a Boy should be sent abroad very young (and principally to kill two Birds with one Stone) into those neighb'ring Nations whose Language is most differing from our own, and to which, if it be not form'd betimes, the Tongue will be grown too stiff to bend. And also 'tis the general Opinion of all, that a Child should not be brought up in his Mother's Lap. Mothers are too tender, and their natural Affection is apt to make the most discreet of them all so over-fond, that they can neither find in their Hearts to give them due Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the Faults they commit, nor suffer them to be brought up in those Hardships and Hazards they ought to be. They would not endure to see them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all Dust and Sweat from their Exercise,<note place="margin">Fondness of Mothers pernicious to Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to drink cold Drink when they are hot, nor see them mount an unruly Horse, nor take a Foil in hand against a rude Fencer, or so much as to discharge a Carbine: and yet there is no Remedy; whoever will breed a Boy to be good for any thing when he comes to be a Man, must by no means spare him, even when so young, and must very often transgress the Rules of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

As for Proof, in our present Civil War, whoever draws his Sword against the Laws, threatens all honest Men with the Whip and the Halter. And moreover, by living at home, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Governour, which ought to be sovereign over the Boy he has receiv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Charge, is often check'd, interrupted, and hindred by the Presence of Parents; to which may also be added, that the Respect the whole Family pay him, as their Master's Son, and the Knowledge he has of the Estate and Greatness he is Heir to, are, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, no small Inconveniences in these tender Years. And yet even in this conversing with Men I spoke of but now, I have observ'd this Vice, That instead of gathering Observations from others, we make it our whole Business to lay our selves open to them, and are more concern'd how to expose and set out our own Commodities, than how to increase our Stock

by acquiring new. Silence therefore, and Modesty, are very advantageous Qualities in Conversation: and one should therefore train up this Boy to be sparing, and a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his Talent of Understanding, when once acquir'd; and to forbear taking Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at, or reproving every idle Saying, or ridiculous Story, is spoke or told in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for it is a Rudeness to controvert eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is not agreeable to our own Pallat. Let him be satisfied with correcting himself, and not seem to condemn every thing in another he would not do himself, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against common Customs.

Let him avoid these vain and uncivil Images of Authority, this childish Ambition of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear better bred, and more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd, than he really will by such Carriage discover himself to be, and, as if Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of interrupting and reprehending were not to be omitted, to desire from thence to derive the Reputation of something more than ordinary: for as it becomes none but great Poets to make use of the Poetical License, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd only to those of celebrated Art; it is also intollerable, that any but Men of great and illustrious Souls should be priviledg'd above the Authority of Custom; <hi>Si quid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, &amp; Aristippus contra morem,</hi>

Let him be instructed not to engage in Discourse, or dispute but with a Champion worthy of him, and even there not to make use of all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fallacies and Subtleties that are pat for his Purpose; but only such as may best serve him upon that Occasion. Let him be taught to be curious in the Election and Choice of his Reasons, to abominate Impertinence, and consequently, to affect Brevity; but above all, let him be lesson'd to acquiesce and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Truth so soon as ever he shall discover it, whether in his Opponent's Argument, or upon better Consideration of his own; for he shall never be preferr'd to the Chair for a mere clatter of Words and Syllogisms, and is no further engag'd to any Argument what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, than as he shall in his own Judgment approve it: nor yet is Arguing a Trade, where the liberty of Recantation, and getting off upon better Thoughts, are to be sold for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money. <hi>Neque, ut omnia, quae praescripta &amp; imperata sint,</hi>

If his Governour be of my Humour, he will form his Will to be a very good and Loyal Subject to his Prince, very affectionate to his Person, and very stout in his Quarrel; but withall, he will cool in him the desire of having any other tye to his Service, than merely a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Duty; because, besides several other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, that are very inconsistent with the honest Liberty every honest man ought to have, a man's Judgment being brib'd and prepossess'd by these particular Obligations and Favours, is either blinded,<note place="margin">Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and less free to exercise its Function, or shall be blemish'd either with Ingratitude or Indiscretion.

This Favour, and the Profit flowing from it, must needs, and not without some shew of Reason, corrupt his Understanding, and deprive him of the freedom of speaking: and also we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see these People speak in another kind of Phrase than is ordinarily spoken by others of the same Nation, though what they say in that Courtly Language, is not much to be believ'd in such Cases.

and have only Reason for their guide. Make him understand, that to acknowledge the Errour he shall discover in his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, though only found out by himself, is an effect of Judgment and sincerity, which are the principal things he is to seek after. That Obstinacy and Contention are common qualities, most appearing in, and best becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mean and illiterate Soul. That to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, and to correct himself, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake an unjust Argument in the height and heat of Dispute, are great, and philosophical Qualities. Let him be advis'd, being in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to have his Eye and Ear in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Room; for I find that the Places of greatest Honour are commonly possest by Men that have least in them, and that the greatest Fortunes are not always accompanied with the ablest Parts. I have been present, when, whilst they at the upper end of the Chamber have been only commending the Beauty of the <hi>Arras,</hi> or the Flavour of the Wine, many things that have been very finely said, have been lost and thrown away at the lower end of the Table.

That he do not teach him so much the Narative part, as the Business of History.

I have read an hundred things in <hi>Livie</hi> that another has not, or not taken notice of at least, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> has read an hundred more there than ever I could find, or then peradventure that Author ever Writ.

Writing; but withall, there are a thousand others which he has only touch'd, and glanc'd upon, where he only points with his Finger to direct us which way we may go if we will, and contents himself sometimes with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only one brisk hit in the nicest Article of the Question; from whence we are to grope out the rest: as for Example, where he says, <hi>That the Inhabitants of</hi> Asia <hi>came to be Vassals to one only, for not having been able to pronounce one Syllable, which is,</hi> No. Which Saying of his, gave perhaps matter and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to <hi>Boetius</hi> to write his <hi>Voluntary Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> Even this but to see him pick out a light Action in a man's Life; or a Word, that does not seem to be of any such Importance, is it self a whole Discourse. 'Tis to our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that men of Understanding should so immoderately affect Brevity; no doubt but their Reputation is the better by it: but in the mean time we are the worse. <hi>Plutarch</hi> had rather we should applaud his Judgment, than commend his Knowledge, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave us with an Appetite to read more, than glutted with that we have already read. He knew very well, that a Man may say too much even upon the best Subjects, and that <hi>Alexandrides</hi> did justly reproach him who made very elegant, but too long Speeches to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> when he said, <hi>O Stranger! thou speakest the things thou oughtest to speak,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53645:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but not after the manner that thou should'st speak them.</hi> Such as have lean and spare Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies stuff themselves out with Cloaths; so they who are defective in Matter, endeavour to make amends with Words. Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is marvellously enlightned by daily Conversation with men, for we are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of our selves so stupid as to have our Sight limited to the length of our own No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. One asking <hi>Socrates</hi> of what Country he was, he did not make Answer of <hi>Athens,</hi> but of the World; he whose Imagination is better levell'd, could carry further, embrac'd the whole World for his Country, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Society and Friendship to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; not as we do, who look no further than our Feet. When the Vines of our Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage are nip'd with the Frost, the Parish Priest presently concludes, that the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God is gone out against all Humane Race, and that the <hi>Cannibals</hi> have already got the Pip. Who is it, that seeing the bloody Havock of these Civil Wars of ours, does not cry out, That the Machine of the World is near Dissolution, and that the Day of Judgment is at hand; without considering, that many worse Revolutions have been seen, and that, in the mean time, People are very merry in a thousand other Parts of the Earth for all this? For my Part, considering the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and Impunity that always attend such
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53645:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Commotions, I admire they are so moderate, and that there is no more Mischief done. To him that feels the Hail-stones patter about his Ears, the whole Hemisphear appears to be in Storm and Tempest; like the ridiculous <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard,</hi> who said very gravely, That if that simple King of <hi>France</hi> could have manag'd his Fortune as he should have done, he might in time have come to have been Steward of the Houshold to the Duke his Master: the Fellow could not, in his shallow Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conceive that there could be any thing greater than a Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> And in truth we are all of us insensibly in this Error, an Error of a very great Train, and very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Consequence. But whoever shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to his Fancy, as in a Picture, that great Image of our Mother Nature, pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her full Majesty and Lustre, whoever in her Face shall read so general and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a Variety, whoever shall observe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that Figure, and not himself but a whole Kingdom, no bigger than the least Touch or Prick of a Pencil in comparison of the whole, that man alone is able to value things according to their true Estimate and Grandeur. This great World which some do yet multiply as several <hi>Species</hi> under one <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> is the Mirror wherein we are to behold our selves, to be able to know our selves as we ought to do. In short, I would have

this to be the Book my young Gentleman should study with the most Attention; for so many Humours, so many Sects, so many Judgments, Opinions, Laws, and Customs, teach us to judge aright of our own, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Understandings to discover their Imperfection and natural Infirmity, which is no trivial Speculation. So many Mutations of States and Kingdoms, and so many Turns and Revolutions of publick Fortune, will make us wise enough to make no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our own. So many great Names, so many famous Victories and Conquests drown'd and swallow'd in Oblivion, render our Hopes ridiculous of eternizing our Names by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of half a score light Horse, or a paltry Turret, which only derives its Memory from its Ruine. The Pride and Arrogancy of so many foreign Pomps and Ceremonies, the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Majesty of so many Courts and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs, accustom and fortifie our Sight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Astonishment to behold and endure the lustre of our own. So many millions of men buried before us, encourage us not to fear to go seek so good Company in the other World: and so of all the rest. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was wont to say, That our Life retires to the great and populous Assembly of the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, wherein some exercise the Body, that they may carry away the Glory of the Prize in those Contentions, and others carry Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise

to sell for Profit. There are also some (and those none of the worst sort) who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue no other Advantage than only to look on, and consider how, and why every thing is done, and to be unactive Spectators of the Lives of other men, thereby the better to judge of, and to regulate their own; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from Examples, all the Instruction couch'd in Philosophical Discourses, may naturally flow, to which all humane Actions, as to their best Rule, ought to be especially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: where a Man shall be taught to know,

If we are once able to restrain the Offices of Humane Life within their just and natural Limits, we shall find that most of the Sciences in use are of no great use to us, and even in those that are, that there are many very unnecessary Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Dilatations which we were better to let alone, and following <hi>Socrates</hi> his Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, limit the Course of our Studies to those things only where a true and real Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

The Way of instructing him ought to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Discourse, and sometimes by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sometimes his Governour shall put the Author himself, which he shall think most proper for him, into his Hands, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times only the Marrow and Substance of it; and if himself be not conversant enough in Books to turn to all the fine Discourses the Book contains, there may some Man of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be joyn'd to him, that upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

She can be Rich, be Potent and Wise, and knows how to lye upon soft Down, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd Quilts too: she loves Life, Beauty, Glory, and Health; but her proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Office is to know regularly how to make use of all these good things, and how to part with them without Concern: an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice much more noble than troublesome, and without which the whole Course of Life is unnatural, turbulent, and deform'd; and there it is indeed, that Men may justly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent those Monsters upon Rocks and Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If this Pupil shall happen to be of so cross and contrary a Disposition, that he had rather hear a Tale of a Tub than the true Narrative of some noble Expedition, or some wise and learned Discourse; who at the Beat of Drum, that excites the youthful Ardour of his Companions, leaves that to follow another that calls to a Morrice, or the Bears, and who would not wish, and find it more delightful, and more pleasing, to return all Dust and Sweat victorious from a Battel, than from Tennis, or from a Ball, with the Prize of those Exercises; I see no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, but that he be bound Prentice in some good Town to learn to make minc'd Pyes, though he were the Son of a Duke, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I would not have his Spirit cow'd and subdu'd, by applying him to the Rack, and tormenting him as some do, 14 or 15 Hours a day, and so make a Pack-Horse of him. Neither should I think it good, when, by reason of a solitary and melancholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, he is discover'd to be much addicted to his Book, to nourish that Humour in him: for that renders them unfit for Civil Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and diverts them from better Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.

By which method of Instruction, my young Pupil will be much more, and better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd than those of the Colledge are: but as the steps we take in walking to and fro in a Gallery, though three times as many, do not tire a man so much as those we employ in a formal Journey, so our Lesson, as it were accidentally occurring, without any set ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of Time or Place, and falling natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally into every action, will insensibly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate it self.

form'd at the same time with his Mind. 'Tis not a Soul, 'tis not a Body that we are train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, but a man, and we ought not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him. And, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, we are not to fashion one without the other, but make them draw together like two Horses harness'd to a Coach.

As to the rest, this Method of Education ought to be carried on with a severe sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, quite contrary to the practice of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who, instead of tempting and alluring Children to Letters by apt and gentle wayes, do in truth present nothing before them but Rods and Ferula's,<note place="margin">Severity an Enemy to Education.</note> Horror and Cruelty. Away with this Violence! away with this Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion! than which, I certainly believe nothing more dulls and degenerates a well-descended Nature. If you would have him apprehend shame and chastisement, do not harden him to them. Inure him to Heat and Cold, to Wind and Sun, and to Dangers that he ought to despise. Wean him from all effeminacy, and delicacy in Cloaths and Lodging, Eating and Drinking; accustom him to every thing, that he may not be a Sir <hi>Paris,</hi> a Carpet-Knight, but a sinewy, hardy, and vigorous young man. I have ever from a Child to the age wherein I now am, been of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53645:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and am still constant to it. But amongst other things, the strict Government of most of our Colledges has evermore displeas'd me, and peradventure they might have err'd less perniciously on the indulgent side. 'Tis the true House of Correction of imprison'd Youth. They are taught to be debauch'd, by being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd before they are so. Do but come in when they are about their Lesson, and you shall hear nothing but the out-cries of Boyes under execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the thund'ring noise of their <hi>Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi> drunk with Fury, to make up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort. A very pretty way this! to tempt these tender and timorous Souls to love their Book, with a furious Countenance, and a Rod in hand! A cursed and pernicious way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding! Besides what <hi>Quintilian</hi> has very well observ'd, that this insolent Authority is often attended by very dangerous Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and particularly our way of Chastising. How much more decent would it be to see their Classes strew'd with green Leaves and fine Flowers, than with the bloody Stumps of Birch and Willows? Were it left to my ordering, I should paint the School with the Pictures of Joy and Gladness; <hi>Flora,</hi> and the <hi>Graces,</hi> as the Philosopher <hi>Spencippus</hi> did his; that where their Profit is, they might there have their Pleasure too. Such Viands as are proper and wholsome for Children, should be season'd with Sugar, and such as are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them, with Gall. A Man would
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53645:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
admire to see how sollicitous <hi>Plato</hi> is in his Laws concerning the Gayety and Diversion of the Youth of his City, and how much he enlarges himself upon their Races, Sports, Songs, Leaps, and Dances: of which, he says, that Antiquity has given the ordering and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage particularly to <hi>Apollo, Minerva,</hi> and the Muses. He insists long upon, and is very particular in giving innumerable Precepts for Exercises; but as to the Lettered Sciences, says very little, and only seems particularly to recommend Poecy upon the Account of Musick. All Singularity in our Manners and Conditions, is by all means to be avoided, as inconsistent with civil Society. Who would not be astonish'd at so strange a Constitution as that of <hi>Demophon,</hi> Steward to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who sweat in the Shade, and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the Sun? I have seen those who have run from the smell of a mellow Apple with greater Precipitation than from a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze Shot; others run away from a Mouse; others vomit at the sight of Cream, others ready to swoon at the sight of a Cat, as <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi> who could neither endure the Sight nor the Crowing of a Cock. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that there may peradventure be some occult Cause and natural Aversion in these Cases; but certainly a Man might conquer it, if he took it in time. Precept has in this wrought so effectually upon me, though not without some Endeavour on my part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53645:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Beer excepted, my Appetite accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates it self indifferently to all sorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. Young Bodies are supple, one should therefore in that Age bend and ply them to all Fashions and Customs: and provided a Man can contain the Appetite and the Will within their due Limits, let a Young-man, a Gods Name, be rendred fit for all Nations and all Companies, even to Debauchery and Excess if occasion be; that is, where he shall do it out of Complacency to the Customs of the Place. Let him be able to do every thing, but love to do nothing but what is good. The Philosophers themselves do not justifie <hi>Callisthenes</hi> for forfeiting the Favour of his Master <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to pledge him a Cup of Wine. Let him laugh, play, and drink with his Prince: nay I would have him, even in his Debauches, too hard for the rest of the Company, and to excell his Companions in Ability and Vigour, and that he may not give over doing it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through Defect of Power or Knowledge how to do it, but for want of Will.<note place="margin">

The World is nothing but Babble; and I hardly ever yet saw that Man who did not rather Prate too much, than Speak too little; and yet half of our Age is embezled this way.

I think they are nothing but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of some imperfect Images and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that they know not what to make of within, nor consequently bring them out: they do not yet themselves understand what they would be at, and if you but observe how they haggle, and stammer upon the point of Parturition, you will soon conclude, that their Labour is not to Delivery, but about Conception, and that they are but licking their formeless Embrio. For my part, I hold, and <hi>Socrates</hi> is positive in it, that whoever has in his Mind a spritely and clear Imagination, he will express it well enough in one kind or another, and, though he were dumb, by Signes.

                        <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> who since died a famous Physician in <hi>France,</hi> totally ignorant of our Language, but very fluent, and a great Critick in Latine. This Man, whom he had fetch'd out of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and whom he entertained with a very great Salary for this only end, had me conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in his Arms: to whom there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so joyn'd two others of the same Nation, but of inferiour Learning, to attend me, and sometimes to relieve him; who all of them entertain'd me with no other Language but Latine. As to the rest of his Family, it was an inviolable Rule, that neither Himself, nor my Mother, Man nor Maid, should speak any thing in my Company, but such Latine Words as every one had learnt only to gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with me. It is not to be imagin'd how
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53645:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great an advantage this prov'd to the whole Family, my Father, and my Mother, by this means learning Latin enough to understand it perfectly well, and to speak it to such a Degree, as was sufficient for any necessary Use; as also those of the Servants did, who were most frequent with me. To be short, we did Latin it at such a Rate, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed to all the Neighbouring Villages, where there yet remain, that have establish't themselves by Custom, several Latin Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Artizans and their Tools. As for what concerns my self, I was above six years of Age before I understood either French or Perigordin, any more than Arabick, and without Art, Book, Grammar, or Precept, Whipping, or the expence of a Tear, had by that time learn'd to speak as pure Latin as my Master himself. If (for Example) they were to give me a Theam after the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge fashion, they gave it to others in <hi>French,</hi> but to me they were of necessity to give it in the worst Latin, to turn it into that which was pure and good; and <hi>Nicholas Grouchi,</hi> who writ a Book <hi>de Comitiis Romanorum; William Guirentes,</hi> who has writ a Comment upon <hi>Aristotle; George Bucanan,</hi> that great <hi>Scotch</hi> Poet, and <hi>Marcus Antonius Muretus</hi> (whom both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for the best Orator of his time) my domestick Tutors, have all of them often told me, that I had in my Infancy that Language
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53645:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so very fluent and ready, that they were afraid to enter into Discourse with me; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Bucanan,</hi> whom I since saw attending the late <hi>Mareschal de Brissac,</hi> then told me, that he was about to write a Treatise of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Example of which, he intended to take from mine, for he was then Tutor to that Count <hi>de Brissac</hi> who afterwards prov'd so valiant and so brave a Gentleman. As to Greek, of which I have but a very little Smattering, my Father also design'd to have it taught me by a Trick; but a new one, and by way of sport; tossing our Declensions to and fro, after the manner of those, who by certain Games at Tables and Chess, learn Geometry and Arithmetick: for he, amongst other Rules, had been advis'd to make me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Science and Duty by an unforc'd Will, and of my own voluntary motion, and to educate my Soul in all Liberty and Delight, without any Severity or Constraint. Which also he was an Observer of to such a degree, even of Superstition, if I may say so, that some being of Opinion, it did trouble and disturb the Brains of Children suddenly to wake them in the Morning, and to snatch them violently and over-hastily from Sleep, (wherein they are much more profoundly envolv'd than we) he only caus'd me to be wak'd by the Sound of some musical Instrument, and was never unprovided of a Musician for that purpose: by which Example you may judge of the rest,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53645:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this alone being sufficient to recommend both the Prudence and the Affection of so good a Father; who therefore is not to be blam'd if he did not reap Fruits answerable to so exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site a Culture: of which, two things were the cause. First, a steril and improper Soil: for, tho I was of a strong and healthful Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of a Disposition tollerably sweet and tractable; yet I was withall so heavy, idle, and indispos'd, that they could not rouze me from this Stupidity to any Exercise of Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, nor get me out to play. What I saw, I saw clearly enough, and under this lazy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion nourish'd a bold Imagination, and Opinions above my Age. I had a slothful Wit, that would go no faster than it was led, a slow Understanding, a languishing Invention, and after all, incredible defect of Memory; so that it is no wonder, if from all these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing considerable can be extracted. Secondly, (like those, who, impatient of a long and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cure, submit to all sorts of Prescriptions and Receipts) the good Man being extreamly ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous of any way failing in a thing he had so wholly set his Heart upon, suffer'd himself at last to be over-rul'd by the common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and complying with the method of the time, having no more those Persons he had brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and who had given him the first Model of Education, about him, he sent me at six Years of Age to the Colledge of <hi>Guienne,</hi> at that time the best and most
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53645:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flourishing in <hi>France.</hi> And there it was not possible to add any thing to the care he had to provide me the most able Tutors, with all other Circumstances of Education, reserving also several particular Rules contrary to the Colledge Practice; but so it was, that with all these Precautions, it was a Colledge still. My Latine immediately grew corrupt, of which also by Discontinuance I have since lost all manner of use: so that this new way of Institution serv'd me to no other end, than only at my first coming to prefer me to the first Forms: for at thirteen Years old, that I came out of the Colledge, I had run thorough my whole Course (as they call it) and in truth without any manner of Improvement, that I can honestly brag of, in all this time. The first thing that gave me any Taste of Books, was the Pleasure I took in reading the Fables of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Metamorphoses, and with them I was so taken, that being but Seven or Eight Years old, I would steal from all other Divertisements to read them, both by reason that this was my own natural Language, the easiest Book that I was acquainted with, and for the Subject, the most accommodated to the Capacity of my Age: for as for <hi>Lancelot du Lake, Amadis de Gaule, Huon</hi> of <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> and such Trumpery, which Children are most delighted with, I had never so much as heard their Names, no more than I yet know what they contain; so exact was the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53645:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Discipline wherein I was brought up. But this was enough to make me neglect the other Lessons were prescrib'd me; and here it was infinitely to my Advantage, to have to do with an understanding Tutor, who very well knew discreetly to connive at this and other Truantries of the same nature; for by this means I ran thorough <hi>Virgil's Aeneids, Terence, Plautus,</hi> and some <hi>Italian</hi> Comedies, allur'd by the Softness and Pleasure of the Subject; whereas had he been so foolish as to have taken me off this Diversion, I do really believe, I had brought nothing away from the Colledge but a Hatred of Books, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all our young Gentlemen do: but he carried himself very discreetly in that Business, seeming to take no notice, and allowing me only such time as I could steal from my other regular, and yet mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Studies, which whetted my Appetite to devour those Books I was naturally so much in love with before. For the chief things my Father expected from their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to whom he had deliver'd me for Education, was Affability of Manners, and good Humour; and, to say the Truth, mine had no other Vice but Sloth and want of Mettal. There was no fear that I would do ill, but that I would do nothing; no body suspected that I would be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but useless; they foresaw an Idleness, but no Malice in my Nature; and I
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53645:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
find it falls out accordingly. The Complaints I hear of my self are these, he is idle, cold in the Offices of Friendship and Relation, and remiss in those of the Publick; he is too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he is too proud: but the most Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious do not say, Why has he taken such a thing? Why has he not paid such a one? But why does he part with nothing? Why does he not give? And I should take it for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that Men would expect from me no greater Effects of Supererogation than these. But they are unjust to exact from me what I do not owe; and in condemning me to it, they efface the Gratification of the Act, and deprive me of the Gratitude that would be due to me upon such a Bounty; whereas the active Benefit ought to be of so much the greater Value from my hands, by how much I am not passive that way at all. I can the more freely dispose of my Fortune the more it is mine, and of my self, the more I am my own. Nevertheless, if I were good at setting out my own Actions, I could peradventure very well repell these Reproaches, and could give some to understand, that they are not so much offended, that I do not enough, as that I am able to do a great deal more than I do. Yet for all this heavy Disposition of mine, my Mind, when retir'd into it self, was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether idle, nor wholly depriv'd of solid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, nor of certain and infallible Results about those Objects it could comprehend, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53645:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could also without any Helps digest them; but amongst other things, I do really believe, it had been totally impossible to have made it to submit by Violence and Force. Shall I here acquaint you with one Faculty of my Youth? I had great Boldness and Assurance of Countenance, and to that a Flexibility of Voice and Gesture to any Part I undertook to act.

'Tis an Exercise that I do not disapprove in young People of Condition, and have since seen our Princes, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Ancients, in Person handsomly and commendably perform these Exercises; and it was moreover allow'd to Persons of the greatest Quality to profess, and make a Trade of it in <hi>Greece.</hi>

Nay, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tax'd those with Impertinence who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn these Entertainments, and with Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice those who refuse to admit such Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as are worth seeing into the good Towns, and grudge the People that publick Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Well-govern'd Corporations take care to assemble their Citizens, not only to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Duties of Devotion, but also to Sports and Spectacles. They find Society and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship augmented by it; and besides, can there possibly be allow'd a more orderly and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diversion than what is perform'd in the Sight of every one, and very often in the Presence of the Supream Magistrate himself? And I, for my part, should think it reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Prince should sometimes gratifie his People at his own Expence; and that in great and populous Cities there might be Theatres erected for such Entertainments, if but to divert them from worse and more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Actions. But, to return to my Subject, there is nothing like alluring the Appetite and Affection, otherwise you make nothing but so many Asses loaden with Books, and by vertue of the Lash, give them their Pocket full of Learning to keep; whereas, to do

day after, and the means by which he tells us he came to do so, we may be allow'd to be a little merry at it, as also at what our Annals report, that Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> the same day that King <hi>Phillip Augustus</hi> died at <hi>Mant</hi>â€” per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his publick Obsequies at <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded the like throughout all <hi>Italy</hi>; the Testimony of these Authors not being perhaps of Authority enough to restrain us. But what if <hi>Plutarch,</hi> besides several Examples that he produces out of Antiquity, tells us, he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by certain Knowledge, that in the time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the News of the Battel lost by <hi>Antonius</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> was publish'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> many dayes Journey from thence, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd throughout the whole World, the same Day it was fought: and if <hi>Caesar</hi> was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it has often happened, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port has preceded the accident; shall we not say, that these simple People have suffered themselves to be deceived with the Vulgar, for not having been so clear sighted as we? Is there any thing more delicate, more clear, more spritely, than <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Judgment, when he is pleased to set it to work? Any thing more remote from vanity? Setting aside his Learning, of which I make less account, in which of these do any of us excell him? And yet there is scarce a Puisne Sophister that does not convince him of untruth, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to instruct him in the Progress of the Works of Nature: When we read in <hi>Bouchet</hi>

the Miracles of St. <hi>Hillary's</hi> Relicks: away with it, his Authority is not sufficient to bear us the Liberty of contradicting him: but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to condemn all such like Stories, seems to me an impudence of the worst Character. The great St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> professes himself to have seen a blind Child recover sight upon the Relick of St. <hi>Gervase,</hi> and St. <hi>Protasius</hi> at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> a Woman at <hi>Carthage</hi> cur'd of a Cancer, by the sign of the Cross made upon her by a Woman newly baptis'd. <hi>Hesperius,</hi> a familiar Friend of his, to have driven away the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that haunted his House, with a little Earth of the Sepulchre of our Lord: which Earth being also transported thence into the Church, a Paralitick to have there been suddenly cur'd by it. A Woman in Procession, having touch'd St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Shrine with a Nosegay, and after rubbing her Eyes with it, to have recovered her Sight lost many years before; with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Miracles, of which he professes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have been an Eye Witness. Of what shall we accuse him and the two holy Bishops, <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> both which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests to the Truth of these things? Shall it be of Ignorance, Simplicity, and Facility; or of Malice, and Imposture?

For after that, according to your fine Understanding, you have establish'd the Limits of Truth and Error, and that afterwards there appears a Necessity upon you of believing stranger things than those you have contradicted, you are already oblig'd to quit your hold, and to acquiesce. That which seems to me so much to disorder our Consciences in the Commotions we are now in concerning Religion, is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks dispensing so much with their Belief; they fancy they appear Moderate, and Wise, when they grant to the <hi>Huguenosts</hi> some of the Articles in Question; but besides that, they do not discern what advantage it is to those with whom we contend, to begin to give Ground, and to retire, and how much this animates our Enemy to follow his blow: these Articles which they insist upon as things indifferent, are sometimes of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and dangerous Consequence. We are either wholly and absolutely to submit our selves to the Authority of our Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Polity, or totally throw off all Obedience to it. 'Tis not for us to determine what and how much Obedience we owe to it, and this I can say, as having my self made tryal of it, that having formerly taken the liberty of my

Glory and Curiosity are the Scourges of the Soul; of which the last prompts us to thrust our Noses into every thing, and the other forbids us to leave any thing doubtful and undecided.</p>

him in the first, and the better, my power of handling not being such, that I dare to offer at a brave peice, finely painted, and set off according to Art. I have therefore thought fit to borrow one of <hi>Estienno de Boitic,</hi> and such a one as shall honour and adorn all the rest of my work; namely, a discourse that he called, <hi>The voluntary Servitude:</hi> a peice writ in his younger years, by way of Essay, in honour of liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Tyrants, and which has since run through the hands of several Men of great Learning and Judgment, not without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and merited commendation; for it is finely writ, and as full, as any thing can possibly be: Though a Man may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say it is far short of what he was able to do; and if in that more mature Age, wherein I had the happiness to know him, he had taken a design like this of mine, to commit his thoughts to writing, we should have seen a great many rare things, and such as would have gone very near to have rival'd the best Writings of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For in Natural parts especially, I know no Man comparable to him. But he has left nothing behind him, save this Treatise only, (and that too by chance, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he never saw it after it first went out of his hands,) and some Observations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Edict of <hi>January,</hi> made Famous by our Civil Wars, which also shall elsewhere
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53645:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
peradventure find a place. These were all I could recover of his Remains, I to whom, with so affectionate a remembrance, upon his Death-bed, he by his last Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd his Library, and Papers, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Book of his Works only excepted, which I committed to the Press. And this particular obligation I have to this Treatise of his, that it was the occasion of my first coming acquainted with him; for it was shew'd to me long before I had the good fortune to know him; and gave me the first knowledg of his name; proving so the first cause and foundation of a Friendship, which we afterward improv'd, and maintain'd, so long as God was pleas'd to continue us together, so perfect, invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and entire, that certainly the like is hardly to be found in Story, and amongst the Men of this Age, there is no sign nor trace of any such thing in use; so much concurrence is requir'd to the building of such a one, that 'tis much, if Fortune bring it but once to pass in three Ages. There is nothing to which Nature seems so much to have enclin'd us, as to Society; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, that the good <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> had more respect to Friendship, than to Justice. Now the most supream point of its perfection in this:<note place="margin">Perfect Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, what.</note> for generally all those, that Pleasure, Profit, Publick or Private Interest, Create and Nourish, are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53645:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so much the less Generous, and so much the less Friendships, by how much they mix another cause, and design, than sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and pure Friendship it self. Neither do the four Ancient Kinds, Natural, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable, Hospitable and Venerian, either se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, or jointly, make up a true and perfect Friendship. That of Children to Parents is rather respect: Friendship being nourisht by Communication, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by reason of the great disparity, be betwixt them: but would rather perhaps violate the duties of Nature; for neither are all the secret thoughts of Fathers fit to be communicated to Children, lest it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get an indecent familiarity betwixt them; neither can the advices, and reproofs, which is one of the principal offices of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, be properly perform'd by the Son to the Father. There are some Countries, where 'tis the Custom for Children to kill their Fathers; and others, where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers kill'd their Children, to avoid being sometimes an impediment to one another in their designs; and moreover the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the one does naturally depend upon the ruine of the other. There have been great Philosophers who have made nothing of this tie of Nature, as <hi>Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> for one, who being prest home about the affection he ow'd to his Children, as being come out of him, presently fell to
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53645:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spit, saying, that that also came out of him, and that he did also breed Worms, and Lice; and that other, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> endeavoured to reconcile to his Brother, I make never the more account of him, said he, for coming out of the same hole. This name of Brother does indeed carry with it an amicable and affectionate sound, and for that reason, he and I call'd Brothers: but the complication of Interest, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Estates, and that the raising of the one, should be the undoing of the other, does strangely unnerve and slacken this fraternal tie: And Brothers pursuing their Fortune and Advancement by the same Path, 'tis hardly possible, but they must of necessity often justle, and hinder one another. Besides, why is it necessary that the correspondence of Manners, Parts and Inclinations, which beget these true and perfect Friendships, should always meet and concur in these relations. The Father and the Son may be of quite contrary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and Brothers without any manner of Sympathy in their Natures. He is my Son, he is my Brother, or he and I are Cousin-germans; but he is Passionate, ill Natur'd, or a Fool. And moreoever, by how much these are Friendships, that the Law, and Natural Obligation, impose upon us; so much less is there of our own choice, and voluntary freedom. Whereas
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53645:171"/>
that voluntary liberty of ours, has nothing but that of Affection and Friendship, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly its own. Not that I have not in my own person experimented all can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be expected of that kind, having had the best, and most indulgent Father, even to an extream old Age, that ever was, and who was himself descended from a Family, for many Generations Famous, and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary for Brotherly Concord:

Friendship on the contrary, is enjoy'd proportionably, as it is desir'd, and only grows up, is nourisht and improves by enjoyment, as being of it self Spiritual, and the Soul growing still more perfect by practice. Under, and subsellious to this
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53645:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perfect Friendship, I cannot deny, but that the other vain Affections, have in my younger Years found some place in my thoughts, that I may say nothing of him, who himself confesses but too much in his Verses: So that I had both these Passions, but always so, that I could my self well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough distinguish them, and never in any degree of comparison with one another. The first maintaining its flight in so lofty and so brave a place, as with disdain to look down, and see the other flying at a far humbler pitch below. As concerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, besides, that it is a Covenant, the entrance into which, is only free, but the continuance in it, forc'd and compell'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another dependance, than that of our own Free-will, and a Bargain commonly contracted to other ends, there almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happens a Thousand Intricacies in it, to unravel, enough to break the Thred, and to divert the Current of a Lively Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: whereas Friendship has no manner of Business or Traffick with any but it self. Moreover, to say truth, the ordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Women, is not such, as is sufficient to maintain the Conference and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication required, to the support of this Conjugal Tie; nor do they appear to be endu'd with Constancy of Mind, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the pinch of so hard and durable a Knot. And doubtless, if without this,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53645:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there could be such a free and voluntary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity contracted, where not only the Souls might have this entire fruition, but the Bodies also might share in the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and a Man be engag'd throughout, the Friendship would certainly be more full and perfect; but it is without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that this Sex could ever arrive at such perfection, and by the Ancient Schools, is wholy rejected; as also that other <hi>Grecian</hi> Licence is justly abhorr'd by our manners; which also, for having, according to their practice, a so necessary disparity of Age, and difference of Offices betwixt the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, hold no more proportion with the perfect Union and Harmony that we here require, than the other.<note place="margin">

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53645:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
false image of Corporal Generation; for upon the Soul it could not ground this Love, the sight of which, as yet lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, was but now springing, and not of maturity to Blossom. Which fury, if it seiz'd upon a mean Courage, the means by which he preferr'd his suit, were rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, favour in advancement to Dignities, and such Trumpery, which they by no means approve: If on a more generous Soul, the pursuit was suitably generous, by Philosophical Instructions, Precepts to revere Religion, to obey the Laws, to die for the good of his Country; by examples of Valour, Prudence and Justice, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver studying to render himself acceptable by the Grace and Beauty of his Soul, that of his Body being long since faded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, hoping by this mutual Society to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish a more firm and lasting Contract. When this Courtship came to effect in due season, (for that which they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the Lover, namely, Leisure and Discretion in his pursuit, they strictly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in the person Loved; forasmuch as he is to judg of an internal Beauty, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Knowledg, and obscure Discovery,) then there sprung in the Person Loved the desire of a spiritual Conception, by the mediation of a spiritual Beauty.

Of which, the Salutiferous Loves of <hi>Harmonius</hi> and <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> is a good instance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that they call'd it Sacred and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and do conceive, that nothing but the Violence of Tyrants, and the Baseness of the common People, is mimical to it: finally, all that can be said in favour of the Academy, is, that it was a Love which ended in Friendship; which also well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough agrees with the Stoical definition of Love.<note place="margin">

Those are only to be reputed Friendships, that are fortified and confirmed by Judgment, and length of time.</hi> For the rest, which we commonly call Friends, and Friendships, are nothing but Acquaintance, and Familiarities, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasionally contracted, or upon some design, by means of which, there happens some little intercourse betwixt our Souls: but in the Friendship I speak of, they mix and work themselves into one piece, with so universal a mixture, that there is no more sign of the Seame by which they were first conjoin'd. If a Man should impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune me to give a reason why I Lov'd him; I find it could no otherwise be exprest, than by making answer, because it was he, because it was I. There is, beyond I am able to say, I know not what inexplicable and fatal power that brought on this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We sought one another long before we met, and by the Characters we heard of one another, which wrought more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Affections, than in reason, meer reports should do, I think by some secret appointment of Heaven, we embra'd in our Names; and at our first meeting, which was accidentally at a great City entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we found our selves so mutually
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53645:174"/>
taken with one another, so acquainted, and so endear'd betwixt our selves, that from thenceforward nothing was so near to us as one another. He writ an excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Satyr, which I since Printed, wherein he excuses the precipitation of our intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, so suddenly came to perfection, saying, that being to have so short conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, as being begun so late, (for we were both full grown Men, and he some Years the older,) there was no time to lose; nor was ti'd to conform it self to the example of those slow and regular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, that require so many precautions of a long praeliminary Conversation. This has no other Idea, than that of its self: this is no one particular consideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand; 'tis I know not what quintessence of all this mixture, which, seizing my whole Will, carried it to plunge and lose it self in his, and that having seiz'd his whole Will; brought it back with equal concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and appetite, to plunge and lose it self in mine. I may truly say, lose, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving nothing to our selves, that was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his or mine. When <hi>Laelius,</hi> in the presence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls, (who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had sentenc'd <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> prosecuted all those who had had any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him also,) came to ask <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Blosius,</hi> (who was his chiefest Friend
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53645:175"/>
and Confident,) how much he would have done for him? And that he made Answer, All things. How! All things! said <hi>Laelius,</hi> And what if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to Fire our Temples? He would never have commanded me that, repli'd <hi>Blosius.</hi> But what if he had? said <hi>Laelius</hi>; Why, if he had, I would have Obey'd him, said the other. If he was so perfect a Friend to <hi>Gracchus,</hi> as the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries report him to have been, there was yet no necessity of offending the Consuls by such a bold confession, though he might still have retain'd the assurance he had of <hi>Gracchus</hi> his disposition. However, those who accuse this Answer as Seditious, do not well understand the Mystery; nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose, as it was true, that he had <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> his Will in his sleeve, both by the power of a Friend, and the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he had of the Man. They were more Friends, than Citizens, and more Friends to one another, than either Friends or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their Country, or than Friends to Ambition and Innovation. Having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely given up themselves to one another, either held absolutely the reins of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Inclination, which also they govern'd by Vertue, and guided by the conduct of Reason, (which also without these, it had not been possible to do,) and therefore <hi>Blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> his Answer was such as it ought to be.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53645:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If either of their Actions flew out of the handle, they were neither (according to my measure of Friendship,) Friends to one another; nor to themselves. As to the rest, this Answer carries no worse sound, than mine would do to one that should ask me, If your Will should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to Kill your Daughter, would you do it? And that I should make An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that I would, for this expresses no consent to such an Act, forasmuch as I do not in the least suspect my own Will, and as little that of such a Friend. 'Tis not in the power of all the Eloquence in the World, to dispossess me of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I have of the intentions and resolutions of mine; nay, no one Action of his, what face soever it might bear, could be presented to me, of which I could not presently, and at first sight, find out the moving cause: Our Souls have drawn so unanimously together, and we have with so mutual a confidence laid open the very bottom of our hearts to one anothers view, that I not only know his as well as my own; but should certainly in any concern of mine, have trusted my interest much more willingly with him, than with my self. Let no one therefore rank other common Friendships with such a one as this. I have had as much experience of these, as another, and of the most perfect
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53645:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their kind: but I do not advise, that any should confound the Rules of the one, and the other, for they would then find themselves much deceiv'd. In those other ordinary Friendships, you are to walk with a Bridle in your hand, with Prudence and Circumspection, for in them the Knot is not so sure, that a Man may not half sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it will slip: Love him (said <hi>Chilo</hi>) so, as if you were one Day to Hate him; and Hate him so, as you were one Day to Love him. A Precept, that though abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the Soveraign, and perfect Friendship which I intend, is nevertheless very sound, as to the practice of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ones, now in fashion, and to which the saying that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had so frequent in his Mouth, <hi>O my Friends, there is no Friend</hi>; may very fitly be apply'd. And this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Commerce of good Offices, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents and Benefits, by which other Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships are supported and maintain'd, do not deserve so much as to be mention'd here; and is, by this concurrence and consent of Wills, totally taken away, and rendred of no use; as the kindness I have for my self, receives no increase, for any thing I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my self withal in time of need, (whatever the Stoicks say,) and as I do not find my self oblig'd to my self, for any Service I do my self: So the Union of such Friends, being really perfect, deprives
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53645:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them of all acknowledgment of such Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and makes them loath and banish from their Conversation, these words of Division, and Distinction, Benefit, Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Acknowledgment, Entreaty, Thanks, and the like: All Things, Wills, Thoughts, Opinions, Goods, Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Honours and Lives, being in effect, common betwixt them, and that absolute concurrence of Affections being no other than one Soul in two Bodies, (according to that very proper definition of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) they can neither lend, nor give any thing to one another. This is the reason why the Law-givers, to honour Marriage with some imaginary resemblance of this divine Alliance, interdict all gifts betwixt Man and Wife; inferring by that, that all should belong to each of them, and that they have nothing to divide; or to give. If, in the Friendship of which I speak, one could give to the other, the receiver of the Benefit would be the Man that oblig'd his Friend; for each of them contending, and above all things, studying how to be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to one another, he that administers the occasion, is the liberal Man, in giving his Friend the satisfaction of doing that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, which above all things he does most desire. When the Philosopher <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> wanted Mony, he used to say, That he redemanded it of his Friends, not that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53645:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he demanded it; and to let you see the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual practice of this, I will here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an ancient and a rare example; <hi>Euda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midas</hi> a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> had two Friends, <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rixenus</hi> a <hi>Sycionian,</hi> and <hi>Aretheus</hi> a <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>: this Man coming to Die, being Poor, and his two Friends Rich, he made his Will after this manner; I Bequeath to <hi>Aretheus</hi> the Maintenance of my Mother, to support and provide for her in her Old Age; and to <hi>Charixenus</hi> I Bequeath the care of Marrying my Daughter, and to give her as good a Portion as he is able; and in case that one of these chance to Die, I hereby substitute the Surviver in his place. They who first saw this Will, made themselves very merry at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: but the Executors being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, accepted the Legacies with very great content; and one of them, <hi>Charixenus,</hi> Dying within five Days after, and <hi>Aretheus</hi> by that means having the charge of both devolved solely to him: He nourisht that Old Woman with very great care and tenderness, and of five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he had in Estate, he gave two and a half in Marriage with an only Daughter he had of his own, and two and a half in Marriage with the Daughter of <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> and in one and the same Day solemnized both their Nuptials. This Example is very full, if one thing were not to be objected,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53645:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
namely, the multitude of Friends: For the perfect Friendship I speak of, is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, every one gives himself so entirely to his Friend, that he has nothing left to distribute to others: But on the contrary, is sorry, that he is not double, treble, or quadruple, and that he has not many Souls, and many Wills, to confer them all upon this one subject. Common Friendships will admit of division, one may Love the Beauty of this, the good Humour of that Person, the Liberty of a third, the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Affection of a fourth, the Fraternal Love of a fifth, and so of the rest: But this Friendship that possesses the whole Soul, and there rules and sways with an absolute Soveraignty, can possibly admit of no Rival. If two at the same time should call to you for succour, to which of them would you run? Should they require of you contrary Offices; how could you serve them both? Should one commit a thing to your Secretary, that it were of importance to the other to know, how would you disingage your self? A singular and particular Friendship disunites and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves all other Obligations whatsoever. The secret I have sworn not to reveal to any other, I may without Perjury commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him who is not another, but my self. 'Tis Miracle enough certainly, for a Man to double himself, and those that talk
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53645:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of tripling, talk they know not of what. Nothing is extream, that has its like; and who shall presuppose, that of two, I Love one as much as the other, that they Love one another too, and Love me as much as I Love them, does multiply in Friendship, the most single and united of all things, and wherein moreover, one alone, is the hardest thing in the World to find. The remaining part of this story suits very well with what I said before; for <hi>Eudamidas</hi> as a Bounty and Favour, Bequeaths to his Friends a Legacy of employing themselves in his necessity; he leaves them Heirs to this liberality of his, which consists, in giving them the opportunity of conferring a benefit upon him; and doubtless, the force of Friendship is more eminently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this act of his, than in that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retheus.</hi> In short, these are effects not to be imagin'd nor comprehended by such as have not experience of them, and which makes me infinitely honour and admire the Answer of that young Souldier to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by whom being askt how much he would take for a Horse, with which he had won the prize of a Course, and whether he would exchange him for a Kingdom? No, truly Sir, said he, but I would give him with all my heart, to find a true Friend, could I find out any Man worthy of that relation. He did not say ill in saying,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53645:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could I find: for though a Man may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every where meet with Men suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently qualified for a superficial acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet in this, where a Man is to deal from the very bottom of his heart, without any manner of reservation, it will be requisite, that all the Wards and Springs be neatly and truly wrought, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sure. In Leagues that hold but by one end, we are only to provide against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, that particularly concern that end. It can be of no importance to me, of what Religion my Physician or my Lawyer is, provided the one be a good Lawyer, and the other a good Physician; this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hath nothing in common with the Offices of Friendship; and I am of the same indifferency in the domestick acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, my Servants must necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with me; I never enquire, when I am to take a Footman, if he be Chaste, but if he be Diligent; and am not solicitous, if my Chairman be given to Gaming, as if he be Strong &amp; Able; or if my Cook be a Swearer, or a good Cook. I do not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever take upon me to direct what other Men should do in the Government of their Families, there are enow that meddle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with that: but only give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my method in my own.</p>

I make no question, but that he himself believ'd what
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53645:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he writ, being so Consciencious that way, that he would not so much as lie in jest: and do moreover know, that could it have been in his own Choice, he had rather have been Born at</hi> Venice, <hi>than at</hi> Soarlac, <hi>and he had reason: But he had another Maxime Soveraignly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his Soul, very Religiously to Obey, and submit to the Laws under which he was Born. There never was a better Citizen, more affectionate to his Country; nor a greater Enemy to all the Commotions and Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his time: So that he would doubtless much rather have employ'd his Talent to the extinguishing of those Civil Flames, than have added any Fewel to them: For he had a Mind fashion'd to the Model of better Ages.

And be not Jealous, that you have but the remainder of what I Publisht some Years since, under the Name of <hi>Monsieur de Foix,</hi> your brave Kinsman; for certainly these have something in them more spritely, and luxuriant, as being Writ in a greener Youth, and enflam'd with the Noble Ardour that I will tell your Ladyship in your Ear. The other were Writ since, when he was a Suitor in the honour of his Wife, already relishing of I know not what Matrimonial Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And for my part, I am of the same opinion with those, who hold, that Poesie appears no where so Gay, as in a wanton and irregular Subject.</p>

                     <p>This is a subtle consideration in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. A Man may both be too much in Love with Vertue, and be excessive in a just Action.

little more advanc't than the rest of his Squadron, do appear to me so just as strange; and I should neither advise, nor like to follow so Savage a Vertue, and that costs so dear. The Archer that shoots over, misses as well as he that falls short, and 'tis equally troublesome to my sight, to look up at a great Light, and to look down into a dark Abyss. <hi>Callicles</hi> in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> says, That the extremity of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is hurtful, and advises not to dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it beyond the limits of Profit: that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken moderately, it is pleasant and useful: but that in the end, it renders a Man Brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and Vicious: A Contemner of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the common Laws, an Enemy to Civil Conversation, and all Humane Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, incapable of all Publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, unfit either to assist others, or to relieve himself, and a fit Object for all sorts of Injuries and Affronts, without remedy, or satisfaction: He says true; for in its Excess, it enslaves our Natural Freedom, and by an impertinent subtilty, leads us out of the fair and beaten way that Nature has plain'd out for us. The Love we bear to our Wives is very lawful, and yet The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology thinks fit to curb and restrain it. As I remember, I have read in one place of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin,</hi> where he condemns Marriages within any of the forbidden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, for this reason, amongst others, that
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53645:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is some danger, lest the Friendship a Man bears to such a Woman, should be immoderate; for if the Conjugal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be full and perfect betwixt them, as it ought to be, and that it be over and above surcharg'd with that of Kindred too, there is no doubt, but such an addition will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Husband beyond the bounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Those Sciences that regulate the manners of Men, Divinity and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, will have a saying to every thing. There is no Action so private that can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape their Inspection and Jurisdiction, but they are best taught, who are best able to censure and curb their own Liberty. 'Tis the Women that expose their Nudities o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver freely upon the account of Pleasure, though in the Necessities of Physick and Chyrurgery, they are more shy, and more reserv'd. I will therefore in their behalf teach the Husbands, that is, such as are too extravagant and sensual in the exercise of the Matrimonial Duty, this Lesson, that the very Pleasures they enjoy in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Wives, are Reproachable, if immoderate, and that a Licentious and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous abuse of them, are Faults<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable here, as illegitimate and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Practices. Those Immodest and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Tricks and Postures, that the first Ardour suggests to us in this Affair, are not only indecently, but inconveniently
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53645:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
practis'd upon our Wives. Let them at least learn Impudency from another hand; they are always ready enough for our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and I for my part always went the plain way to work. Marriage is a Solemn and Religious Tie, and therefore the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure we extract from thence, should be a sober and serious delight, and mixt with a certain kind of Gravity; it should be a kind of discreet and conscientious pleasure. And being that the chief end of it is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, some make a Question, whether when Men are out of hopes of that fruit, as when they are superannuated, or alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with Child, it be lawful to lie with our Wives. 'Tis Homicide, according to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and certain Nations, (the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> amongst others,) Abominate all Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with Women with Child, and others also, with those who are Unclean. <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> would never admit her Husband for more than one Encounter, after which, she left him to his own swing for the whole time of her Conception, and not, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, would any more receive him: A brave Example of Conjugal Continency. It was doubtless from some Lascivious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and one that himself was in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress for a little of this sport, that <hi>Plato</hi> borrowed this Story; that <hi>Jupiter</hi> was one Day so hot upon his Wife, that not having so much patience, as till she could get to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53645:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Couch, he threw her upon the Floor, where the vehemency of pleasure made him forget the great and important Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions he had but newly taken with the rest of the Gods, in his Celestial Council; and to brag, that he had had as good a Bout, as when he got her Maidenhead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to their Parents. The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> were wont to invite their Wives to the beginning of their Festivals; but when the Wine began to work in good earnest, and that they were to give the Reins to pleasure, they sent them back to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Appartments, that they might not participate of their immoderate Lust, send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for other Women in their stead, with whom they were not oblig'd to so great a decorum of respect. All Pleasures, and all sorts of Gratifications, are not properly and fitly conferr'd upon all sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had Committed a young Man for certain Debauches; for whom <hi>Pelopidas</hi> mediated, that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest he might be set at liberty, which notwithstanding the great intelligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> resolutely deny'd to him, but granted it at the first word to a Wench of his, that made the same inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; saying, that it was a Gratification fit for such a one as she, but not for a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Sophocles</hi> being joint Praetor with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> seeing accidentally a fine Boy pass
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53645:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by: O what a delicate Boy is that, said he; I, that were a Prize, answered <hi>Pericles,</hi> for any other, than a Praetor, who ought not only to have his Hands, but his Eyes Chaste too. <hi>Elius Verus</hi> the Emperour, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Wife, who Reproach'd him with his Love to other Women, that he did it upon a Conscientious account, forasmuch as Marriage was a Name of Honour, and Dignity, not of Wanton and Lascivious Desire. And our Ecclesiastical History pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Memory of that Woman in great Veneration, who parted from her Husband, because she would not comply with his indecent and inordinate Desire. In fine, there is no so just and lawful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, wherein the Intemperance and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, is not to be Condemn'd. But, to speak the truth, is not Man a most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature the while? It is scarce, by his Natural Condition, in his power to taste one Pleasure pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to Curtal that little he has; he is not yet Wretched enough, unless by Art and Study, he Augment his own Misery.</p>

Had I rul'd the Roast, I should have taken another, and more natural course, which, to say the truth, is both Commodious and Sacred, and should peradventure have been able to have limited it too. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that both our Spiritual and Corporal Physicians, as by compact betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, can find no other way to cure, nor other Remedy for the Infirmities of the Body, and the Soul, than what is oft times worse than the Disease, by torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us more, and by adding to our Misery and Pain. To this end, Watchings, Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Hair-shirts, remote and solitary Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, perpetual Imprisonments, Whips, and other Afflictions, have been introduc'd amongst Men: But so, that they should carry a sting with them, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Afflictions indeed; and not fall out so, as it once did to one <hi>Gallio,</hi> who having been sent an Exile into the Isle of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> news was not long after brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he there Liv'd as Merry, as the Day was long; and that what had been enjoin'd him for a Penance, turn'd to his greatest
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53645:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pleasure and Satisfaction: Whereupon the Senate thought fit to recall him home to his Wife and Family, and confine him to his own House, to accommodate their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to his feeling and apprehension. For to him whom Fasting would make more Healthful and more Spritely, and to him to whose Pallat Fish were more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable than Flesh, it would be no proper, nor sanative Receipt; no more than in the other sort of Physick, where the Drugs have no effect upon him who swallows them with Appetite and Pleasure. The Bitterness of the Potion, and the Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the Patient, are necessary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances to the Operation.

This Belief a little resembles that other so Ancient one, of thinking to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Gods and Nature, by Self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; an Opinion universally once receiv'd in all Religions, and to this Day retain'd in some.

a propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the Deceased. And in those new Countries discover'd in this Age of ours, which are pure, and Virgins yet, in comparison of ours, this practice is in some measure every where receiv'd.

Neither are we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Examples of Constancy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, in this Affair: The poor Souls that are to be Sacrific'd, Old Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, going some Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to beg Alms for the Offering of their Sacrifice, and so Singing and Dancing, present themselves to the Slaughter. The Ambassadors of the King of <hi>Mexico,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to <hi>Fernando Cortez</hi> the Power and Greatness of their Master, after having told him, that he had Thirty Vassals, of which, each was able to Raise an Hundred Thousand Fighting Men, and that he kept his Court in the fairest and best Fortified City under the Sun, added at last, that he was oblig'd Yearly to offer to the Gods Fifty Thousand Men. And it is confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm'd, that he maintain'd a continual War, with some Potent Neighbouring
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53645:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nations, not only to keep the Young Men in Exercise, but principally, to have wherewithal to furnish his Sacrifices with his Prisoners of War. At a certain Town in another place, for the welcome of the said <hi>Cortez,</hi> they Sacrificed Fifty Men at once. I will tell you this one Tale more, and I have done; Some of these People being Beaten by him, sent to Complement him, and to Treat with him of a Peace, whose Messengers carried him Three sorts of Presents, which they presented in these terms: Behold, Lord, here are Five Slaves, if thou beest a Furious God that feedeth upon Flesh and Blood, eat these, and we will bring thee more; if thou beest an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable God, behold here Incence and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but if thou beest a Man, take these Fowls and these Fruits, that we have brought thee.</p>

not, said he, what kind of <hi>Barbarians</hi> (for so the <hi>Greeks</hi> call'd all other Nations) these may be; but the Discipline of this Army that I see, has nothing of Barbarity in it. As much said the <hi>Greeks</hi> of that <hi>Flaminius</hi> brought into their Country; and <hi>Philip</hi> beholding from an Eminence, the Order and the distribution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, led into his Kingdom by <hi>Publius Sulpicius Galba,</hi> spake to the same effect. By which it appears, how Cautious Men ought to be, of taking things upon trust from Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Opinion, and that we are to judg by the Eye of Reason, and not from common report. I have long had a Man in my House, that Liv'd Ten or Twelve Years in the new World, discover'd in these lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days, and in that part of it where <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legaignon</hi> Landed, which he call'd Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>France.</hi> This Discovery of so vast a Country seems to be of very great Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and we are not sure, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after there may not be another, so many wiser Men than we have been deceiv'd in this. I am afraid our Eyes are bigger than our Bellies, and that we have more Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity than Capacity: for we grasp at all, but catch nothing but Air. <hi>Plato</hi> brings in <hi>Solon,</hi> telling a Story, that he had heard from the Priests of <hi>Sais</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of Old, and before the Deluge, there was a great Island call'd <hi>Atlantis,</hi> scituate direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53645:188"/>
at the Mouth of the Streight of <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which contain'd more Ground, than both <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> put together; and that the Kings of that Country, who not only possest that Isle, but extended their Dominion so far into the Continent, that they had a Country as large as <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and as long as <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Tuscany,</hi> attempted to Encroach even upon <hi>Asia,</hi> and to subjugate all the Nations that Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the Mediterranian Sea, as far as the Gulf of <hi>Mare Maggiore</hi>; and to that effect, over-ran all <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> so far, as to penetrate into <hi>Greece,</hi> where the <hi>Athenians</hi> stopt the Torrent of their Arms: but sometimes after, both the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they, and their Island, were swallowed by the Flood.</p>
                     <p>It is very likely, that this Violent Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inundation of Water, made a wonderful Change, and strange Alteration, in the Habitations of the Earth: As 'tis said, that the Sea then divided <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy:</hi>

But there is no great appearance, that this Isle was this new World so lately disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd: for that almost toucht upon <hi>Spain,</hi> and it were an incredible effect of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, to have tumbled so prodigious a Mass, above Twelve Hundred Leagues: Besides, that our Modern Navigators have already almost discover'd it to be no Island, but firm Land, and Continent, with the <hi>East-Indies</hi> on the one side, and with the Lands under the two Poles on two others; or if it be separate from them, 'tis by so narrow a Streight, and so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a Channel, that it never the more deserves the Name of an Island for that. It should seem, that in this great Body, there are two sorts of Motions, the one Natural, and the other Febrifick, as there are in ours. When I consider the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that our River of <hi>Dordoigne</hi> has made
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53645:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in my time, on the right Bank of its des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and that in Twenty Years it has gain'd so much, and undermin'd the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of so many Houses, I perceive it to be an extraordinary Agitation: for had it always follow'd this Course, or were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to do it, the prospect of the World would be totally chang'd. But Rivers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Course, sometimes beating against the one side, and sometimes the other, and sometimes quietly keeping the Channel. I do not speak of sudden Inundations, the causes of which every Body understands. In <hi>Medoc,</hi> by the Sea-shore, the <hi>Sieur d' Arsac</hi> my Brother, sees an Estate, he had there, Buried under the Sands which the Sea Vomits before it: where the tops of some Houses are yet to be seen, and where his Rents and Revenues are converted into pitiful Barren Pasturage. The Inhabitants of which place affirm, That of late Years the Sea has driven so vehemently upon them, that they have lost above Four Leagues of Land. These Sands are her Harbingers. And we now see great heaps of moving Sand, that march half a League before her.</p>
                     <p>The other Testimony from Antiquity, to which some would apply this discovery of the new World, is in <hi>Aristotle</hi>; at least, if that little Book of unheard of Miracles be his. He there tells us, That certain <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:53645:190"/>
having crost the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Streight of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and Sailed a very long time, discover'd at last, a great and fruitful Island, all cover'd over with Wood, and Water'd with several broad and deep Rivers; far remote from all firm Land, and that they, and others after them, allur'd by the gratitude and fertility of the Soil, went thither with their Wives and Children, and began to Plant a Colony: But the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> visibly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their People by little and little, to grow thin, Issu'd out an express Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That no one, upon pain of Death, should Transport themselves thither; and also drove out these new Inhabitants; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis said, lest in process of time, they should so multiply, as to supplant them themselves, and Ruine their State: But this Relation of <hi>Aristotles,</hi> does no more agree with our new found Lands, than the other. This Man that I have is a plain ignorant Fellow, and therefore the more likely to tell Truth: For your better bred sort of Men, are much more Curious in their Observation, 'tis true, and discover a great deal more, but then they gloss upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they deliver, and allure your Belief, they cannot forbear a little to alter the Story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but rather as they appear'd to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53645:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, or as they would have them appear to you, and to gain the reputation of Men of Judgment, and the better to induce your Faith, are willing to help out the Business with something more than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally true, of their own Invention. Now in this Case, we should either have a Man of Irreproachable Veracity; or so Simple, that he has not wherewithal to Contrive, and to give a Colour of Truth to False Relations, and that can have no Ends in Forging an Untruth. Such a one is mine; and besides, the little suspicion the Man lies under, he has divers times shew'd me several Sea-men, and Merchants, that at the same time went the same Voyage. I shall therefore content my self with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, without enquiring what the Cosmographers say to the Business. We should have Maps to trace out to us the particular places where they have been; but for having had this advantage over us, to have seen the Holy Land, they would have the priviledg forsooth, to tell us Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all the other parts of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. I would have every one Write what he knows, and as much as he knows, but no more; and that not in this only, but in all other Subjects: For such a Person may have some particular Knowledg and Experience of the nature of such a River; or such a Fountain; that as to other
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:53645:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things, knows no more, than what every Body does, and yet to keep a clutter with this little Pittance of his, will undertake to Write the whole Body of Physicks: A Vice from whence great Inconveniences derive their Original.</p>
                     <p>Now, to return to my Subject, I find, that there is nothing Barbarous and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage in this Nation, by any thing that I can gather, excepting, That every one gives the Title of Barbarity to every thing that is not in use in his own Country: As indeed we have no other level of Truth and Reason, than the Example and Idea of the Opinions and Customs of the place wherein we Live. There is always the true Religion, there the perfect Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the most exact and accomplish'd Usance of all things. They are Savages at the same rate, that we say Fruits are wild, which Nature produces of her self, and by her own ordinary progress; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth, we ought rather to call those wild, whose Natures we have chang'd by our Artifice, and diverted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Order. In those, the Genuine, most useful and natural Vertues and Properties, are Vigorous and Spritely, which we have help'd to Degenerate in these, by accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating them to the pleasure of our own Corrupted Palate. And yet for all this, our Taste confesses a flavor and delicacy,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53645:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
excellent even to Emulation of the best of ours, in several Fruits those Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with, without Art or Culture; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it reasonable, that Art should gain the Preheminence of our great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Mother Nature. We have so express'd her with the additional Ornaments and Graces, we have added to the Beauty and Riches of her own Works, by our Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we have almost Smother'd and Choak'd her; and yet in other places, where she shines in her own purity, and proper lustre, she strangely baffles and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces all our vain and frivolous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53645:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fortune, or by Art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one, or the other of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the last. These Nations then seem to me to be so far Barbarous; as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd but very little form and fashion from Art and Humane Invention, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, not much remote from their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Simplicity. The Laws of Nature however govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with any mixture of ours: But in such Purity, that I am sometimes troubled we were no sooner acquainted with these People, and that they were not discovered in those better times, when there were Men much more able to judg of them, than we are. I am sorry that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had no knowledg of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in those Natives, does not only surpass all the Images with which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets have adorn'd the Golden Age, and all their Inventions in feigning a Happy Estate of Man; but moreover, the Fancy, and even the Wish and Desire of Philosophy it self; so Native, and so pure a Simplicity, as we by Experience see to be in them, could never enter into their Imagination, nor could they ever believe that Humane Society could have been maintained with so little Artifice; should I tell <hi>Plato,</hi> that it is a Nation wherein there is no manner
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53645:192"/>
of Traffick, no knowledg of Letters, no science of Numbers, no name of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, nor Politick Superiority; no use of Service, Riches or Poverty, no Contracts, no Successions, no Dividents, no Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no Employments, but those of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, no respect of Kindred, but common, no Cloathing, no Agriculture, no Mettal, no use of Corn or Wine, and where so much as the very words that signifie, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Treachery, Dissimulation, Avarice, Envy, Detraction and Pardon, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of: How much would he find his Imaginary Republick short of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>

The scituation of their Country is all along by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and enclos'd on the other side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Land, with great and high Mountains, having about a Hundred
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53645:193"/>
Leagues in breadth between.. They have great store of Fish and Flesh, that have no resemblance to those of ours: which they Eat without any other Cookery, than plain Boiling, Roasting, and Broiling. The first that carried a Horse thither, though in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Voyages he had contracted an acquaintance and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a Fright, that they Kill'd him with their Arrows before they could come to discover who he was. Their Buildings are very long, and of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to hold Two or Three Hundred People, made of the Barks of tall Trees, rear'd with one end upon the ground, and leaning to, and supporting one another, at the top, like some of our Barns, of which, the Covering hangs down to the very ground, and serves for the side Walls. They have Wood so hard, that they cleave it into Swords, and make Grills of it to Broil their Meat. Their Beds are of Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, hung swinging in the Roof, like our Seamens Hammocks, for every one one, for the Wives lie apart from their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. They rise with the Sun, and so soon as they are up, Eat for all Day, for they have no more Meals but that: They do not then Drink, (as <hi>Suidas</hi> reports of some other People of the <hi>East,</hi> that never Drinks at their Meals,) but Drink very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all Day after, and sometimes to a rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53645:193"/>
pitch. Their Drink is made of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Root, and is of the Colour of our Claret; which they never Drink but Luke-warm. It will keep above two or three Days, has a quick Taste, is nothing Heady, but very comfortable to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, loosning to Strangers, and a very pleasant Beverage to such as are us'd to it. They make use, instead of Bread, of a certain White Matter, like <hi>Coriander</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; I have tasted of it, the taste is sweet, and a little flat. All the whole Day is spent in Dancing. Their Young Men go a Hunting after Wild Beasts with Bows and Arrows, and one part of their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are employ'd in preparing their Drink the while, which is their chief Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are some of their Old Men, who in the Morning before they fall to Eating, Preach to the whole Family, as they walk to and again from the one end of the House to the other, several times repeating the same Sentence, till they have finish'd their turn, (for their Houses are at least a Hundred Yards long,) Valour towards their Enemies, and Love towards their Wives, being the two heads of his Discourse, never failing in the close, to put them in mind, that they have so much the greater obligation to it, because they provide them their Drink warm, and well order'd. The fashion of their Beds, Ropes,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53645:194"/>
Swords, and Wooden Bracelets, they tie about their Wrists, when they go to Fight, and great Canes, boar'd hollow at one end, by the Sound of which they keep the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their Dances, are to be seen in several places, and amongst others, at my House. They shave all their hairy parts, and much more neatly than we, without other Razor, than one of Wood, or of Stone. They believe the Immortality of the Soul, and that those who have Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well of the Gods, are Lodg'd in that part of Heaven where the Sun rises; and the Accursed in the West. They have I know not what kind of Priests, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that very rarely present themselves to the People, having their abode in the Mountains. At their arrival there is a great Feast, and solemn Assembly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Villages made: that is, all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Families, for every House, as I have describ'd it, makes a Village, and are about a <hi>French</hi> League distant from one another. This Prophet declaims to them in publick, exhorting them to Vertue, and their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But all their Ethicks are terminated in these two Articles, of Resolution in War, and Affection to their Wives. This also Prophesies to them Events to come, and the Issues they are to expect from their Enterprizes, prompts them to, or diverts them from War: But let him look to't;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53645:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for if he fail in his Divination, and any thing happen otherwise, than he has fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, he is cut into a thousand pieces, if he be caught, and Condemn'd for a false Prophet; and for that reason, if any of them finds himself mistaken, he is no more to be heard of. Divination is a gift of God, and therefore to abuse it, ought to be a Punishable Imposture. Amongst the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> where their Diviners fail'd in the promis'd effect, they were laid, Bound Hand and Foot, upon Carts loaden with Furs and Bavins, and drawn with Oxen, on which they were Burnt to Death. Such as only meddle with things subject to the conduct of Humane Capacity, are excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in doing the best they can: But those other sort of People that comes to delude us, with assurances of an extraordinary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, beyond our understanding: ought they not to be Punish'd, when they do not make good the effect of their Promise, and for the temerity of their Imposture? They have continual War with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that Live further within the main Land, beyond their Mountains, to which they go Naked, and without other Arms, than their Bows, and Wooden-Swords, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion'd at one end like the head of a Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. The Obstinacy of their Battels is wonderful, and never end without great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53645:195"/>
of Blood: For as to running away, they know not what it is. Every one for a Trophy brings home the head of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy he has Kill'd, which he fixes over the Door of his House. After having a long time treated their Prisoners very well, and given them all the Regalia's they can think of, he to whom the Prisoner belongs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites a great Assembly of his Kindred, and Friends, who being come, he ties a Rope to one of the Arms of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, of which, at a distance, out of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the Friend he Loves best, the other Arm to hold after the same manner; which being done, they two in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of all the Assembly, dispatch him with their Swords. After that, they Roast him, Eat him amongst them, and send some Chops to their absent Friends, which nevertheless they do not do, as some think, for Nourishment, as the <hi>Scythians</hi> ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, but as a representation of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Revenge; as will appear by this, That having observ'd the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who were in League with their Enemies, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict another sort of Death upon any of them they took Prisoners: Which was, to set them up to the Girdle in the Earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was stuck full of Arrows, and then to hang them: They that thought those People of the other
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53645:195"/>
World, (as those who had sown the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of a great many Vices amongst their Neighbours, and who were much greater Masters in all sorts of Mischief than they,) did not exercise this sort of Revenge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mystery, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs; and so began to leave their old way, and to follow this. I am not sorry that we should here take notice of the Barbarous Horrour of so Cruel an Action, but that seeing so clearly into their faults, we should be so blind in our own: For I conceive, there is more Barbarity in Eating a Man Alive, than when he is Dead; in tearing a Body Limb from Limb, by Wracks and Torments, that is yet in perfect Sense, in Roasting it by degrees, causing it to be bit and worri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dogs and Swine, (as we have not only read, but lately seen; not amongst inveterate and mortal Enemies, but Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and fellow Citizens, and which is worse, under colour of Piety and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) than to Roast, and Eat him after he is Dead. <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> and <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Two Heads of the Stoical Sect, were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That there was no hurt in making use of our Dead Carcasses, in what kind soever, for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too; as our Ancestors, who being Besieged by <hi>Caesar</hi> in the City <hi>Alexia,</hi> resolv'd to sustain the Famine of the Siege,

We may then call these People Barbarous, in respect to the Rules of Reason: but not in respect to our selves; who in all sorts of Barbarity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them. Their Wars are throughout Noble and Generous, and carry as much Excuse and fair Pretence, as their Humane Disease is capable of; having with them no other foundation, than the sole Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Vertue. Their Disputes are not for the Conquest of new Lands, those they already possess, being so fruitful by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to supply them without Labour or Concern, with all things necessary, in such abundance, that they have no need
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53645:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to enlarge their Borders. And they are moreover happy in this, that they only covet so much as their natural necessities require: all beyond that, is superfluous to them: Men of the same Age generally call one another Brothers, those who are younger, Sons and Daughters, and the old Men are Fathers to all. These leave to their Heirs in common this full possession of Goods, without any manner of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other Title, than what Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows upon her Creatures, in bringing them into the World. If their Neigbours pass over the Mountains, and come to assault them, and obtain a Victory, all the Victors gain by it is Glory only, and the advantage of having prov'd themselves the better in Valour and Vertue: for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with the Goods of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, but presently return into their own Country, where they have no want of any thing necessary; nor of this greatest of all Goods, to know happily how to enjoy their Condition, and to be Content. And these in turn do the same. They demand of their Prisoners no other Ransome, than acknowledgment that they are overcome: but there is not one found in an Age, who will not rather choose to Die, than make such a Confession, or either by Word or Look, recede from the entire Grandeur of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage.

them, who had not rather be Kill'd and Eaten, than so much as to open his Mouth to entreat he may not. They use them with all Liberality and Freedom, to the end their Lives may be so much the dearer to them; but frequently entertain them withal with Menaces of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, of the Torments they are to suffer, of the preparations are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in order to it, of the mangling their Limbs, and of the Feast is to be made, where their Carcasses is to be the only Dish. All which they do, to no other end, but only to extort some gentle or submissive word from them, or to Fright them so as to make them run away; to obtain this advantage, that they were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and that their Constancy was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and indeed, if rightly taken, it is in this point only, that a true Victory does consist.</p>

them go without Injury, or Ransome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, at the most, to make them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their word, never to bear Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them again.

Who could have found out a more subtle Invention to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his safety, than he did to assure his Ruine: He was set to defend a certain Pass of <hi>Peloponesus</hi> against the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> which, considering the nature of the place, and the inequality of Forces, finding it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impossible for him to do, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that all who were presented to the Enemy, must certainly be left upon the place; and on the other side, reputing it unworthy of his own Vertue, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> name to fail in any part of his Duty, he chose a mean betwixt these two Extreams, after this manner; The Youngest and most Active of his Men, he would preserve for the Service and Defence of their Country, and therefore sent them back; and with the rest, whose loss would be of less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, he resolv'd to make good the Pass, and with the death of them, to make the Enemy Buy their Entry as dear as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he could: as it also fell out, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53645:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
presently Environ'd on all sides by the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> after having made a great Slaughter of the Enemy, he, and his, were all cut in pieces. Is there any Trophy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Conquerours, which is not much more due to these who were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The part that true Conquering is to play, lies in the Encounter, not in the coming off; and the Honour of Vertue consists in Fighting, not in Subduing.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my Story, these Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are so far from discovering the least Weakness, for all the Terrors can be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them, that, on the contrary, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the two or three Months, that they are kept, they always appear with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance; importune their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to make haste to bring them to the Test, Defie, Rail at them, and Reproach them with Cowardize, and the number of Battels they have lost against those of their Country. I have a Song made by one of these Prisoners, wherein he bids them <hi>come all, and Dine upon him, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, for they shall withal Eat their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Grandfathers, whose Flesh has serv'd to feed and nourish him. These Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> says he, <hi>this Flesh, and these Veins, are your own: Poor silly Souls as you are, you little think that the substance of your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors Limbs is here yet: but mind as you Eat, and you will find in it the Taste of your
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53645:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own Flesh</hi>: In which Song there is to be observ'd, an Invention that does nothing relish of the Barbarian. Those that paint these People Dying after this manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Prisoner spitting in the faces of his Executioners, and making at them a wry Mouth. And 'tis most certain, that to the very last gasp, they never cease to Brave and Defie them both in Word and Gesture. In plain truth, these Men are very Savage in comparison of us, and of necessity, they must either be absolutely so, or else we are Savager; for there is a vast difference betwixt their Manners, and ours.</p>
                     <p>The Men there have several Wives, and so much the greater number, by how much they have the greater Reputation and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and it is one very remarkable Vertue their Women have, that the same Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our Wives have to hinder and divert us from the Friendship and Familiarity of other Women, those employ to promote their Husbands Desires, and to procure them many Spouses; for being above all things sollicitous of their Husbands Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, 'tis their chiefest care to seek out, and to bring in the most Companions they can, forasmuch as it is a Testimony of their Husbands Vertue. I know most of ours will cry out, that 'tis Monstrous; whereas in truth, it is not so; but a truly
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53645:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Matrimonical Vertue; though of the highest form. In the Bible, <hi>Sarah, Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> gave the most Beautiful of their Maids to their Husbands, <hi>Livia</hi> preferred the Passion of <hi>Augustus</hi> to her own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and the Wife of King <hi>Dejotarus</hi> of <hi>Stratonica,</hi> did not only give up a fair young Maid, that serv'd her, to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the Children he had by her, and assisted them in the Succession to their Fathers Crown. And that it may not be suppos'd, that all this is done by a simple and servile Observation to their common Practice, or by any Authoritative Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of their Ancient Custom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgment, or Examination; and for having a Soul so stupid, that it cannot contrive what else to do, I must here give you some touches of their sufficiency, in point of Understanding; besides what I repeated to you before, which was one of their Songs of War, I have another, and a Love-Song, that begins thus; <hi>Stay Adder stay, that by thy Pattern my Sister may draw the Fashion, and work of a Noble Wreath, that I may present to my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, by which means thy Beauty, and the excellent Order of thy Scales shall for ever be preferr'd before all other Serpents.</hi> Wherein the first Couplet, <hi>Stay Adder, &amp;c.</hi> makes the Burthen of the Song. Now

I have converst enough with Poetry to judg thus much: that not only, there is nothing of Barbarous in this Invention: But moreover, that it is perfectly <hi>Anacre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontick</hi>: to which their Language is soft, of a pleasing Accent, and something bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Terminations. Three of these People, not foreseeing how dear their knowledg of the Corruptions of this part of the World, would one Day cost their Happiness and Repose, and that the effect of this Commerce would be their Ruine, as I presuppose it is in a very fair way, (Miserable Men to suffer themselves to be deluded with desire of Novelty, and to have left the Serenity of their own Heaven, to come so far to gaze at ours,) came to <hi>Roane,</hi> at the time that the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth was there: where the King himself talk'd to them a good while, and they were made to see our Fashions, our Pomp, and the form of a great City; after which, some one ask'd their opinion, and would know of them, what of all the things they had seen, they found most to be admired? To which they made Answer, Three things, of which I have forgot the Third, and am troubled at it; but Two I yet remember. They said, that in the first place they thought it very strange, that so many tall Men wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beards, strong, and well Arm'd, who
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53645:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were about the King, ('tis like they meant the <hi>Swiss</hi> of the Guard,) should submit to Obey a Child, and that they did not choose out one amongst themselves to Command: Secondly, (they have a way of speaking in their Language, to call Men the half of one another,) that they had Observ'd, that there were amongst us, Men full, and cramm'd with all manner of Conveniences, whilst in the mean time, their halves were Begging at their Doors, Lean, and half starv'd with Hunger and Poverty; and thought it strange, that these Necessitous halves, were able to suffer so great an Inequality and Injustice, and that they did not take the others by the Throats, or set Fire to their Houses. I talk'd to one of them a great while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I had so ill an Interpreter, and that was so perplex'd by his own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to apprehend my meaning, that I could get nothing out of him, of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Asking him, what advantage he reapt from the Superiority he had amongst his own People? (for he was a Captain, and our Marriners call'd him King,) he told me, to March in the Head of them to War; and demanding of him further, how many Men he had to follow him? He shew'd me a space of Ground, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, as many as could March in such a compass: which might be Four or Five
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53645:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thousand Men; and putting the question to him, whether or no his Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd with the War? He told me this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd; that when he went to Visit the Village of his dependance, they plain'd him Paths through the thick of their Woods, through which he might pass at his ease. All this does not sound very ill, and the last was not much amiss; for they wear no Breeches.</p>

For which reason, says <hi>Plato,</hi> it is much more easie to satisfie the hearers, when speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nature of the Gods, than of the Nature of Men, because the Ignorance of the Auditory affords a fair and large Career, and all manner of Liberty, in
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53645:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the handling of profane and abstruce things; and then it comes to pass, that nothing is so firmly believed, as what we least know; nor any People so confident, as those who entertain us with Fabulous Stories, such as your Alchymists, Judicial Astrologers, Fortune-tellers, and Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Id genus omne</hi>; to which I could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, if I durst, join a sort of People, that take upon them to Interpret and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul the Designs of God himself, making no question of finding out the cause of every Accident, and to pry into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Divine Will, there to discover the Incomprehensible Motives of his Works. And although the variety, and the continual discordance of Events, throw them from Corner to Corner, and toss them from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> yet do they still persist in their vain Inquisition, and with the same Pencil to Paint Black and White. In a Nation of the <hi>Indies,</hi> there is this commendable Custom, that when any thing befalls them amiss in any Rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Battel, they Publickly ask Pardon of the Sun, who is their God, as having committed an unjust Action, always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their Good or Evil Fortune to the Divine Justice, and to that, submitting their own Judgment and Reason. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a Christian to believe, that all things come from God, to receive them
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53645:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with acknowledgment of his divine and instructable Wisdom, and also thankfully to accept and receive them, with what Face soever, they may present themselves: But I do not approve of what I see in use, that is, to seek to continue and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Religion by the Prosperity of our Enterprizes. Our Belief has other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation enough, without going about to Authorize it by Events: For the People accustomed to such Arguments as these, and so proper to their own Taste, it is to be fear'd, lest when they fail of Success, they should also stagger in their Faith: As in the War wherein we are now Engag'd, upon the account of Religion, those who had the better in the Business of <hi>Rochela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beille</hi>; making great Brags of that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, as an infallible approbation of their Cause, when they came afterwards to excuse their Misfortunes of <hi>Jarnac,</hi> and <hi>Moncontour,</hi> 'twas by saying, they were Fatherly Scourges and Corrections; if they have not a People wholely at their Mercy, they make it manifestly enough to appear, what it is to take two sorts of Grist out of the same Sack, and with the same Mouth to blow Hot and Cold. It were better to possess the Vulgar with the solid and real Foundations of Truth. 'Twas a brave Naval-Battel that was gain'd a few Months since, against the <hi>Turks,</hi>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:53645:202" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under the Command of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>; but it has also pleas'd God at other times to let us see as great Victories at our own Expence. In fine, 'tis a hard matter to reduce Divine things to our Ballance, without waste, and losing a great deal of the weight. And who would take upon him to give a reason, that <hi>Arius,</hi> and his Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> the principal Heads of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Heresie, should Die at several times of so like and strange Deaths, (for being withdrawn from the Disputation, by the Griping in the Guts, they both of them suddenly gave up the Ghost upon the Stool,) and would aggravate this Divine Vengeance by the Circumstance of the place; might as well add the Death of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who was also Slain in a House of Office. But what? <hi>Ireneus</hi> was involv'd in the same Fortune; God being pleas'd to shew us, that the Good have something else to hope for; and the Wicked some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to fear, than the Fortunes, or Misfortunes, of this World: He manages, and applies them, according to his own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will and Pleasure, and deprives us of the means, foolishly to make our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And those People both abuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and us, who will pretend to dive into these Mysteries by the strength of Humane Reason.

I am of Opinion, says he, either that thou leave
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53645:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Life, or Life it self; I would indeed advise thee to the gentle way, and to untie, rather than to break, the Knot thou hast undiscreetly Knit, provided, that if it be not otherwise to be unti'd, then resolutely break it. There is no Man so great a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, that had not rather once fall, than to be always falling. I should have found this Counsel conformable enough to the Stoical Roughness: But it appears the more strange, for being borrowed from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus,</hi> who writes the same thing upon the like occasion to <hi>Idomenius.</hi> And I think I have Observ'd something like it, but with Christian Moderation, amongst our own People. St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> that famous Enemy of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Heresie, being in <hi>Syria,</hi> had Intelligence thither sent him, that <hi>Abra</hi> his only Daughter, whom he left at home under the Eye and Tuition of her Mother, was sought in Marriage by the greatest Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Country, as being a Virgin Vertuously brought up, Fair, Rich, and in the Flower of her Age: whereupon he writ to her, (as it appears upon Record,) that she should remove her Affection from all these Pleasures and Advantages were propos'd unto her; for he had in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels found out a much greater and more worthy Fortune for her, a Husband of much greater Power and Magnificence,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53645:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that would present her with Robes, and Jewels of inestimable value; wherein his design was, to dispossess her of the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and use of Worldly Delights, to join her wholely to God: But the nearest and most certain way to this, being, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, the Death of his Daughter; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceas'd, by Vows, Prayers and Orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, to Beg of the Almighty, that he would please to call her out of this World, and to take her to himself; as accordingly it came to pass; for soon after his return, she Died, at which he exprest a singular Joy. This seems to outdo the other, forasmuch as he applys himself to this means at the first sight, which they only take subsidiarily, and besides, it was towards his only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I will not omit the latter end of this Story, though it be from my purpose; St. <hi>Hilaries</hi> Wife having understood from him, how the Death of their Daughter was brought about, by his desires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and how much happier she was, to be remov'd out of this World, than to have stay'd in it: Conceiv'd so Lively an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the Eternal and Heavenly Beatitude, that she Begg'd of her Husband, with the extreamest Importunity, to do as much for her; and God, at their joint Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, shortly after calling her to him, it was a Death embrac'd on both sides, with singular Content.</p>

The Pope being come before his Son, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Drink, the Butler supposing this Wine had not been so strictly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Care, but only upon the account of its Excellency, presented it presently to the Pope, and the Duke himself coming in presently after, and being confident they had not meddled with his Bottle, took also his Cup; so that the Father Died imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the place, and the Son, after having been long tormented with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

Does she not seem to be an Artist here? <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Hellen,</hi> founded the Empire of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and so many Ages after, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Hellen</hi> put an end to it. Sometimes she is pleas'd to Emulate our Miracles. We are told, that King <hi>Clouis</hi> Besieging <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> the Walls fell down of themselves by Divine Favour. And <hi>Bouchet</hi> has it from some Author, that King <hi>Robert</hi> having sat down before a City, and being stole away from the Seige, to go keep the Feast of St. <hi>Aignan</hi> at <hi>Orleans</hi>; as he was in Devotion, at a certain place of the Mass, the Walls of the beleaguered Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without any manner of Violence, fell down with a sudden Ruine. But she did quite contrary in our <hi>Milan</hi> War; for Captain <hi>Rense</hi> laying Seige to the City <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> and having carried a Mine under a great part of the Wall, the Mine being sprung, the Wall was lifted from its base, but dropt down again nevertheless, whole and entire, and so exactly upon its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that the Besieged suffer'd no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience by that Attempt. Sometimes she plays the Physician, <hi>Jason Phereus</hi> being given over by the Physicians, by reason of a desperate Imposthumation in his Breast; having a mind to rid himself of his Pain,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53645:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Death at least, in a Battel, threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self desperately into the thickest of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, where he was so fortunately wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite through the Body, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthume brake, and he was perfectly cur'd. Did she not also excel the Painter <hi>Protogenes</hi> in his Art? Who having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd the Picture of a Dog quite tir'd, and out of breath, in all the other parts excellently well to his own liking, but not being able to express, as he would, the slaver and foam that should come out of his Mouth, vext, and angry at his work, he took his Spunge, which by cleaning his Pencils, had imbib'd several sorts of Colours, and threw it in a rage against the Picture, with an intent utterly to deface it; when Fortune guiding the Spunge to hit just upon the Mouth of the Dog, it there perform'd what all his Art was not able to do. Does she not sometimes direct our Counsels, and correct them? <hi>Isabel</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> being to Sail from <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into her own Kingdom, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in favour of her Son, against her Husband, had been lost, had she come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Port she intended, being there laid wait for by the Enemy; but Fortune, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her will, threw her into another Haven, where she Landed in safety.

Which the other seeing, and concluding himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, and lost, he runs to the Altar, and begs for Mercy, promising to discover the whole truth, which as he was doing, and laying open the whole Conspiracy, behold the third Man, who being Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, was, as a Murtherer thrust and hal'd by the People through the Prease, towards <hi>Timoleon,</hi> and other the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Persons of the Assembly, before whom being brought, he Crys out for Pardon, pleading, that he had justly Slain his Fathers Murtherer; which he also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the place, by sufficient Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53645:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which his good Fortune very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely supply'd him withal, that his Father was really Kill'd in the City of the <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> by that very Man on whom he had taken his Revenge; he was presently A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded Ten Attick <note n="*" place="margin">The old Attick Mine was 75 Drach.</note> Mine, for having had the good Fortune, by designing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the the Death of his Father, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Life of the common Father of <hi>Sicily.</hi> This Fortune in her Conduct, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes all the Rules of Humane Prudence.

And doubtless, these mutual

Advertisements would be of no contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Advantage to the Publick Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency and Intelligence: For there are evermore Conditions that hunt after one another, and for want of knowing one anothers occasion, leave Men in very great necessity. I have heard, to the great shame of the Age we Live in, that in our very sight, two most excellent Men for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Died so Poor, that they had scarce Bread to put in their Mouths: <hi>Lilius Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius Giraldus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sebastianus Castalio</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>: And do believe, there are a Thousand Men would have invited them into their Families, with very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Conditions, or have Reliev'd them where they were, had they known their wants. The World is not so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Corrupted, but that I know a Man, that would heartily wish the Estate his Ancestors have left him, might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, so long as it shall please Fortune to give him leave to enjoy it, to secure rare and remarkable Persons of any kind, whom Misfortune sometimes persecutes to the last degree, from the danger of Necessity; and at least, place them in such a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they must be very hard to please, if they were not contented. My Father in his Oeconomical Government, had this Order, (which I know how to commend, but by no means imitate,)
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53645:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was, that besides the Day-book, or Memorial of the Houshold Affairs, where the small Accounts, Payments and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursements, which do not require a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries hand, were entred, and which a Bayliff always had in Custody; he Order'd him whom he kept to write for him, to keep a Paper Journal, and in it to set down all the remarkable Occurrences, and Day by Day the Memoires of the Histories of his House: very pleasant to look over, when time begins to wear things out of Memory, and very useful sometimes to put us out of doubt, when such a thing was begun, when ended, what courses were debated on, what concluded; our Voyages, Absences, Marriages, and Deaths, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of good, or ill news; the change of principal Servants, and the like.

so were we: But as those who by Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Light put out that of the Day, so we by borrowed Forms and Fashions have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd our own. And 'tis plain enough to be seen, that 'tis Custome only which renders that impossible, that otherwise is nothing so; for of those Nations who have no manner of knowledg of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some are scituated under the same Temperature that we are, and some in much Colder Climates. And besides, our most tender Parts are always expos'd to the Air, as the Eyes, Mouth, Nose, and Ears; and our Country Labourers, like our Ancestors in former times, go with their Breasts and Bellies open. Had we been Born with a necessity upon us of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:53645:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wearing Petticoats and Breeches, there is no doubt, but Nature would have Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those Parts she intended should be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Fury of the Seasons, with a thicker Skin, as she has done the Finger ends, and the Soles of the Feet. And why should this seem hard to believe? I Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve much greater distance betwixt my Habit, and that of one of our Country Bores, than betwixt his, and a Man that has no other Covering but his Skin. How many Men, especially in <hi>Turky,</hi> go Naked upon the account of Devotion? I know not who would ask a Beggar, whom he should see in his Shirt in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as Brisk and Frolick, as he who goes Muffled up to the Ears in Furs, how he is able to endure to go so? Why Sir, he might Answer, you go with your Face bare, and I am all Face. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Story of the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his Fool, whom his Master Asking, <hi>How being so thin Clad, he was able to support the Cold, when he himself, warm wrapt as he was, was hardly able to do it?

A <hi>Venetian</hi> who has long Liv'd in <hi>Pegu,</hi> and is lately return'd from thence, writes, that the Men and Women of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, though they cover all their other Parts, go always Barefoot, and Ride so too. And <hi>Plato</hi> does very earnestly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53645:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the health of the whole Body, to give the Head and the Feet no other Cloathing, than what Nature has bestow'd. He whom the <hi>Polacks</hi> have Elected for their King, since ours came thence, who is indeed one of the greatest Princes of this Age, never wears any Gloves, and for Winter, or whatever Weather can come, never wears other Cap abroad, than the same he wears at home. Whereas I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to go unbutton'd, or unti'd; our Neighbouring Labourers would think themselves in Chains, if they were so brac'd. <hi>Varro</hi> is of Opinion, that when it was Ordain'd, we should be bare in the presence of the Gods, and before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, it was rather so Order'd, upon the score of health, and to Inure us to the Injuries of Weather, than upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Reverence. And since we are now talking of Cold, and <hi>French-men</hi> us'd to wear variety of Colours, (not I my self, for I seldome wear other than Black, or White, in Imitation of my Father,) let us add another Story of Captain <hi>Martin du Bellay,</hi> who affirms, that in the Voyage of <hi>Luxenbourg,</hi> he saw so great Frosts, that the Ammunition Wine was cut with Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, and Wedges; was deliver'd out to the Souldiers by Weight, and that they carried it away in Baskets: and <hi>Ovid,</hi>

At the Mouth of the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> the Frosts are so very sharp, that in the very same place where <hi>Methridates</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had Fought the Enemy dry-foot, and given them a notable Defeat, the Summer following he obtain'd over them a Famous Naval Victory. The <hi>Romans</hi> Fought at a very great disadvantage, in the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> near <hi>Placentia,</hi> by reason, that they went on to Charge with their Blood fix'd, and their Limbs Numm'd with Cold, whereas <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> had caus'd great Fires to be dispers'd quite through his Camp to warm his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and Oil to be distributed amongst them; to the end, that Anointing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they might render their Nerves more Supple and Active, and fortifie the Pores against the violence of the Air, and Freezing Wind, that Rag'd in that Season. The Retreat the <hi>Greeks</hi> made from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> into their own Country, is Famous, for the Difficulties and Calamities they had to overcome. Of which, this was one,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53645:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that being Encounter'd in the Mountains of <hi>Armenia</hi> with a horrible Storm of Snow, they lost all knowledg of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and of the ways, and being driven up, were a Day and a Night without Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Drinking, most of their Cattel Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many of themselves Starv'd Dead, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral struck Blind with the driving, and the glittering of the Snow, many of them Maim'd in their Fingers and Toes, and many Stiff and Motionless with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the Cold, who had yet their Understanding entire. <hi>Alexander</hi> saw a Nation, where they Bury their Fruit-Trees in Winter, to defend them from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd by the Frost, and we also may see the same. But concerning Cloaths, the King of <hi>Mexico</hi> chang'd four times a Day his Apparel, and never put them on more, employing those he left off, in his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Liberalities and Rewards, as also, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pot, Dish, nor other Utensil of his Kitchen, or Table, was ever serv'd in Twice.</p>

I easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that in anothers Humour, that is contrary to my own; and though I find my self engag'd to one certain Form, I do not obliged others to it, as many do; but believe and apprehend a Thousand ways of Living, and contrary to most Men, more easily admit of Difference than Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongst us. I as frankly, as any one would have me, discharge a Man from my Humours and Principles, and consider him according to his own particular Model. Though I am not Continent my self, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless sincerely Love, and approve the Continency of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and other Religious Orders, and highly commend their way of Living. I insinuate my self by imagination into their Place and Love, and Honour them the more, for being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than I am.

only. There is no more Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions extant, and those Actions that carry a shew of Vertue, have yet nothing of its Essence; by reason, that Profit, Glory, Fear and Custom, and other such like foreign Causes, put us in the way to produce them. Our Justice also, Valour, and good Offices, may then be call'd so too, in respect to others, and according to the face they appear with to the Publick; but in the doer it can by no means be Vertue, because there is another end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, another moving cause. Now Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue owns nothing to be hers, but what is done by her self, and for her self alone. In that great Battel of <hi>Potidaea,</hi> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> under the Command of <hi>Pausanias</hi> obtain'd against <hi>Mardonius,</hi> and the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the Conquerours, according to their Custom, coming to divide amongst them the Glory of the Exploit, they attributed to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Nation the Preheminence of Valour in this Engagement. The <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> great Judges of Vertue, when they came to determine, to what particular Man of their Nation the Honour was due, of having the best Behav'd himself upon this occasion, found, that <hi>Aristodemus</hi> had of all others hazarded his Person with the greatest Bravery: but did not however al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him any Prize, or Reward; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that his Vertue had been incited by a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53645:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
desire, to clear his Reputation from the Reproach of his Miscarriage at the Business of <hi>Thermypole,</hi> and with a desire to Die Bravely, to wipe off that former Blemish. Our Judgments are yet sick, and Obey the Humour of our deprav'd Manners. I Observe most of the Wits of these Times pretend to Ingenuity, by endeavouring to blemish and to darken the Glory of the Bravest and most Generous Actions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, putting one Vile Interpretation or another upon them, and forging and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing vain Causes and Motives for those Noble things they did. A mighty subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty indeed! Give me the greatest and most unblemish'd Action that ever the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and I will contrive a Hundred plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Drifts and Ends to obscure it: God knows, who ever will stretch them out to the full, what diversity of Images our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Wills do suffer under; they do not so Maliciously play the Censurers, as they do it Ignorantly and Rudely in all their Detractions. The same pains and licence that others take to Blemish and Bespatter these illustrious Names, I would willingly undergo to lend them a shoulder to raise them higher. These rare Images, and that are cull'd out by the consent of the wisest Men of all Ages, for the Worlds Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I should endeavour to Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, as far as my Invention would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53645:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in all the Circumstances of favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpretation. And we are to believe, that the force of our Invention is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short of their Merit. 'Tis the Duty of good Men to Pourtray Vertues as Beautiful as they can, and there would be no Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the Case, should our Passion a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Transport us in favour of so Sacred a Form. What these People do to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they either do out of Malice, or by the Vice of confining their Belief to their own Capacity; or, which I am more inclin'd to think, for not having their sight strong, clear and elevated enough, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the splendour of Vertue in her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purity: As <hi>Plutarch</hi> complains, that in his time some Attributed the cause of the Younger <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death, to his Fear of <hi>Caesar,</hi> at which he seems very Angry, and with good reason: and by that a Man may guess how much more he would have been offended with those, who have Attributed it to Ambitious Senceless People! He would rather have perform'd a handsome, just and generous Action, and to have had Ignominy for his Reward, than for Glory. That Man was in truth a Pattern, that Nature chose out to shew to what height Humane Vertue and Constancy could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive: but I am not capable of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so Noble an Argument, and shall therefore only set Five Latine Poets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53645:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Ears, who has done best in the praise of <hi>Cato</hi>; and inclusively for their own too. Now a Man well Read in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will think the two first, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the others, a little Flat and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing; the Third more Vigorous, but overthrown by the Extravagancy of his own force. He will then think, that there will be yet room for one or two Gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Invention to come to the Fourth; but coming to mount the pitch of that, he will lift up his Hands for admiration; the last, the first by some space, (but a space that he will swear is not to be fill'd up by any Humane Wit,) he will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish'd, he will not know where he is. These are Wonders. We have more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, than Judges and Interpreters of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It is easier to Write an indifferent Poem, than to Understand a good one. There is indeed a certain low and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate sort of Poetry, that a Man may well enough judg by certain Rules of Art; but the true, supream and divine Poesie, is equally above all Rules and Reason. And whoever discerns the Beauty of it, with the most assured and most steady sight, sees no more than the quick reflection of a Flash of Lightning. This is a sort of Poesie, that does not exercise, but ravishes and overwhelms our Judgment. The Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that possesses him who is able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53645:216"/>
into it, wounds yet a Third Man by hearing him repeat it. Like a Loadstone, that not only attracts the Needle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so infuses into it the Vertue to attract o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And it is more evidently Eminent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Theatres, that the Sacred Inspiration of the Muses, having first stirr'd up the Poet to Anger, Sorrow, Hatred, and out of himself, to whatever they will, does moreover by the Poet possess the Actor, and by the Actor consecutively all the Spectators. So much do our Passions hang and depend upon one another. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry has ever had that power over me from a Child, to Transpierce and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me: But this quick resentment that is Natural to me, has been variously hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by variety of Forms, not so much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and lower, (for they were ever the highest of every kind,) as differing in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. First, a Gay and Spritely Fluency, afterwards a Lofty and Penetrating Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and lastly, a Mature and Constant Force. Their Names will better express them; <hi>Ovid, Lucan, Virgil.</hi> But our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets are beginning their Career.

so is it, that in judging of these Accidents, we are to consider how much our Souls are oft-times agitated with divers Passions. And as they say, that in our Bodies there is a Congregation of divers Humours, of which, that is the Soveraign, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Complexion we are of, is commonly most predominant in us: So, though the Soul have in it divers motions to give it Agitation; yet must there of necessity be one to over-rule all the rest, though not with so necessary and absolute a Dominion, but that through the Flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Inconstancy of the Soul, those of less Authority, may upon occasion, reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume their place, and make a little Sally in turn. Thence it is, that we see not only Children, who Innocently Obey, and follow Nature, often Laugh and Cry at the same thing: but not one of us can boast, what Journey soever he may have in hand, that he has the most set his Heart upon, but when he comes to part with his Family and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53645:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Friends, he will find something that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him within; and though he refrain his Tears, yet he puts Foot i'th' Stirrupt, with a Sad and Cloudy Countenance, and what gentle Flame soever may have warm'd the Heart of Modest, and Well-Born Virgins, yet are they fain to be forc'd from about their Mothers Necks, to be put to Bed to their Husbands, whatever this Boon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion is pleas'd to say:

Neither is it strange to lament a person, whom a man would by no means should be alive: When I rattle my man, I do it with all the mettle I have, and load him with no feign'd, but downright real Curses; but the heat being over, if he should stand in need of me, I should be very ready to do him good: for I instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn the leaf. When I call him Calf, and Coxcomb, I do not pretend to entail
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53645:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those titles upon him for ever; neither do I think I give my self the lye in calling him an honest man presently after. Were it not the sign of a fool to talk to ones self, there would hardly be a day or hour wherein I might not be heard to grumble, and mutter to my self, and against my self; <hi>Turd in the fools teeth,</hi> and yet I do not think that to be my Character. Who for seeing me one while cold, and presently very kind to my Wife, believes the one or the other to be counterfeited, is an Ass. <hi>Nero</hi> taking leave of his Mother, whom he sent to be drown'd, was nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this farewel, and was struck with horror, and pity.

And therefore it was, that <hi>Bias</hi> pleasantly said to some, who being with him in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous storm, implor'd the assistance of the Gods, <hi>Peace, speak softly,</hi> said he, <hi>that they may not know you are here in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:</hi> And of more pressing exemple, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque</hi> Vice Roy in the <hi>Indies,</hi> for <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in an extream peril of Shipwrack, took a young Boy upon his Shoulders, for this only end, that in the Society of their common danger, his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency might serve to protect him, and to recommend him to the Divine favour, that they might get safe to Shoar: 'Tis not that a Wise Man may not live every where content, either alone, or in the crowd of a Palace: But if it be left to his own choice, he will tell you, that he would fly the very sight of the latter: He can endure it if need be; but if it be referred to him, he will choose the first. He cannot think himself sufficiently rid of Vice, if he must yet contend with it in other Men: <hi>Charon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

Convict of keeping of ill Company. There is nothing so Unsociable, and Sociable, as Man, the one by his Vice, the other by his Nature. And <hi>Antisthenes</hi> in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did not give him a satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, who Reproach'd him with frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill Company, by saying, <hi>That the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians Liv'd well enough amongst the Sick</hi>: for if they contribute to the health of the Sick, no doubt, but by the Contagion, continual sight of, and familiarity with Diseases, they must of necessity impair their own. Now the end I suppose is all one, to Live at more leisure, and at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ease: but Men do not always take the right way; for they often think, they have totally taken leave of all Business, when they have only exchang'd one Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for another. There is little less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Governing a private Family, than a whole Kingdom: wherever the Mind is perplex'd, it is in an entire disorder, and Domestick Employments are not less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, for being less important. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, for having shak'd off the Court, and Publick Employments, we have not taken leave of the principal Vexations of Life.

If a Man do not first discharge both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his Mind, of the Burthen with which he finds himself Oppress'd, Motion will but make it press the harder, and sit the heavier, as the Lading of a Ship is of less Incumbrance, when fast, and bestow'd in a settled posture; you do a Sick Man more harm than good, in removing him from place to place; you fix and establish the Disease by motion, as Stoops dive deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the Earth, by being mov'd up and down in the place where they are design'd to stand. And therefore it is not enough to get remote from the Publick; 'tis not enough to shift the Soil only, a Man must flie from the Popular Dispositions that have taken possession of his Soul, he must Sequester and Ravish himself from himself.

things; so far as they are pleasant to us, but by no means to lay our principal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation there. This is no true one, neither Nature, nor Reason, can allow it so to be, and why therefore should we contrary to their Laws, enslave our own contentment, by giving it into the power of another: To anticipate also the accidents of Fortune, and to deprive our selves of those things we have in our own power, as several have done upon the account of Devotion, and some Philosophers by discourse; to serve a Mans self, to lye hard, to put out our own Eyes, throw Wealth into the River, and to seek out Grief, (the one by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness, and misery of this Life, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bliss in another; the other by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves low to avoid the Danger of falling) are acts of an excessive Nature.

A great deal less would serve my turn well enough. 'Tis enough for me under For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes favour to prepare my self for her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and being at my ease to represent to my self, as far as my imagination can Stretch, the ill to come; as we do at Justs, and Tiltings, where we counterfeit War in the greatest Calm of Peace. I do not think <hi>Arcesilaus</hi> the Philosopher the less Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and Reform'd, for knowing that he made use of Gold, and Silver Vessels, when the condition of his Fortune allow'd him so to do: But have a better Opinion of him, than if he had deni'd himself what he us'd with Liberality, and Moderation, I see the utmost Limits of Natural necessity, and considering a Poor Man Begging at my Door, oft-times more Jocund, and more Healthy than I my self am, I put my self into his place, and attempt to dress my Mind after his Mode; and running in like manner over other examples, though I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Death, Poverty, Contempt, and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness treading on my Heels, I easily resolve not to be affrighted, forasmuch as a less than I takes them with so much Patience, and am not willing to believe that a less

understanding can do more than a greater; or that the effects of precept cannot arrive to as great a height, as those of Custom: And knowing of how uncertain duration these accidental conveniences are, I never forget, in the height of all my enjoyments, to make it my cheifest Prayer to Almighty God, that he will please to render me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my self; and the Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am. I see several Young Men very Gay, and Frolick; who nevertheless keep a Mass of Pills in their Trunck at home, to take when the Rhume shall fall, which they fear so much the less, because they think they have Remedy at hand: Every one should do the same, and moreover if they find themselves subject to some more violent Disease, should furnish themselves with such Medicines as may Numme and Stupifie the part: The employment a Man should choose for a Sedentary Life, ought neither to be a Laborious, nor an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing one, otherwise 'tis to no purpose at all to be retir'd, and this depends upon every ones liking, and humour; mine has no manner of complacency for Husbandry, and such as Love it, ought to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to it with Moderation.

It appears to be reason, when a Man talks of Retiring from the World, that he should look quite out of himself. These do it but by halves. They design well enough for themselves, 'tis true, when they shall be no more in it; but still they pretend to extract the fruits of that Design from the World, when absented from it, by a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Contradiction. The Imagination of those who seek Solitude, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Devotion, filling their Hopes with certainty of Divine Promises in the other Life, is much more rationally found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They propose to themselves God, an infinite Object in Goodness and Power. The Soul has there wherewithal, at full liberty, to satiate her Desires. Afflictions and Sufferings turn to their advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undergone for the acquisition of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Health, and everlasting Joys. Death is to be wish'd and long'd for, where it is the passage to so perfect a Condition. And the Tartness of these severe Rules they impose upon themselves, is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately taken away by Custom, and all their
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53645:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Carnal Appetites baffled and subdu'd, by refusing to humour and feed them; they being only supported by use and exercise. This sole end therefore, of another happy and immortal Life, is that which really merits, that we should abandon the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Conveniences of this. And who can really and constantly enflame his Soul with the Ardour of this Lively Faith and Hope, does erect for himself in this Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, a more Voluptuous and Delicious Life, than any other sort of Living whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Neither the end then, nor the means of this Advice of <hi>Pliny,</hi> pleases me, for we often fall out of the Frying-pan into the Fire. This Book Employment is as painful as any other, and as great an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Health, which ought to be the first thing in every Man's prospect; neither ought a Man to be allur'd with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it, which is the same that destroys the Wary, Avaricious, Voluptuous and Ambitious Men. The Wise give us Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough, to beware the Treachery of our Desires, and to distinguish true and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Pleasures, from such as are mix'd and complicated with greater Pain. For the greatest part of Pleasures, (say they,) Wheedle and Caress, only to strangle us, like those Thieves the <hi>Egyptians</hi> call'd <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liste</hi>; and if the Head-Ach should come before Drunkenness, we should have a care
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53645:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Drinking too much: but Pleasure to deceive us, Marches before, and conceals her Train. Books are pleasant, but if by being over Studious, we impair our Health, and spoil our good Humour, two of the best Pieces we have, let us give it over; for I for my part am one of those who think, that no Fruit deriv'd from them, can recompence so great a Loss. As Men who feel themselves Weakned by a long Series of Indisposition, give themselves up at last to the Mercy of Medicine, and submit to certain Rules of Living, which they are for the future never to Transgress; so he who Retires, weary of, and disgusted, with the common way of Living, ought to Model this new One he enters into, by the Rules of Reason, and to Institute and Establish it by Premeditation, and after the best Method he can contrive. He ought to have taken leave of all sorts of Labour, what advantage soever he may propose to himself by it, and generally to have sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off all those Passions which disturb the Tranquility of Body and Soul, and then choose the Way that best suits with his own Humour:

Wiser Men propose to themselves a Repose wholely Spiritual, as having great force and vigour of Mind: but for me, who have a very ordinary Soul, I find it very necessary, to support my self with Bodily Conveniences; and Age having of late depriv'd me of those Pleasures that were

You have, say they, hitherto Liv'd Swimming and Floating, come now, and Die in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: You have given the first part of your Life to the Light, give what remains to the Shade. It is impossible to give over Business, if you do not also quit the Fruit, and therefore disengage your selves from all the Concerns of Name and Glory. 'Tis to be fear'd, the Lustre of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Actions will give you but too much Light, and follow you into your most pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and most obscure Retreat: Quit with other Pleasures, that which proceeds from the Approbation of another: And as to your Knowledg and Parts, never concern your selves, they will not lose their effect, if your selves be ever the better for them.

I am none of all this; but I know how to Command all these. And <hi>Antisthenes</hi> took it for an argument of little Valour, in <hi>Ismenas,</hi> that he was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Playing excellently well upon a Flute. I know very well, that when I hear any one insist upon the Language of <hi>Essays,</hi> I had rather a great deal he would say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 'Tis not so much to elevate the Stile as to depress the Sence, and so much the more offensively, as they do it Disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and out of the Way. I am much deceived if many other Essayists, deliver more worth noting as to the matter, and how well, or ill soever, if any other Writer has strewed them either much more Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, or thicker upon his Paper than my self. To bring the more in, I only Muster up the Heads, should I annex the sequel, I should strangely Multiply this Volume: And how many Stories have I Scattered up
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:53645:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and down, in this Book, that I only touch upon, which should any one more curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly search into, they would find matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to produce infinite Essays: Neither those Stories, nor my allegations do always serve simply for Example, Authority, or Ornament, I do not only regard them for the use I make of them: They carry some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times besides what I apply them to, the seed of a more Rich, and a Bolder matter, and sometimes collaterally a more delicate Sound both to me my self, who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press no more in this Place, and to others who shall happen to be of my Ear.</p>
                     <p>But returning to the speaking vertue; I find no great choice betwixt, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to speak any thing but very ill, and not knowing to speak any thing but very well. <hi>Non est ornamentum virile concimitas.</hi>

There is something like this in these two other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, for they also promise Eternity, to the Letters they Write to their Friends; but 'tis after another manner, and by accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating themselves, for a good end, to the vanity of another; for they Write to them, that if the concern of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

known to future Ages, and the Thirst of Glory, do yet detain them in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick affairs, and make them fear the Solitude, and retirement to which they would perswade them; let them never trouble themselves more about it, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they shall have Credit enough with posterity to assure them, that were there nothing else but the very Letters thus Writ to them, those Letters will render their names as known, and famous, as their own publick actions themselves could do. And besides this difference, these are not Idle, and empty Letters, that contain nothing but a fine Gingle of well chosen Words, and fine Coucht phrases, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repleat, and abounding with Grave, and Learn'd Discourses, by which a Man may render himself not more Eloquent, but more Wise, and that instruct us not to speak, but to do well: A way with that Eloquence that so enchants us with its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that we should more Study it than things. Unless you will allow that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> to be of so Supream a perfection, as to form a compleat Body of it self: And of him I shall further add one Story, we read of him to this purpose, wherein his nature will much more manifestly be laid open to us: He was to make an Oration in publick, and found himself a little straightned in time, to fit his Words to his Mouth, as he had a
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53645:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mind to do; when <hi>Eros</hi> one of his Slaves brought him word, that the audience was deferr'd till the next Day, at which he was so ravisht with Joy, that he enfranchis'd him for the good news.</p>
                     <p>Upon this subject of Letters, I will add this more to what has been already said, that it is a kind of Writing, wherein my Friends think I can do something; and I am willing to confess, I should rather have chose to publish my Whimsies that way, than any other, had I had to whom to Write; but I wanted such a settled Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, as I once had to attract me to it, to raise my Fancy, and to maintain the rest against me. For to Traffick with the Wind, as some others have done, and to Forge vain Names to direct my Letters to, in a serious subject, I could never do it but in a Dream, being a sworn Enemy to all manner of falsification: I should have been more diligent, and more confidently secure, had I had a Judicious and Indulgent Friend, to whom to address, than thus to expose my self to various judgements of a whole People, and I am deceiv'd if I had not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded better: I have naturally a Comick, and familiar Stile; but it is a peculiar one, and not proper for Publick business, but like the Language I speak, too Compact, Irregular, Abrubt, and Singular; and as to Letters of Ceremony, that have no other
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53645:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
substance, than a fine contexture of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and obliging Words, I am wholly to seek, I have neither faculty, nor relish, for those tedious offers of Service, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; I am not good natur'd to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and should not forgive my self, should I offer more, than I intend, which is very remote from the present practice; for there never was so abject, and servile <hi>prostitution of tenders of Life, Soul, Devotion, Adoration, Vassal, Slave,</hi> and I cannot tell what, as now; all which expressions are so commonly, and so indifferently Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and fro by every one, and to every one, that when they would profess a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more respective inclination upon more just occasions, they have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to express it: I hate all air of Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Death, which is the cause that I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fall into a Shy, Rough, and crude way of speaking, that to such as do not know me, may seem a little to relish of disdain: I Honour those most to whom I shew the least Honour, and Respect, and where my Soul moves with the greatest Cheerfulness, I easily forget the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Look, and Gesture; I offer my self Faintly, and Bluntly, to them whose I effectually am, and tender my self the least to him, to whom I am the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted: Methinks they should read it in my Heart, and that my expression would

but injure the Love I have conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. To Welcome, take Leave, give Thanks, Accost, offer my Service, and such verbal Formalities, as the Laws of our modern civility enjoyn, I know no Man so stupidly unprovided of Language as my self: And have never been employ'd in Writing Letters of Favour, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that he, in whose behalf it was, did not think my mediation Cold, and Imperfect. The <hi>Italians</hi> are great Printers of Letters, I do believe I have at least an hundred several Volumes of them; of all which, those of <hi>Hannibal Caro,</hi> seem to me to be the best: If all the Paper I have Scribled to the Ladies all the time, when my Hand was really prompted by my Passion, were now in being, there might Peradventure be found a Page worthy to be communicated to our young enamora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's, that are Besotted with that Fury. I always Write my Letters Post, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitously, that though I Write an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ill Hand, I rather choose to do it my self, than to imploy another; for I can find none able to follow me, and never transcribe any; but have accustomed the great ones that know me to endure my Blots, and Dashes, and upon Paper without Fold, or Margent. Those that cost me the most Pains, are the worst of mine; when I once begin to draw it in by Head and

Shoulders, 'tis a sign that I am not there<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I fall too without premeditation, or design, the first word begets the second, and so to the end of the Chapter. The Letters of this Age consist more in fine Foldings, and Prefaces, than matter; whereas I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Write two Letters, than Close, and Fold up one, and always assign that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to some other; as also when the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Letter is dispatcht, I would with all my heart transferr it to another Hand, to add those long Harangues, Offers, and Prayers, that we place at the Bottom, and should be glad that some new custom would discharge us, of that unnecessary trouble; as also of superscribing them with a long Ribble-row of Qualities, and Titles, which for fear of mistakes, I have several times given over Writing, and especially to Men of the long Robe. There are so many innovations of Offices, that 'tis hard to place so many Titles of Honour in their proper, and due order, which also being so dearly bought, they are neither to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, nor omitted without offence. I find the same fault likewise with charging the fronts, and Title Pages of the Books we commit to the Press, with such a clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Titles.</p>

                     <p>MEn (says an ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Sentence) are tormented with the Opinions they have of things, and not by the things themselves. It were a great Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd for the relief of our miserable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Condition, could this proposition be establish'd for certain, and true throughout. For if evils have no admission into us; but by the judgement we our selves make of them, it should seem that it is then in our own power to despise them, or to turn them to good. If things sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render themselves to our mercy, why do we not convert, and accommodate them to our advantage? If what we call Evil, and Torment, is neither Evil, nor Torment of it self, but only that our Fancy gives it that Quality, and makes it so, it is in us to change, and alter it, and it being in our own choice, if there be no constraint upon us, we must certainly be very strange Fools, to take Arms for that side, which is most offensive to us, and to give Sickness, Want,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53645:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and contempt, a nauseous tast, if it be in our power to give them a more graceful Relish, and if Fortune simply providing the matter, 'tis for us to give it the form. Now that which we call Evil, is not so of it self, or at least to that degree that we make it; and that it depends upon us, to give it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother tast or complexion, (for all comes to one) let us examine how that can be maintain'd. If the original being of those things we fear, had power to lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in us, by their own authority, it would then lodge it self alike, and in like manner in all; for Men are all of the same kind, and saving in greater, and less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, are all provided with the same utensils and instruments to conceive and to judge; but the diversity of opinions we have of those things, does clearly evidence, that they only enter us by composition: One particular Person, peradventure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them in their true being; but a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand others give them a new, and contrary being in them. We hold Death, Poverty, and Grief, for our principal Enemies, but this Death which some repute, the most dreadful of all dreadful things, who does not know that others call it the only secure Harbour, from the Storms, and Tempests of Life? The Soveraign good of Nature? the sole Support of Liberty, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and sudden Remedy of all Evils? And
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53645:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the one expect it with Fear, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, the other support it with greater Ease than Life. That Blade complains of its facility,

But let us leave these Glorious Courages. <hi>Theodorus</hi> answer'd <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Kill him, thou wilt do a brave thing, said he, to arrive at the force of a <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi> The greatest part of Philosophers, are observ'd to have either purposely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or hastned, and assisted their own Death. How many ordinary people do we see led to Execution, and that not to a simple Death, but mixt with Shame, and sometimes with grievous Torments, appear with such assurance, what through obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or natural simplicity, that a Man can discover no change from their ordinary condition? Setling their Domestick affairs, recommending them to their Friends, Singing, Preaching, and Diverting the People so much, as sometimes to Sally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jests, and to Drink to their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as <hi>Socrates</hi>? One that they were leading to the Gallows, told them
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53645:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they must not carry him through such a Street, lest a Merchant that lived there, should Arrest him by the way, for an old Debt. Another told the Hangman, he must not touch his Neck, for fear of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him Laugh he was so Ticklish. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer'd his Confessor, who promised him he should that day Sup with our Lord. Do you go then, said he, in my Room; for I for my part keep fast to day. Another having call'd for Drink, and the Hangman having Drank first, said he would not Drink after him, for fear of catching the Pox. Every body has heard the Tale of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card,</hi> to whom being upon the Ladder they presented a Whore, telling him (as our Law does sometimes permit) that if he would Marry her, they would save his Life, he having a while considered her, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that she Halted, Come tye up, tye up, said he, she limps.

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53645:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Master could err. We read that of the inhabitants of <hi>Arras,</hi> when <hi>Lewis</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth took that City, a great many let themselves be Hang'd, rather than they would say, <hi>God Save the King.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst that mean-soul'd race of Men, the Buffoons, there having been some, who would not leave their Fooling at the very moment of Death. He that the Hangman turn'd off the Ladder cry'd, <hi>Launch the Galley,</hi> an ordinary foolish saying of his; and the other, whom at the point of Death his Friends having laid upon a Pallet before the Fire, the Physician asking him where his Pain lay, betwixt the Bench and the Fire, said he, and the Priest, to give him the extream Unction, Groping for his Feet, which his Pain had made him pull up to him, you will find them, said he, at the end of my Legs. To one that being present exhorted him to recommend himself to God, why who goes thither? said he; and the other replying, it will presently be your self, if it be his good pleasure; would I were sure to be there by to morrow Night, said he; do but recommend your self to him said the other, and you will soon be there: I were best then, said he, to carry my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations my self. In the Kingdom of <hi>Narsingua</hi> to this day, the Wives of their Priests, are buried alive with the Bodies of their Husbands; all other Wives are burnt
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53645:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at their Husbands Funerals, which also they do not only constantly, but chearfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo: At the death of their King, his Wives, and Concubines, his Favourites, all his Officers, and Domestick servants, which make up a great number of people, present themselves so chearfully to the Fire, where his Body is burnt, that they seem to take it for a singular honour, to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Master in death. During our late War of <hi>Milan,</hi> where there hapned so many takings, and re-takings of Towns, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple impatient of so many various changes of Fortune, took such a resolution to dye, that I have heard my Father say, he there saw a List taken of five and twenty Masters of Families, that made themselves away in one weeks time: An accident somewhat resembling that of the <hi>Zanthians,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing besieg'd by <hi>Brutus,</hi> precipitated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, Men, Women, and Children, into such a furious appetite of dying, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done to evade death, they did not put in practice to avoid life; insomuch, that <hi>Brutus</hi> had much ado to save but a very small number. Every opinion is of force enough, to make it self to be espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the expence of life. The first Article of that valiant Oath, that <hi>Greece</hi> took, and observ'd in the <hi>Median</hi> War, was that every one should sooner exchange life for death, than their own Laws for those of <hi>Persia.</hi>

What a World of people do we see in the Wars betwixt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> rather embrace a cruel death, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcise themselves to admit of Baptism? An example of which no sort of Religion is incapable. The Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> having Banisht the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their Dominions, <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> in consideration of eight Crowns a Head, sold them a retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his, for a certain limited time; upon condition, that the time perfixt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to expire, they should be gone; and he to furnish them with Shipping, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport them into <hi>Affrick.</hi> The limited day came, which once laps'd, they were given to understand, that such as were afterwards found in the Kingdom should remain Slaves: Vessels were very slenderly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and those who embarkt in them were rudely, and villanously used by the Seamen, who besides other indignities, kept them cruising upon the Sea, one while forwards, and another backwards, till they had spent all their provisions, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to buy of them at so dear rates, and so long withal, that they set them not on Shoar, till they were all stript to the very Shirts. The news of this inhumane usage, being brought to those who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind, the greater part of them resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon Slavery, and some made a shew of changing Religion. <hi>Emanuel</hi> the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor

He says that this produc'd a most horrid Spectacle: The natural affection betwixt the Parents and their Children,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:53645:241"/>
and moreover their Zeal to their ancient Belief, contending against this violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. Fathers and Mothers were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly seen making themselves away, and by a yet much more Rigorous Example, precipitating out of Love and Compassion, their young Children into Wells and Pits, to avoid the Severity of this Law. As to the remainder of them, the time that had been prefix'd being expir'd, for want of means to transport them, they again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into Slavery. Some also turn'd Christians, upon whose Faith, as also that of their Posterity, even to this Day, which is a Hundred Years since, few <hi>Portuguese</hi> can yet relie or believe them to be real Converts; though Custom, and length of time, are much more powerful Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors in such Changes, than all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints whatever.

Arguments, which he would never permit me to dispossess him of, upon the first Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable occasion that offer'd it self to him, to precipitate himself into it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of visible reason, with an obstinate and ardent desire of Dying. We have several Examples of our own times of those, even so much as to little Children, who for fear of a Whipping, or some such little thing, have dispatch'd themselves. And, what shall we not fear (says one of the Ancients to that purpose,) if we dread that, which Cowardize it self has chosen for its Refuge? Should I here produce a tedious Catalogue of those of all Sexes and Conditions, and of all sorts, even in the most happy Ages, who have either with great Constancy look'd Death in the Face, or voluntarily sought it; and sought it not only to avoid the Evils of this Life, but some, purely to avoid the Saciety of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and others, for the hope of a better Condition elsewhere, I should never have done. Nay, the Number is so infinite, that in truth, I should have a better Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on't, to reckon up those who have fear'd it. This one therefore shall serve for all; <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rho</hi> the Philosopher, being one Day in a Boat, in a very great Tempest, shew'd to those he saw the most Affrighted about him, and encourag'd them by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Hog, that was there, nothing at

all concern'd at the Storm. Shall we then dare to say, that this advantage of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of which we so much Boast, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of which, we think our selves Masters and Emperours, over the rest of the Creatures, was given us for a Torment? To what end serves the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of things, if it renders us more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly? If we lose the Tranquility and Repose we should enjoy without it? And if it put us into a worse Condition, than <hi>Pyrrho</hi>'s Hog? Shall we employ the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that was conferr'd upon us for our greatest Good, to our own Ruine? Setting our selves against the design of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the universal Order of things, which intend, that every one should make use of the Faculties, Members and Means, he has, to his own best Advantage? But it may peradventure be Objected against me; Your Rule is true enough, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Death: But what will you say of Necessity? What will you moreover say of Pain, that <hi>Aristippus, Hieronimus,</hi> and almost all the Wise Men, have reputed the worst of Evils? And those who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd it by word of Mouth, did however confess it in Effects? <hi>Possidonius</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Tormented with a sharp and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Disease, <hi>Pompeius</hi> came to Visit him, excusing himself, that he had taken so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable a time to come to hear him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:53645:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Philosophy; God forbid, said <hi>Possidonius</hi> to him again, that Pain should ever have the power to hinder me from talking, and thereupon fell imediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a discourse of the Contempt of Pain: But in the mean time, his own Infirmity was playing its part, and plagu'd him to the purpose; to which he Cry'd out, thou may'st work thy Will Pain, and Torment me with all the power thou hast, but thou shalt never make me say, that thou art an Evil. This Story that they make such a Clutter withal, what is there in it, I fain would know, to the Contempt of Pain? It only Fights it with Words, and in the mean time, if the Shootings and Dolours he felt, did not move him, why did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his Discourse? Why did he fancy, he did so great a thing, in forbearing to confess it an Evil? All does not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the Imagination, our Fancies may work upon other things: But this here is a certain Science that is playing its part, of which our Senses themselves are judg.

A Thousand Beasts, a Thousand Men, are sooner Dead than Threatned. That also which we principally pretend to Fear in Death, is Pain, the ordinary fore-runner of it: Yet, if we may believe a Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Malam mortem non facit, nisi quod se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur mortem.</hi> Nothing makes Death E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but what follows it. And I should yet say more probably, that neither that which goes before, nor that which follows after, are at all the appendants of Death:
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:53645:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
We excuse our selves falsely. And I find by experience, that it is rather the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Imagination of Death, that makes us impatient of Pain; and that we find it doubly grievous, as it Threatens us with Death. But Reason accusing our Cowardize, for fearing a thing so sudden, so inevitable, and so insensible, we take the other as the more excusable pretence. All ills that carry no other danger along with them, but simply the Evils themselves, we despise as things of no danger. The Tooth-Ach, or the Gout, as painful as they are, being yet not reputed Mortal, who reckons them in the Catalogue of Diseases? But let us presuppose, that in Death we principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard the Pain, as also, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be fear'd in Poverty, but the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series it brings along with it, of Thirst, Hunger, Cold, Heat, Watching, and the other Inconveniences it makes us suffer, yet still we have nothing to do with any thing but Pain. I will grant, and very willingly, that it is the worst Accident of our Being, (for I am the Man upon Earth, that the most Hates, and avoids it, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that hitherto I thank God I have had so little Traffick with it,) but still it is in us, if not to annihilate, at least, to lessen it by Patience, and though the Body should Mutiny, to Maintain the Soul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless in a good Temper. And were
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:53645:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it not so, who had ever given Reputation to Vertue, Valour, Force, Magnanimity, and Resolution? where were their parts to be plaid, if there were no Pain to be Defi'd? <hi>Avida est periculi virtus.</hi>

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53645:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
relie upon her who is the sole and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Mistress of our Condition. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, saving in greater or less proportion, has but one and the same Bent and Bias; whereas the Soul is variable into all sorts of forms; and subjects to her self, and to her own Empire, all things whatsoever; both the Senses of the Body, and all other Accidents: and therefore it is, that we ought to study her, to enquire into her, and to rowse up all her powerful Faculties. There is neither Reason, Form, nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, that can any thing prevail against her Inclination and Choice; of so many Thousands of Biasses that she has at her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, let us give her one proper to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and conservation, and then we shall not only be shelter'd and secur'd from all manner of Injury and Offence, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over gratified and oblig'd, if we will, with Evils and Offences. She makes her profit indifferently of all things. Errour and Dreams serve her to good use, as a Loyal matter to Lodg us in Safety and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis plain enough to be seen, that 'tis the sharpness of our Conceit, that gives the Edg to our Pains and Pleasures. Beasts that have no such thing, leave to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies their own free and natural Sentiments, and consequently, in every kind very near the same, as appears by the resembling Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of their Motions. If we would
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:53645:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not disturb, in our Members, the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that appertains to them in this, 'tis to be believed, it would be the better for us, and that Nature has given them a just and moderate Temper, both to Pleasure and Pain; neither can it fail of being Just, being Equal, and Common. But seeing we have Enfranchis'd our selves from these Rules, to give our selves up to the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Liberty of our own Fancies, let us at least help to encline them to the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable side. <hi>Plato</hi> fears our too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently engaging our selves with Grief and Pleasure, forasmuch as these too much Knit and Ally the Soul to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: whereas I rather, quite contrary, by reason it too much separates and disunites them. As an Enemy is made more Feirce by our Flight, so Pain grows Proud to see us Truckle under it. She will surrender upon much better Terms to them who make Head against her: A Man must op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and stoutly set himself against it. In retiring and giving ground, we invite, and pull upon our selves the Ruine that Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us. As the Body is more firm in an Encounter, the more stifly and obstinately it applys it self to it; so is it with the Soul. But let us come to Examples, which are the proper Commodity for Fellows of such feeble Reins as my self; where we shall find, that it is with Pain, as with Stones, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53645:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>

The Pains of Child-bearing, said by the Physician, and by God himself, to be very great, and which our Women keep so great a Clutter about, there are whole Nations that make nothing of it.

And another Cursing at a Sacrifice, suffer'd himself to be Burnt to the Bone, by a Coal that fell into his Sleive, rather than disturb the Ceremony. And there have been a great Number, for a sole Trial of Vertue, following their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, who have at Seven Years old endur'd to be Whipt to Death, without changing their Countenance.

                     <p>I have since my Child-hood Liv'd in Three sorts of Conditions; the First, which continued for some Twenty Years, I past over without any other means, but what were Accidental, and depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the allowance and assistance of others, without Stint, or certain Revenue. I then spent my Money so much the more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and with so much the less care how it went, as it wholely depended upon my over-confidence of Fortune; and never Liv'd more at my ease, I never had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of finding the Purse of any of my Friends shut against me, having enjoin'd my self this Necessity above all other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities whatever, by no means to fail of Payment at the appointed time, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they have a Thousand times respited, seeing how careful I was to satisfie them; so that I practis'd at once a Thrifty, and withal, a kind of alluring Honesty.

Those kind of payments excepted, where the trouble of reckoning and dodging are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, and in such cases, where I can meet with no Body to ease me of that hateful Torment, I avoid them, how scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously and injuriously soever, all I possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can, for fear of those little wrangling Disputes, for which, both my humour, and way of speaking, are so totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unfit.

And yet I always borrow'd at great disadvantage, for wanting the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to speak to the person my self, I committed my Request to the perswasion of a Ticket, which usually is no very suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Advocate, and is of very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him who has a mind to deny.

                     <p>My Second Condition of Life was, to have Mony of my own; wherein I so order'd the matter, that I had soon laid up a very notable Summ out of so mean a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53645:253"/>
considering with my self, that that only was to be reputed having, which a Man reserv'd from his ordinary Expence, and that a Man could not absolutely relie upon Revenue to receive, how clear soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Estate might be. For what, said I, if I should be surpriz'd by such or such an Accident? And after such like vain and vicious Imaginations, would very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, by this hoarding of Mony, provide against all Inconveniences; and could moreover answer, such as objected to me, that the number of them was too infinite, that it I could not lay up for all, I could however do it at least for some, and for many. Yet was not this done without a great deal of Solicitude and Anxiety of Mind. I kept it very close, and though I dare talk so boldly of my self, never spoke of my Mony, but falsely, as others do, who being Rich, pretend to be Poor, and being Poor, pretend to be Rich, dispensing with their Consciences for ever telling sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely what they have. A ridiculous and shameful Prudence. Was I to go a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? methought I was never enough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: and the more I loaded my self with Mony, the more also was I loaded with Fear, one while of the danger of the Roads, another of the Fidelity of him who had the charge of my Sumpters, of whom, as some others that I know, I was never
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:53645:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sufficiently Secure, if I had him not always in my Eye. If I chanc'd to leave the Key of my Cabinet behind me, what strange Jealousies, and Anxiety of Mind did I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into? And which was worse, without daring to acquaint any Body with it. My Mind was eternally taken up with such things as these, so that all things consider'd, there is more trouble in keeping Mony, than in getting it. And if I did not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so much as I say, or was not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually so scandalously solicitous of my Mony, as I have made my self; yet it cost me something at least to govern my self from being so, I reapt little or no advantage by what I had, and my Expences seem'd nothing less to me, for having the more to spend: For, as <hi>Bion</hi> said, The Hairy Men are as angry as the Ball'd to be pull'd; and after you are once accustomed to it, and have once set your heart upon your heap, it is mo more at your Service, you cannot find in your heart to break it: 'Tis a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you will fancy, must of necessity all tumble down to Ruine, if you stir but the least Pibble, Necessity must first take you by the Throat, before you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon your self to touch it: And I would sooner have pawn'd any thing I had, or sold a House, and with much less constraint upon my self, than have made the least breach in that beloved Purse, I
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53645:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had so cunningly laid by. But the danger was, that a Man cannot easily prescribe certain limits to this desire, (for they are hard to find in things that a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be good,) and to stint this good Husbandry so, that it may not degenerate into Avarice: Men still being intent upon adding to the heap, and encreasing the stock, from Sum to Sum, till at last they vilely deprive themselves of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own proper Goods, and throw all into reserve, without making any use of them at all. According to this Rule, they are the Richest People in the World, who are set to guard the Goals, and to defend the Walls of a Wealthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All Mony'd Men I conclude to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous. <hi>Plato</hi> places Corporal or Humane Riches in this Order; Health, Beauty, Strength and Riches; and Riches, says he, is not blind, but very clear sighted, when illuminated by Prudence. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Son, did a very handsome Act upon this subject. He was inform'd, that one of the <hi>Syracusans</hi> had hid a Treasure in the Earth, and thereupon sent to the Man to bring it to him, which he accordingly did, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately reserving a small part of it only to himself, with which he went to another City, where being cur'd of his Appetite of Hoarding, he began to Live at a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Rate. Which <hi>Dionysius</hi> hearing,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:53645:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
caus'd the rest of his Treasure to be restored to him, saying, that since he had learnt how to use it, he very willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it back unto him.</p>
                     <p>I continued some years in this hoarding humour, when I know not what good <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> fortunately put me out of it, as he did the <hi>Syracusan,</hi> and made me throw abroad all my reserve at random; the pleasure of a certain Voyage I took of very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, having made me spurn this fond Love of Money under foot, by which means I am now fallen into a third way of living, (I speak what I think of it) doubtless much more pleasant and moderate, which is, that I live at the height of my Revenue, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the one, sometimes the other may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exceed, but 'tis very little, and but rarely that they differ at all; I live from Hand to Mouth, and content my self in having sufficient for my present, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expence; for as to extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, all the laying up in the World would never suffice; and 'tis the greatest folly imaginable to expect, that fortune should ever sufficiently arm us against her self. 'Tis with our own arms that we are to fight her, accidental ones will betray us in the pinch of the business. If I lay up, 'tis for some near and designed expence, and not to purchase Lands, of which I have no need, but to purchase pleasure. <hi>Non esse

liv'd very happily together, both of them equally content with the change of their condition. An example that I could imitate with all my heart. And very much approve the fortune of an ancient <hi>Prelate,</hi> whom I see to have so absolutely stript himself of his Purse, his Revenue, and Care; of his Expence; committing them one while to one trusty Servant, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while to another, that he has spun out a long succession of years, as ignorant by this means of his Domestick affairs, as a meer stranger. The confidence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans vertue, is no light evidence of a Mans own; besides, God is pleased to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour such a confidence, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him of whom I am speaking, I see no where a better govern'd Family, nor a House more nobly, and constantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained than his, happy in this to have sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his affairs to so just a proportion, that his Estate is sufficient to do it without his care, or trouble, and without any hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, either in the spending, or laying it up; to his other more decent, and quiet employments, and that are more suitable both to his place, and liking. Plenty then and indigence depend upon the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion every one has of them; and Riches no more than Glory, or Health, have no more either Beauty, or Pleasure, than he is pleas'd to lend them, by whom they are
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53645:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
possest. Every one is well, or ill at ease, according as he finds himself: Not he whom the World believes, but he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves himself to be so is content; and in him alone belief gives it self being, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Fortune does us neither good, nor hurt; she only presents us the matter, and the seed, which our soul, more powerful than she, turns and applies as she best pleases; being the sole cause, and Soveraign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of her own happy, or unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. All external accessions receive taste and Colour, from the internal constitution, as Cloaths warm us, not with their Heat, but our own, which they are fit to cover and keep in; and who would cover a cold body, would do the same service for the cold, for so Snow and Ice are preserved. And after the same manner that Study is a torment to a truant, abstinence from Wine to a good fellow, frugality to the Spend-thrift, and exercise to a Lazy tender bred fellow; so it is of all the rest. The things are not so painful, and difficult of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but our weakness or cowardise makes them so. To judge of great, and high matters, requires a suitable soul, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we attribute the vice to them, which is really our own. A straight Oar seems crooked in the Water: It does not only import that we see the thing, but how, and after what manner we see it.
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:53645:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But after all this, why amongst so many discourses, that by so many arguments perswade Men to despise death, and to endure pain, can we not find out one that makes for us? And of so many sorts of imaginations as have so prevailed upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to perswade them to do so, why does not every one apply some one to himself, the most suitable to his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? If he cannot away with a strong working Aposence to eradicate the Evil, let him at least take a Lenitive to ease it. <hi>Opinio est quedam effeminata, ac levis:</hi>

After you have said all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all has been said to its prejudice, it creates so intestine inclination in opposition to your best arguments, that you have little power, and constancy to resist it: for (as <hi>Cicero</hi> says) even those who most controvert it, would yet that the Books they write should visit the light under their own names, and seek to derive glory from seeming to despise it. All other things are communicable, and fall into commerce; we lend our goods, and stake our Lives for the necessity, and service of our friends; but to communicate a man's Honour, and and to robe another with a man's own Glory, is very rarely seen.

Is she Settled, Even and Content? This is what is to be examin'd, and by that you are to judg of the vast differences betwixt Man, and Man. Is he

Can we think, that the Singing-Boys of the Quire, take any great delight in their own Musick? The Saciety does rather render it troublesome and tedious to them. Feasts, Balls, Masquerades and Tiltings, delight such as but rarely see, and desire to be at such Solemnities: But having been frequent at such Entertainments, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of them grows flat and insipid: Nay, Women (the greatest Temptation) do not so much delight those who make a common practice of the sport. He who will not give himself leisure to be Thirsty, can never find the true pleasure of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

whatever his own Will leads him to. And by reason of this Impunity, the Overt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting and Publication of their Vices, does oft-times more Mischief, than the Vice it self. Every one fears to be pry'd into, and discover'd in their Evil Courses; but Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are, even to their very Gestures, Looks and Thoughts, the People conceiving they have right and title to Censure, and be Judges of them: Besides, that the Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of the Great, naturally appear greater, by reason of the Eminency and Lustre of the place where they are seated; and that a Mole or a Wart appears greater in them, than the greatest Deformity in others. And this is the reason why the <hi>Poets</hi> feign the Amours of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be perform'd in the disguises of so many bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed shapes, that amongst the many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Practices they lay to his charge, there is only one, as I remember, where he appears in his own Majesty and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. But let us return to <hi>Hiero,</hi> who complains of the Inconveniences he found in his Royalty, in that he could not look abroad, and Travel the World at liberty, being as it were a Prisoner to the Bounds and Limits of his own Dominion: And that in all his Actions, he was evermore surrounded with an importunate Crowd. And in truth, to see our Kings set all alone at Table, environed with so many People
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:53645:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prating about them, and so many stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers staring upon them, as they always are, I have often been mov'd, rather to pity, than to envy, their condition. King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was wont to say, that in this, Asses were in a better condition than Kings, their Masters permitting them to feed at their own ease and pleasure; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that Kings cannot obtain of their Servants. And it would never sink into my fancy, that it could be of any great benefit to the Life of a Man of Sense, to have Twenty People prating about him, when he is at Stool; or that the Services of a Man of Ten Thousand <hi>Livers</hi> a Year, or that has taken <hi>Casal,</hi> or defended <hi>Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> should be either more commodious, or more acceptable to him, than those of a good Groom of the Chamber, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands his place. The Advantages of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, are but Imaginary upon the matter: Every degree of Fortune has in it some Image of Principality. <hi>Caesar</hi> calls all the Lords of <hi>France,</hi> having Free-Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise within their own Demeans, <hi>Roylets</hi>; and in truth, the Name of <hi>Sire</hi> excepted, they go pretty far towards Kingship; for do but look into the Provinces remote from Court, as <hi>Brittany</hi> for example, take notice of the Attendance, the Vassals, the Officers, the Employments, Service, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony and State, of a Lord that Lives
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:53645:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
retir'd from Court, is constant to his own House, and that has been bred up amongst his own Tenants and Servants; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve withal, the flight of his Imagination, there is nothing more Royal: He hears talk of his Master once a Year, as of a King of <hi>Persia,</hi> or <hi>Peru,</hi> without taking any further notice of him, than some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Kindred, his Secretary keeps in some Musty Record. And, to speak the truth, our Laws are easie enough, so easie, that a Gentleman of <hi>France</hi> scarce feels the weight of Soveraignty pinch his Shoulders above Twice in his Life. Real and effectual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, only concerns such amongst us, as voluntarily thrust their Necks under the Yoke, and who design to get Wealth and Honours by such Services: For a Man that loves his own Fire-side, and can Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his House, without falling by the Ears with his Neighbours, or engaging in Suits of Law, is as free, as a Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice. Paucos servitus, plures servitutem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> Servitude seizes of few, but many seize of her. But that which <hi>Hiero</hi> is most concern'd at, is, that he finds himself stripp'd of all Friendship, and depriv'd of all Natural Society, wherein the true and most perfect Fruition of Humane Life does consist. For what Testimony of affection and good will, can I extract from him, that owes me, whether he will or no, all
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:53645:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he is able to do? Can I form any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his real Respect to me, from his humble way of speaking, and submissive Behaviour, when they are Ceremonies, it is not in his Choice to deny? The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we receive from those that Fear us, is not Honour, those Respects are paid to my Royalty, and not to me.

All the real advantages of Princes are common to them with Men of meaner condition: 'Tis for the Gods to Mount winged Horses, and feed upon <hi>Ambrosia:</hi> Earthly Kings have no other Sleep, nor other Appetite, than we; the Steel they Arm themselves withal, is of no better temper, than that we also use; their Crowns do neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from the Rain, nor Sun. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian</hi> who wore a Crown so Fortunate and Rever'd, resign'd it, to retire himself to the Felicity of a private Life: And some time after the necessity of Publick Affairs, requiring, that he should reassume

his Charge, he made Answer to those who came to Court him to it, You would not offer, (said he) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to this, had you seen the fine Order of Trees I have Planted in my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and the fair Melows I have Sow'd in my Garden. In <hi>Anacharsis</hi> his Opinion, the happiest Estate of Government would be, where all other things being equal, Precedency should be measur'd out by the Vertues, and Repulses by the Vices of Men. When King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> prepar'd for his Expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> his Wise Counseller <hi>Cyneas,</hi> to make him sensible of the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Ambition; Well Sir, (said he,) to what End do you make all this Mighty Preparation? To make my self Master of <hi>Italy,</hi> (reply'd the King). And what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is done, (said <hi>Cyneas?</hi>) I will pass over into <hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> said the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And what then? I will then go to Subdue <hi>Africk</hi>; and lastly, when I have brought the whole World to my Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I will sit down and rest Content at my own Ease. For God sake, Sir, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Cyneas,</hi>) tell me what hinders, that you may not, if you please, be now in the condition you speak of? Why do you not now at this instant, settle your self in the State you seem to aim at, and spare the Labour and Hazard you interpose?</p>

                     <p>THE way by which our Laws at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to regulate idle and vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences in Meat and Clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end design'd. The true way would be to beget in men a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Silks and Gold, as vain, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and useless; whereas we augment to them the Honours, and enhance the value of such things, which sure is a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:53645:271"/>
way to create a disgust. For to enact, that none but Princes shall eat Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, shall wear Velvet, or Gold-Lace, and interdict these things to the people, what is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one more a gog to eat, and wear them? Let Kings (a Gods name) leave off these Ensigns of Grandeur, they have others enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; those excesses are more excusable in any other, than a Prince. We may learn by the Example of several Nations, better ways of exteriour distinction of quality (which truly I conceive to be very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in a State) enow, without fostering up this corruption, and manifest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to this effect. 'Tis strange how suddenly, and with how much ease custom in these indifferent things establishes it self, and becomes authority. We had scarce worn Cloath a year (in compliance with the Court) for the Mourning of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, but that Silks were already grown into such contempt with every one, that a man so clad, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Concluded a Citizen. The Silks were divided betwixt the Physicians, and Chirurgeons, and though all other people almost went in the same habit, there was notwithstanding in one thing or other, sufficient distinction of the calling, and conditions of men. How suddenly do
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:53645:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greasy <hi>Chamois</hi> Doublets become the fashion in our Armies, whilst all neatness and riches of habit fall into contempt? Let Kings but lead the dance, and begin to leave off this expence, and in a Month the business will be done throughout the Kingdome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Edict; we shall all follow. It should be rather proclaim'd on the contrary, that no one should wear Scarlet, or Gold-smiths work, but Whores and Tumblers. <hi>Zeleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> with the like invention reclaim'd the corrupted manners of the <hi>Locrians.</hi> Whose Lawes were, that no free woman should be allow'd any more than one Maid to follow her unless she was drunk: nor was to stir out of the City by night, wear Jewels of Gold about her, or go in an Embroidred Robe, unless she was a profest and publick Whore: The Bravo's, and Ruffians except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no man was to wear a Gold Ring, nor be seen in one of those effeminate Vests wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the City of <hi>Miletum.</hi> By which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous exceptions, he discreetly diverted his Citizens, from Superfluities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious pleasures, and it was a project of grean Utility to attract men by honour, and Ambition to their Duty and Obedience.

Whatever is done at Court passes for a rule through the rest of <hi>France.</hi> Let the Courtiers but fall out with these abominable Breeches, that discover so much of those parts should be concealed: These great Bellied Doublets, that make us look like I know not what; and are so unfit to admit of Arms; these long effeminate Locks of Hair: This foolish Custom of Kissing, what we present to our equals and our Hands in saluting them; a ceremony in former times only due to Princes: And that a Gentleman shall appear in place of respect without his Sword, unbuttoned and untrust, as though he came from the House of Office; and that contrary to the custom of our Fore-fathers, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priviledge of the Nobless of this Kingdom, we shall stand a long time bare to them in what place soever, and the same to a hundred others, so many Tierces and Quarts of Kings we have got now a days, and also other the like innovations, and degenerate customs; they will see them all presently Vanisht and Cry'd down. These are, 'tis true, but superficial Errours; but however of ill consequence, and 'tis enough to inform us that the whole Fabrick is Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy and Tottering, when we see the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast of our Walls to cleave and split. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Laws, esteems nothing of more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiferous consequence to his City, than to

give Young-Men the liberty of introducing any change in their Habits, Gestures, Dances, Songs, and Exercises, from one form to another; shifting from this to that, Hunting after Novelties, and applauding the Inventors; by which means Manners are corrupted, and the old institutions come to be nauseated and despised. In all things saving only in those that are evil a change is to be fear'd; even the change of Seasons, Winds, Viands, and Humours. And no Laws are in their true credit, but such to which God has given so long a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, that no one knows their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or that there ever was any other.</p>

I have taken notice, as of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing of some great Men, who in the highest Enterprizes, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Dangers, have detain'd themselves in so settled and serene a Calm, as not at all to hinder their usual Gayety, or break their Sleep. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, on the Day assigned for that furious Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and <hi>Darius,</hi> slept so profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and so long in the Morning, that <hi>Parmenio</hi> was forc't to enter his Chamber, and coming to his Bedside to call him seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times by his Name, the time to go to Fight compelling him so to do. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Otho,</hi> having put on a resolution to Kill himself the same night, after having settled his Domestick affairs, divided his Money amongst his Servants, and set a good edge upon a Sword he had made choice of for the purpose, and now staying only to be satisfied whether all his friends were retir'd in safety, he fell into so sound a sleep, that the Gentlemen of his Chamber heard him Snore. The death of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour has in it circumstances parallelling that of the great <hi>Cato,</hi> and particularly this before related: For <hi>Cato</hi> being ready
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:53645:274"/>
to dispatch himself, whilst he only staid his hand in expectation of the return of a messenger he had sent, to bring him news whether the <hi>Senators</hi> he had sent away, were put out from the Port of <hi>Vtica,</hi> he fell into so sound a sleep, that they had him into the next Room; and he whom he had sent to the Port, having awak'd him to let him know, that the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous Weather had hindred the <hi>Senators</hi> from putting to Sea; he dispatcht away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother messenger, and composing himself again in the Bed, settled again to sleep, and did so, till by the return of the last messenger, he had certain intelligence they were gone. We may here further compare him with <hi>Alexander</hi> too, in that great and dangerous Storm that threatned him by the Sedition of the Tribune <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> who attempting to publish a Decree for the calling in of <hi>Pompey</hi> with his Army into the City, at the time of <hi>Catilines</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, was only, and that stoutly oppos'd by <hi>Cato,</hi> so that very sharp language and bitter menaces past betwixt them in the Senate about that affair; but it was the next day in the Fore-Nune, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie was to be decided; where <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> besides the favour of the people, and of <hi>Caesar,</hi> (at that time of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Faction) was to appear accompanied with a Rabble of Slaves and Fencers; and <hi>Cato</hi>
                        <pb n="531" facs="tcp:53645:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only fortified with his own Courage and Constancy; so that his Relations, Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and several vertuous people of his Friends were in great apprehensions for him. And to that Degree, that some there were who past over the whole Night without Sleep, Eating, or Drinking, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest danger they saw him running into; of which his Wife and Sisters did nothing but Weep, and torment themselves in his House; whereas he, on the contrary, Comforted every one, and after having Supp'd after his usual manner, went to Bed, and slept profoundly till Morning, that one of his fellow <hi>Tribunes</hi> rouz'd him to go to the encounter. The knowledge we have of the greatness of this Mans Courage by the rest of his Life, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us securerly to judge, that his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proceeded from a soul so much eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above such accidents, that he disdain'd to let it take any more hold of his Fancy, than any other ordinary adventure. In the Naval Engagement, that <hi>Augustus</hi> won of <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> just as they were to begin the Fight he was so fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, that his Friends were compell'd to wake him to give the Signal of Battel: And this was it that gave <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards occasion to reproach him, that he had not the Courage so much as with open Eyes, to behold the order of his own
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:53645:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Squadrons, and not to have dar'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himself before the Souldiers, till first <hi>Agrippa</hi> had brought him news of the Victory obtain'd. But as to the business of young <hi>Marius,</hi> who did much worse (for the day of the last Battel against <hi>Sylla,</hi> after he had order'd his Army, given the word and Signal of Battel, he laid him down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shade of a Tree to repose himself, and fell so fast asleep, that the Rout, and Fight of his Men could hardly wake him, having seen nothing of the Fight) he is said to have been at that time so extreamly spent, and worn out with Labour and want of Sleep, that Nature could hold out no longer. Now upon what has been said, the Physicians may determine, whether sleep be so necessary that our lives depend upon it: for we read that King <hi>Perseus</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> being Prisoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> was wak'd to Death; but <hi>Pliny</hi> instances such as have lived long without sleep. <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of Nations, where the Men sleep and wake by half years: And they who write the Life of the Wise <hi>Epimenides,</hi> affirm that he slept seven and fifty years together.</p>

                     <p>OUr Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> is remarkable for several extraordinary accidents: But such as have no great kindness for the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> nor do much favour his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, are willing to have him thought too blame, and that his making a Halt and delaying time with this Forces he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whilst the Constable who was General of the Army was Rackt through and through with the Enemies Artillery, his Battalion Routed, and himself taken Prisoner; is not to be excus'd: And that he had much better have ran the hazard of charging the Enemy in the Flank, than staying for the advantage of falling in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rear, to suffer so great and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a loss. But, besides what the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent demonstrated, who will consider it without passion or prejudice, will easily be induced to confess, that the aim and design not of a Captain only, but of every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldier ought to look at the Victory in general; and that no particular occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, how nearly soever they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:53645:276"/>
his own interest, should divert him from that pursuit. <hi>Philopemen</hi> in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with <hi>Machanidas,</hi> having sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good strong party of his Archers, to begin the Skirmish, which were by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy Routed, and pursu'd; who pursuing them, and pushing on the Fortune of their Arms in the heat of Victory; and in that pursuit passing by the Battalion where <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopemen</hi> was, though his Souldiers were impatient to fall on, yet he was better temper'd, and did not think fit to stir from his post, nor to present himself to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to relieve his Men, but having suffer'd them to be chaste about the Field, and Cut in pieces before his Face, then charged in upon their Battalion of Foot, when he saw them left Naked by their Horse; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that they were <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> yet taking them in the nick, when think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves secure of the Victory, they began to disorder their Ranks, he did his business with great facility, and then put himself in pursuit of <hi>Machanidas.</hi> Which case is very like that of <hi>Monsieur de Guise</hi>: In that Bloody Battel betwixt <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and the <hi>Baeotians,</hi> which <hi>Zenophon,</hi> who was present at it, reports to be the rudest and most Bloody that he had ever seen: <hi>Agesilaus</hi> wav'd the advantage that Fortune presented him, to let the <hi>Baeotians</hi> Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pass by, and then to charge them in
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:53645:276"/>
the Rear, how certain soever he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Victory: Judging it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be an effect of Conduct than Valour, to proceed that way: And therefore, to shew his prowess, rather chose with a wonderful ardour of Courage, to charge them in the Front; but he was well beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and wounded for his pains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd at last to disengage himself, and to take the course he had at first neglected; opening his Battalion to give way to this torrent of the <hi>Baeotians</hi> fury and being past by, taking notice that they march'd in disorder, like men that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of danger, he then pursu'd, and charg'd them in their Flanks and Rear; yet could not so prevail as to bring it to so general a Rout, but that they leisurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, still Facing about upon him, till they were retired into safety.</p>

                     <p>WHat variety of Herbs soever are shuffled together in the Dish, yet the whole Mass is swallow'd up in one name of a Sallet. In line manner, under
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:53645:277"/>
the consideration of Names, I will make a hodg-podg of differing Articles. Every Nation has certain Names, that, I know not why, are taken in no good sense, as with us, <hi>John, William,</hi> and <hi>Benoist.</hi> In the Genealogy of Princes, also there seems to be certain Names fatally affected, as the <hi>Ptolomies</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Henry</hi>'s of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Charles</hi>'s of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Williams</hi> of our Ancient <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> from whence, 'tis said, the Name of <hi>Guyenne</hi> has its derivation; which would seem far fetch'd, were there not as rude derivations in <hi>Plato</hi> himself. 'Tis a very frivolous thing in it self, but nevertheless worthy to be Recorded for the strangeness of it, which is writ by an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness; that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> making a great Feast in <hi>France,</hi> the concourse of Nobility and Gentry was so great, that being, for Sports sake, divided into Troops, according to their Names, in the first Troop, which consisted of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> there were found an Hundred and Ten Knights sitting at the Table of that Name, without reckoning the ordinary Gentlemen, and their Servants. It is as pleasant to distinguish the Tables by the Names of the Guests, as it was in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Geta,</hi> to distinguish the several Courses of his Meat, by the first Letters
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:53645:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Meats themselves, where those that began with B, were serv'd up together, as Brawn, Beef, Breame, Bustards and Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca-ficos, and so of others. Now there is a saying, that it is a good thing to have a good Name, that is to say, Credit, and a good Repute: But besides this, it is really convenient, to have such a Name as is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of pronunciation, and easie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; by reason, that Kings, and other great Persons, do by that means the more easily know, and the more hardly forget us; and indeed, of our own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we more frequently call and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy those, whose Names are most ready upon the Tongue. I my self have seen <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, when he could not for his heart hit of a Gentlemans Name of our Country of <hi>Gascony</hi>; and moreover, was fain to call one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, by the general Name of her Family, her own being so difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or remember. And <hi>Socrates</hi> thinks it worthy a Fathers Care, to give fine Names to his Children. 'Tis said, that the Foundation of <hi>Nostre Dame la Grande,</hi> at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> took its Original from hence, that a Debauch'd Young Fellow formerly Living in that place, having got to him a Whore, and at her first coming in, asking her Name, and being answer'd, that it was <hi>Mary,</hi> he felt himself so suddenly darted
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:53645:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through with the Awe of Religion, and the Reverence to that Sacred Name of the Blessed Virgin, that he not only imedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put his Lewd Mistress away from him, but became a reformed Man, and so continued the remainder of his Life: And that in consideration of this Miracle, there was Erected upon the place, where this Young Mans House stood, first a Chappel Dedicated to our Lady, and afterwards the Church that we now see standing there. This Auricular Reproof wrought upon the Conscience, and that right into the Soul: This that follows, insinuated it self meerly be the sense. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being in company with some wild Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and perceiving that, heated with the Feast, they complotted to go Violate an Honest House, commanded the Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wench to alter her Wanton Airs; and by a Solemn, Grave and Spondaick Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, gently enchanted and laid asleep their Ardour. Will not Posterity say, that our Modern Reformation has been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully exact, in having not only scuffled with, and overcome Errours and Vices, and fill'd the World with Devotion, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Obedience, Peace, and all sorts of Vertue; but to have proceeded so far, as to quarrel with the Ancient Baptismal Names of <hi>Charles, Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> to fill the World with <hi>Methusalems, Ezekiels,</hi>

and <hi>Malachies,</hi> of a more Scriptural sound? A Gentleman, a Neighbour of mine, a great Admirer of Antiquity, and who was always preferring the Excellency of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Times, in comparison with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age of ours, did not (amongst the rest) forget to Magnifie the Lofty and Magnificent sound of the Gentlemen's Names of those Days, <hi>Don Grumedan, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dregan, Angesilan,</hi> &amp;c. which but to hear Nam'd, he perceiv'd to be other kind of Men, than <hi>Pierre, Guillot</hi> and <hi>Michel.</hi> I am mightily pleas'd with <hi>Jaques Amiot,</hi> for leaving throughout a whole <hi>French</hi> Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Latine</hi> Names entire, without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and dissecting them, to give them a <hi>French</hi> termination. It seem'd a little harsh and rough at first: But already Custom, by the Authority of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> (whom he took for his Example) has overcome that Novelty. I have often wish'd, that such as write Chronical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Latine,</hi> would leave our Names as they find them, and as they are, and ought to be, for in making <hi>Vaudemont, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemontances,</hi> and Metamorphosing Names, to make them suit better with the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> we know not where we are, and with the persons of the Men, lose the benefit of the Story. To conclude, 'tis a scurvy Custom, and of very ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that we have in our Kingdom of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:53645:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>France,</hi> to call every one by the Name of his Mannor, or Seigneury, and the thing in the World that does the most prejudice, and confound Families and Descents. A Younger Brother of a good Family, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Mannor left him by his Father, by the Name of which he has been known and Honour'd, cannot handsomely leave it; Ten Years after his Decease, it falls into the hand of a stranger, who does the same: Do but judg whereabouts we shall be, concerning the knowledg of these Men. We need look no further for Examples, than our own Royal Family, where every Partage creates a new Sir-name, whilst in the mean time the Original of the Family is totally lost. There is so great liberty taken in these Mutations, that I have not in my time seen any one advanc'd by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to any extraordinary condition, who has not presently had Genealogick Titles added to him, new, and unknown to his Father, and who has not been innoculated into some illustrious Stem; and by good Luck, the obscurest Families, are the most proper for Falsification. How many Gentlemen have we in <hi>France,</hi> who, by their own talk, are of Royal Extraction? More I think, than who will confess they are not. Was it not a pleasant passage of a Friend of mine? There were a great many Gentlemen assembled together, about
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:53645:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the dispute of one Lord of a Mannor, with another; which other had in truth, some preheminence of Titles and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, above the ordinary Scheme of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Upon the Debate of this Priority of Place, every one standing up for himself, to make himself equal to him, alledging one one Extraction, another another, one the near resemblance of Name, another of Arms, another an old worm-eaten Patent, and the least of them, Great-Granchild to some Foreign King. When they came to sit down to Dinner, my Friend, instead of taking his place amongst them, retiring with most profound Congees, entreated the Company to excuse him, for having hitherto Liv'd with them at the sawcy rate of a Companion; but being now better inform'd of their Quality, he would begin to pay them the Respect due to their Birth and and Grandeur, and that it would ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to sit down among so many Princes; and ended the Farce with a Thousand Reproaches. Let us in Gods Name satisfie our selves with what our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were contented, and with what we are: We are great enough, if we rightly understand how to maintain it: Let us not disown the Fortune and Condition of our Ancestors, and lay aside these Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretences; that can never be wanting to any one that has the Impudence to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:53645:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them. Arms have no more Security, than Sir-names. I bear <hi>Azure powdered with Trefoiles, Or, with a Lyons Paw of the same armed gules in Fesse.</hi> What privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to continue particularly in my House and Name? A Son-in-Law will transport it into another Family; or some paltry Purchaser will make them his first Arms; there is nothing wherein there is more change, and confusion. But this consideration leads me perforce into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subject. Let us pry a little narrowly into, and in Gods name examine upon what foundation we erect this Glory and Reputation, for which the World is turn'd topsy turvy: Wherein do we place this Renown, that we hunt after with so great flagrancry, and through so many impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and so much trouble? It is in conclusion, <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>William</hi> that carries it, takes it into his possession, and whom it only concerns. O what a valiant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is hope, that in a mortal subject, and in a moment makes nothing of usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinity and immensity, and of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying her Masters indigence at her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with all things he can imagine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire! Nature has given us this passion for a pretty toy to play withal. And this <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> what is it but a sound when all is done? or three or four dashes with a Pen, so easie to be varied, that I would

The chace is there in very good earnest: The question is, which of these Letters is to be rewarded for so many Sieges, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, Wounds, Imprisonments, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> by this famous Constable. <hi>Nicholas Denisot</hi> never concern'd himself further than the Letters of his name, of which he has altered the whole Contexture to build up by Anagram the Count of <hi>Alsinois,</hi> whom he has cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with the utmost force, and glory of his <hi>Poetry,</hi> and <hi>Painting.</hi> And the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian <hi>Suetonius</hi> could be satisfied with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he Writ, unless it might redound to his own particular honour, which made him casheer his fathers Sirname <hi>Leuis,</hi> to leave <hi>Tranquillus</hi> Successor to the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his writings.

But withal, what better opportunity can he expect, than that he has lost? 'Tis not here, as in Fencing, where the most hits gain the Prize: For so long as the Enemy is on foot, the Game is new to begin, and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:53645:283" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is not to be call'd a Victory, that puts not an end to the War.

But why may not a man also argue on the contrary, that it is the effect of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous, and insatiate Spirit, not to know how to bound, and restrain its ardour: that it is to abuse the favours of God to exceed the measure he has prescrib'd them: and that again to throw a mans self into danger, after a Victory obtain'd, is again to expose himself to the mercy of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and that it is one of the greatest discretions in the Rule of War, not to drive an Enemy to despair. <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> in the Associate War having defeated the <hi>Marsians</hi>; seeing yet a Body of Reserve, that prompted by Despair, was coming on like enraged Brutes to charge in upon them, thought it not convenient to stand their charge.

that it is to a Souldier an enflaming of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and a spur to Glory, to see himself brave; and withal an imitation to be more obstinate in Fight, having his Arms, which are in a manner his Estate, and whole inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to defend, which is the reason (says <hi>Xenophon</hi>) why those of <hi>Asia,</hi> carried their Wives, Concubines, with their choicest Jewels, and greatest Wealth along with them to the Wars. But then these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would be as ready to stand up for the other side, that a General ought rather to render his Men careless and desperate, than to encrease their solicitude of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves: That by this means they will be in a double fear of hazarding their persons; as it will be a double temptation to the Enemy, to fight with greater reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, where so great booty and so rich spoils are to be obtain'd: And this very thing has been observ'd in former times, notably to encourage the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Samaites. Antiochus</hi> shewing <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Army he had raised wonderfully splendid, and Rich in all sorts of Equipage; askt him, if the <hi>Romans</hi> would be satisfied with that Army? Satisfied? replied the other, yes doubtless were their avarice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great. <hi>Licurgus</hi> not only forbad his Souldiers all manner of bravery in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage, but moreover to strip their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Enemies, because he would (as he
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:53645:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
said) that poverty, and frugality should shine with the rest of the Battel.</p>
                     <p>At Seiges, and elsewhere, where occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion draws us near to the Enemy, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly suffer our Men to Brave, Rate, and affront the Enemy with all sorts of injurious Language; and not without some colour of reason: For it is of no little consequence, to take from them all hopes of Mercy, and Composition, in representing to them, that there is no fair Quarter to be expected from an Enemy, they have incenc'd to that degree, nor other Remedy remaining, but in the Victory. And yet <hi>Vitellius</hi> found himself deceiv'd in this way of proceeding; for having to do with <hi>Otho,</hi> weaker in the valour of his Souldiers, of long unaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to War, and effeminated with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the City; he so nettled them at last with injurious Language, reproaching them with cowardize, and the regret of the Mistresses, and entertainments they had left behind at <hi>Rome</hi>; that by this means he inspir'd them with such resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as no exhortation had had the power to have done; and himself made them fall upon him, with whom their own Captains before could by no means prevail. And indeed when they are injuries that touch to the quick, it may very well fall out, that he who went but ill-favour'dly to work in the behalf of his Prince, will fall to't with
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:53645:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another sort of Mettle, when the quarrel is his own.</p>
                     <p>To consider of how great importance is the preservation of the General of an Army, and that the Universal aim of an Enemy is levell'd directly at the head, upon which all the others depend; the advice seems to admit of no dispute, which we know has been taken by so many great Captains of changing their habit, and disguising their persons upon the point of going to engage. Nevertheless the inconvenience a Man by so doing runs into, is not less than that he thinks to avoid: For the Captain by this means being conceal'd from the knowledge of his own Men, the courage they should derive from his Presence and Example, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by degrees to cool and to decay; and not seeing the wonted <note n="*" place="margin">As at the Battel of <hi>Ivry,</hi> in the person of <hi>Henry the Great.</hi>
                        </note> Marks, and Ensigns of their Leader, they presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him either dead, or that, despairing of the business, he is gone to shift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and experience shews us that both these ways have been both successful, and otherwise. What befel <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel he fought against the Consul <hi>Levinus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> will serve us to both purposes: For though by shrouding his person under the Arms of <hi>Demogacles,</hi> and making him wear his own, he undoubtedly preserved his own Life, yet by that very means he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al very near running into the other mischief
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53645:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of losing the Battel. <hi>Alexander, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> lov'd to make themselves known in a Battel, by rich Furnitures, and Arms of a particular lustre and colour: <hi>Agis, Agesilaus,</hi> and that great <hi>Gilippus</hi> on the contrary us'd to Fight obscurely Armed, and without any imperial attendance, or distinction.</p>
                     <p>Amongst other oversights <hi>Pompey</hi> is charg'd withal, at the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> he is condemned for making his Army stand still to receive the Enemies charge; by reason that (I shall hear steal <hi>Plutarchs</hi> own words, that are better than mine) he by so doing, depriv'd himself of the violent impression, the motion of running adds to the first shock of Arms, and hindred the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Combatants (who were wont to give great impetuosity, and fury to the first Encounter; especially when this came to rush in with their utmost vigour, their courages increasing by the Shouts and the Carreer) rendering the Souldiers animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ardour, as a man may say, more reserv'd and cold. This is what he says: But if <hi>Caesar</hi> had come by the worse, why might it not as well have been urg'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that, on the contrary the strongest, and most steady posture of Fighting, is that wherein a man stands planted firm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion; and that who makes a halt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their march, closing up, and reserving
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:53645:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their force within themselves for the push of the business, have a great advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who are disordred, and who have already spent half their breath in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on precipitously to the charge? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that an Army being a Body made up of so many individual members, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for it to move in this fury with so exact a motion, as not to break the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Battel, and that the best of Foot are not engag'd, before their fellows can come in to relieve them. In that unnatural Battel betwixt the two <hi>Persian</hi> Brothers, the <hi>Lacedemonian Clearchus,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> party, led them on softly, and without precipitation to the Charge; but coming within fifty paces hurried them on full speed, hoping in so short a Carreer, both to look to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to husband their breath, and at the same time to give an advantage of violence, and impression both to their persons, and their missile Arms: Others have regulated this question in charging thus; if your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy come running upon you, stand firm to receive him; if he stand to receive you, run full drive upon him.</p>
                     <p>In the expedition of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth into <hi>Provence,</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> was put to choose either to go meet him in <hi>Italy,</hi> or to expect him in his own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; wherein, though he very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53645:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of how great advantage it was, to preserve his own territories entire, and clear from the troubles, and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the War, to the end that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhausted of her stores, it might continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally supply Men, and Money at need, that the necessity of War requires at every turn to spoil, and lay waste the Country before them, which cannot very well be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ones own; to which may be added that the Country people do not so easily digest such a havock by those of their own party, as from an Enemy, so that seditions and commotions might by such means be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongst us; that the Licence of Pillage and Plunder (which are not to be tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at home) is a great ease and refreshment against the fatigues, and sufferings of War; and that who has no other prospect of gain, than his bare pay, will hardly be kept from running home, being but two steps from his Wife, and his own House: That he who lays the Cloath, is ever at the charge of the Feast: That there is more alacrity in assaulting than defending, and that the shock of a Battels loss in our own Bowels, is so violent as to endanger the disjointing of the whole Body, there being no passion so contagious as that of fear; that is so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily believ'd, or that so suddenly diffuses its Poison; and that the Cities that should hear the Rattle of this Tempest, that should
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:53645:287"/>
take in their Captains, and Souldiers yet trembling and out of breath, would be in danger in this heat and hurry, to precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themselves upon some untoward reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Notwithstanding all this, so it was, that he chose to recall the Forces he had beyond the Mountains, and to suffer the Enemy to come to him. For he might on the other side imagine, that being at home and amongst his Friends, he could not fail of plenty of all manner of conveniences; the Rivers, and Passes he had at his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would bring him in both Provisions and Money in all security, and without the trouble of Convoy; that he should find his subjects by so much the more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to him, by how much their danger was more near and pressing; that having so many Cities and stops to secure him, it would be in his power to give the Law of Battel at his own opportunity and best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and if it pleas'd him to delay the time, that under covert, and at his own ease, he might see his Enemy founder, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat himself with the difficulties he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to encounter, being engag'd in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Country, where before, behind, and on every side War would be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; no means to refresh himself or to enlarge his Quarters, should diseases infest them, or to lodge his wounded Men in safety: No Money, no Victuals, but all
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53645:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at the point of the Launce; no leisure to repose and take breath, no knowledge of the ways, or Country to secure him from Ambushes and Surprizes: And in case of losing a Battel, no possible means of saving the remains. Neither is their want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in both these cases. <hi>Scipio</hi> thought it much better to go attacque his Enemies territories in <hi>Affrick,</hi> than to stay at home to defend his own, and to Fight him in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and it succeeded well with him: But on the contrary, <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the same War ruin'd himself, by abandoning the conquest of a strange Country, to go defend his own. The <hi>Athenians</hi> having left the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in their own Dominions, to go over into <hi>Sicily,</hi> were not favoured by Fortune in their design; but <hi>Agathocles</hi> King of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse,</hi> found her favourable to him, when he went over into <hi>Affrick,</hi> and left the War at home. By which Examples, and divers others, we are wont to conclude, and with some reason, that events especially in War, do for the most part depend upon Fortune, who will not be govern'd by, nor submit unto humane prudence; according to the Poet.

They also call'd such as were drest in such sort, that running full speed side by side without Bridle or Saddle, the <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen Arm'd at all peices, would shift, and throw themseves from the one to the other, <hi>desultorios equos.</hi> The <hi>Numidian</hi> Men at Arms, had always a Led-Horse in one Hand, besides that they Rode up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to change in the heat of Battel:<note place="margin">

There are many Horses train'd up to help their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so as to run upon any one that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with a drawn Sword, to fall both with Mouth and Heels upon any that front or oppose them: But it oft falls out, that they do more harm to their Friends, than their Enemies; considering that you cannot loose them from their hold, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them again into order, when they are once engag'd and grappled; by which means you remain at the Mercy of their senseless Quarrel. It hapned very ill to <hi>Artibius</hi> General of the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, Fighting Man to Man with <hi>Onesilus</hi> King of <hi>Salamis,</hi> to be Mounted upon a Horse drest after this manner, it being the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Death; the Squire of <hi>Onesilus</hi> cleaving him down with a Scyth betwixt the Shoulders, as the Horse was rear'd up upon his Master. And what the <hi>Italians</hi> report, that in the Battel of <hi>Fornoue,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> his Horse, with Kicks and Plunges, disengag'd his Master from the Enemy, that prest upon him, without which he
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:53645:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had been Slain, sounds odly, and he ran a very great hazard, and came strangely off; if it be true. The <hi>Mamalukes</hi> made their Boast, that they had the most ready Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of any Cavalry in the World; that by nature and custom they were taught to know and distinguish the Enemy, they were to fall foul upon with Mouth and Heels, according to a Word or Sign given: As also to gather up with their Teeth Darts and Launces scatter'd upon the Feild, and present them to their Riders, as they should have occasion to use them. 'Tis said, both of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> that amongst other excellent Qualities they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of, they were both excellent Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and particularly of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that in his Youth, being Mounted on the bare Back, without Saddle, or Bridle, he could make him run, stop and turn, and perform all his Airs, with his Hands behind him. As Nature design'd to make of his Person, and of <hi>Alexander</hi> two Miracles of Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Art, so one would say, she had done her utmost to Arm them after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner: For every one knows, that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Horse <hi>Bucephalus</hi> had a Head enclining to the shape of a Bull, that he would suffer himself to be Mounted and Govern'd by none but his Master, and that he was so Honour'd after his Death, as to have a City Erected to his Name. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
                        <pb n="546" facs="tcp:53645:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>

We Read in <hi>Xenophon</hi> a Law, forbidding any one who was Master of a Horse to Travel on Foot. <hi>Troglus</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus</hi> say, That the <hi>Parthians</hi> were wont to perform all Offices and Ceremonies, not only in War, but also all Affairs, whether publick or private, make Bargains, confer, entertain, take the Air, and all on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; and that the greatest distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Free-men and Slaves amongst them, was, that the one rode on Horseback, and the other went on Foot: An Institution of which, King <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the founder. There are several Examples in the <hi>Roman</hi> History, (and <hi>Suetonius</hi> more particularly observes it of <hi>Caesar,</hi>) of Captains, who in pressing occasions Commanded their Cavalry to alight, both by that means to take from them all hopes of Flight, as also for the advantage they hop'd for in this sort of Fight.<note place="margin">

Their Battels were much better disputed: Now adays there are nothing but Routs: <hi>primus clamor, atque impetus rem decernit.</hi> The first shout or the first charge puts an end to the business: And the Arms we choose to make use of in so great a hazard, should be as much as possible at our own command: Wherefore I should advise to choose them of the shortest sort, and such of which we are able to give the best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. A man may repose more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Sword he holds in his Hand, than in a Bullet he discharges out of a Pistol, wherein there must be a concurrence of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral executions, to make it perform its office, the Powder, the Stone, and the Wheel, if any of which fail, it at least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers your Fortune: A Man strikes much surer, than the Air directs him.

That missile Weapon which the <hi>Italians</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made use of both with Fire and without, was much more terrible: They called a certain kind of <hi>Javeline</hi> Armed at the point with an Iron three foot long, that it might pierce through and through an Armed Man, <hi>Phalarica,</hi> which they sometimes in Field-service darted by hand; sometimes from several sorts of Engines for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of beleaguered places: The shaft whereof being roul'd round with Flax, Wax, Rozin, Oyl, and other combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took Fire in its flight, and lighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body of a Man, or his Targuet, took away all the use of Arms and Limbs.

other Apes-tricks, which he got his living by.

But I find fault with their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, when it arrives to that degree of indiscretion, as to suffer themselves to be impos'd upon by authority of the present usance, as every Month to alter their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if custom so require, and that they should so vary their judgement in their own particular concern: When they wore the Belly-pieces of their Doublets up as high as their Breasts, they stifly maintain'd that they were in their proper place: some years after they were slipt down betwixt their Thighs, and then they could laugh at the former fashion as uneasy and intollerable. The fashion now in use, makes them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely condemn the other two, with so great indignation, and so universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that a Man would think, there was a certain kind of madness crept in amongst them, that infatuates their understandings, to this strange degree. Now seeing that our change of fashions is so prompt and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that the inventions of all the Taylors
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:53645:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the World, cannot furnish out new Whim-whams enow to feed our vanity withal; there will often be a necessity, that the despised ones must again come in vogue, and even those immediately after fall into the same contempt, and that the same judgement must in the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty years, take up not only different, but contrary opinions, with an incredible lightness and inconstancy: There is not any of us so cautelous and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, that suffers not himself to be gull'd with this contradiction, and both in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and internal sight to be insensibly blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will here muster up some old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, that I have in memory, some of them the same with ours, the others diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to the end, that bearing in mind this continual variation of humane things, we may have our judgements clearer, and more firmly settled: the thing in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us of fighting with Rapier and Cloak, was in practice amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> also, <hi>Sinistris sagos involvant, gladiosque di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringuunt.</hi>

cause of quarrel, if they refuse to do it: At the Baths, which the ancients made use of every day before they went to Dinner, and as frequently as we wash our Hands, they at first only bath'd their Arms and Legs; but afterwards, and by a Custom that has continued for many Ages in most Nations of the World, they bath'd stark naked in mixt and perfum'd waters, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it as a great simplicity to bath in meer water: The most delicate and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perfum'd themselves all over three or four times a day.

Fish has ever had this preeminence, and keeps it still, that the great ones all pretend to be Cooks in their favour, and indeed the taste is more delicate, than that of Flesh, at least to me. But in all sorts of magnificence, debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and voluptuous inventions of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy and expence, we do in truth all we can to parallel them, for our wills are as corrupt as theirs: but we want power to

reach them; and our force is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reach them in their vicious, than in their vertuous qualities; for both the one and the other, proceed from a vigour of soul, which was without comparison great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them, than in us: And souls, by how much the weaker they are, by so much have they less power to do or very well, or very ill: The highest place of honour amongst them was the middle; the name going before, and that following after, either in writing or speaking; had no sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Grandeur, as is evident by their writings, they will sooner say <hi>Oppius</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> than <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Oppius,</hi> and me, and thee, than thee, and me; which is the reason that made me formerly take notice in the life of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> in our French <hi>Plutarch</hi> of one passage, where it seems as if the Author, speaking of the jealousie of honour, betwixt the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> about the winning of a Battel, they had with their join'd forces obtain'd, made it of some importance, that in the <hi>Greek</hi> Songs, they had put the <hi>Aetolians</hi> before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> If there be no amphibology, or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing in the words of the <hi>French</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation; an instance of which I present you out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> though <hi>Monsieur de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi> did not think it worth repeating.

                     <p>THe Judgment is an utensil proper for all subjects, and will have an Oar in every thing: which is the reason, that in these Essays I take hold of all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Where, though it happen to be a subject I do not very well understand, I try however, sounding it at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and finding it too deep for my stature, I keep me on the firm shoar: and this knowledge that a Man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, is one effect of its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, even in the most inconsidering sort of men. One while in an idle and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous subject, I try to find out matter whereof to compose a body, and then to prop, and support it. Another while I employ it in a noble subject, one that has been tost and tumbled by a thousand hands, wherein a Man can hardly possibly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any thing of his own, the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so beaten on every side, that he must of necessity walk in the steps of another. In such a case, 'tis the work of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take the way that seems best, and of a thousand paths, to determine
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:53645:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that this or that, was the best chosen. I leave the choice of my arguments to Fortune, and take that the first presents me; they are all alike to me, I never design to go through any of them; for I never see all of any thing: Neither do they who so largely promise to shew it others. Of a hundred Members and Faces that every thing has, I take one, one while to look it over only, another while to ripple up the Skin, and sometimes to pinch it to the Bones: I give a stab, not so wide, but as deep as I can; and am for the most part, tempted to take it in hand by some absolute gracefulness I discover in it. Did I know my self less, I might perhaps ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to handle something or other to the bottom, and to be deceiv'd in my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, but sprinkling here one word, and there another, Patterns cut from several Pieces, and scatter'd without design, and without engaging my self too far, I am not responsible for them, or oblig'd to keep close to my subject, without varying at my own liberty and pleasure, and giving up my self to doubt and incertainty, and to my own governing Method, Ignorance. All Motion discovers us. The very same Soul of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that made it self so Conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Marshalling and Commanding the Battle of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> was also seen as Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and Busie in the softer Affairs of Love.

A Man makes a Judgment of a Horse, not only by seeing his Menage in his Airs, but by his very walk, nay, and by seeing him stand in the Stable. Amongst the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Soul, there are some of a lower and meaner Form, who does not see her in those Inferiour Offices, as well as those of Nobler Note, never fully discover her; and peradventure, she is best discover'd, where she moves her own natural pace. The Winds of Passions take most hold of her in her highest flights; and, the rather, by reason that she wholely applys her self to, and exercises her whole Vertue upon every particular subject, and never handles more than one thing at a time, and that not according to it, but according to her self. Things in respect to themselves, have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure their Weight, Measures and Conditions; but when we once take them into us, the Soul forms them as she pleases. Death is Terrible to <hi>Cicero,</hi> Coveted by <hi>Cato,</hi> and Indifferent to <hi>Socrates.</hi> Health, Conscience, Authority, Knowledg, Riches, Beauty, and their contraries, do all strip themselves at their entring into us, and receive a new Robe, and of another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, from every distinct Soul, and of what Colour, Brown, Bright, Green, Dark and Quality, Sharp, Sweet, Deep, or Superficial, as best pleases them, for they are not yet agreed upon any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:53645:303" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Standard of Forms, Rules, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; every one is a Queen in her own Dominions. Let us therefore no more excuse our selves upon the External Qualities of things, it belongs to us to give our selves an account of them. Our good or ill, has no other dependance, but on our selves. 'Tis there that our Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and our Vows are due, and not to Fortune: She has no power over our Manners, on the contrary, they draw, and make her follow in their Train, and cast her in their own Mould. Why should not I Censure <hi>Alexander,</hi> Roaring and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the prodigious rate he sometimes us'd to do? Or, if he plaid at Chess, what string of his Soul was not touch'd by this Idle and Childish Game? I hate and avoid it, because it is not Play enough, that it is too grave and serious a Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I am asham'd to lay out as much Thought and Study upon that, as would serve to much better uses. He did not more pump his Brains about his Glorious Expedition into the <hi>Indies</hi>; and another that I will not name, took not more pains to unravel a passage, upon which depends the safety of all Mankind. To what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then does this ridiculous Diversion molest the Soul, when all her Faculties shall be summon'd together upon this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Account? And how fair an oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:53645:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
she herein gives every one to know, and to make a right Judgment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? I do not more throughly sift my self in any other posture, than this. What Passion are we exempted from in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant Game? Anger, Spite, Malice, Impatience, and a vehement desire of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the better in a concern, wherein it were more excusable, to be Ambitious of being overcome: For to be Eminent, and to excel above the common rate in frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things, is nothing graceful in a Man of Quality and Honour. What I say in this Example, may be said in all others. Every Particle, every Employment of Man, does Exalt or Accuse him, equally with any other. <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were two Philosophers, of which, the first finding Humane Condition Ridiculous and Vain, never appear'd abroad, but with a Jeering and Laughing Countenance: Whereas <hi>Heraclitus</hi> Commiserating that Condition of ours, appear'd always with a Sorrowful Look, and Tears in his Eyes.

I am clearly for the first Humour; not because it is more pleasant to Laugh, than to Weep; but because it is Ruder, and expresses more Contempt, than the other; because I think we can never be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly despis'd to our desert. Compassion and Bewailing, seem to imploy some Esteem of, and Value for the thing Bemoan'd: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the things we Laugh at, are by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest to be of no Moment or Repute. I do not think that we are so Unhappy, as we are Vain, or have in us so much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as Folly; we are not so full of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as Inanity: Nor so Miserable, as we are Vile and Mean. And therefore <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who past away his time in rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself in his Tub, and made nothing of the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> esteeming us no better than Flies or Bladders puft up with Wind, was a sharper, and more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and consequently in my opinion, a juster Judg, than <hi>Timon</hi> Sir-nam'd the <hi>Man-Hater</hi>; for what a Man hates he lays to Heart: This last was an Enemy to all Mankind, did positively desire our Ruin, and avoided our Conversation as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, proceeding from Wicked and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Natures: The other valued us so little, that we could neither trouble, nor infect him by our Contagion; and left us to Herd with one another, not out of Fear, but Contempt of our Society: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

at the Answer of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> when enquiring of him, which was the better Wrestler, <hi>Pericles,</hi> or he<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he reply'd, that it was hard to affirm; for when I have thrown him, said he, he always perswades the Spectators, that he had no fall, and carries away the Prize. They who Paint, Pounce and Plaister up the Ruins of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, filling up their Wrinckles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, are less to blame; because it is no great matter, whether we see them in their Natural Complexions, or no: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as these make it their business to deceive not our sight only, but our Judgments, and to Adulterate and Corrupt the very Essence of things. The Republicks that have maintain'd themselves in a Regular and well Modell'd Government, such as those of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> had Orators in no very great Esteem. <hi>Aristo</hi> did wisely define <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to be a Science to perswade the People; <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> an Art to Flatter and Deceive: And those who deny it in the general description, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it throughout in their Precepts. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> will not suffer their Children to be Instructed in it, as being useless, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> perceiving of how pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consequence the Practice of it was, it being in their City of universal Esteem, order'd the principal part, which is to move Affections, with their Exordiums

and Perorations, to be taken away. 'Tis an Engine invented, to manage and govern a disorderly and tumultuous Rabble, and that never is made use of, but like Physick to the Sick, in the Paroxisms of a discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Estate. In those, where the Vulgar, or the ignorant, or both together, have been all powerful, and able to give the Law, as in those of <hi>Athens, Rodes</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and where the Publick Affairs have been in a continual Tempest of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to such places have the Orators al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repair'd. And in truth, we shall find few persons in those Republicks, who have push'd their Fortunes to any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Eminence, without the assistance of Elocution: <hi>Pompey, Caesar, Crassus, Lucullus, Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Metellus,</hi> have thence taken their chiefest Spring, to mount to that degree of Authority, to which they did at last arrive: Making it of greater use of them, than Arms, contrary to the opinion of better times. For <hi>L. Volumnius</hi> speaking publickly in favour of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi> and <hi>Pub.

The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Eloquent and Learned, are only good for the City, to make Praetors of, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Justice. Eloquence Flourish'd most

at <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Publick Affairs were in the worst condition, and the Republick most disquieted with intestine Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a frank and untill'd Soil bears the worst Weeds. By which it should seem, that a Monarchical Government has less need of it, than any other: For the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and Facility, natural to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, and that render them subject to be turn'd and twin'd, and led by the Ears, by this charming harmony of words, without weighing or considering the truth and realty of things by the force of reason: This Facility, I say, is not easily found in a single person, and it is also more easie by good Education and Advice, to secure him from the impression of this Poison.

He brag'd, that he had never worn a Gown that cost above Ten Crowns, nor had ever sent above Ten Pence to the Market for one Days Provision, and that as to his Country Houses, he had not one that was rough cast on the outside. <hi>Scypio Aemylia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> after two Triumphs, and two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul-ships, went an Embassy with no more than Seven Servants in his Train.

Is it not a singular testimony of Imperfection, that we cannot establish our satisfaction in any one thing, and that even our own Fancy and Desire, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the power to choose what is most proper and useful for us? A very good proof of this, is the great Dispute that has ever been amongst the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, of finding out a Man's principal and soveraign Good, that continues yet, and will eternally continue, without Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Accord.

mention'd in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> I am mightily pleas'd with the humour of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, having a Man brought before him, that had learn'd to throw a Grain of Millet with such dexterity and assurance, as never to miss the Eye of a Needle; and being afterwards entreated to give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the reward of so rare a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, he pleasantly, and in my opinion, ingeniously order'd a certain number of Bushels of the same Grain to be deliver'd to him, that he might not want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to exercise so famous an Art. 'Tis a strong evidence of a weak Judgment, when Men approve of things for their being rare and new, or yet for the difficulty; where Vertue and Usefulness are not conjoin'd to recommend them. I come just now from playing with my own Family, at who could find out the most things, that had their principal force in their two Extremities; as, <hi>Sire,</hi> which is a Title given to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est person in the Nation, the King, and also to the Vulgar, as Merchants and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, but never to any degree of Men between. The Women of great Quality are call'd <hi>Madams,</hi> inferiour Gentlewomen, <hi>Mademoiselles,</hi> and the meanest sort of Women, <hi>Madams,</hi> as the first. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of State over Tables are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but in the Pallaces of Princes, and Taverns. <hi>Democritus</hi> said, that Gods and
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:53645:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beasts, had a more exact and perfect sense, than Men, who are of a middle Form. The <hi>Romans</hi> wore the same Habit at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Feasts; and it is most certain, that an extream Fear, and an extream Ardour of Courage, do equally trouble and lax the Belly. The Nickname of Trembling, with which they Sirnam'd <hi>Sancho</hi> the XII. King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> sufficiently informeth, that Valour will cause a trembling in the Limbs, as well as Fear. The Friends of that King, or of some other person, who upon the like occasion was wont to be in the same disorder, try'd to compose him, by representing the danger less, he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to engage himself in: You understand me ill, said he, for could my Flesh know the danger my Courage will presently car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it into, it would sink down to the ground. The faintness that surprizes us from Frigidity, or dislike in the exercises of <hi>Venus,</hi> are also occasion'd by a too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent desire, and an immoderate heat. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Coldness, and extream Heat, Boil and Roast. <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, that Sows of Lead will melt, and run with Cold, and the extreamity of Winter, as with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Heat. Desire and Saciety fill all the gradations above and below Pleasure with Grief. Brutality and Wisdom meet in the same Center of Sentiment and Resolution, in the suffering of Humane Accidents; the
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:53645:312" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wise Controul and Triumph over ill, the others know it not: These last are, as a Man may say, on this side of Accidents, the other are beyond them; who after having well weigh'd and consider'd their Qualities, measur'd and judg'd them what they are, by vertue of a vigorous Soul leap out of their reach. They disdain and trample them under foot, having a solid and well fortified Soul, against which the Darts of Fortune coming to strike, they must of necessity rebound, and blunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, meeting with a Body upon which they can fix no Impression; the ordinary and middle condition of Men, are lodg'd betwixt these two Extremities, consisting of such, who perceive Evils, feel them, and are not able to support them. Infancy and Decrepitude meet in the imbecillity of the Brain; Avarice and Profusion in the same thirst and desire of getting. A Man may say with some colour of truth, that there is an <hi>Abecedarian</hi> ignorance that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes knowledge, and a <hi>Doctoral</hi> Ignorance that comes after it; an Ignorance that knowledge does create and beget, at the same time that she dispatches and destroys the first. Of mean understandings, little inquisitive, and little instructed, are made good Christians, who by reverence and obedience implicitely believe, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in their belief. In the moderate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:53645:312" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the middle sort of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, the error of Opinions is begot, and they have some colour of reason on their side, to impute our walking on in the old beaten path to simplicity, and brutishness, I mean in us who have not inform'd our selves by Study. The higher, and nobler Souls, more solid and clear sighted, make up another sort of true believers: who by a long and Religious investigation of truth, have obtain'd a clearer, and more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, light into the Scriptures, and have discover'd the Mysterious and Divine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of our Ecclesiastical Polity. And yet we see some, who by this middle step, are arriv'd to that supream degree with marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fruit, and Confirmation; as to the utmost limit of Christian intelligence, and enjoying their victory with great Spiritual consolation, humble acknowledgment of the Divine favour, examplary reformation of manners, and Singular modesty. I do not intend with these to rank some others, who to clear themselves from all suspicion of their former Errours, and to satisfie us, that they are sound and firm to us, render themselves extream indiscreet and unjust, in the carrying on our Cause, and by that means blemish it with infinite Reproaches of Violence and Oppression. The simple Peasants are good People, and so are the Philosophers: Men of strong and clear
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:53645:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Reason, and whose Souls are enrich'd with an ample instruction of profitable Sciences. The <hi>Mongrets</hi> who have disdain'd the first form of the Ignorance of Letters, and have not been able to attain to the other, (sitting betwixt two Stools, as I, and a great many more of us do,) are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, foolish and importunate; these are they that trouble the World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that I, for my own part, retreat as much as I can towards my first and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Station, from whence I so vainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to advance. The vulgar and purely natural Poesie, has in it certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties and Graces, by which she may come into some comparison with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Beauty of a Poesie perfected by Art: As is evident in our <hi>Gascon</hi> Villanels and Songs, that are brought us from Nations that have no knowledg of any manner of Science, nor so much as the use of Writing. The indifferent and middle sort of Poesie betwixt these two, is dispis'd, of no Value, Honour or Esteem. But seeing that the Ice being once broken, and a Path laid open to the Fancy, I have found, as it commonly falls out, that what we make choice of for a rare and difficult Subject, proves to be nothing so, and that after the invention is once warm, it finds out an infinite number of parallel Examples, I shall only add this one; That were these Essays
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:53645:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mine considerable enough to deserve a Censure, it might then I think fall out, that they would not much take with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vulgar Capacities, nor be very acceptable to the singular and excellent sort of Men, for the first would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them enough, and the last too much, and so they might hover in the middle Region.</p>

Of Smells, the simple and natural seem to be most pleasing. Let the Ladies look to that, for 'tis chiefly their concern. In the wildest parts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the <hi>Scythian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, after Bathing, were wont to Powder and Crust their Faces, and whole Bodies, with a certain Odoriferous Drug, growing in their own Territories; which being cleans'd off, when they came to have familiarity with Men, they were found
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:53645:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Perfum'd and Sleek: 'Tis not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, how strangely all sorts of Odours cleave to me, and how apt my Skin is to imbibe them. He that complains of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that she has not furnish'd Mankind with a Vehicle to convey Smells to the Nose, had no reason; for they will do it themselves; especially to me: My very Mustachio's perform that Office; for if I stroak them but with my Gloves, or Handkerchief, the Smell will not out a whole Day: They will Reproach me where I have been; the close, luscious, devouring and melting Kisses of Youthful Ardour, would in my Wanton Age have left a Sweetness upon my Lips for several Hours after. And yet I have ever found my self very little subject to Epidemick Diseases, that are caught, either by conversing with the Sick, or bred by the contagion of the Air; I have very well escap'd from those of my time, of which there has been seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virulent sorts in our Cities and Armies. We Read of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that though he never departed from <hi>Athens,</hi> during the frequent Plagues that infested that City, he only was never Infected. Physicians might (I believe,) if they would extract greater Utility from Odours, than they do; for I have often observ'd, that they cause an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in me, and work upon my Spirits according to their several Vertues; which
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53645:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
makes me approve of what is said, namely, that the use of Incence and Perfumes in Churches, so Ancient, and so universally receiv'd in all Nations, and Religions, was intended to chear us, and to rouse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Senses, the better to fit us for Contemplation. I could have been glad, the better to judg of it, to have tasted the Culinary Art of those Cooks, who had so rare a way of Seasoning Exatick Odours with the relish of Meats; As it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly observ'd in the Service of the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who in our Days Landed at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> to have an interview with <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, where his Dishes were far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'d with Odoriferous Drugs, to that degree of Expence, that the Cookery of one Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, and two Pheasants, amounted to a Hundred Duckets, to dress them after their Fashion. And when the Carver came to break them up, not only the Dining-room, but all the Appartments of his Pallace, and the adjoining Streets were fill'd with an Aromatick Vapour, which did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanish. My chiefest care in chusing my Lodgings, is always to avoid a thick and stinking Air; and those Beautiful Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> have very much lessen'd the Kindness I had for them, the one by the offensive Smell of her Marshes, and the other of her Dirt.</p>

                     <p>I proprose formless and undermin'd Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, like those who publish subtle Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, to be after disputed upon in the Schools, not to Establish truth, but to seek it: I submit them to the better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those, whose Office it is to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, not my Writings and Actions only, but moreover my very Thoughts and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Let what I here set down meet with Correction or Applause, it shall be of equal welcome and utility to me, my self before hand condemning it for Absurd and Impious, if any thing shall be found through Ignorance or Inadvertency, couch'd in this Rhapsody contrary to the Resolutions and Prescriptions of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church,</hi> into which I was Born, and in which I will Die. And yet, always submitting to the Authority of their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, who have an Absolute Power over me, I thus Timerariously venture at every thing, as upon this present Subject.</p>
                     <p>I know not, if, or no, I am deceiv'd; but since by a particular favour of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53645:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Bounty, a certain Form of Prayer has been prescrib'd and dictated to us, Word by Word, from the Mouth of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I have ever been of Opinion, that we ought to have it in more frequent use, than we yet have, and if I were worthy to advise, at the sitting down to, and rising from our Tables, at our rising, and going to Bed, and in every particular Action, wherein Prayer is requir'd, I would that Christians always make use of the Lord's Prayer, if not alone, yet at least always. The Church may lengthen, or alter Prayers, according to the necessity of our Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I know very well, that it is always the same in substance, and the same thing: But yet such a preferrence ought to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that Prayer, that the People should have it continually in their Mouths; for it is most certain, that all necessary Petitions are comprehended in it, and that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely proper for all Occasions. 'Tis the only Prayer I use in all Places and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what I still repeat instead of changing; whence it also happens, that I have no other by Heart, but that only. It just now comes into my Mind, from whence we should derive that Errour of having recourse to God in all our Designs and Enterprizes, to call him to our Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in all sorts of Affairs, and in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where our Weakness stands in need of
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:53645:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
support, without considering whether the occasion be just, or otherwise, and to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Name and Power, in what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state soever we are, or Action we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in, how Vicious soever: He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our sole and only Protector, and can do all things for us: But though he is pleas'd to Honour us with his Paternal Care, he is notwithstanding, as Just, as he is Good and Mighty, and does ofter exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Justice, than his Power, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours us according to that, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Petitions. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Laws, makes Three sorts of Belief Injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Gods; That there is none; That they concern not themselves about Humane Affairs; and that they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or deny any thing to our Vows, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Sacrifices. The first of these Errours (according to his Opinion,) did never continue rooted in any Man, from his Infancy to his Old Age, the other two he confesses, Men might be Obstinate in. God's Justice and his Power are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore in vain we Invoke his Power in an Unjust Cause: We are to have our Souls pure and clean, at that Moment at least, wherein we Pray to him, and purified from all Vicious Passions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we our selves present him the Rods wherewith to Chastise us. Instead of repairing any thing we have done amiss,
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:53645:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we double the Wickedness and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whilst we offer to him, to whom we are to sue for Pardon, an Affection full of Irreverence and Hatred. Which makes me not very apt to applaud those whom I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be so frequent on their Knees, if the Actions nearest of Kin to Prayer, do not give me some Evidence of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And the Practice of a Man, that mixes Devotion with an Execrable Life, seems in some sort more to be Condemn'd, than that of a Man conformable to his own Propension, and Dissolute throughout: And for that Reason, it is, that our Church denies Admittance to, and Communion with Men Obstinate and Incorrigible in any kind of Impiety. We Pray only by custom, and for fashions sake, or rather, we read and pronounce our Prayers aloud, which is no better than an Hypocritical shew of Devotion: And I am scandaliz'd, to see a Man Cross himself Thrice at the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> and as often, at anothers say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, (and the more, because it is a
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:53645:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sign I have in great Veneration, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant use upon solemn occasions,) and to Dedicate all the other Hours of the Day to Acts of Malice, Avarice and Injustice. One Hour to God, the rest to the Devil, as if by Commutation and Consent. 'Tis a wonder to me, Actions so various in themselves, succeed one another with such an Uniformity of Method, as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfer, nor suffer any alteration<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Confines and Passes from the one to the other. What a Prodigious Conscience must that be, that can be at Quiet within it self, whilst it harbours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Roof, with so agreeing and so calm a Society, both the Crime and the Judg? A Man whose whole Meditation is continually working upon nothing but Impurity, which he knows to be so Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Almighty God, what can he say, when he comes to speak to him? He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, but immediately falls into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse. If the Object of the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and the Presence of his Maker, did, as he pretends, Strike and Chastise his Soul, how short soever the Repentance might be, the very fear of offending that Infinite Majesty, would so often present it self to his Imagination, that he would soon see himself Master of those Vices, that are most Natural and Habitual in him. But what shall we say of those, who settle their
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:53645:318" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole course of Life, upon the Profit and Emolument of Sins, which they know to be Mortal? How many Trades and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have we admitted and countenanc'd amongst us, whose very Essence is Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And he that confessing himself to me, voluntarily told me, that he had all his Life time profest and practic'd a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his Opinion Damnable, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that he had in his Heart, only to preserve his Credit, and the Honour of his Employments, how could his Courage suffer so Infamous a Confession? What can Men say to the Divine Justice upon this subject? Their Repentance consisting in a visible and manifest Reformation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, they lose the colour of alledging it both to God and Man. Are they so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as to sue for Remission, without Satisfaction, and without Penitency, or Remorse? I look upon these as in the same condition with the first: But the Obstinacy is not there so easie to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This contrariety and volubility of Opinion, so sudden and violent as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is a kind of Miracle to me. They present us with the state of an indegestible Anxiety, and doubtfulness of Mind. It seem'd to me a Fantastick and Ridiculous Imagination in those, who these late Years past, were wont to Reproach every Man they knew to be of any extraordinary
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:53645:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Parts, and made profession of the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> that it was but outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, maintaining moreover, to do him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour forsooth, that whatever he might pretend to the contrary, he could not but in his Heart, be of their Reform'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. An untoward Disease, that a Man should be so Riveted to his own Belief, as to fancy, that others cannot believe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than as he does: And yet worse in this, that they should entertain so Vicious an Opinion of such parts, as to think any Man so Qualified, should prefer any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent advantage of Fortune, before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Eternal Life, and the means of Eternal Damnation. They may believe me: Could any thing have tempted my Youth, the Ambition of the danger and difficulties in the late Commotions, had not been the least Motives.</p>
                     <p>It is not without very good Reason, in my Opinion, that the Church Interdicts the Promiscuous, Indiscreet and Irreverent use of the Holy and Divine <hi>Psalms,</hi> with which the Holy Ghost Inspir'd King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> We ought not to mix God in our Actions, but with the highest Reverence and Caution. That Poesie is too Sacred, to be put to no other use, than to exercise the Lungs, and to delight our Ears. It ought to come from the Soul, and not from the Tongue. It is not fit that a
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:53645:319"/>
Prentice in his Shop, amongst his vain and frivolous Thoughts, should be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pass away his time, and divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with such Sacred things. Neither is it decent to see the Holy Bible, the Rule of our Worship and Belief, tumbled up and down a Hall, or a Kitchin. They were formerly Mysteries, but are now become Sports and Recreations. 'Tis a Book too Serious, and too Venerable, to be cursori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or slightly turn'd over. The Reading of the Scripture ought to be a temperate and premeditated Act, and to which Men should always add this Devout Preface, <hi>Sursum Corda,</hi> preparing even the Body to so humble and compos'd a Gesture and Countenance, as shall evidence their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Attention. Neither is it a Book for every one to fist, but the Study of Select Men set apart for that purpose, and whom Almighty God has been pleas'd to call to that Office, and Sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Wicked and Ignorant, Blemish and Deprave it. 'Tis not a Story to tell, but a History to fear and adore. Are not they then pleasant Men, who think they have render'd this fit for the Peoples handling, by Translating it into the Vulgar Tongue? Does the Understanding of all therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, only stick at Words? Shall I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to say further, that by coming so near to understand a little, they are much wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:53645:320"/>
of the whole scope than before. A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ignorance, and wholely depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Exposition of other Qualified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, was more knowing and salutiferous, than this vain and verbal knowledg, which has only prov'd the Nurse of Temerity and Presumption. And I do further believe, that the liberty every one has taken, to disperse the Sacred Writ into so many Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms, carries with it a great deal more of Danger, than Utility. The <hi>Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> and almost all others, have Espous'd and Reverence the Language wherein their Laws and Mysteries were first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and have expresly, and not without colour of reason, forbid the version or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of them, into any other. Are we assur'd, that in <hi>Biscay,</hi> and in <hi>Brittany,</hi> there are enow competent Judges of this affair, to Establish this Translation into their own Language? Why, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church has not a more difficult and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Judgment to make. One of our <hi>Greek</hi> Historians does justly accuse the Age he Liv'd in, for that the Secrets of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion were disperst into the Hands of every Mechanick, to Expound and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue upon, according to his own Fancy; and that we ought to be much asham'd, we who by God's especial favour, enjoy the purest Mysteries of Piety, to suffer them to be Prophan'd by the Ignorant Rabble;
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:53645:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
considering, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> expressly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and the other Sages, to enquire into, or so much as to mention the things committed only to the Priests of <hi>Delphos</hi>; saying moreover, that the Factions of Princes, upon Theological ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, are not Arm'd with Zeal, but Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that Zeal springs from the Divine Wisdom and Justice, and governs it self with Prudence and Moderation; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into Hatred and Envy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Tares and Nettles, instead of Corn and Wine, when conducted by Humane Passions. And it was truly said of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who advising the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> and told him, that Disputes did not so much Rock the Schisms of the Church a sleep, as it Rous'd and Animated Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. That therefore all Contentions, and Logical Disputations, were to be avoided, and Men absolutely to Acquiess in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and Formulas of Faith, Establish'd by the Ancients. And the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droricus</hi> having over-heard some great Men at high words in his Pallace with <hi>Lapodius,</hi> about a Point of ours of great Importance, gave them so severe a Check, as to threaten to cause them to be thrown into the River, if they did not desist. The very Women and Children now adays, take upon them to Document the Oldest and most Experienc'd Men about
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:53645:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Ecclesiastical Laws: Whereas the first of those of <hi>Plato,</hi> forbids them to enquire so much as into the Civil Laws; which were to stand instead of Divine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And allowing the Old Men to confer amongst themselves, or with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, about those things, he adds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not in the presence of Young or Profane Persons. A Bishop has left in Writing, that at the other end of the World, there is an Isle, by the Ancients call'd <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> abundantly Fertile in all sorts of Trees and Fruits, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Healthful Air: The Inhabitants of which are Christians, having Churches and Altars, only adorn'd with Crucifixes, without any other Images, great Observers of Fasts and Feasts: Exact payers of their Tyths to the Priests, and so Chast, that none of them is permitted to have to do with more than one Woman in his Life. As to the rest, so content with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that environed with the Sea, they know nothing of Navigation, and so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they understand not one Syllable of the Religion they profess, and wherein they are so Devout. A thing incredible to such as do not know, that the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who are so Zealous Idolaters, know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of their Gods, than their bare Names and their Statues. The Ancient beginning of <hi>Menalippus,</hi> a Tragedy of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripedes,</hi> ran thus,

I have also known in my time some Men's Writings found fault with, for being pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Humane and Philosophical, without any mixture of Divinity; and yet whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver should on the contrary say, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Doctrine, as Queen and Regent of the rest, better, and with greater Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, keeps her State apart: What, she ought to be Soveraign throughout, not Subsidiary and Suffragan: And that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, Grammatical, Rhetorical and Logical Examples, may elsewhere be more suitably chosen, as also the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Stage, and Publick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, than from so Sacred a matter: That Divine Reasons are consider'd with greater Veneration and Attention, when by themselves, and in their own proper Stile, than when mixt with, and adapted to Humane Discourses. That it is a fault much more often observ'd, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines Write too Humanely, than that the Humanists Write not Theologically e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: Philosophy, says St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> has long been Banish'd the Holy Schools, as an Hand-maid, altogether useless, and thought unworthy to peep, so much as in passing by the Door, into the Sacrifice of
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:53645:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Divine Doctrine. And that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane way of speaking is of a much low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form, and ought not to serve her self with the Dignity and Majesty of Divine Eloquence. I say, whoever on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary should Object all this, would not be without reason on his side. Let who will <hi>Verbis Indisciplinatis,</hi> talk of Fortune, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny, Accident, Good and Evil Hap, and other such like Phrases, according to his own Humour; I for my part, propose Fancies meerly Humane, and meerly my own, and that simply, as Humane Fancies, and separately consider'd, not as deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by any Arrest from Heaven; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Doubt, or Dispute. Matter of Opinion, not matter of Faith. Things which I discourse of according to my own Capacity, not what I believe according to God; which also I do after a Laical, not Clerical, and yet always after a very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious manner. And it were as Rational to affirm, that an Edict, enjoining all People, but such as are Publick Professors of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be very reserv'd in Writing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, would carry with it a very good colour of Utility and Justice, and me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, to hold my prating. I have been told, that even those who are not of our Church, do nevertheless a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, expressly forbid the Name of God to be us'd in common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:53645:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Not so much as by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjection, Exclamation, Assertion of a Truth, or Comparison, and I think them in the right. And upon what occasion so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we call upon God, to accompany and assist us, it ought always to be done with the greatest Reverence and Devotion. There is, as I remember, a passage in <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> where he tells us, that we ought so much the more seldome to call upon God, by how much it is hard to compose our Souls to such a degree of Calmness, Penitency and Devotion, as it ought to be in at such time, otherwise our Prayers are not only vain and fruitless, but Vicious in themselves. <hi>Forgive us</hi> (we say) <hi>our Trespasses, as we forgive them that Trespass against us.</hi> What do we mean by this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, but that we present him a Soul free from all Rancour and Revenge? And yet we make nothing of Imvoking God's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in our Vices, and inviting him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our unjust Designs.

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:53645:324" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to his Throne by Arms; and was so miserable, as to see himself taken at his word. We are not to Pray, that all things may go as we would have them, but as is most conducing to the good of the World; and we are not in our Prayers to Obey our Wills, but Prudence. We seem, in truth, to make use of our Prayers, as of a kind of Gibberish, and as those do who employ Holy Words about Sorceries and Magical Operations: And as if we made account, the benefit we are to reap from them, depended upon the contexture, sound and gingle of Words, or upon the composing of the Countenance. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Soul contaminated with Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, not touch'd with Repentance, or comforted by any late Reconciliation with Almighty God, we go to present him such Words as the Memory suggests to the Tongue, and hope from thence to obtain the Remission of our Sins.

and, for that instant at least, wherein we Address our selves to her, to have the Soul sensible of the ills we have committed, and at defiance with those Passions, that seduc'd her to offend, for neither the Gods, nor Good Men, (says <hi>Plato,</hi>) will accept the present of a Wicked Man.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LVII. Of Age.</head>
                     <p>I Cannot allow of the proportion we set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon our selves, and the space we allot to the duration of Life. I see that the Wise contract it very much, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the common Opinion. What (said the Younger <hi>Cato</hi> to those who would stay his Hand from Killing himself,) am I now of an Age to be Reproach'd, that I go out of the World too soon? And yet he was but Eight and Forty Years Old. He thought that to be a mature and competent Age, considering how few arrive unto it, and such, as soothing their Thoughts with I know not what course of Nature, promise to themselves some Years beyond it, could they be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd from the infinite number of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, to which we are by a natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection expos'd, might have some Reason so to do. What an Idle Conceit it is, to expect to Die of a decay of Strength, which is the last of effects of the extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Age, and to propose to our selves no
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:53645:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shorter lease of Life than that, considering it is a kind of Death of all others the most rare, and very hardly seen? We call that only a Natural Death, as if it were contrary to Nature, to see a Man break his Neck with a Fall, be Drown'd in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack at Sea; or snatch'd away with a Plurisie, or the Plague, and, as if our ordinary condition of Life did not expose us to these Inconveniences. Let us no more flatter our selves with these fine sounding Words: We ought rather, at a venture, to call that Natural, which is Common and Universal. To Die of Old Age, is a Death rare, extraordinary and singular, and therefore so much less Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than the others: 'Tis the last and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest sort of Dying: And the more remote, the less to be hop'd for. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Boundary of Life, beyond which we are not to pass: Which the Law of Nature has pitch'd for a Limit, not to be exceeded: But it is withal a Priviledg she is rarely seen to give us to last till then. 'Tis a Lease she only Signs by particular sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and it may be, to one only, in the space of two or three Ages; and then with a Pass to boot, to carry him through all the Traverses and Difficulties she has strew'd in the way of this long Carreer. And therefore my Opinion is, that when
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:53645:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
once Forty Years Old, we should consider it is as an Age to which very few arrive: For seeing that Men do not usually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so far, it is a sign that we are pretty well advanc'd, and since we have exceeded the ordinary Bounds, which make the just measure of Life, we ought not to expect to go much further; having escap'd so many Precipices of Death, whereinto we have seen so many other Men to fall, we should acknowledg, that so extraordinary a Fortune, as that which has hitherto rescu'd us from those Eminent Perils, and kept us alive beyond the ordinary term of Living, is not likely to continue long. 'Tis a fault in our very Laws, to maintain this Errour, That a Man is not capable of managing his own Estate, till he be Five and Twenty Years Old, whereas he will have much ado to manage his Life so long. <hi>Augustus</hi> cut off Five Years from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Roman</hi> Standard, and declar'd, that Thirty Years Old was sufficient for a Judg. <hi>Survius Tullius</hi> superceded the Knights of above Seven and Forty Years of Age, from the Fatigues of War: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> dismiss'd them at Forty Five: Though methinks it seems a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that Men should be sent to the Fire-side, till Five and Fifty, or Sixty Years of Age. I should be of Opinion, that both our Vacancy and Employment,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:53645:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should be as far as possible extended for the Publick Good: But I find the fault on the other side, that they do not employ us Early enough. This Emperour was Arbiter of the whole World at Nineteen, and yet would have a Man to be Thirty, before he could be fit to bear Office in the Common-wealth. For my part I believe, our Souls are Adult at Twenty, such as they are ever like to be, and as capable then as ever. A Soul that has not by that time given evident earnest of its Force and Vertue, will never after come to proof. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parts and Excellencies produce, that they have of Vigorous and Fine, within that Term, or never.</p>
                     <p>Of all the great Humane Actions I ever Heard, or Read of, of what sort soever, I have Observ'd, both in former Ages, and our own, more perform'd before the Age of Thirty, than after: And oft-times in the very Lives of the same Men. May I not confidently instance in those of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> and his great concurrent <hi>Scipio</hi>? The better half of their Lives, they Liv'd upon the Glory they had Acquir'd in their Youth; great Men after, 'tis true, in comparison of others; but by no means, in comparison of themselves. As to my own particular, I do certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that since that Age, both my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and my Constitution, have
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:53645:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather decay'd, than improv'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd, rather than advanc'd. 'Tis possible, that with those who make the best use of their Time, Knowledg and Experience may grow up and encrease with their Years; but the Vivacity, Quickness and Steadiness, and other peices of us, of much greater Importance, and much more Essentially our own, Languish and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.

Sometimes the Body first submits to Age, sometimes the Soul, and I have seen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now, who have got a Weakness in their Brains, before either in their Hams, or Stomach: And by how much the more, it is a Disease of no great pain to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Party, and of obscure Symptoms, so much greater the danger is. And for this reason it is, that I complain of our

Laws, not that they keep us too long to our Work, but that they set us to work too late. For the Frailty of Life consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and to how many Natural and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Rubs it is Obnoxious and Expos'd: Birth, though Noble, ought not to share so large a Vacancy, and so tedious a course of Education.</p>

to that interpret all his Actions, of which, if some be so stiff and stubborn, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bend or writh them to any uniformity with the rest, they are presently imputed to dissimulation. <hi>Augustus</hi> has escapt them,<note place="margin">

                        </note> for there was in him so apparent, sudden, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual variety of Actions, all the whole course of his life, that he is slipt away clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided from the most hardy Censurers. I am more hardly induc't to believe a man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy than any other Virtue, and believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sooner than the contrary. It is a hard matter, out of all Antiquity, to pick out a dozen men, who have form'd their lives to one certain and constant course, which is the principal design of Wisdom: For to comprize it all in one word, (says one of the Antients) and to contract all the Rules of humane life into one, it is to Will, and not to Will always one and the same thing: I will not vouchsafe, says he to add, provided the Will be just, for if it be not just, it is impossible it should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one. I have indeed formerly learnt, That Vice is nothing but Irregularity and want of measure, and therefore 'tis impossible to fix constancy to it. 'Tis a saying of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> That the beginning of all virtue is consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deliberation, the end and perfection, constancy. If we would resolve on any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain course upon mature advice, we should pitch upon the best, but no body has thought on't.</p>

The Man you saw yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day so adventurous and brave, you must not think it strange to see him as great a Poltron the next: Anger, Necessity, Company, Wine or the sound of the Trumpet, had rous'd his Spirits; this is no Valour form'd, and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Meditation; but accidentally created by those circumstances, and therefore it is no wonder, if by contrary circumstances it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipear te another thing.</p>

In a word, I have nothing to say of my self entirely, simply, and solidly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53645:336" rendition="simple:additions"/>
without mixture, and confusion. <hi>Distinguo</hi> is the most universal Member of my Logick. Though I always intend to speak well of good things, and rather to interpret such things, as may fall out, in the best sence, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: Yet such is the strangeness of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that we are sometimes push't on to do well even by Vice it self, if well doing were not judged by the intention only. One gallant Action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to conclude a man Valiant; if a man was brave indeed, he would be always so, and upon all occasions. If it were a Habit of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not a Sally, it would render a man equally resolute in all Accidents; the same Alone, as in Company; the same in Lists, as in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; for, let them say what they will, there is not one Valour for the Pavement, and another for the Feild. He would bear a Sickness in his Bed, as bravely as a Wound in the Field, and no more fear Death in his own house, than at an assault. We should not then see the same man charge into a Breach with a brave assurance, and afterwards torment himself, and pule like a Woman for the loss of a tryal at Law, or the death of a Child. When being a detected Coward to infamy, he is constant in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of Poverty and Want; when he starts at the sight of a Barbers Razor, and rushes fearless into the Swords of the Enemy, the Action is commendable, not the Man.</p>

As peerless as it is, it has yet some blemishes. Of which, his being so often at his wits end, upon every light suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Captains conspiring against his life, and the carrying himself in that Inquisition with so much vehemency and injustice, and a fear that subverted his natural reason, is one pregnant instance; the Superstition also, with which he was so much tainted, carries along with it some Image of Pusillanimity. And the excess of his Penitency, for the Murther of <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> is also a Testimony of the unevenness of his Courage.

Vertue cannot be followed, but for her self, and if one sometimes borrow her Mask for some other occasion, she presently pulls it away again. 'Tis a stamp and lively tincture, which when the soul has once thorowly imbibed, it will not out, but with the piece.

To what use are colours to him, or to what end should he provide them, that knows not what he is to paint? No one lays down a certain design for his life, and we only deliberate by pieces. The Archer ought first to know at what he is to aime, and then accommodate his Arm, Bow, String, Shaft, and Motion to it. Our Counsel deviates and wanders, because not levelled to any determinate end. No wind serves him, who addresses his Voyage to no certain Port. I cannot acquiesce in the judgment given by one, in the behalf of <hi>Sophocles</hi>; who concluded him capable of the management of Domestick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, against the accusation of his son, for having seen one of his Tragedies.</p>

they appointed those Farmers for new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and Magistrates; concluding, that they, who had been so provident in their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concerns, would be so of the publick too.

his Education in the house, and company of <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) he made him Drink to such a pitch, that he could after dispose of his Beauty, as of a Hedg-whore, to the Muletteers and Servants of the basest Office in the house. And I been further told, by a Lady whom I highly Honor and Esteem, that near <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and about <hi>Castres</hi> where she lives, a Country-woman, a Widow of chast repute, perceiving in her self the first symptoms of Breeding, innocently told her Neighbours, that if she had a Husband she should think her self with child: But the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of suspition every day more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, and at last growing up to a manifest proof; the poor Woman was reduc'd to the necessity of causing it to be Proclaimed at the Prosne of her Parish-Church; that whoever had done that deed, and would frankly confess it, she did not only promise to Forgive, but moreover to Marry him, if he lik'd of the motion. Whereupon a young fellow that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the quality of a Labourer, encouraged by this Proclamation, declared; that he had one Holy-day found her, having taken too much of the Bottle, so fast a sleep in the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and in so undecent a posture, that he might conveniently come to doe his business without waking her; and they yet live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man and Wife.

warmed with Wine. My taste and constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are greater Enemies to this Vice than I am, for besides that I easily submit my belief to the Authority of antient opinions: I look upon it indeed as a stupid and ungraceful Vice, but less malicious and hurtful than the others, which almost all more directly justle publick Society. And if we cannot please our selves, but it must cost us something, as they hold; I find this Vice costs a mans conscience less than the others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it is of no difficult preparation; nor what we look for hard to be found, a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not altogether to be despised. A man well advanc'd both in Dignity and Age, amongst three principal Commodities, that he said re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to him of life, reckoned to me this for one, and where would a man more justly find it,<note place="margin">

                        </note> than amongst the natural conveniences? But he did not take it right, for delicacy and the curious choice of Wines, is therein to be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. If you found your pleasure upon Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the best, you condemn your self to the penance of Drinking of the worst. Your taste must be more indifferent and free. So delicate a Palate is not required to make a good Toper. The <hi>Germans</hi> Drink almost indifferently of all Wines and Liquors with delight, their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is to power down, and not to taste; and it's so much the better for them, their pleasure is so much the more constant, and nearer at hand. Now on the other side, not to Drink (after the French fashion) but at meals, and then very moderately too, is to be ingrate to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53645:341" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this bountiful God of Wine. There is more time and constancy required than so. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients spent whole nights in this exercise, and oft-times added the day following to eke it out, and therefore we are to take greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than so, and stick closer to our work. I have seen a great Lord of my time, a man of high enterprise and famous success, that without set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself to't, and after his ordinary rate of Drinking at meals, Drank not much less than five quarts of Wine, and at his going away appeared but too wise and discreet, to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our affairs. The pleasure we design the greatest esteem for the whole course of our lives, ought to have a greater share of our time dedicated to it. We should like Shop-boys and Labourers, refuse no occasion nor omit no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Drinking, and always have it in our minds. But methinks we every day abridg and curtail the use of Wine; and the Break-fast Drinking and Collations, I used to see in my Fathers house, when I was a Boy, were more usual and frequent then, than now.</p>

                     <p>The incommodities of old Age, that stand in need of some refreshment and support, might with reason beget in me a desire of this faculty, it being as were the last pleasure the course of years deprives us of. The natural heat, (say the Good-fellows,) first seats itself in the Feet, that concerns Infancy, thence it mounts into the middle Region, where it makes a long aboad, and produces in my opinion the sole true pleasure of humane life; all other pleasures, in comparison, sleep. Toward the end, like a vapour that still mounts upward, it arrives at the Throat, where it makes its final residence, and concludes the progress. I cannot neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less understand, how a man can extend the pleasure of drinking beyond Thirst, and to forge in his imagination an Appetite artificial, and against Nature. My Stomach would not proceed so far, it has enough to do to deal with what it takes in for necessity. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, is, not to care to Drink, but as it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53645:343" rendition="simple:additions"/>
follows Eating, and to wash down my Meat, and for that reason my last Draught is always the greatest: And seeing that in old Age we have our Palats furr'd with Phlegmes, or deprav'd by some other ill constitution, the Wine tasts better to us, as the Pores are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wash't, and laid more open. At least I sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome tast the first Glass well. <hi>Anacharsis</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that the Greeks drunk in greater Glasses towards the end of a meale, than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which was I suppose for the same reason, the Dutch do the same, who then begin the Battel. <hi>Plato</hi> forbids Children Wine, till eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age, and being drunk, till forty; but after forty gives them leave to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to mix a little liberally, in their Feasts, the influence of <hi>Dionysius,</hi>

He moreover says, that Wine is able to supply the Soul with Temperance, and the Body with Health; nevertheless these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions, in part borrowed from the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> please him: That they forbear excesses in

But to join Constancy to it, is her utmost Perfection; I mean though nothing should justle and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose her, which a thousand Accidents may do. 'Tis to much purpose, that the great Poet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53645:344" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Lucretius,</hi> keeps such a clutter with his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, when behold he is ruin'd with a Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, one poor draught of Love. Is it to be imagin'd, that an Apoplexy will not make an Ass of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as well as of a Porter. Some have forgot their own names by the violence of a Disease, and a slight Wound has turn'd the Judgment of others topsey-turvey. Let him be as wise as he will, but in fine he is a Man; and than that, what is there more miserable, or more nothing? Wisdom does not force our natural dispositions.</p>

When we hear our Martyrs cry out to the Tyrant in the middle of the Flame, this side is Roasted enough, fall to, and eate, it is enough, fall to work with the other.

As in occasion of War, the Heat of Battle sometimes pushes the generous Souldiers to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form things of so infinite Danger, as after having recollected themselves, they themselves are the first to wonder at. As also fares with the Poets, who are often rapt with admiration of their own Writings, and know not where again to find the track, through which they

performed so happy a Carreer; which also is in them call'd Rage, and Rapture: And as <hi>Plato</hi> says, tis to purpose for a Sober man to knock at the door of Poesy: And <hi>Aristotle</hi> says to the same effect, that no excellent Soul is exempt from the mixture of Folly; and he has reason to call all Transports, how commendable soever, that surpass our own Judgment and understanding, Folly,: For as much as Wisdom is a regular Government of the Soul, which is carryed on with Measure and Proportion, and which she is to her self responsible for. <hi>Plato</hi> argues thus, that the Faculty of Prophecying is so far above us, that we must be out of our selves, when we meddle with it, and our Prudence must either be obstructed by Sleep or Sickness, or lifted from her place by some Celestial Rapture.</p>

Death, is the most brave. Life depends upon the Pleasure and Discretion of others, Death upon our own. We ought not to accommodate our selves to our own Humour in any thing so much as in that. Reputation is not concern'd in such an enterprize; and it's a folly to be diverted by any such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, living is Slavery, if the liberty of dying be away. The ordinary method of Cures is carried on at the expence of Life, they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us with Causticks, Incisions, and Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of limbs, at the same time interdicting Aliments, and exhausting our Blood; one step father, and we are cur'd indeed. Why are not the <hi>Jugular</hi> Veines as much at our dispose, as the <hi>Cephalick, Basilick,</hi> or <hi>Median</hi> Veine? For a desperate disease, a desperate cure. <hi>Servius</hi> the Grammarian, being tormented with the Gout, could advise of no better remedy, than to apply Poison to his Legs, to deprive them of their sence, then let them be Gouty on Gods name, so they were insensible of pain. God gives us leave enough, when he is pleased to reduce us to such a condition, that to live is far worse than to die. 'Tis weakness to truckle under infirmities, but it's madnes to nourish them. The Stoicks say, that it is living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature in a Wise man to take his leave of Life, even in the height of prosperity, if he do it opportunely, and in a Fool to prolong it, though he be miserable, provided he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent of those things, which are reputed the necessaries of human life. As I do not offend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53645:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Law, provided against Thieves, when I embezel my own Money, and cut my own Purse; nor that against Incendiaries, when I burn my own Wood; so am I not under the lash of those made against Murtherers, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving depriv'd my self of my own life. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesius</hi> said, that as the condition of life did, so the condition of death ought to depend upon our own choice: And <hi>Diogenes</hi> meeting the <hi>Philosopher Speucippus,</hi> so blown up with an inveterate Dropsie, that he was fain to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a Litter, and by him saluted with the complement, of, I wish you good health; no health to thee, reply'd the other, who art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live in such a condition. And in truth, not long after <hi>Speucippus,</hi> weary of so languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an estate of Life, found a means to dye. But this does not pass without admitting a dispute: For many are of Opinion, that we cannot quit this Garrison of the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the express command of him, who has plac'd us in it; and that it appertains to God, who has plac'd us here, not for ourselves only, but for his Glory, and the service of others, to dismiss us when it shall best please him, and not for us to depart without his Licence: That we are not born for ourselves only, but for our Country also, the Laws of which require an account from us, upon the score of their own interest, and have an action of Man-slaughter good against us. Or if these fail to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Fact, we are punish'd in the other World, as deserters of our Duty.</p>

If this good Man be yet living, I would recommend to him <hi>Xenophon,</hi> to do as much by that. 'Tis a much more easy task than the other, and consequently more proper for his age. And besides, I know not how, methinks, though he does briskly, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough trip over steps another would have stumbled at, that nevertheless his style seemes to be more his own, where he does not encounter those difficulties and rowles away at his own ease.

But I doubt, whether any one can commend his prudence; for receiving unexpected Letters, and especially from an Emperor, it might have fal'n out, that the deferring to read them might have been of great prejudice.<note place="margin">

I never open any Letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to another, not only those entrusted with me, but even such as fortune has guided to my hand; and am very angry with my self, if my Eyes unawares steal any contents of Letters of importance he is reading, when I stand near a great Man.

And there was anciently at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Consular place, as they called it, which was the most honorable at the Table, for being a place of most liberty, and of more convenient access to those who came in to take with the person seated there. By which it appears, that for being at meat, they did not totally abandon the concern of other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and accidents.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53645:362" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let us go, Citizens, said he, let us go render thanks to the Gods for the Victory they gave over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> as this day, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himself before towards the Temple, he had presently all the Assembly and his very Accuser himself following at his heeles. And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> having been set on by <hi>Cato</hi> to demand an account of the money had past thro' his hands in the Province of <hi>Antioch, Scipio</hi> being come into the Senate to that purpose, produc't a Book from under his Robe, wherein he told them was an exact account of his receipts and disbursments; but being required to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to the Pronotary to be examined and enrolled, he refused, saying, he would not do himself so great a disgrace; and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the whole Senate tore the Book with his own hands to peices. I do not believe that the most fear'd Conscience could have counterfeited so great an assurance. He had naturally too high a spirit, and was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to too high a fortune, says <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> to know how to be criminal, and to dispose himself to the meanness of defending his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. This putting men to the Rack is a dangerous invention, and seemes to be rather a tryal of patience than truth. Both he who has the fortitude to endure it, conceals the truth, and he who has not: for why should paine sooner make me to confesse what really is, than force me to say what is not? And on the contrary, if he who is not guilty of that whereof he is accused, has the courage to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53645:363" rendition="simple:additions"/>
undergo those torments, why should not he who is guilty have the same, so fair a reward as life being in his prospect? I think the ground of this invention proceeds from the consideration of the force of Conscience. For to the guilty it seemes to assist the Rack to make him confess his fault, and to shake his resolution, and on the other side, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the innocent against the torture. But when's all's don, 'tis in plain truth a tryal full of incertainty and danger. What would not a man say, what would not a man do to avoid so intolerable torments?</p>

I know not where I had this Story: but it exactly matches the Conscience of our Justice in this particular. A Country woman, to a General of very severe Discipline, accused one of his Souldiers, that he had taken from her Children the little milke she had lest to nourish them withal, the Army having consum'd all the rest: but of this, Proof there was none. The General, after having caution'd the woman to take good heed to what she said, for that she would make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self guilty of a false Accusation, if she told a lie; and she persisting, he presently caused the Souldiers belly to be ript up, to clear the truth of the fact, and the Woman was found to be in the right.

Being upon my return home, a suddain occasion falling out to make use of this horse, in a kind of service that he was not acquainted with; one of my train, a lusty proper fellow, mounted upon a strong <hi>German</hi> horse, that had a very ill mouth, but was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vigorous and unfoild; to play the <hi>Bravo</hi> and appear a better man than his fellowes, comes thundring full speed in the very track where I was, rushing like a <hi>Colossus</hi> upon the little man, and the little horse, with such a carreer of strength and weight, that he turn'd us both over and over, topsy turvy with our heeles in the aire: so that there lay the horse over thrown and stun'd with the fall, and I ten or twelve paces from him stretcht out at length, with my face all batter'd and broken, my sword which I had in my hand, above ten paces

beyond that, and my belt broke all to pieces, without motion or sence any more than a stock. 'Twas the only swoon I was ever in till this hour in my life.

which only touch the outward Bark of us, as a man may say, cannot be said to be ours: to make them so, there must be a concurrence of the whole man and the pains, which are felt by the hand or the foot while we are sleeping, are none of ours. As I drew near my own house, where the Alarm of my fall was already got before me, and that my family were come out to meet me, with the hubbub usual in such cases; I did not only make some little answer to some questions were askt me, but they moreover tell me, that I had so much sense, as to order that a horse I saw trip and faulter in the way, which is mountainous and uneasy, should be given to my wife. This consideration should seem to proceed from a Soul, that retained its functions; but it was nothing so with me. I knew not what I said or did, and they were nothing but idle thoughts in the clouds, that were stir'd up by the senses of the eyes and eares, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from me. I knew not for all that, or whence I came, or whither I went, neither was I capable to weigh and consider what was said to me: these were light effects, that the senses produc't of themselves, as of custom, what the Soul contributed was in a dream, as being lightly toucht, lick't and bedew'd by the soft impression of the senses. Notwithstanding, my condition was in truth very easy and quiet, I had no afflictions upon me, either for others or my self. It was an extream drooping and weekness without any manner of pain. I saw my own house, but knew it not. When they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53645:370"/>
had put me to bed, I found an inexpressible sweetness in that repose; for I had been damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tugg'd and lugg'd by those poor People, who had taken the pains to carry me upon their Arms a very great and a very ill way, and had in so doing all quite tir'd out themselves twice or thrice one after another. They offer'd me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral remedies, but I would take none, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beleiving that I was mortally wounded in the head. And in earnest, it had been a very happy death, for the weakness of my understanding depriv'd me of the faculty of discerning, and that of my body from the sense of feeling. I suffered my self to glide away so sweetly and after so soft and easy a manner, that I scarce find any other action less troublesom than that was.

the fool, 'tis at my own expence and no body else is concern'd in't: for 'tis a folly, that will die with me and that no one is to inherit. We hear but of two or three of the Ancients, who have beaten this Road, and yet I cannot say, if it be after this manner, knowing no more of them but their names. Not one since has followed the track: 'tis a tickle subject and more nice than it seems, to follow a pace so extravagant and uncertain, as that of the Soul; to penetrate the dark Profundities of their intricate internal windings; to choose and lay hold of so many little graces and nimble motions, and a new and extraordinary undertaking, and that withdraws us from the common and most recommended emploiments of the World. 'Tis now many years since, that my thoughts have had no other aime and level, than my self, and that I have only pried into and studied my self: Or if I study any other thing, 'tis to lay it up for and to apply it to my self. And yet I do not think it a fault, if, as others do by other much less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Sciences, I communicate what I have learn't in this affair: though I am not very well pleased with what I have writ upon this Subject. There is no description so difficult, nor doubtless of so great utility, as that of a Mans self. And withall a Man must curle, set out and adjust himself to appear in publick. Now I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually tricking my self; for I am eternally upon my own description.

that seems inseparably joyn'd with the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men give of themselves. I do not know that necessarily follows; but allowing it to be true, and that it must of necessity be presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to entertain the people with Discourses of ones self: I ought not, pursuing my general Design, to forbear an action that publishes this Infirmity of mine; nor conceal the Fault which I not only practise, but profess. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to speak my thought freely, I do think that the custom of condemning Wine, because some people will be drunk, is it self to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. A man cannot abuse any thing but what is good in it self; and I believe that this Rule has only regard to the popular Vice: they are Bits, with which neither the Saints whom we hear speak so highly of themselves, nor the Philosophers, nor the Divines will be curb'd; neither will I, who am as little the one as the other: Of what does <hi>Socrates</hi> treat more largely, than of himself? To what does he more direct, and address the Discourses of his Disciples, than to speak of themselves, not of the Lesson in the Book, but of the Essence and Motion of their Souls? We confess our selves Religiously to God, and our Confessor; and, as they are our Neighbours to all the people.

The Wisest and Devoutest Men have liv'd in the greatest Care to avoid all discovery of Works: Effects would more speak of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than of me. They manifest their own Office, and not mine; but uncertainly, and by conjecture: They are but Patterns of some one particular Vertue I expose my self entire: 'tis a Skeleton where at one view the Veins, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Tendons are apparent every of them in its proper place. I do not write my own Acts, but my Self and my Essence: I am of opinion, that a man must be very wise to value himself, and equally consciencious, to give a true Report; be it better or worse, indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: If I thought my self perfectly good and wise, I would speak with open mouth, and rattle it out to some purpose. To speak less of a man's self, than what one really is, is folly, not modesty; and to take that for currant pay, which is under a man's value, is Pusillanimity
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53645:372" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Cowardize, according to <hi>Aristotle.</hi> No Vertue assists it self with Falshood; Truth is never the Master of Errour: To speak more of ones self, than is really true, is not always Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, 'tis moreover very often Folly: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o be immeasurably pleas'd with what one is, and to fall into an indiscreet self-love, is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Substance of this Vice. The most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Remedy to cure it, is to do quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what these people direct, who in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding men to speak of themselves, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently at the same time interdict thinking of themselves too. Pride dwells in the Thought, the Tongue can have but a very little share in it: They fancy, that to think of ones self is to be delighted with himself; to frequent, and to converse with a man's self, to be over-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent. But this Excess springs only in those, who only take of themselves a Superficial View, and dedicate their main Inspection to their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; that call Meditation, raving and idleness, looking upon themselves as a third person only, and a stranger. If any one be ravisht with his own Knowledge, whilst he looks only on those below him; let him but turn his Eye upward towards past Ages, and his Pride will be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when he shall there find so many thousand Wits that trample him under foot. If he enter into a flattering vanity of his personal Valour, let him but recollect the Lives of <hi>Scipio, Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> so many Armies and Nations that leave him so far behind them, and he will be cur'd of his Self-opinion. No particular Quality can
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53645:373" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make any man proud, that will at the same time put so many other meek and imperfect ones as he has in him in the other Scale, and the Nothingness of Humane Condition to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the weight: Because <hi>Socrates</hi> had alone swallow'd to purpose the Precept of his God, <hi>To know himself,</hi> and by that study was arriv'd to the perfection of setting himself at naught; he was only reputed worthy the Title of a <hi>Sage.</hi> Whosoever shall so know himself, let him bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speak it out.</p>

So it is, that he had himself been gratified by his Uncle with all the Military Recompences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ever been in the Field. It was a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Invention, and receiv'd into most Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World, to Institute certain vain and insignificant Distinctions to Honour and recompence Vertue; such as the Crowns of Lawrel, Oak, and Myrrh, the particular Fashion of some Garment, the priviledge to ride in a Coach in the City, or to have a Torch by Night; some peculiar place assign'd in publick

Assemblies; the Prerogative of certain addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Names and Titles; certain Distinctions in their bearing of Coats of Arms, and the like: The use of which, according to the several Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Nations, has been variously receiv'd, and do yet continue.

                        </note> as also se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our Neighbous, have the Orders of Knighthood, that are instituted only for this end. And 'tis in earnest a very good and profitable Custom, to find out an Acknowledgment for the Worth of Rare and Excellent Men; and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their Ambition with Rewards, that are not at all Chargeable either to Prince or People: And that which has been always found both by ancient Experience; and that we our selves may also have observ'd in our own times; that men of Quality have ever been more jealous of such Recompences, than of those wherein there was Gain and Profit, is not without very good ground and reason. If with Reward, which ought to be simply a Recompence of Honour, they should mix other Emoluments, and add Riches; this mixture in stead of procuring an encrease of Estimation, would vilifie and abate it. The Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> which has been so long in repute amongst us, had no other,<note place="margin">

willingly embracing, and, with greater Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aspiring to a Recompence truly her own, and rather Honourable than Beneficial: For intruth, the other Rewards have not so great a Dignity of Usage, by reason they are laid out upon all sorts of Occasions. With Money a man pays the Wages of a Servant, the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a Courrier, Dancing, Vaulting, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the vilest Offices we receive; nay, and reward Vice with it too; as Flattery, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and Pimping: and therefore 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Vertue does less desire, and less willingly receive this common sort of Payment, than that which is proper and peculiar to her, throughout Generous and Noble. <hi>Augustus</hi> had reason to be a better Husband, and more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, than the other; by how much Honour is a Priviledge that extracts its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Esteem from Rarity, and Vertue its self.

We do not intend it for a Commendation, when we say, that such a one is careful in the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Children: by reason it is a common Act, how just and well done soever; no more than we commend a great Tree, where the whole Forrest is the same.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53645:374" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the whole Nation, and as little glorified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon his Fidelity, and contempt of Riches. There is no Recompence due to Vertue, how great soever, that is once past into a Custom; and I know not withal, whether we can ever call it Great, being Common. Seeing that these Remunerations of Honour have no other Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and Estimation, but only this, That few people enjoy them; 'tis but to be liberal of them, to bring them down to nothing. And though there should be now more men found than in former times worthy of our Order, the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it nevertheless should not be abated, nor the honour made cheap. And it may easily fall out, that more may merit it; for there is no Vertue that so easily dilates it self, as that of Military Valour: There is another true, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Philosophical, of which I do not speak, (and only make use of the word in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation) much greater than this, and more full, which is a force and assurance of Souls, equally disposing all sorts of adverse Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, equal, uniform, and constant; of which ours is no more, than one little Ray. U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, Precept, Example and Custom, can do all in all to the establishment of that whereof I am speaking, and with great facility render it vulgar, as by the experience of our Civil War is manifest enough; and whoever could at this instant unite us <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Hugonot</hi> into one Body, and set us upon some brave Enterprize, we should again make our ancient Military Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to flourish. It is most certain, that in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53645:375"/>
times past, the Recompence of this Order, had not only a regard to Valour, but had a further Prospect. It never was the Reward of a Valiant Souldier, but of a Great Captain. The Science of obeying was not reputed worthy of so honourable a Guerdon, there was therein a more Universal Military Expertness requir'd, and that comprehended the most and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Qualities of a Military man; <hi>Neque enim eaedem Militares &amp; Imperatoriae artes sunt.</hi> For the Military knowledge requir'd in a common Souldier and a General, are not the same; as also besides a Condition suitable to such a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Rules for the dispensing of this New Order, had need to be extreamly clipt, and bound under great Restrictions to give it Authority; and this tumultuous Season is incapable of such a Curb: Besides, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this can be brought into Repute, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Memory of the first, and the Contempt into which it is faln, be totally bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Oblivion.</p>
                     <p>This place might naturally enough admit of some Discourse upon the Consideration of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the Difference of this Vertue from others: But <hi>Plutarch</hi> having so often handled this Subject, I should give my self an unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trouble to repeat what he has said; but this is worth considering, That our Nation place Valour in the Highest Degree of Vertue; as the very Word does evidence, being deriv'd from <hi>Value,</hi> and that according to our Usance when we decipher a Worthy Man, or a Man of Value; only in our Court style, to say a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Man, after the <hi>Roman</hi> way: For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Appellation of Vertue with them, takes Etymology from <hi>Force.</hi> The proper, sole, and essential Method of the <hi>French Nobleness,</hi> is the Practice of Arms: And 'tis likely that the first Vertue which discovered its self amongst Men, and that has given some Advantage over others, was this; by which the Strongest and most Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant have Lorded it over the Weaker, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon themselves a particular Authority and Reputation: Or else that these Nations

idle Fancy of Writing: Wherein finding my self totally Unprovided and Empty of other Matter, I presented my Self to my Self for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Subject.

                     <p>Now, <hi>Madam,</hi> being to draw mine own Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to the Life, I had omitted the onely grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Feature, had I not therein represented the Honour I have ever had for you, and your Merits; which I have purposely chosen to say in the beginning of this Chapter, by reason that amongst many other Excellent Qualities you are Mistress of, that of the tender Love you have manifested to your Children, is worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seated in one of the highest places.

                     <p>If there be any Law truly Natural; that is to say, any Instinct that is seen universally and perpetually imprinted in both Beasts and Men, (which is not without Controversie) I can then say, that in my opinion, next to the Care every Animal has of his own Preservation, and to avoid that which may hurt him, the Affection that the Begetter bears to his Off-spring, holds the second place in this File. And seeing that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53645:377" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nature seems to have recommended it to us, having regard to the Extension and Propagation of the successive Piece of this Machine: 'tis no wonder if on the contrary, that of Children towards their Parents is not so great. To which we may add this other <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he who confers a Benefit on any one, loves him better, than he is belov'd by him again: and that every Artificer is fonder of his Work, than if that Work had Sense, it would be of him; by reason that it is dear to us to be, and to be consists in moving and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore every one has in some sort a being in his Work. Who confers a Benefit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises a fair and honest Action; who receives it, exercises the <hi>Vtile</hi> only. Now the <hi>Vtile</hi> is much less amiable than the <hi>Honest</hi>: the Honest is stable and permanent, supplying him who has done it with a continual Gratification. The <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> loses it self, easily slides away, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it is neither so fresh, nor so pleasing. Those things are dearest to us that have cost us most, and giving is more chargeable than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. Since it has pleas'd God to endue us with some Capacity of weighing and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, to the end we may not like Brutes be servilely subjected and enslav'd to the Laws common to both; but that we should by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a voluntary liberty apply our selves to them: We ought indeed something to yield to the simple Authority of Nature, but not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our selves to be tyrannically hurried away and transported by her; being that Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53645:378" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should have the Conduct of our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I for my part have a strange Disgust to those Propensions that are started in us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Mediation and Direction of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As upon the Subject I am speaking of, I cannot entertain that Passion of Dandling and Caressing an Infant scarcely born, having as yet neither motion of Soul, nor shape of Body distinguishable, by which they can render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves amiable; and have not willingly suffered them to be nurs'd near me: A true and regular Affection ought to spring and encrease with the knowledge they give us of themselves, and then if they are worthy of it, the natural Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion walking hand in hand with Reason, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them with a truly Paternal Love; and to judge and discern also if they be otherwise, still rendring our selves to Reason, notwithstanding the Inclination of Nature. It goes through some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quite otherwise, and most commonly we find our selves more taken with the running up and down the Play, and Puerile Simplicity of our Children, than we do afterwards with their most compleated Actions; as if we had lov'd them for our sport, like Monkies, and not as Men. And some there are, who are very liberal in buying them Balls to play withal, who are very close-handed for the least necessary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence when they come to age. Nay, to that degree, that it looks as if the jealousie of seeing them appear in, and enjoy the World, when we are about to leave it, render'd us more niggardly and stingy towards them. It vexes us that they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53645:378" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tread upon our Heels, as if to solicite us to go out; and if this be to be fear'd, since the order of things will have it so that they cannot, to speak the truth, be, nor live, but at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of our Being and Life, we should never meddle with getting Children. For my part I think it Cruelty and Injustice not to receive them into the share and society of our Goods, and not to make them Partakers in the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our Domestick Affairs, when they are capable, and not to lessen and contract our own Expences to make the more room for theirs, seeing we beget them to that effect. 'Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just that an old Fellow, deaf, lame, and half-dead, should alone in a Corner of the Chimney, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Goods that were sufficient for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and Advancement of many Children, and to suffer them in the mean time to lose their best Years, for want of means to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into publick service, and the knowledge of men. A man by this means drives them to desperate Courses, and to seek out by any means, how unjust or dishonourable soever, to provide for their own support. As I have in my time seen several young men of good Extraction, so addicted to stealing, that no Correction could cure them of it. I know one of a very good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to whom, at the request of a Brother of his, a very honest and brave Gentleman, I once spoke upon this account; who made answer, and confest to me roundly, that he had been put upon this dirty Practice by the Severity and Avarice of his Father: but that he was now so

This is something, but it is Physick for a Disease, that a man should prevent. A Father is very miserable, that has no other hold of his Childrens Affection, than the need they have of his Amstance, if that can be call'd Affection; he must render himself wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be respected by his Vertue and Wisdom, and belov'd by his Bounty, and the sweetness of his Manners. Even the very Ashes of a rich Matter have their Value; and we are wont to have the Bones and Relicks of worthy Men in regard and reverence. No old Age can be so ruinous and offensive in a man who has past his Life in Honour, but it must be Venerable, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to his Children; the Soul of which he must have train'd up to their Duty by Reason, not by Necessity, and the Need they have of him; nor by roughness and force.

I condemn all Violence in the Education of a tender Soul, that is design'd for Honour and Liberty. There is, I know not what, of Servile in Rigour and Restraint; and I am of opinion, that what is not to be done by Reason, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Address, is never to be effected by Force. I my self was brought up after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and they tell me, that, in all my first Age, I never felt the Rod but twice, and then very easily. I have practis'd the same Method with my Children, who all of them died at Nurse; but <hi>Leonor</hi> my onely Daughter is arriv'd to the age of six years, and upward, without other Correction for her Childish Faults, (her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Indulgence easily concurring) than Words only, and those very gentle. In which kind of proceeding, though my end and expectation should be both frustrated, there are other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses enough to lay the Fault on, without blaming my Discipline, which I know to be natural and just, and I should in this have yet been more Religious towards the Males, as born to less Subjection, and more free; and I should have made it my business to swell their Hearts with Ingenuity and Freedom. I have never observ'd other effects of Whipping, unless to render them more cowardly, or more wilful and obstinate. Do we desire to be belov'd of our Children? Will we remove from them all occasion of wishing our Death?

In order to this, we should not marry so young, that our Age shall in a manner be confounded with theirs; for this inconvenience plunges us into many very great Difficulties: I say, the Gentry of the Nation, who are of a condition wherein they have little to do, and live upon their Revenues only: For elsewhere where the Life is dedicated to profit, the plurality and numbers of Children is an encrease to the good husbandry, and they are as so many new Tools and Instruments wherewith to grow rich.

He has liv'd long enough, if he be wise, to have a mind to strip himself to go to bed, not to his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Shirt, <hi>I</hi> confess, but to that, and a good warm Night-Gown; the remaining Pomps of which he has no further use, he ought voluntarily to surrender to those to whom by the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they belong.

I have known in my time, and been intimately acquainted with some Persons of very great Quality, whom a man might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discern so manifestly laps'd from their former sufficiency, I was sure they were once endu'd with, by the Reputation they had acquired in their former years; that I could heartily, for their own sakes, have wisht them at home at their ease, discharg'd of their Publick Military Employments, which were now grown too heavy for their Shoulders. I have formerly been very familiar in a Gentleman's House, a Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and very old, though healthy and chearful enough: This Gentleman had several Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to marry, and a Son already of a ripe age, which brought upon him many Visits, and a great Expence; neither of which did very well please him, not only out of consideration of Frugality; but yet more, for having, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Age, enter'd into a course of Life far differing from ours. I told him one day a little boldly, as I use to do, that he would do better to give us room, and to leave his principal House, (for he had but that well scituated and furnisht) to his Son, and retire himself to an Estate he had hard by, where no body would trouble his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, seing he could not otherwise avoid being

importun'd by us, the Condition of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren considered. He took my advice afterwards, and found an advantage by so doing: I do not mean, that a man should so instate them, as not to reserve to himself a liberty to recant; <hi>I,</hi> who am now arriv'd to the age, wherein such things are fit to be done, would resign to them the enjoyment of my House and Goods, but with a power of Revocation, if they should give me cause to alter my mind: I would leave to them the Use, they being no longer proper for me, and, of the general Authority and Power over all, would reserve as much as I thought good to my self: Having always thought, that it must needs be a great satisfaction to an aged Father, himself to put his Children into the way of governing his Affairs, and to have power during his own life to controul their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, supplying them with Instruction and Advice from his own Experience, and himself to transfer the ancient Honour and Order of his House into that of those who are to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, and by that means to be responsible to himself (by the hopes he may conceive) for their future conduct. And in order to this, I would not avoid their company, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them near at hand, and partake, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the condition of my age, of their Feasts and Jollities. If I did not live amongst them, (which I could not do, without being a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to them, by reason of the morosity of my age, and the restlesness of my Infirmities, and without violating also the Rules and Order

They have Youth and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in possession, and consequently the breath and favour of the World, and therefore receive these fierce and tyrannical looks (mere Scar-Crows) of a man without blood, either in his Heart or Veins, with mockery and contempt.

Every one is a Centinel against him, and if by accident any wretched Fellow that serves him is of another humour, and will not joyn with the rest, he is presently rendred suspected to him, a Bait that old Age very easily bites at of its self.

Submission and Respect.

And after a fit inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time, Letters are pretended to come a great way off, from I know not where, very humble, suppliant, and full of promises of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; by vertue of which he is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into favour.

Such as have neither Wife, nor Son, do not so easily fall into this misfortune; but withal more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, and undeservingly. <hi>Cato</hi> the elder in his time, said, <hi>So many Servants, so many Enemies.</hi> Consider then, whether according to the vast difference betwixt the purity of the Age he liv'd in, and the corruption of this of ours, he does not seem to advertise us, that Wife, Son, and Servant, so many Enemies to us? 'Tis well for old Age, that it is always accompanied with Stupidity, Ignorance, and a facility of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; for should we see how we are us'd, and would not acquiesce, what would become of us? especially in such an Age as this, where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Judges who are to determine, are usually

The very Image of it, which I see so pure and uncorrupted in Beasts, how religiously do I respect it? If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deceive me, yet do I not at least deceive my self, in thinking I am able to defend me from them, or in cudgeling my Brains to make my self so? I protect my self from such Treasons in my own Bosom, not by an unquiet and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary Curiosity, but rather by Mirth and Resolution. When I hear talk of any ones Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I never trouble my self to think of him, I presently turn my Eyes upon my self, to see in what condition <hi>I</hi> am; what ever concerns another, relates to me, The Accident that has befaln him, gives me Caution, rouzes me to turn my Defence that way. We every day and every hour say things of another, that we might more properly say of our selves, could we but revert our Observation to our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, as well as extend it to others. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authors have in this manner prejudic'd their own Cause, by running headlong upon those they attack, and darting those Shafts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Enemies, that are more properly, and with greater advantage to be return'd upon them. The last <hi>Mareschal de Monlue,</hi> having lost his Son, who was slain at the Isle of <hi>Madera</hi>; in truth a very brave Gentleman, and of great
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53645:386" rendition="simple:additions"/>
expectation, did to me, amongst his other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets, very much insist upon what a Sorrow and Heart-breaking it was, that he had never made himself familiar and acquainted with him; and by that humour of Fatherly Gravity and Sowrness, to have lost the opportunity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an insight into, and of well knowing his Son; as also of letting him know the extream affection he had for him, and the worthy opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had of his Vertue. That poor Boy, said he, never saw in me other, than a stern and disdainful Countenance, and is gone in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that I neither knew how to love nor esteem him according to his desert. For whom did I reserve the discovery of that singular Affection I had for him in my Soul? Was it not he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who ought to have had all the pleasure of it, and all the Obligation? I forc'd and rack'd my self to put on and maintain this vain Disguise, and have by that means depriv'd my self of the pleasure of his Conversation, and, I doubt in some measure, his Affection, which could not but be very cold towards me, having never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from me than Austerity; nor felt other than a tyrannical manner of proceeding. I find this Complaint to be rational and rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; for, as I my self know by too cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Experience, there is no so sweet Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the loss of Friends, as the conscience of having had no reserve of secret for them; and to have had with them a perfect and entire Communication. Oh my Friend, am I the better for being sensible of this; or am I the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53645:386" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worse? I am doubtless much the better. I am consolated and honoured in the sorrow for his death. Is it not a pious and a pleasing Office of my Life to be always upon my Friends Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies? Can there be any joy equal to this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? I open my self to my Family, as much as I can, and very willingly let them know, in what estate they are in my opinion and good will, as I do every body else. I make haste to bring out, and expose my self to them; for I will not have them mistaken in me in any thing.

                        </note> That the Sons never presented themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Fathers, nor durst never appear in their company in publick, till they began to bear Arms; as if they would intimate by that, that it was also time for their Fathers to receive them into their familiarity and acquaintance. I have observ'd yet another sort of Indiscretion in Fathers of my time, That, not contented with having depriv'd their Children, during their own long lives, of the share they naturally ought to have had in their Fortunes, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards leave to their Wives the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over their Estates, and Liberty to dispose of them according to their own fancy: And have known a certain Lord one of the principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crown, who having in his prospect, by right of succession, above Fifty thousand Crowns yearly Revenue, died necessitous, and overwhelm'd with debt, at above fifty years of age; his Mother in his extreamest decrepitude,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53645:387" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and necessity, being yet in possession of all his Goods, by the Will of his Father, who had, for his part, liv'd till near Fourscore years Old. This appears by no means reasonable to me: And therefore I think it of very little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a man, whose Affairs are well enough, to seek a Wife that will charge his Estate with too great a Joynture: There being no sort of foreign Debt or Encumbrance, that brings great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more frequent ruin to Estates and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, than that. My Predecessors have ever been aware of that danger, and provided against it, and so have I: But these who dissuade us from rich Wives, for fear they should be less tractable and kind, are out in their Advice, to make a man lose a real Convenience for so fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous a Conjecture. It costs an unreasonable Woman no more to pass over one Reason, than another. They love but where they have the most wrong. Injustice allures them, as the Honour of their vertuous Actions does the good; and the more Riches they bring with them, they are by so much the more gentle, and sweet Natur'd; as women who are fair, are more inclin'd, and proud to be chast. 'Tis reasonable to leave the administration of Affairs to the Mothers, during the minority of the Children; but the Father has brought them up very ill, if he cannot hope, that when they come to Maturity, they will have more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Dexterity in the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, than his Wife, considering the ordinary Weakness of the Sex. It were notwithstanding,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53645:387" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to say the truth, more against Nature, to make the Mothers depend upon the Discretion of their Children: They ought to be plentifully provided for, to maintain themselves according to their Quality and Age, by reason that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity is much more indecent and insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, than to men; and therefore the Son is rather to be cut short, than the Mother. In general, the most judicious Distribution of our Goods, when we come to dye, is, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to let them be distributed according to the Custom of the Country. The Laws have considered it better than we know how to do, and 'tis better to let them fail in their Election, than rashly to run the hazard of miscarrying in ours. Neither are they properly ours, since, by a Civil Prescription, and without us, they are all judg'd to certain Successors. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have some liberty beyond that, yet I think we ought not, without great and manifest cause, to take away that from one which his Fortune has allotted him, and to which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Equity gives him Title; and that it is against reason to abuse this liberty, in making it to serve our own frivilous and private Fancies. My Destiny has been kind to me, in not prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with Occasions to tempt and divert my Affection from the common and legitimate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. I see well enough, with whom 'tis time lost, to employ a long Diligence of Good Offices: A word ill taken obliterates ten years merit; and he is happy, who is in place to oyle their Good Will at this last Passage. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53645:388" rendition="simple:additions"/>
last Action carries it: Not the best, and most frequent Offices, but the most recent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent do the Work. These are people that play with their Wills, as with Apples and Rods, to gratifie or chastise every Action of these, that pretend to an Interest in their Care. 'Tis a thing of too great weight and consequence, to be so tumbled and tost, and alter'd every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And wherein the Wise men of the World determin once for all, having therein above all things, a regard to reason, and the publick observance. We also lay these Masculine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions too much to heart, proposing a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Eternity to our Names. And are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over too superstitious in the vain Conjectures of the future, which we derive from the little Observations we make of the Words and Actions of Children. Peradventure they might have done me an injustice, in dispossessing me of my Right, for having been the most dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, the most slow and unwilling at my Book, not of all my Brothers only, but of all the Boys in the whole Province: Whether about learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lesson, or any other bodily Exercise. 'Tis a folly to make an extraordinary Election upon the Credit of these Divinations, wherein we are so often deceived. If the Rule of Primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture were to be violated, and the Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies corrected in the Choice they have made of our Heirs, one might more plausibly do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of some enormous personal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; a constant and incorrigible Vice, and in the opinion of us <hi>French,</hi> who are great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53645:388" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Beauty of important prejudice. The pleasant Dialogue betwixt <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Legislator,</hi> and his Citizens, will be an Ornament to this place. What, said they, feeling themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to dye, may we not dispose of our own to whom we please? Good God, what cruelty! That it shall not be lawful for us, according as we have been serv'd and attended in our Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in our Old Age, and other Affairs, to give more or less to those whom we have found most diligent about us, at our own Fancy and Discretion! To which the <hi>Legislator</hi> answers thus; My Friends, who are now without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, very soon to dye, it is hard for you in the Condition you are, either to know your selves; or what is yours, according to the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick</hi> Inscription. I, who make the Laws, am of opinion, that you neither are your selves your own, neither is that yours of which you are possest. Both your Goods, and you belong to your Families, as well those past, as those to come; but yet both your Family and Goods do much more appertain to the publick. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lest any Flatterer in your Age, or in your Sickness, or any Passion of your own, should unseasonably prevail with you to make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Will, I shall take care to prevent that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. But having respect both to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Interest of the City, and that of your particular Family, I shall establish Laws, and make it by lively Reasons appear, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Convenience ought to give place to the common Benefit. Go then chearfully where
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53645:389" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Humane Necessity calls you. It belongs to me, who have no more respect to one thing than another; and who, as much as in me lies, am careful of the publick Concern, to take care of what you leave behind you.</p>
                     <p>To return to my Subject; It appears to me that such women are very rarely born, to whom the Prerogative over men, in others excepted, is in any sort due; unless it be for the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such, as in some lustful Humour, have voluntarily submitted themselves to them: but that does nothing concern the Old ones, of which we are now speaking.

'Tis dangerous to leave the disposal of our Succession to their Judgment, according to the Choice they shall make of Children, which is often fantastick and unjust; for the irregular Appetite and depreav'd Tast they have, during the time of their being with Child, they have at all other times in the mind. We commonly see them fond of the most weak, ricketty, and deform'd Children; or of those, if they have such, as are hanging at their Breasts. For not having sufficient force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to choose and embrace that which is most
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53645:389" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worthy, they the more willingly suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be carried away, where the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Nature are most alone: Like Animals that know their Young no longer than they give them suck. As to what remains, it is easie by experience to be discern'd, that this Natural Affection to which we give so great Authority, has but a very weak and shallow Root. For a very little profit we every day ravish their own Children out of the Mothers Arms, and make them take ours in their room: We make them abandon their own to some pitiful Nurse, to which we disdain to commit ours, or to some Shee Goat; forbidding them, not only to give them suck, what danger soever they run there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but moreover, to take any manner of care of them, that they may wholly be taken up with the care of, and attendance upon ours. And we see in most of them an adulterate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, begot by Custom, toward the faster Children, more vehement than the Natural; and a greater Solicitude for the Preservation of those they have taken charge of, than their own. And that which I was saying of Goats, was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account; that it is ordinary, all about where I live, to see the Country-women, when they want<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Suck of their own, to call Goats to their assistance. And I have, at this hour, two Foot-men that never suck't womans Milk more than eight days after they were born.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Goats trained to give suck to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                        </note> These Goats are immediately taught to come to suckle the little Children, will know their Voices when they cry, and come running to them;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53645:390" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when if any other than that they are acquanted with be presented to them, they refuse to let it suck, and the Child, to another Goat, will do the same. I saw one the other day, from whom they had taken away the Goat that us'd to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish it, by reason the Father had only borrow'd it of a Neighbour; that would not touch any other they could bring, and doubtless dyed of hunger. Beasts do as easily alter and corrupt their Natural Affection as we: I believe that in what <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates of a certain place of <hi>Lybia</hi>; there are very many mistake; he says, that the women are there in common; but that the Child so soon as it can go, finds him out in the Crowd for his Father, to whom he is first led by his Natural Inclination. Now, to consider this simple reason for loving our Children, for having begot them, therefore calling them our Second selves: It appears, methinks, that there is another kind of Production proceeding from us, that should no less recommend them to our Love: For that which we engender by the Soul, the issue of our Understandings, Courage and Abilities, spring from nobler Parts than those of the Body, and that are much more our own. We are both Father and Mother in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; these cost us a great deal more, and brings us more Honour, if they have any thing of good in them. For the Value of our other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is much more theirs, than ours; the share we have in them is very little; but of these, all the Beauty, all the Grace and Value is ours; as also they more lively represent and resemble
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53645:390"/>
us, than the rest. <hi>Plato</hi> adds, that these are immortal Children,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Books im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Children.</hi>
                        </note> that immortalize and deify their Fathers, as <hi>Lycurgus, Solon</hi> and <hi>Minos.</hi> Now Histories being full of Examples of the common Affection of Fathers to their Children, it seems not altogether improper, to introduce some few, also of this other kind. <hi>Heliodorus</hi> that good Bishop of <hi>Tricea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

There has been one <hi>Labienus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Man of great Valour and Authority; and, amongst other good Qualities, excellent in all sorts of Literature; who was, as I take it, the Son of that great <hi>Labienus,</hi> the chiefest of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Captains in the Wars of <hi>Gaule</hi>; and who, afterwards siding with <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, so valiantly maintained his Cause, till he was by <hi>Caesar</hi> defeated in <hi>Spain.</hi> This <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bienus</hi> of whom I am now speaking, had several Enemies, who were emulous of his Vertue; and 'tis likely the Courtiers and Minions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of his time, who were very angry at, and displeas'd with his Freedom, and Paternal Humours, which he yet retain'd against Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, with which it is to be suppos'd, he had tincted his Books and Writings. His Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before the Magistracy of <hi>Rome,</hi> prosecuted several Pieces he had publish't, and prevail'd so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53645:391" rendition="simple:additions"/>
far against him, as to have them condemn'd to the Fire. It was in him that this new Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Punishment was begun, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued against several others at <hi>Rome,</hi> to punish even Writing, and Studies with Death. There would not be means and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough of Cruelty, did we not mix with them things, that Nature has exempted from all Sense and Suffering; as Reputation, and the Products of Wit; and communicate Corporal Punishments to the Learning and Monuments of the <hi>Muses.</hi> Now <hi>Labienus</hi> could not suffer this loss, nor survive these his so dear Issue; and therefore caus'd himself to be convey'd and shut up alive in the Monument of his Ancestors, where he made shift to kill, and bury himself at once. 'Tis hard to shew a more violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Affection, than this. <hi>Cassius Severus</hi> a Man of great Eloquence, and his very intimate Friend, seeing his Books burnt, cry'd out, That by the same Sentence they should as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to the Fire too, being that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his Memory all that they contain'd. The like Accident befel <hi>Geruntius Cordus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cordus<hi>'s Writings condemn'd to the Fire.</hi>
                        </note> who being accus'd for having in his Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>; that dirty, servile, and degenerated Senate, and worthy a worse Master than <hi>Tiberius,</hi> condemned his Writings to the Flame. He was willing to bear them Company, and kil'd himself with Fasting. The good <hi>Lucan</hi> being condemn'd by that Beast <hi>Nero,</hi> at the last gasp of his Life, when the greater part of his Blood was already gone by the Veins
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53645:391" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Arms, which he had caus'd his Physitian to open to make him dye, and that the cold had seiz'd of all his Extremities, and began to approach his Vital Parts; the last thing he had in his Memory, was some of the Verses of his Battle of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> which he repeated, and and dyed with them in his Mouth. What was this but taking a Tender and Paternal Leave of his Children, in imitation of the Valedictions and Embraces wherewith we part with ours, when we come to dye; and an effect of that Natural Inclination, that suggests to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in this Extremity, those things which were dearest to us during the time of our Life? Can we believe that <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who, as he says himself, dying of intolerable Pains of the Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, had all his Consolation in the Beauty of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he left behind him, could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the same satisfaction from many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though never so well educated, had he had them, as he did from the issue of so many rich and admirable Writings? Or that, had it been in his choice to have left behind him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and untoward Child, or a foolish and ridiculous Book, he, or any other Man of his Understanding would not rather have chose to have run the first Misfortune than the other? It had been (for example) peradventure, an Impiety in St. <hi>Austin,</hi> if on the one hand, it had been propos'd to him to bury his Writings, from which Religion has receiv'd so great Advantage; or on the other, to bury his Children, had he had them, had he not rather chose to bury his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53645:392" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Children had he had them, had he not rather chose to bury his Children. And I know not whether I had not much rather have begot a very Beautiful one, thorough my Society with the <hi>Muses,</hi> than by lying with my Wife. To this, such as it is, what I give it, I give abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and irrevocably, as Men do to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Children. That little I have done for it, is no more at my own dispose. It may know many things that are gone from me, and from me keep that which I have not retain'd: And that, as a Stranger, I might borrow thence, should I stand in need. If I am wiser than my Book, it is richer than I. There are few Men addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Poetry, who would not be much Prouder to be Father to the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> than to the hansom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best fashion'd Youth of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that would not much better bear the loss of the one than the other. For according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the Poet, of all sorts of Artificers, is the fondest of his Work. 'Tis hard to believe that <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who boasted, that in lieu of all Posterity, he left two Daughters behind him, which would one day do their Father Honour (meaning the two Victories he obtain'd over the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) would willingly have consented to exchange those, for the most Beautiful Creature of all <hi>Greece</hi>: Or that <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi> ever wish't to be depriv'd of the Grandeur of their Glorious Exploits in War, for the conveniency of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Heirs, how perfect and accomplish't soever.

would be so solicitous of the Preservation and Continuance of his Natural Children, as he would be of a rare Statue, which with long labour and study, he had perfected according to Art. And to those furious and irregular Passions that have sometimes flam'd in Fathers towards their own Daughters, and in Mothers towards their own Sons; the like is also found in this other sort of Parentry: Witness what is related of <hi>Pygmalion,</hi> who having made the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Woman of singular Beauty, fell so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately in love with this Work of his, that the Gods, in favour of his Passion, must inspire it with Life.</p>

                        <hi>Alexander,</hi> the most adventurous Captain that ever was, very seldom wore Arms, and such amongst us as slight them, do not by that much harm to the main Concern; for if we see some kil'd for want of them, there are few less whom the lumber of Arms helps to destroy, either by being over-burthen'd, crush't and cramp't with their weight by a rude Shock, or otherwise. For, in plain truth, to observe the weight and thickness of those we have now in use, it seems,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53645:393" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if we only pretend to defend our selves, and that we are rather loaded, than secured by them. We have enough to do to support their weight, being so manacled, and immur'd, as if we were only to contend with our own Arms; and as if we had not the same Obligation to defend them, that they have to defend us. <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives a pleasant Description of the Men at Arms of our ancient <hi>Gauls</hi>; so armed, as only to be able to move, without power to offend, or possibility to be offended, or to rise again when once beaten down. <hi>Lucullus</hi> seeing certain Soldiers of the <hi>Medes,</hi> that made the Front of <hi>Tigranes</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, heavily arm'd, and very uneasie, as if in Prisons of Iron, from thence conceiv'd hopes, with great ease to defeat them; and by them began his Charge, and Victory. And now that our Musqueteers are come into Credit, I believe some Invention will be found out to immure us for our Safety, and to draw us to the War in Sconces, such as those the Ancients loaded their Elephants withall. This Humour is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from that of the younger <hi>Scipio,</hi> who sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended his Soldiers, for having planted <hi>Caltrops</hi> under Water, in a Graff, by which those of the Town he held besieged might sally out upon him; saying, That those who assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted should think of attacking, and not to fear; suspecting, with good reason, that this stop they had put to the Enemies, would make them less vigilant upon their Duty. He said also to a young Man, shewing him a fine Buckler he had, that he was very proud of, <hi>It is a very

at the same rate, were inur'd to march in Battalia five Leagues in five hours; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, upon any urgent occasion, six. Their Military Discipline was much ruder than ours, and accordingly produced much greater effects. The younger <hi>Scipio,</hi> reforming his Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> ordered his Soldiers to eat standing, and nothing that was drest. The Jeer that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Soldier, is marvellously pat upon this account, who, in an Expedition of War, was reproached to have been seen under the Roof of a House: They were so inur'd to Hardship, that, let the Weather be what it would, it was a shame to be seen under any other Cover than the Roof of Heaven. We should not march our People very far at that rate. As to what remains, <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> a Man bred up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Wars, does curiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the manner of the <hi>Parthians</hi> arming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the rather, for being so different from that of the <hi>Romans.

                     <p>I Make no doubt, but that I oft happen to speak of things that are much better, and more truly handled by those who are Masters of the Trade. This here is purely an Essay of my Natural Parts, and not of those acquired: and whoever shall take me tripping in my Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, will not in any sort displease me; for I should be very unwilling to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible to another for my Writings, who am not so to my self, nor satisfied with them. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goes in quest of Knowledge, let him fish for it where it is to be found; there is nothing I so little profess. These are Fancies of my own, by which I do not pretend to discover things, but to lay open my self: They may, peradventure, one day be known to me, or have formerly been, according as my Fortune has been able to bring me in place where they have been explained; but I have utterly forgot them: and if I am a Man of some Reading, I am a Man of no Retension: So that I can promise no Certainty, if not to make known to what certain <hi>Mark</hi> the Knowledge I now have does rise. Therefore let no Body insist upon the Matter I write, but my Method in writing. Let them observe in what I borrow, if I have known how to chuse what is proper to raise, or releive the Invention, which is always my own.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53645:396" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For I make others say for me, what, either for want of Language, or want of Sense, I cannot my self well express. I do not number my Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowings, I weigh them. And had I designed to raise their Estimate by their Number, I had made them twice as many. They are all, or within a very few, so fam'd and ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that they seem, methinks, themselves sufficiently to tell who they are, without giving me the trouble. In Reasons, Comparisons and Arguments, if I transplant any into my own Soil, and confound them amongst my own, I purposely conceal the Author, to awe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of those precipitous Censures, that fall upon all sorts of Writings; particularly, the late ones, of Men yet living, and in the Vulgar Tongue, which put every one into a Capacity of Censuring, and which seem to convince the Authors themselves of Vulgar Conception and Design. I will have them wound <hi>Plutarch</hi> through my Sides, and rail against <hi>Seneca</hi> when they think they rail at me. I must shelter my own Weakness under these great Reputations; I shall love any one that can plume me, that is, by Clearness of Understanding and Judgment, and by the sole Distinction of the Force and Beauty of Discourse. For I, who, for want of Memory, am at every turn at a loss to pick them out of their National Livery, am yet wise enough to know, by the Measure of my own Abilities, that my Soil is incapable of producing any of those rich Flowers, that I there find set, and growing; and that all the Fruits of my own
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53645:396" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Growth are not worth any one of them. For this, indeed, I hold my self very responsible, though the Confession makes against me; if there be any Vanity and Vice in my Writings, which I do not of my self perceive, nor can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, when pointed out to me by another; for many Faults escape the Eye, but the Infirmity of Judgment consists in not being able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, when, by another, laid open to us. Knowledge and Truth may be in us without Judgment, and Judgment also without them; but the Confession of Ignorance is one of the fairest and surest Testimonies of Judgment that I know: I have no other Officer to put my Writings in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File,</hi> but only Fortune. As things come into my head, I heap them one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which sometimes advance in whole Bodies, sometimes in single Files: I am content that every one should see my natural and ordinary Pace, as ill as it is. I suffer my self to jog on, at my own rate and ease. Neither are these Subjects, which a Man is not permitted to be ignorant in, or casually, and at a venture, to discourse of. I could wish to have a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge of things, but I will not buy it so dear as it will cost. My design is to pass over easily, and not laboriously, the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my Life. There is nothing that I will cudgel my Brains about; no, not Knowledge, of what price soever. I seek, in the reading of Books, only to please my self, by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable Divertion: Or if I study, 'tis for no other Science, than what treats of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53645:397"/>
Knowledge of my self, and instructs me how to dye, and live well.

I do not bite my Nails about the Difficulties I meet with in my Reading; after a Charge, or two, I give them over. Should I insist upon them, I should both lose my self, and time; for I have an impatient Understanding, that must be satisfied at first: What I do not discern at first, is, by Persistency, rendred more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure. I do nothing without Gayety; Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, and a too obstinate Endeavour, dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, stupifies and tires my Judgment. My Sight is confounded and dissipated with poring; I must withdraw it, and refer my Discovery to new Attempts: Just, as to judge rightly of the Lustre Scarlet, we are taught to pass it lightly with the Eye, in running it over at several sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and reiterated Views and Glances. If one Book do not please me, I take another, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with any, but at such times as I am weary of doing nothing. I care not much for new ones, because the old seem fuller, and of stronger Reason; neither do I much tamper with Greek Authors, my Knowledge in that Language being too little to read them with any delight. Amongst those that are simply plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, of the Moderns, <hi>Boccace</hi> his <hi>Decameron,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53645:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Rabelais,</hi> and the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Johannes Secundus</hi> (if those may be ranged under that Title) are worth Reading. As to <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> and such kind of stuff, they had not the Credit to take me, so much as in my Childish Years. And I will moreover say (whether boldly, or rashly) that this old, heavy Soul of mine is now no longer delighted with <hi>Ariosto</hi>; no, nor with <hi>Ovid</hi>; and that his Facility and Invention, with which I was formerly so ravished, are now of no more Relish, and I can hardly have the patience to read him. I speak my Opinion free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all things, even of those that, perhaps, exceed my Capacity, and that I do not conceive to be, in any wise, under my Jurisdiction. And accordingly, the Judgment I deliver, is to shew the Measure of my own Sight, and not of the things I make so bold to censure: When I find my self disgusted with <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Axiochus,</hi> as with a Work (with due Respect to such an Author be it spoken) without force, my Judgment does not believe it self: It is not so arrogant as to oppose the Authority of so many other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Judgments of Antiquity, which it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as its Regents and Masters, and with whom it is rather content to err. In such a Case, it condemns it self, either for stopping at the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bark, not being able to penetrate to the Heart, or for considering it by some false Light, and is content with securing it self from Trouble and Error only; and, as to its own Weakness, does frankly acknowledge and confess it. It thinks it gives a just Interpretation, according
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53645:398" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Appearances, by its Conceptions presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it; but they are weak and imperfect. Most of the Fables of <hi>Aesop</hi> have in them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senses and Meanings, of which, the <hi>Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists</hi> chose some one, that quadrates well to the Fable; but, for the most part, 'tis but the first Face that presents it self, and is Superficial only: There yet remain others more lively, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential and profound, into which they have not been able to penetrate; and just so do I.</p>
                     <p>But, to pursue the business of this Essay, I have always thought, that in Poesie, <hi>Virgil, Lucretius, Catullus</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> do many degrees excel the rest; and signally, <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks,</hi> which I look upon for the most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished piece of Poetry; and, in comparison of which, a Man may easily discern, that there are some places in his <hi>Aeneids,</hi>

It is quite otherwise with my Author; the Elegancy and Perfection of his way of Speaking, makes us lose the Appetite of his Plot. His fine Expression, Elegancy and Queint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is every where Taking: He is so pleasant throughout.

And does so possess the Soul with his Graces, that we forget those of his <hi>Fable.</hi> This very Consideration carries me further: I observe, that the best and most ancient Poets have avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Affectation, and hunting after, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of fantastick <hi>Spanish,</hi> and Petrarchick Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but even the softest, and most gentle Touches, which are the only Ornaments of succeeding Poesie. And yet there is no good Judgment that will condemn this in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and that does not incomparably more admire the equal Politeness, and that perpetual Sweetness, and flourishing Beauty, that appears in <hi>Catullus</hi> his Epigrams,<note place="margin">

themselves: The others have need of Foreign Assistance; as they have the less Wit, they must have the more Body; they mount on Horseback, because they are not able to stand on their own Legs. As in our Balls, those mean Fellows that teach to dance, not being able to represent the Presence and Decency of our Nobleness, are fain to supply it with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Leaps, and other strange Motions, and fantastick Tricks.

And, as I have also seen good Tumblers, when in their own Every-day-Cloaths, and with the same Face they always wear, give us all the pleasure of their Art, when their Apprentices, not yet arrived to such a pitch of Perfection, are fain to meal their Faces, put themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ridiculous Disguises, and make a hundred Mimick Faces, to prepare us for Laughter. This Conception of mine is no where more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable, than in comparing the <hi>Aeneid</hi> with <hi>Orlando Furioso</hi>; of which, we see the first, by Dint of Wing, flying in a brave and lofty Place, and always following his Point; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fluttering and hopping from Tale to Tale, as from Branch to Branch, not daring to trust his Wings but in very short Flights, and pearching at every turn, lest his Breath and Force should fail.

These then, as to this sort of Subjects, are the Authors that best please me. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my other Reading that mixes a little more Profit with the Pleasure, and from whence I learn how to marshal my Opinions and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the Books that serve me to this purpose, are <hi>Plutarch</hi> (since translated into French) and <hi>Seneca</hi>:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of</hi> Plutarch <hi>and</hi> Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> Both of which have this great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience suited to my Humour, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I there seek, is discoursed in loose pieces, that do not engage me in any great trouble of reading long, of which I am impatient. Such are the Opusculums of the first, and the Epistles of the latter, which are also the best, and most profiting of all their Writings. 'Tis no great attempt to take one of them in hand, and I give over at pleasure; for they have no sequele or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon one another. These Authors, for the most part, concur in useful and true Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: And there is this Parallel betwixt them, That Fortune brought them into the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same Age: They were both Tutors to two <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours: Both sought out from foreign Countries: Both Rich, and both Great Men. Their Instruction is the Cream of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and deliver'd after a plain and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner. <hi>Plutarch</hi> is more uniform and constant; <hi>Seneca</hi> more various and waving. The last toil'd, set himself, and bent his whole Force to fortifie Vertue against Frailty, Fear and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Appetites: The other seems more to slight their Power, and to disdain to alter his Pace, and to stand upon his Guard. <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Opinions
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53645:400" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are <hi>Platonick,</hi> sweet, and accommodated to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society: Those of the other are <hi>Stoical</hi> and <hi>Epicurean,</hi> more remote from the common Usance; but, in my Opinion, more especially proper, and more firm. <hi>Seneca</hi> seems to lean a little to the Tyranny of the Emperours of his time, and only seems; for I take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he speak against his Judgment, when he condemns the Generous Action of those who assassinated <hi>Caesar. Plutarch</hi> is frank through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. <hi>Seneca</hi> abounds with brisk Touches and Sallies: <hi>Plutarch</hi> with things that heats and moves you more; this contents and pays you better. This guides us, the other pushes us on. As to <hi>Cicero,</hi> those of his Works that are most useful to my Design, are they that treat of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, especially Moral: But boldly to confess the truth, his way of Writing, and that of all other Long-winded Authors, appears to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tedious: For his Prefaces, Definitions, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Etimologies take up the greatest part of his Work:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Censure of</hi> Cicero.</note> Whatever there is of Life and Marrow, is smother'd and lost in the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When I have spent an hour in reading him (which is a great deal for me) and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what I have thence extracted of Juice and Substance; for the most part I find nothing but Wind; for he is not yet come to the Arguments that serve to his purpose, and the Reasons that should properly help to loose the Knot I would untye. For me, who only desire to become more Wise, not more Learned or Eloquent, these Logical or Aristotelian Dispositions of Parts
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53645:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are of no use. I would have a Man begin with the main Proposition, and that wherein the force of the Argument lies: I know well enough what Death and Pleasure are, let no Man give himself the trouble to anatomize them to me; I look for good and solid Reasons at the first dash to instruct me how to stand the Shock, and resist them; to which purpose, neither Grammatical Subtilties, nor the queint Contexture of Words and Argumentations are of any use at all: I am for Discourses that gives the first Charge into the Heart of the Doubt; his languish about his Subjects, and delay our Expectation. Those are proper for the Schools, for the Bar, and for the Pulpit, where we have leisure to nod, and may awake a quarter of an hour after time enough to find again the Thread of the Discourse. It is necessary to speak after this manner to Judges, whom a Man has a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, Right or Wrong, to encline to favour his Cause, to Children and Common-people; to whom a Man must say all he can, and try what effects his Eloquence can produce. I would not have an Author make it his business to render me attentive: Or that he should cry out fifty times, <hi>Oyez,</hi> as the Clerks and Heralds do. The <hi>Romans</hi> in their Religious Exercises, began with <hi>Hoc age</hi>: As we in ours do with <hi>Sursum corda,</hi> which are so many words lost to me: I come thither already fully prepared from my Chamber, I need no Allurement, no Invitation, no Sauce; I eat the Meat Raw, so that, instead of whetting my Appetite by these Preparatives,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53645:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they tire, and pall it. Will the License of the time excuse the Sacrilegious Boldness to censure the <hi>Dialogisms</hi> of <hi>Plato</hi> himself,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>And of</hi> Plato.</note> for as dull and heavy as the other before nam'd, whilst he too much stifles his Matter? And to lament so much time lost by a Man who had so many better things to say, in so many long and needless Preliminary Interlocutions? My Ignorance will better excuse me in that, I understand not Greek so well, as to discern the Beauty of his Language. I would generally chuse Books that use Sciences, not such as only lead to them. The two first, and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and their like, have nothing of this <hi>Hoc age</hi>; they will have to do with Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready instructed; or if they have, 'tis a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial <hi>Hoc age,</hi> and that has a Body by it self. I also delight in reading his Epistles, <hi>ad Atticum</hi>; not only because they contain a great deal of History, and the Affairs of his time; but much more because I therein discover much of his own private Humour: For I have a singular curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as I have said elsewhere) to pry into the Souls, and the Natural and True Judgments of the Authors with whom I converse. A Man may indeed judge of their Parts, but not of their Manners, nor of themselves, by the Writings they expose upon the Theatre of the World. I have a thousand times lamented the loss of the Treatise <hi>Brutus</hi> writ upon Vertue; for it is best Learning the <hi>Theorie</hi> of those who best know the <hi>Practick.</hi> But seeing the thing preached, and the Preacher are different things, I would as willingly see <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as in a Book
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53645:402" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his own. I would rather chuse to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inform'd of the Conference he had in his Tent with some particular Friend of his the night before a Battle, than of the Harangue he made the next day to his Army; and of what he did in his Closset and his Chamber, than what he did in the Publick Place, and in the Senate. As to <hi>Cicero,</hi> I am of the common Opinion that (Learning excepted) he had no great Natural Parts. He was a good Citizen, of an affable Nature, as all fat, heavy Men, such as he was, usually are: But given to ease, and had a mighty share of Vanity and Ambition. Neither do I know how to excuse him for thinking his Poetry fit to be publish't. 'Tis no great Imperfection to make ill Verses; but it is an Imperfection, not to be able to judge how unworthy his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were of the Glory of his Name. For what concerns his Eloquence, that is totally out of comparison, and I believe it will never be equal'd. The younger <hi>Cicero,</hi> who resembled his Father in nothing but in Name, whilst commanding in <hi>Asia,</hi> had several Strangers one day at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and, amongst the rest, <hi>Caestius</hi> seated at the lower end, as Men often intrude to the open Tables of the Great: <hi>Cicero</hi> ask't one of the Waiters who that Man was, who presently told him his Name: But he, as one that had his Thoughts taken up with something else, and that had forgot the Answer made him, asking three or four times, over, and over again, the same Question; the Fellow, to deliver himself from so many Questions, and to make him know
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53645:402" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him by some particular Circumstance; 'Tis that <hi>Caestius,</hi> said he, of whom it was told you, that he makes no great Account of your Fathers Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in comparison of his own. At which, <hi>Cicero</hi> being suddenly nettled, commanded poor <hi>Caestius</hi> presently to be seiz'd, and caus'd him to be very well whip't in his own presence; a very discourteous Entertainer! Yet even amongst those, who, all things consider'd, have reputed his Eloquence incomparable; there have been some however, who have not stuck to observe some Faults in his Writing: As that Great <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Friend for example, who said 'twas a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and feeble Eloquence, <hi>fractam &amp; elumbem.</hi> The Orators also nearest to the Age wherein he liv'd, reprehended in him the Care he had of a certain long Cadence in his Periods, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly took notice of these Words, <hi>esse videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> which he there so oft makes use of. For my part, I better approve of a shorter Style, and that comes more roundly off. He does, though sometimes, shuffle his Parts more brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, but 'tis very seldom. I have my self taken notice of this one Passage, <hi>Ego vero me minus diu senem mallem, quÃ m esse senem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cicero <hi>de Sencet.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam essem.</hi> The Historians are my true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, for they are pleasant and easie, where immediately Man in general, the Knowledge of whom I hunt after, does there appear more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intire than any where besides: The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Truth of his Internal Qualities, in gross and peace-meal, the diversity of means by which he is united and knit, and the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53645:403" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that threaten him. Now those that write Lives, by reason they insist more upon Counsels than Events, more upon what sallies from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than upon that which happens without, are the most proper for my reading; and therefore, above all others, <hi>Plutarch</hi> is the Man for me. I am very sorry we have not a dozen <hi>Laertii,</hi> or that he was not further extended, and better understood: For I am equally curious to know the Lives and Fortunes of these great Instructors of the World, as to know the Diversities of their Doctrines and Opinions. In this kind of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (the reading of Histories) a Man must tumble over, without distinction, all sorts of Authors, both Antick and Modern; as well Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and Absolute, as those of current Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, there to know the things of which they variously treat:<note place="margin">Caesar's <hi>Com. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</hi>
                        </note> But <hi>Caesar,</hi> in my Opinion, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deserves to be studied, not for the Knowledge of the History only, but for himself, so great an Excellence and Perfection he has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the rest, though <hi>Salust</hi> be one of the number. In earnest, I read this Author with more reverence and respect than is usually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to Humane Writings; one while consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in his Person, by his Actions and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Greatness, and another in the Purity and inimitable Neatness of his Language and Style, wherein he not only excels all other Historians, as <hi>Cicero</hi> confesses, but peradventure, even <hi>Cicero</hi> himself; speaking of his Enemies with so much Sincerity in his Judgment; that, the false Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours with which he strives to palliate his ill
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53645:403" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cause, and the Ordure of his Pestilent Ambition excepted, I think there is no Fault to be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against him, saving this, that he speaks too sparingly of himself, seeing so many great things could not have been perform'd under his Conduct, but that his own Personal Valour must necessarily have had a greater share in the Execution, than he attributes to himself. I love Historians, who are either very sincere, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent. The Sincere who have nothing of their own to mix with it, and who only make it their Business to make a Faithful Collection of all that comes to their Knowledge, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to record all things without Choice or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, leaving to us the entire Judgment of discerning the Truth of things. Such, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample amongst others, as honest <hi>Froissard,</hi> who has proceeded in his Undertaking with so frank a Plainness, that having committed an Error,<note place="margin">Froissard.</note> he is not asham'd to confess, and correct it in the place where the Finger has been laid, and who represents to us even the Variety of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that were then spread abroad, and the different Reports that were made to him; which is the naked and unaffected Matter of History, and of which every one may make his Profit, according to his proportion of Understanding. The more excellent sort of Historians have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pick out what is most worthy to be known; and, of two Reports, to examine which is the most likely to be true: From the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Princes, and their Humours, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Counsels, and attribute to them Words
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53645:404" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proper for the Occasion; and such have Title to assume the Authority of Regulating our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to what they themselves believe; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this Privilege belongs not to every one. For the middle sort of Historians (of which, the most part are) they spoil all; they will chew our Meat for us, they take upon them to judge of, and consequently, to incline the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story to their own Liking; for if the Judgment partially lean to one side, a Man cannot avoid wresting and writhing his Narrative to that <hi>Byass.</hi> They undertage to chuse things worthy to be known, and yet very oft conceal from us such a Word, such a private Action, as would much better instruct us; omit, as incredible, such things as they do not understand, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure some, because they cannot express them well in good French or Latin. Let them, in God's Name, display their Eloquence, and judge according to their own fancy: but let them, withall, leave us something to judge of after them, and neither alter, nor disguise, by their Abridgments, and at their own Choice, any thing of the substance of the Matter; but deliver it to us pure and entire in all its Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the most part, and especially in these latter Ages, Persons are cull'd out for this Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

By which we may see, whether the Inquisition after Truth be not very delicate, when a Man cannot believe the Report of a Battle from the Knowledge of him who there commanded, nor from the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were engaged in it, unless, after the

In good earnest, the Knowledge we have of our own private Affairs, is much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: But that has been sufficiently handled by <hi>Bodin,</hi> and according to my own Sentiment. A little to relieve the weakness of my Memory (so extream, that it has hapned to me more than once, to take Books again into my hand for new, and unseen, that I had carefully read over a few Years before, and scribled with my Notes) I have taken a Custom of late, to fix at the end of every Book (that is, of those I never intended to read again) the Time, when I made an end on't, and the Judgment I had made of it, to the end that that might, at least, represent to me the Air and general Idea, I had conceiv'd of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in reading it; and I will here transcribe some of those Annotations. I writ this, some ten Years ago,<note place="margin">

'Tis not to be imagined, that he should have disguised any thing, either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Hatred, Favour, or Vanity; of which, the liberal Censures he passes upon the Great Ones; and particularly, those by whom he was advanced, and employed in Commands of great Trust and Honour

(as Pope</hi> Clement <hi>the Seventh) give ample Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. As to that part, which he thinks himself the best at, namely, his Digressions and Discourses; he has, indeed, very good ones, and enrich'd with fine Expressions; but he is too fond of them: for, to leave nothing unsaid, having a Subject so plain, ample, and almost infinite, he degenerates into Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry, and relishes a little of the Scholasting Prattle. I have also observed this in him, That of so many Souls, and so many Effects; so many Motives, and so many Counsels as he judges of, he never attributes any one to Vertue, Religion, or Conscience; as if all those were utterly extinct in the World: And of all the Actions, how brave, in outward shew, soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they appear in themselves, he always throws the Cause and Motive upon some vicious Occasion, or some prospect of Profit. It is impossible to imagine, but that, amongst such an infinite number of Actions, as he makes mention of, there must be some one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the way of Reason. No Corruption could so universally have infected Men, that some one would not have escaped the Contagion: Which makes me suspect, that his own Taste was vicious; from whence it might happen, that he judged other Men by himself.</hi> In my <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> there is this written;<note place="margin">

I will not believe that they have falsified any thing, as to Matter of Fact; but they make a common practice of wresting the Judgment of Events (very often contrary to Reason) to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and of omitting whatsoever is nice to be handled in the Life of their Master; witness the Relation of</hi> Messieurs de Montmorency, <hi>and</hi> de Brion, <hi>which were here omitted: nay, so much as the very name of Madam</hi> d'Estampes <hi>is not here to to be found. Secret Actions an Historian may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal; but to pass over in silence what all the World knows, and things that have drawn after them publick Consequences, is an inexcusable defect. In fine, Whoever has a mind to have a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of King</hi> Francis, <hi>amd the Revolutions of his Reign, let him seek it elsewhere, if my Advice may prevail. The only profit a Man can reap from hence is, from the particular Narrative of Battles, and other Exploits of War, wherein these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

who, in this Extremity led him to Execution, with words to this effect: <hi>That it was a thing too easie, and too base, to do ill; and that to do well where there was no danger, was a common thing; but that to do well where there was danger, was the proper Office of a Man of Vertue.</hi> These words of <hi>Metellus</hi> do very clearly represent to us, what I would make out; <hi>viz.</hi> That Vertue refuses Facility for a Companion; and that that easie, smooth and descending Way, by which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Steps of a sweet Disposition of Nature are conducted, is not that of a true Vertue: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a rough and stormy Passage; she will have either Exotick Difficulties to wrestle with, (like that of <hi>Metellus</hi>) by means whereof For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune delights to interrupt the Speed of her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; or internal Difficulties, that the inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Appetites and Imperfections of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion introduce to disturb her.

without Opposition or Disturbance. If Vertue cannot shine bright, but by the Conflict of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Appetites, shall we then say, that she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without the Assistance of Vice; and that it is from her, that she derives her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Honour? What then also would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that brave and generous <hi>Epicurean</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which makes account that it nourishes Vertue tenderly in her Lap, and there makes it play and wanton, giving it for Toys to play withal, Shame, Fevers, Poverty, Death and Torments?

that so brave an Action had been inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently placed in any other Life, than that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>; and that it only appertain'd to His, to end so.

We do not become others for dying. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways interpret the Death, by the Life prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and if any one tell me of a Death strong and constant in appearance, annexed to a feeble Life, I conclude it produced by some feeble Cause, and suitable to the Life before. The Easiness then of this Death, and the Facility of Dying, he had acquired by the vigour of his Soul; shall we say, that it ought to abate any thing of the lustre of his Vertue? And who, that has his Brain never so little tinctur'd with the true Philosophy, can be content to imagine <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> only free from Fear and Passion, in the Accident of his Prison, Fetters and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

not what) new Satisfaction, and a frolick Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in his last Words and Actions? At the Start he gave, with the pleasure of scratching his Leg, when his Irons were taken off, does he not discover an equal Serenity and Joy in his Soul for being freed from past Inconveniences, and at the same time to enter into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come? <hi>Cato</hi> shall pardon me, if he please; his Death, indeed, is more tragical, and more taken notice of, but yet this is (I know not how) methinks finer. <hi>Aristippus,</hi> to one that was lamenting his Death; <hi>The Gods grant me such an one,</hi> said he.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vertue turn'd into Habit in</hi> Cato <hi>and</hi> Socrates.</note> A Man discerns in the Souls of these two great Men, and their Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (for I very much doubt, whether there was ever their like) so perfect a Habitude to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that it was turn'd to a Complection. It is no more a laborious Vertue, nor the Precepts of Reason, to maintain which, the Soul is so wrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; but the very Essence of their Souls, their natural and ordinary Habit. They have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it such by a long Practice of Philosophical Precepts, having light upon a rich and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature. The vicious Passions that spring in us, can find no Entrance into them. The Force and Vigour of their Souls stifle and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish irregular Desires, so soon as they begin to move. Now, that it is not more noble, by a high and divine Resolution, to hinder the Birth of Temptations; and to be so form'd to Vertue, that the very Seeds of Vice be rooted out, than to hinder their Progress; and having suffer'd themselves to be surprized with the first Motions
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53645:410" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Passions, to arm themselves, and to stand firm to oppose their Progress, and overcome them: And that this second Effect is not also much more generous, than to be simply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a frail and affable Nature, of it self, disaffected to Debauchery and Vice, I do not think can be doubted; for this third and last sort of Vertue seems to render a Man innocent, but not vertuous; free from doing ill, but not apt enough to do well: considering also, that this Condition is so near Neighbour to Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Cowardize, that I know not very well how to separate the Confines, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them: The very name of Good Nature and Innocence are, for this reason, in some sort grown into Contempt. I very well know, that several Vertues, as Chastity, Sobriety and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, may come to a Man through Personal Defects. Constancy in Danger, if it must be so called, the Contempt of Death, and Patience in Misfortunes, may oft times be found in Men, for want of well judging of such Accidents, and not apprehending them for such as they are. Want of Apprehension, and Sottishness, do sometimes counterfeit vertuous Effects: As I have oft seen it happen, that Men have been commended for what really merited Blame.

strange, if they were often, in War, observed to provide for their Safety, even before they had discover'd the Peril: That we <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were not so cunning, went on further; and that we must be made to see and feel the danger, before we would take the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm; and that even then we had no Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Swisse,</hi> more heavy,<note place="margin">Germans <hi>and</hi> Suisses <hi>Logger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi>

For this reason it is, that, when we judge of a particular Action, we are to consider several Circumstances, and the whole Man by whom it is perform'd, before we give it a name. To instance in my self; I have sometimes known my Friends call that Prudence in me, which was meerly Fortune; and repute that Courage and Patience, which was Judgment and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and attribute to me one Title for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sometimes to my advantage, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwise.

But so it is, that I have naturally a Horror for most Vices. The Answer of <hi>Antisthenes</hi> to him who askt him, Which was the best Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, To unlearn Evil, seems to point at this. I have them in Horror, I say, with a Detestation so Natural, and so much my own, that the same Instinct and Impression I brought with me from my Nurse, I yet retain, no Temptation whatever had the power to make me alter it. Not so much as my own Discourses, which in some things lashing out of the Common Road of modest Speaking, might easily license me to Actions, that my Natural Inclination makes me hate. I will say a prodigious thing, but I will say it however. I find my self in many things more curb'd and retain'd by my Manners than my Opinion, and my Concupiscence less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht than my Reason. <hi>Aristippus</hi> instituted Opinions so bold, in favour of Pleasure and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as made all the Philosophers murmur at him: But as to his Manners, <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, having presented three Beautiful Women

His Servant finding himself over-loaden upon the Way, with the Money he carried after him, he order'd him to pour out, and throw away, that which troubled him. And <hi>Epicurus,</hi> whose Doctrines were so irreligious and effeminate, was in his Life very laborious and devout: He writ to a Friend of his, that he liv'd only upon Biscuit and Water, intreating him to send him a little Cheese, to lye by him against he had a mind to make a Feast. Must it be true, that to be a perfect good Man, we must be so by an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, Natural and Universal Propriety, without Law, Reason or Example? The Debauches, wherein I have been ingag'd, have not been (I thank God) of the worse sort, and I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them in my self, for my Judgment was never infected by them. On the contrary I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them more severely in my self, than in any other. But that is all, for, as to the rest, I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose too little resistance, and suffer my self to encline too much to the other side of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, excepting that I imoderate them, and prevent them from mixing with other Vices, which, for the most part, will cling together, if a Man have not a care. I have contracted and curtal'd mine, to make them as single as I can:

These are witty and substantial Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which Philosophy sometimes insists upon. I follow some Vices, but I fly others, as much as a Saint would do. The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> also disown this indissoluble Connexion; and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> is of Opinion, that a Prudent, and Just Man may be intemperate and lascivious. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> confessed to some, who had discover'd a certain inclination to Vice in his Physiognomy, that it was, in truth, his Natural Propension, but that he had by Discipline corrected it. And such as were familiar with the Pihlosopher <hi>Stilpo</hi> hath said, That, being born subject to Wine and Women, he had by Study rendred himself very abstinent, both from the one, and the other. What I have in me of Good, I have, quite contrary, by the chance of my Birth; and hold it not either by Law, Precept, or any other Instruction. The Innocency, that is in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53645:413" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me, is a simple and unexperienced one, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vigour, and less Art. Amongst other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I mortally hate Cruelty, both by Nature and Judgment, as the very extream of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But with so much tenderness withal, that I cannot see a Chickens Neck pul'd off, without trouble, and cannot without impatience, endure the Cry of a Hare in my Dogs Teeth, though the Chase be a violent Pleasure. Such as have Sensuality to encounter, willingly make use of this Argument, (to shew that it is altogether vicious and unreasonable) that when it is at the height, it subjects us to that degree, that a Man's Reason can have no access, and instance our own Experience in the Act of Love. Wherein they conceive, that the Pleasure does so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, that our Reason cannot perform its Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whilst we are so benumn'd and extasied in Delight. I know very well, it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and that a Man may sometimes, if he will, gain this point over himself to sway his Soul, even in the Critical moment, to think of some thing else: But then he must leisurely incline, and ply it to that bent. I know, that a Man may triumph over the utmost effort of this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: I have experienced it in my self, and have not found <hi>Venus</hi> so imperious a Goddess, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and some more reform'd than I, declare. I do not consider it as a Miracle, as the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> does in one of the Tales of her <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameron,</hi> (which is a marvilous pretty Book of that kind) nor for a thing of extream difficulty, to pass over whole Nights, where a Man has

He punished his Secretary <hi>Philomon,</hi> who had attempted to poyson him, with no greater seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than a single Death. Without naming that Latin Author, that dare alledge for a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Mercy, the killing only of those by whom we have been offended: It is easie to guess that he was struck with the horrid and inhumane Examples of Cruelty, practis'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. For my part, even in Justice it self, all that exceeds a Simple Death, appears to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cruelty; especially in us who ought to have regard to their Souls, to dismiss them in a good and calm Condition; which cannot be, when we have discompos'd them by insufferable Torments. Not long since, a Souldier, who was a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Prisoner, perceiving from a Tower, where he was shut up, that the people began to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the place of Execution, and that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters

With this he first gave himself two great Wounds about his Throat, but finding those would not do, he presently after gave himself a third in the Belly, where he left the Nayle sticking up to the head. The first of his Keepers that came in, found him in this Condition; yet alive, but sunk down, and near expiring by his Wounds. To make use of time therefore, before he should die and defeat the Law, they made hast to read his Sentence: Which having done, and he hearing that he was only condemn'd to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, he seem'd to take new Courage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of Wine, which he had before refus'd, and thanked his Judges for the unhop'd for Mildness of their Sentence; saying, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had taken a resolution to dispatch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for fear of a more severe and insupportable Death: Having entertain'd an Opinion by the Preparations he had seen in the <hi>Place,</hi> that they were resolved to torment him with some hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Execution; and seem'd to be delivered from Death, for having it changed from what he apprehended. I should advise, that these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Severity, by which 'tis design'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the people in their Duty, might be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised upon the dead Bodies of <hi>Criminals</hi>; for to see them deprived of Sepulture, to see them

For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Deportments of the Soul, whilst it had been in <hi>Alexander,</hi> they said, that God ordered it another body to inhabit, more or less painful, and proper for its Conditions.

And the very Interpretation, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives to this Error, which is very well taken, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to them: For he says, that it was not the Cat; or the Oxe (for example) that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ador'd: But that they in those Beasts ador'd some Image of the Divine Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; in this the Patience and Utility, in that the Vivacity, or, as our Neighbours, the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians,</hi> with the <hi>Germans,</hi> the Impatience to see it self shut up; by which, they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Liberty they lov'd and ador'd, above all other Divine Faculty, and so of the rest.

The <hi>Romans</hi> had a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick regard to the Nourishment of Geese, by whose Vigilancy their Capitol had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd: The <hi>Athenians</hi> made a Decree, that the Mules and Moyles which had serv'd at the building of the Temple call'd <hi>Hecatompedon,</hi> should be free, and suffer'd to pasture at their own choice without hindrance. The <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentines</hi> had a common usance solemnly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Beasts, they had a kindness for; as Horses of some rare qualities, Dogs, and Birds of whom they had had profit, and even those that had only been kept to divert their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53645:420"/>
as to order'd it to be Printed; which also, after his death, was perform'd. I found the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Author exceeding fine, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his Work well follow'd, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign full of Piety; and because many People take a delight to read it, and particularly the Ladies, to whom we owe the most Service, I have often been ready to assist them, to clear the Book of two principal Objections. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is hardy, and bold; for he undertakes, by Humane and Natural Reasons, to establish, and make good against the Atheists, all the <hi>Articles</hi> of Christian <hi>Religion:</hi> wherein (to speak the truth) he is so firm, and so successful, that I do not think it possible to do better upon that Subject; and do believe that he has been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by none. This Work seeming to me to be too beautiful, and too rich for an Author, whose Name is so little known, and of whom, all that we know is, that he was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Physick at <hi>Tholouse</hi> about two hundred Years ago; I enquired of <hi>Adrian Turnebus,</hi> who knew all things, what he thought of that Book; who made Answer, That he thought it was some Abstract drawn from St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin</hi>; for that, in truth, his Wit, full of infinite Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and absolute Subtilty, was only capable of those Thoughts.

Christians are too blame to repose their Belief upon Humane Reasons, which is only conceiv'd by Faith, and the particular Inspiration of Divine Grace.</hi> In which Objection, there appears to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Zeal to Piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfie those who put it forth, with the greater Mildness and Respect. This were a Task more proper for a Man well read in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than for me who know nothing of it; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, I conceive that, in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as this Truth, with which it has plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Bounty of Almighty God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should, moreover, lend us his Assistance after a very extraordinary Method of Favour, to conceive and imprint it in our Understandings; and do not believe, that Meanes purely humane, are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent Souls, and so abundantly furnish'd with natural Force, in former Ages, had not faild, by their Reason, to arrive at this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 'Tis <hi>Faith</hi> alone, that livelily and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly comprehends the deep Mysteries of our Religion; but withall, I do not say, that it is not a brave, and a very laudable Attempt, to accommodate the Natural and Humane Utensils, that God has endow'd us with, to the Service of our Faith: It is not to be doubted, but that it the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a Christian-Man more noble, than to make it the Aim and End of all his Thoughts and Studies, to extend and

We do not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our selves with serving God with our Souls and Understanding only, we moreover owe and render him a Corporal Reverence, and apply our Limbs, Motions, and external Things, to do him Honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our Faith with all the Reason we have, but always with this Reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our Arguments and Endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a Knowledge. If it enter not into us by an extraordinary Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; if it only enter, not only by Arguments of Reason, but, moreover, by Human Ways, it is not in us in its true Dignity and Splendor; and yet, I am afraid we only have it by this way.

Compare our Manners to those of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan or Pagan, you will still find, that we fall very short; whereas out of regard to the Reputation, and Advantage of our Religion, we ought to shine in Vertue, and that it should be said of us, Are they so Just, so Charitable,<note place="margin">

For this, our good St. <hi>Lewis</hi> was in the right; when the King of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who was become Christian, designed to come to Lyons, to kiss the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Feet, and there to be an Eye-witness of the Sanctity he hoped to find in our Manners; immediately to divert him from his purpose; for fear lest our inordinate way of Living should on the contrary put him out of conceit with so holy a Belief. And yet it hapned quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise since to this other, who going to <hi>Rome</hi> to the same End, and there seeing the Dissolution of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our <hi>Religion,</hi> considering how great the Force and Divinity of it must necessarily be, that could maintain its Dignity and Splendor amongst so much Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and in so Vicious Hands. If we had but one single Grain of Faith, we should remove Mountains from their places, says the Sacred Word; our Actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the Divinity, would not be mearly Human, they would have in them something of Miraculous, as well as our Belief. <hi>Brevis est institutio vitae honestae, beataeque, si credas.</hi> Some impose upon the World that they believe that which they do not; others more in Number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe.

And hearken now from what Quarter comes the Vote, and Instruction of both the one, and the other; and if Arms makes less noise, and rattle for this Cause, than for that. We condemn those to the Fire, who say, That Truth must be made to bear the Yoak of our Necessity; and how much more does <hi>France,</hi> than say it? Let us confess the Truth; whoever should draw out the Army, lawfully rais'd by the Kings Authority, those who take up Arms out of pure Zeal to Religion, and also those who only do it to protect the Laws of their Country, or for the Service of their Prince, could hardly out of both these put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, make one compleat Company of <hi>Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'armes.</hi> Whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found, who have maintained the same Will, and the same Progress in our Civil Commotions, and that we see them one while move but a Foot-pace, and another run Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speed? And the same Men one while endamage our Affairs by their violent Heat and Austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and another by their Coldness, Gentleness and Slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and causal Considerations, according to the Variety whereof they move? I evidently perceive, that we do not willingly afford Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any other Offices, but those that best suit with our own Passions.

Our Religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to extirpate Vices: Whereas it skreens, nourishes and incites them. We must not mock God. If we did believe in him, I do not say by Faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say, (and I speak it to our great shame,) if we did believe him, as we do any other History; or as we would do one of our Companions, we should love him above all other things, for the infinite Bounty and Beauty that shines in him: at least he would go equal in our Affections, with Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Pleasures, Glory, and our Friends. The best of us is not so much afraid to injure him, as he is afraid to injure his Neighbour, his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or his Master. Is there any so weak Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that having on one side the Object of one of our vicious Pleasures, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in equal knowledge and perswasion) the State of an Immortal Glory, will dispute for the first, against the other? And yet we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times renounce this out of pure Contempt: For what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, the very desire to offend?

Let us subdue this Presumption; The first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Tyranny of the Evil Spirit. <hi>Deus superbis resistit: Humilibus autem dat gratiam. God resists the Proud; but gives Grace to the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Understanding is in all the <hi>Gods,</hi> (says <hi>Plato</hi>) and not at all, or very little, in Men.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 55.</note> Now it is in the mean time a great Consolation to a Christian Man, to see our Frail and Mortals
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53645:428"/>
Parts so fitly suited to our Holy and Divine Faith, that when we employ them to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their own Mortal and Frail Nature, they are not even there more equally, or more firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, adjusted. Let us see then, if Man hath in his power other more forcible and convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, than those of <hi>Sebonde</hi>; That is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reasons. For St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> disputing against the people, has good cause to reproach them with Injustice, in that they maintain the part of our Belief to be false, that our Reason cannot establish. And to shew that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things may be, and may have been, of which our Nature could not sound the Reason and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he proposes to them certain known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Experiments, wherein Men confess they see nothing, and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious Inquisition. We must do more than this, and make them know, that to convince the weakness of their Reason, there is no necessity of culling out rare Examples: And that it is so defective, and so blind that there is no so clear Facility clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for it, that to it the easie and the hard is all alone; that all Subjects equally, and Nature in general, disclaims its Authority, and rejects its Mediation. What does Truth mean, when she preaches to us to fly wordly <hi>Philosophy,</hi> when she so often inculcates to us,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the World, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God.</hi>
                        </note> That our Wisdom is but Folly in the sight of God. That the vainest of all Vanities is Man: That the Man who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes upon his Wisdom, does not yet know
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53645:428" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what Wisdom is; and that Man, who is nothing, if he think himself to be any thing, does seduce and deceive himself? These Sentences of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> do so clearly and lively express that which I would maintain, that I should need no other proof against Men, who would with all Humility and Obedience submit to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But these will be whipt at their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and will not suffer that a Man oppose their Reason, but by it self. Let us then for once consider a Man alone, without foreign As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, arm'd only with his own proper Arms, and unfurnished of the Divine Grace and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is all his Honour, Strength, and the Foundation of his Being. Let us see what certainty he has, in this fine Equipage. Let him make me understand by the force of his Reason, upon what Foundations he has built those great Advantages, he thinks he has over other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Who has made him believe, that this admirable Motion of the Celestial Arch, the Eternal Light of those Tapers that roll over his Head, the wonderful Motions of that infinite Ocean, should be established, and continue so many Ages, for his Service and Convenience? Can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched Creature, who is not so much as Master of himself, but subject to the Injuries of all things, should call himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Emperour of the World, of which, he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole. And this Priviledge which he attributes to himself, of being the only
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53645:429"/>
Creature in this vast Fabrick, that has the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to discover the Beauty, and the Parts of it; the only one who can return thanks to the <hi>Architect,</hi> and keep account of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and Disbursements of the World; Who, I wonder, seal'd him this Patent? Let us see his <hi>Commission</hi> for this great Employment. Was it granted in favour of the Wise only? Few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be concerned in it. Are Fools and Wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? And being the worst part of the World, to be preferred before the rest? Shall we believe <hi>Cicero!

                        <hi>Plato,</hi> in his Picture of the Golden Age under <hi>Saturn,</hi> reckons, amongst the chief Advantages, that a Man then had, his communication with Beasts, of whom inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true Qualities and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect Intelligence and Prudence, and led his Life more happily, than we could do.

The Swallows that we see at the return of the Spring, searching all the Corners of our Houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their Nest, do they seek without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and amongst a thousand, chuse out the most proper for their purpose, without discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In that elegant and admirable Contexture of their Building, can Birds rather make choice of a square Figure than a round, of an obtuse, than of a right Angle without knowing their Properties and Effects? Do they bring Water, and than Clay, without knowing that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the later grows softer by being wet? Do they matt their Palace with Moss or Down, without foreseeing, that their tender Young will lye more safe and easie? Do they secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Wet and rayny Winds, and place their Lodgings towards the East, without knowing the different Qualities of those Winds, and considering, that one is more comfortable than the other? Why does the Spider make her Web streighter in one place, and slacker in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

That which he attributes to himself by vain Fancy and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has neither Body, nor Tast: And if it be so, that he only of all the Animals, hath this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Imagination, and irregularity of Thoughts representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the False, and the True; 'tis an Advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be Proud: Seeing that from thence springs the principal and original Fountain of all the Evils that befal him, Sin, Sickness, Irresolution, Affliction, and Despair. I say then (to return to my Subject) that there is no apparence to induce a Man to believe, that Beasts should by a natural, and forc'd Inclination, do the same things that we by our Choice, and Industry do. We ought from like Effects to conclude like Faculties, and from greater Effects greater Faculties: and consequently confess, that the same Meditation, and the very same Ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. Why should we imagine this natural Constraint in them, who experiment no such effect in our selves? Considering that it is more honorable
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53645:438" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be guided, and obliged to act regularly by a natural, and irresistible Disposition, and nearer ally'd to the Divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious, and fortuitous Liberty; and more safe to entrust the Reins of our Conduct in the Hands of Nature, than our own. The vanity of our Presumption is the Cause, that we had rather own our Sufficiency to our own Industry, than to her Bounty, and that we enrich the other Animals with natural Goods, and abjure them in their Favor, to honor, and enoble our selves with Goods acquired, very foolishly in my Opinion; so I should as much value Parts and Virtues naturally, and purely my own, as those I had begg'd, and obtain'd from Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not in our Power to obtein a nobler Reputation, than to be favoured of God, and Nature. For this Reason, should we see the Fox, the People of <hi>Thrace</hi> make use of, when they will attempt to pass over the Ice of some frozen River, and turn him out before them to that purpose, lay his Ear upon the Banks of the River, down to the Ice, to listen if from a more remote, or nearer Distance, he can hear the noise of the Waters Current, and according as he finds by that, the Ice to be of a less or greater thickness to retire, or advance; had we not a reason to believe from thence, that he had some thoughts, that we should have upon the like Occasion, and that it is a Ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Consequence drawn from natural Sence; that that which makes a noise, runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53645:439" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that which is liquid, yeilds to Impression? For to attribute this to a vivacity of the Sence of Hearing without Meditation, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is a <hi>Chimera</hi> that cannot enter into the Imagination. We are to suppose the same of so many sorts of Subtleties, and Inventions, with which Beasts secure themselves from, and frust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Enterprizes we complot against them. And if we will make an Advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our Service, and to use them at our Pleasure, 'tis but still the same Advantage we have over one another. We have our Slaves upon these terms, and the <hi>Climacidae,</hi> were they not Women in <hi>Syria,</hi> which being on all four, serv'd for a Ladder, and half Pace, by which the Ladies mounted the Coach? And the greatest part of free Persons, surrender for very trivial Conveniences their Life, and Being, into the Power of another. The Wives, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines of the Thracians contend who shall be chosen to be slain upon their Husbands Tomb. Have Tyrants ever fail'd of finding men enough vow'd to their Devotion: Some of them more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adding this necessity of accompanying them in Death, as well as Life? Whole Armies have obliged themselves after this manner to their Captains.

in pieces.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53645:441"/>
his Nose, in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on by the force of Reason. This Sally, which is purely Logical, and this manner of stating Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions divided, and conjoin'd, and the right enumeration of Parts, is it not every whit as good, that the dog know all this of himself, as to have learnt it by rules of Art? And Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are not incapable however, of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed after our method. We teach <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, Ravens, Pies,</hi> and <hi>Parrats</hi> to speak; and the Facility and Complacency wherewith we see they lend us their Voices, and render both them, and their Breath so supple, and pliant, to be form'd, and confin'd within a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Letters and Syllables, does evince, that they have an Examination of things within, which renders them so docile, and willing to learn. Every body, I believe, is glutted with the several sorts of Tricks, that <hi>Tumblers</hi> teach their Dogs, the Dances where they do not miss any one cadence of the Sound they hear, the several various motions, and leaps, they make them perform by the command of a Word: But I observe this Effect with the greatest Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which nevertheless is very common, of the Dogs, that lead the Blind, both in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in Cities: I have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they were wont to receive Almes, how they avoided the encounter of Coaches, and Carts, even there where they have had sufficient room to pass; and have seen them by the Trench of a Town,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53645:442" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forsake a plain, and even Path, and take a worse, only to Keep their Masters further from the ditch. How could a Man have made this Dog understand, that it was his Office to look to his Masters Safety only, and to despise his own Conveniency to serve him? And how had he the knowledg, that a way was large enough for him, that was not so for a blind Man? Can all this be apprehended without Ratiocination? I must not omit what <hi>Plutarch</hi> says he saw of a dog at Rome, with the Emperor <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Father, at the Theatre of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> This dog serv'd a Player, that play'd a <hi>Farce</hi> of several Gestures, and several Persons, and had therein his part. He was amongst other things to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain Drug he must be suppos'd to have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: After he had swallowed a piece of Bread, which must pass for the Drug, he began after a while to tremble, and stagger, as if he was astonish'd: At last stretching himself out stiff, as if he had been dead, he suffered himself to be drawn, and drag'd from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if newly awak'd out of some profound Sleep, and lifting up his Head, look'd about him after such a manner, as astonish'd all the Spectators. The Oxen that serv'd in the royal Gardens of <hi>Susa,</hi> to water them, and turn certain great Wheels to draw Water for that purpose, to which Buckets were fastned (such as there are many in <hi>Languedoc</hi>) being ordered every one

to draw a hundred turns a day: They were so accustomed to this Number, that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by any Force, to make them draw one turn more, but, their Task being perform'd, they would suddainly stop, and stand still. We are almost Men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered Nations that have no knowledg of Numbers at all.

But setting aside what <hi>Democritus</hi> held, and prov'd, that most of the Arts we have, were taught us by other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: As the Spider, to weave and few, the Swallow to build, the Swan and Nightingale Musick, and several Animals by their imitation to make Medicines. <hi>Aristotle</hi> is of Opinion, that the Nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time, and care in it, from whence it happens, that those we bring up in Cages, and have not had time to learn of their Dams, want much of the grace of their singing. We may judg by that, that they improve by Discipline and Study: And even amongst the wild, it is not all one, and every one alike, every one has learnt to do better, or worse, according to their Capacity. And so jealous are they of one another, whilst learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they contend with Emulation, and so vigorous a Contention, that sometimes the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished fall dead upon the place, the Breath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther failing, than the Voice. The younger ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate pensive, and begin to mutter some broken Notes; the Disciple listens to the Masters

Lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent by turns, one may hear Faults corrected, and observe some Reprehensions of the Teacher. I have formerly seen, says <hi>Arius,</hi> an <hi>Elephant</hi> having a Cymbal hung at each Leg,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Elephants wearing Cymbals.</hi>
                        </note> and another fastned to his Trunck, at the sound of which, all the others danc'd round about him, rising, and falling at certain Cadences, as they were guided by the Instrument, and took a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Harmony. In the Spectacles of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were ordinarily seen Elephants taught to move and dance,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Elephants taught to dance.</hi>
                        </note> to the sound of the Voice, Dances wherein were several Changes, and Steps, and Cadences very hard to learn. And some have been seen in private, so intent upon their Lesson, as to practise it by themselves, that they might not be chidden, nor beaten by their Masters. But this other Story of the <hi>Pie,</hi> of which we have <hi>Plutarch</hi> himself for warrant, it is very strange: She was in a Barbers Shop at <hi>Rome,</hi> and did Wonders in imitating with her Voice, whatever she heard. It hapned one day, that certain Trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the Shop: after that, and all the next day, the <hi>Pie</hi> was pensive, dumb, and melancholick;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A Story of a Magpye at</hi> Rome.</note> which every body wondered at, and thought that the noise of the Trumpets, had so stupified and astonish'd her, and that her Voice was gone with her Hearing: But they found at last, that it was a profound Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and a Retiring into herself, her Thoughts exercising and preparing her Voice to imitate the Sound of those Trumpets, so
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53645:443" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the first Voice she uttered, was perfectly to imitate their Strains, Stops, and Changes; having by this new Lesson quitted, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd all she had learn'd before. I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this other Example of a <hi>Dog</hi> also, which the same <hi>Plutarch</hi> says he saw, being on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Dog, to get the Oyl out of a Jar.</hi>
                        </note> This Dog being puzzeled how to get the Oyl that was in the bottom of a Cruce, which he could not reach with his Tongue, by reason of the narrow Mouth of the Vessel, went, and fetch'd Stones, and let them fall into the Jar, till he made the Oyl rise so high, that he could reach it. What is this but an effect of a very subtle Capacity? 'Tis said that the <hi>Ravens</hi> of Barbarie do the same, when the Water they would drink is too low. This Action is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a-kin to what <hi>Juba,</hi> a King of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, relates of the <hi>Elephants</hi>; then, when by the Craft of the Hunter, one of them is trapt in certain deep Pits prepared for them, and covered over with Brush, to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many Stones,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, to disengage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                        </note> and Logs of Wood to raise the Bottom so, that they may get out. But this Animal, in several other Effects comes so near to human Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that should I particularly relate all that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath deliver'd to us, I should easily have, what I usually maintain, granted, namely, that there is no more difference betwixt such and such a Man, than betwixt such a Man and such a Beast. The Keeper of an <hi>Elephant</hi> in a private House of <hi>Syria,</hi> rob'd him every Meal, of the half of his Allowance: One day his Master
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53645:444" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of Barly he had ordered for his Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>An Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Cheet of his Keeper.</hi>
                        </note> into his Manger; at which, the Elephant casting an angry Look at his Keeper, with his Trunck separated the one half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the Wrong was done him. And another, having a Keeper that mixt Stones with his Corn, to make up the Measure, came to the Pot where he was boyling Flesh for his own Dinner, and fill'd it with Ashes. These are particular Effects: But that which all the World has seen, and all the World knows, that in all the Armies of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, one of their greatest Forces consisted in Elephants, with whom they did, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, much greater Execution, than we now do with our Artillerie; which is, as it were, in their stead in a day of Battail, (as may easily be suppos'd by such, as are well read in antient History.)

They must necessarily very confidently rely upon the Fidelity, and Understanding of these Beasts, when they entrusted them with the Vantguard of a Battail, where the least stop they should have made by reason of the bulk, and heaviness of their Bodies, and the least Fright that should have made them face about upon their own People, had been enough to spoil all. And there are but few Examples where it has hapned, that they have fallen foul upon their own Troops, whereas we our selves, break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own Battalions, and rout one another. They had the Commission, not of one simple Motion only, but of many several things they were to perform in the Battail: As the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> did to their Dogs in their new Conquest of the <hi>Indies,</hi> to whom they gave Pay, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a share in the Spoil; and those Animals shew'd as much Dexterity, and Judgment in pursuing the Victory, and stopping the Pursuit; in charging and retiring as Occasion requir'd, and in distinguishing their Friends from their Enemies, as they did Ardour and Feirceness. We more admire, and value things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual and strange, than those of ordinary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. I had not else so long insisted upon these Examples: For I believe, whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those Animals we have amongst us, may there find as wonderful Effects, as those we fetch from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Countries, and Ages, 'Tis one same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that rouls her Course, and whoever had sufficiently considered the present state of things,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53645:445" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might certainly conclude both the future, and the past. I have formerly seen Men brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sea, from very distant Countries, whose Language being not understood by us, and that moreover their Meen, Countenance, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, were quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them Savages, and Brutes? Who did not attribute it to Stupidity, and want of common Sence, to see them mute, ignorant of the French Tongue, ignorant of our Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Cringes, our Port, and Behavior, from which all human Nature must by all means take its Pattern, and Example. All that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. The same things happen also in the Judgment we make of Beasts: They have several Conditions, like to ours; from those we may by Comparison draw some Conjecture: But those Qualities that are particular to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, what know we what to make of them? The Horses, Dogs, Oxen, Sheep, Birds, and most of the Animals that live amongst us, know our Voices, and suffer themselves to be govern'd by them: So did <hi>Crassus</hi> his <hi>Lamprey,</hi> and came when he call'd it, as also do the <hi>Eeles</hi> that are in the Lake <hi>Arethusa</hi>; and I have seen several Stews, where the Fishes run to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them.

We may judg of that; We may also say, that the Elephants have some participation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, forasmuch as after several Washings,<note place="margin">

But because we do not see any such Signes in other Animals, we cannot for that conclude, that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion; nor make any Judgment of what is conceal'd from us. As we discern something in this Action, which the Philosopher <hi>Cleanthes</hi> took notice of, because it something resembles our own. He saw, he say's, Ants go from their Ant-hill, carrying the dead Body of an Ant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Ant-hill, from whence several other Ants came out to meet them,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Ants.</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53645:446" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leaving the dead Body to the others. This was the Interpretation that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> gave of this Transaction, giving us by that to understand, that those Creatures that have no Voice, are not, nevertheless, without Practice, and mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, whereof 'tis thorough our own Defect, that we do not participate; and for that reason, foolishly take upon us to pass our Censure. But they yet produce other Effects, far beyond our Capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation, that we cannot so much, as by imitation conceive it. Many are of Opinion, that in the great, and last naval Engagement, that <hi>Anthony</hi> lost to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> his admiral Galley was stay'd in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of her Course, by the little Fish the Latins call <hi>Remora,</hi> by reason of the Property she has of staying all sorts of Vessels, to which she fastens herself. And the Emperor <hi>Caligula,</hi> sayling with a great Navy upon the Coast of <hi>Romania,</hi> his Galley only was suddainly stay'd by the same Fish; which he caus'd to be taken, fastned as it was to the Keel of his Ship, very angry that such a little Animal could resist both the Sea, the Wind, and the force of all his Oars, by being only fastned by the Beak to this Galley, (for it is a Shell-Fish and was moreover, not without great Reason, astonish'd, that being brought to him in the Long-Boat, it had no more the Strength it had without. A Citizen of <hi>Zycicus,</hi> formerly acquired the Reputation of a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician, for having learnt the Condition of the Hedghog.

                        </note> The <hi>Cameleon</hi> takes her Colour from the Place upon which it is laid; but the <hi>Polypus,</hi> gives himself what Colour he pleases, according to Occasion, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himself from what he fears, or from that he has a design to seize: In the <hi>Cameleon</hi> 'tis a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, but in the <hi>Polypus</hi> 'tis an active Change. We have some Changes of Colour, as in Fear, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Shame, and other Passions, that alter our Complexions; but it is by the effect of Suffring, as with the <hi>Cameleon.</hi> It is in the Power of the <hi>Jaundice</hi> indeed, to make us turn Yellow, but 'tis not in the Power of our own Will. Now these Effects that we discover in other Animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent Faculty in them, unknown to us; as 'tis to be presum'd several other Qualities, and Abilities of theirs are, of which no appearen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have arriv'd at us.

That rule, and order of the moving of the Wing, from whence they deriv'd the Consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means, to so noble an Operation: For to attribute this great Effect to any natural Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, without the Intelligence, Consent, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53645:447" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Meditation of him by whom it is produc'd, is an Opinion evidently False: That it is so, the <hi>Cramp-Fish</hi> has this Quality, not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numn all the Members that touch her, but even through the Nets transmit a heavy dulness into the Hands of those that move, and handle them; nay it is further said, that if one powre Water upon her, he will feel this Numness mount up the Water to the Hand, and stupify the Feeling thorough the Water. This is a miraculous Force; but 'tis not useless to the <hi>Cramp-Fish,</hi> she knows it, and makes use on't, for to catch the Prey she desires, she will bury herself in the Mud, that other Fishes, swiming over her, struck and benumn'd with this Coldness of hers, may fall into her Power. <hi>Cranes, Swallows,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Birds of Passage, by shifting their Abode, according to the Seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledg they have of their divining Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and put it in use. Huntsmen assure us, that to cull out from amongst a great many Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, that which ought to be preserv'd for the best, the best way is to refer the Choise to the Damm, as thus, take them, and carry them out of the Kennel, and the first she brings back, will certainly be the best: Or if you make a shew as if you would environ the Kennel with Fire, those that she first catches up to Save. By which it appears they have another sort of Prognostick, than we have; or that they have some Virtue in judging of their Whelps, other, and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than we have.

Moving, Living, and Dying of Beasts, is so near to ours, that what ever we retrench from their moving Causes, and add to our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any Meditation of our own Reason. For the Regiment of our Health, Physitians propose to us the Example of the Beasts Manners, and way of living, for this saying, has in all times, been in the Mouth of the People.

There are certain Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Affection, which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of Reason; and by a fortuitous Temerity, which others call Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy: Of which, Beasts are as capable, as we. We see Horses take such an Acquaintance with one another, that we have much ado to make

them eat or travail, when separated: We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them to fancy a particular Colour in those of their own kind, and where they meet it, run to it with great Joy and Demonstrations of Good Will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other Colour. Animals have choice, as well as we, in their Amours, and cull out their Mistresses; neither are they exempt from our Jealousies and implacable Malice. Desires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with Females; or neither natural nor necessary: Of which last sort, are almost all the Desires of Men: They are all superfluous and artificial: For 'tis not to believed, how little will satisfie Nature, how little she has left us to desire: Our Ragous and Kickshaws are not of her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, that a Man may live of an Olive a day: Our delicacy in our Wines is no part of her Instruction, nor the over-acting the Ceremonies of Love.

And as there have been known furious Desires, that have hurried Men to the love of Beasts, so there has been examples of Beasts that have fallen in love with us, and caught with mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Affection betwixt different kinds: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Elephant who was rival to <hi>Aristophanes</hi> the Grammarian in the love of a young Herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench in the City of <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> who was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind him in all the Offices of a very passionate Suitor: For going through the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket where they sould Fruit, he would take some in his Trunck, and carry them to her: He would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his Trunck under her Hankerchief into her Bosom to feel her Breasts.

And for malicious Subtilty, can there be a more pregnant example, than in the Philosopher <hi>Thales</hi>'s Mule? Who foarding a River loaden with Salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the Sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the Salt, his Burthen was something lighter, he never failed so oft as he came to any River to lye down with his Load; till his Master discovering the Knavery, order'd that he should be loaden with Wool, wherein finding himself mistaken, he ceas'd to practise that Device. There are several, that very lively represent the true Image of our Avarice, for we see them infinitely solicitous to catch all they can, and hide it with exceeding great Care, though they never make any use of it at all. As to Thrift, they surpass us not only in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53645:450" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have moreover a great deal of the Science necessary thereto. The Ants bring abroad into the Sun their Grain and Seeds to air, refresh and dry them, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. But the caution and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention they use in gnawing their Grains of Wheat, surpass all Imagination of Human Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: For by reason that the Wheat does not always continue sound and dry; but grows soft, thaws and dissolves, as if it were steept in Milk, whilst hasting to Germination, for fear lest it should shoot, and lose the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Magazine for their subsistence, they nibble of the end by which it should shoot and sprit. As to what concerns War, which is the greatest and most magnificent of Human Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I would very fain know, whether we would serve for an Argument of some Prerogative, or on the contrary for a Testimony of our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and imperfection; as in truth the Science of undoing and killing one another, and of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting, as to make it be coveted by Beasts who have it not.

And so their City, by this new sort of relief, was freed from the Danger, with so wonderful a Fortune, that at their return from the Pursuit, they found they had not lost so much as one Man. The Souls of Emperours and Coblers are cast in the same Mould. The weight and importance of the Actions of Princes consider'd, we persuade our selves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important Causes: But we are deceiv'd, for they are pushed on, and pull'd back in their Motions, by the same Springs, that we are in our little Undertakings.

One day as he was at a general <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of his Army, this Dog was aware of his Masters Murtherers, and with great Barking, and extream signs of Anger, flew upon them, by this first Accusation, awaking the Revenge of this Murther, which was soon after perfected by Form of Justice.

The News of this Dog being come to the Warders of this Church, they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53645:453" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the Colour of the Dog, and at last found him in the City of <hi>Cromyon,</hi> and the Thief also whom they brought back to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he had his reward: And where the Judges, taking Cognizance of the good Office, order'd a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Measure of Corn for the Dog's daily Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, at the Publick Charge, and the <hi>Priest</hi>'s to take care in it. <hi>Plutarch</hi> delivers this Story for a most certain truth, and that hapned in the Age wherein he liv'd.

                        </note> shall suffice. One day (says he) that at <hi>Rome</hi> they entertain'd the people with the pleasure of the fighting of several strange Beasts, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of <hi>Lyons</hi> of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest, who, by his furious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, by the strength and largeness of his Limbs, and by his loud and dreadful Roaring, attracted the Eyes of all the Spectators. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Slaves, that were presented to the people in this Combat of Beasts, there was one <hi>Androdus</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> belonging to a <hi>Roman</hi> Lord of Consular Dignity. This Lyon having seen him at distance, first made a sudden stop, as it were, in a wondring posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, as if it were to enter into acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him. This being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his Tail, as Dogs do when they flatter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53645:454" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Masters, and to kiss and lick the Hands and Thighs of the poor Wretch, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, and almost dead with fear. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drodus</hi> being by this kindness of the Lyon, a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart, as to consider and know him; it was a singular Pleasure to see the Joy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses that passed betwixt them. At which, the people breaking into loud Acclamations of Joy, the Emperour caus'd the Slave to be call'd, to know from him the cause of so strange an Event; who, thereupon told him a new and a very strange Story: My Master (said he) being <hi>Proconsul</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> I was constrained by his Severity and cruel Usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him, and to run away. And to hide my self securely from a person of so great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Province, I thought it my best way to fly to the Solitudes, Sands, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable parts of that Country, resolv'd, that in case the means of supporting Life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill my self. The Sun being excessively hot at Noon, and the Heat intolerable, I acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally found a private and almost inaccessible Cave, and went into it. Soon after there came in to me this Lyon with one Foot wounded and bloody; complaining and groaning with the Pain he indur'd: At his coming I was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid, but he having espied me hid in a corner of his Den, came gently to me, holding out, and shewing me his wounded Foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53645:454" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then drew out a great Splinter he had got there, and growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the Wound, thrust out the Dirt and Gravel was got into it, wiped and cleansed it the best I could: He finding himself something better, and much easied of his Pain, laid him down to repose, and presently fell asleep with his Foot in my hand. From that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he and I lived together in this Cave three whole years, upon one and the same Diet; for of the Beasts that he kill'd in hunting, he always brought me the best pieces, which I roasted in the Sun for want of Fire, and so eat it. At last growing weary of this wild and brutish Life, the Lyon being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary Provision, I escaped from thence, and the third day after was taken by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who brought me from <hi>Africk</hi> to this City to my Master, who presently condemn'd me to dye, and to be thus expos'd to the wild Beasts. Now by what I see, I perceive that this Lyon was also taken soon after, who would now have recompensed me for the Benefit and Cure that he receiv'd at my hands. This is the Story that <hi>Androdus</hi> told the Emperour, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Wherefore at the general Request, he was absolved from his Sentence, and set at liberty; and the Lyon was by order of the people, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him. We afterwards saw (says <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion) Androdus</hi> leading this Lyon, in nothing but a small Leash, from Tavern to Tavern at <hi>Rome,</hi> and receiving what Money every body

As to the particular Offices that we receive from one another, for the Service of Life, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral like Examples amongst them.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53645:456" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Bill, rouses him, and gives him notice of his Danger. He feeds of this Monsters Leavings, who receives him familiarly into his Mouth, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to pick in his Jaws, and betwixt his Teeth, and thence to pick out the Bits of Flesh that remain, and when he has a mind to shut his Mouth, he first gives the Bird warning to go out, by closing it by little and little, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bruising, or doing it any harm at all. The Shell-Fish, call'd a <hi>Naker,</hi> lives also with the Shrimp in the same Intelligence; a little sort of Animal, of the Lobster kind, serving him in the Nature of a Porter, sitting at the opening of the Shell, which the <hi>Naker</hi> keeps always gaping and open, till the Shrimp sees some little Fish, proper for their Prey, within the hollow of the Shell, for then she enters too, and pinches the <hi>Naker</hi> so to the Quick, that she is forc'd to close her Shell, where they two together devour the Prey they have trapt in their Fort. In the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living of the <hi>Tunnies,</hi> we observe a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Knowledge of the three parts of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. As to Astrologie, they teach it Men, for they stay in the Place where they are surpriz'd by the <hi>Brumal Solstice,</hi> and never stir from thence till the next <hi>Equinox:</hi> For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself attributes to them this Science.

As to the Beauty of the Body, before I proceed any further, I should know whether, or no, we are agreed about the Description: 'Tis likely we do not well know what Beauty is in Nature; and in general, since to our own human Beauty we give so many diverse Formes; of which, were there any natural Rule, and Prescription, we should know it in common, as the Heat of the Fire. But we fancy the Forms according to our own Appetite, and Liking.

For the Internal, and Vital Parts, the Hog. In earnest, when I imagine Man stark naked, (even in that Sex, that seems to have the greatest share of Beauty) his Defects, natural Subjection, and Imperfections, I find that we have more reason than any other Animal, to cover our selves; are to be excus'd for borrowing of those, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has in this been kinder, than to us, to trick our selves with their Beauties, and hide our selves under their Spoils, their Wool, Feathers, Hair, and Silk. Let us observe as to the rest, that Man is the sole Animal, whose Nudities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own Companions, and the only one, who in his natural Actions withdraws, and hides himself from his own Kind. And really, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an Effect worth Consideration, that they, who are Masters in the Trade, prescribe as a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for amorous Passions, the full, and free View of the Body a Man desires, so that to cool the Ardour, there needs no more, but at liberty to see, and contemplate the Parts he loves.

Whereas in several Animals there is nothing that we do not love, and that does not please our Sences: So that from their very Excrements,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53645:461" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our Sawces; but also our richest Ornaments and Perfumes. This Discourse reflects upon none, but the ordinary sort of Women, and is not so Sacrilegious, as to comprehend those Divine, Supernatural and extraordinary Beauties, which we see shine amongst us, like Stars under a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and Terrestial Vayle. As to the rest, the very Share that we allow to Beasts, of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature, by our own Confession, is very much to their Advantage. We attribute to our selves imaginary and fantastick Goods, future and absent Goods, for which human Capacity cannot of her self be Responsible: Or Goods, that we falsly attribute to our selves by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Opinion, as Reason, Knowledg, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: And leave to them for their Divident, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, Maniable, and Palpable Goods, as Peace, Repose, Security, Innocence, and Health: Health, I say, the fairest and richest Present that Nature can make us.<note place="margin">

By which they set a greater Value upon Wisdom, comparing and putting it in the Ballance with Health, than they do in this other Proposition, which is also theirs.

                        </note> the one to make a Fool become a Wise-Man, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53645:462" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make a Wise-Man become a Fool, that <hi>Vlysses</hi> ought rather to have chosen the last, than to consent that <hi>Circe</hi> had chang'd his human Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure into that of a Beast: And say that Wisdom it self would have spoke to him after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodg me under the Body and Figure of an Ass.</hi> How? The <hi>Philosophers</hi> then will abandon this great and divine Wisdom, for this corporal and terrestrial Covering? It is than no more by Reason, by Discourse, and by the Soul, that we excel Beasts: 'Tis by our Beauty, our fair Complexion, and our fine symmetry of Parts, for which we must quit our Intelligence, our Prudence, and all the rest. Well, I accept this natural and free Confession: Certainly they knew, that those Parts upon which we so much value our selves, are no other than meer Fancy. If Beasts then had all the Virtue, Knowledg, Wisdom and Stoical Perfection; they would still be Beasts, and would not be comparable to Man, Miserable, Wicked, and a Madman. For, in fine, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not as we are, is nothing considerable: And God, to procure himself an Esteem amongst us, must put himself into that Shape, as we shall shew anon. By which it does appear, that it is not upon any true ground of Reason, but by a foolish Pride and vain Opinion, that we prefer our selves before other Animals, and separate our selves from their Society and Condition. But, to return, to what I was upon before, we have for our part, Inconstancy, Irresolution, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercitude, Sorrow, Superstition, Solicitude of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53645:462" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things to come, even after we shall be no more, Ambition, Avarice, Jealousy, Envy, Irregular, Frantick and Untam'd Appetites, War, Lying, Disloyalty, Detraction and Curiosity. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, we have strangely overpay'd this Fine, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we so much glorify our selves, and this Capacity of Judging and Knowing, if we have bought it at the Price of this infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Passions, to which we are eternally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Unless we shall yet think fit, as <hi>Socrates</hi> does, to add to the Counterpoise, that notable Prerogative above Beasts, that whereas <hi>Nature</hi> has prescrib'd them certain Seasons and Limits for the Delights of <hi>Venus,</hi> she has given us the Reins at all Hours, and all Seasons. <hi>Vt vinum aegrotis quia prodest rarÃ², nocet saepissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quÃ m,</hi>

I have known in my time a hundred <hi>Artizans,</hi> and a hundred <hi>Labourers</hi> wiser and more happy, than the <hi>Rectors</hi> of the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> and whom I had much rather have resembled. Learning methinks, has its Place amongst the necessary things of Life, as Glory, Nobility, Dignity, or at the most, as Riches, and such other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which indeed are useful to it; but remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more by Opinion, than by Nature. We stand very little more in need of Offices, Rules, and Laws of living in our Society, than Cranes and Emmets do in theirs. And yet we see that they carry themselves very regularly, and without Erudition. If Man was Wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was more utile, and proper to his Life. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will number us by our Actions and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will find many more excellent Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ignorant than the Learned: I say, in all sort of Vertue. The old <hi>Rome</hi> seems to me, to have been of much greater Value, both for Peace and War, than that learned <hi>Rome</hi> that ruin'd it self. And tho all the rest should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53645:464" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet the Prowess, Integrity, and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency would remain to the Ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with Simplicity. But I will leave this Discourse,<note place="margin">

                        </note> that would lead me farther than I am willing to follow; and shall only say this farther, 'tis only Humility and Submission, that can make a compleat good Man. We are not to leave the Knowldg of his Duty to every Man's own Judgment: We are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own Discretion: Otherwise, according to the Imbecillity and infinite Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Reasons and Opinions, we should at last forge ourselves Duties, that would (as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> says) enjoine us to eat one another. The first <hi>Law</hi> that ever God gave to Man, was a <hi>Law</hi> of pure Obedience: It was a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment naked and simple, wherein Man had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to enquire after, or to dispute, forasmuch as to obey, is the proper Office of a Rational Soul, ackowledging a heavenly Superior and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. From Obedience and Submission, spring all other Vertues, as all Sin does from Self-Opinion. And on the contrary, the first Temptation, that by the Devil was offered to human Nature, its first Poison insinuated it self by the Promises was made us of Knowledg and Wisdom: <hi>Eritis sicut Dii, scientes bonum &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53645:464" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reason it is, that Ignorance is so recommended to us by our Religion, as proper to Faith and Obedience. <hi>Cavete, ne quis vos decipiat per</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophiam, <hi>&amp; inanes seductiones,</hi>

It seems, in truth, that Nature, for the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our miserable and wretched Estate, has only given us Presumption for our Inheritance.

on the contrary, posses his Goods by Fancy, his Ills in Essence. We have had Reason to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Power of our Imagination; for all our Goods are only in Dream. Hear this poor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamicous Animal Huff. There is nothing, says <hi>Cicero,</hi> so charming as the Knowledg of Letters; of Letters I say, by means whereof the Infinity of things, the immense grandeur of Nature, the Heavens, even in this World, the Earth, and the Seas are discovered to us: 'Tis they that have taught us Religion, Moderation, and the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Courage, and that have rescu'd our Soules from Obscurity, to make her see all things, high, low, first and last, and indifferent: 'tis they, that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our Lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Displeasure, and without Offence. Does not this Man seem to speak of the Condition of the Ever-living and Almighty God? And as to the Effect, a thousand little Country-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have lived Lives more equal, more sweet and constant than his.

According to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>In virtute verÃ¨ gloriamur: quod non contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret, si id donum Ã  Deo non Ã  nobis haberemus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cicero de Nat. Deor. l. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>We truly glory in our Virtue: Which would not be, if it was given us of God, and not by our selves.</hi> This is also <hi>Seneca</hi>'s saying, That the Wise Man has Fortitude equal with God; but in human Frailty, wherein he surmounts him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so ordinary as to meet with Sallies of the like Temerity: There is none of us, who takes so much Offence to see himself equal to God, as he does, to see himself undervalued by being ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own Interest, than that of our
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53645:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Creator. But we must trample under foot this foolish Vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous Foundation, upon which these false Opinions are founded. So long as Man shall believe he has any Means and Power of himself, he will never acknowledg what he owes to his Maker, <hi>his Eggs shall always be Chickens,</hi> as the saying is: We must therefore strip him to his Shirt. Let us see some notable Example of the Effects of his <hi>Philosophy. Possidonius</hi> being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a Disease so painful, as made him Writh his Armes, and Gnash his Teeth; thought he sufficiently baffell'd the Dolor, by crying out against it: <hi>Thou dost exercise thy Malice to much Purpose, I will not Confess that thou art an Evil.</hi> He is as sensible of the Pain as my Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but he mightily values himself, upon bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Tongue at least, and restraining it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Laws of his <hi>Sect. Re succumbere non opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebat verbis gloriantem. It did not become him that spoke so big,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cic. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sc. l. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>to confess his Frailty when he came to the Test. Archesilaus,</hi> being ill of the Gout, and <hi>Carneades</hi> coming to see him, was returning troubled at his Condition, whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving call'd back, and shewing him his Feet and his Breast: <hi>There is nothing come from thence hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> said he. This has something a better Grace, for he feels himself in Pain, and would be disengaged from it: But his Heart, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, is not Conquered, nor Subdued by it. The other stands more obstinately to his Work; but I fear, rather verbally than really. And <hi>Dionysius Heracleotes,</hi> afflicted with a vehement
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53645:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
smarting in his Eyes, was reduc'd, and made to quit these stoical Resolutions. But tho Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the Point, and dull the Edge of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that attend us, what does she yet more, than what Ignorance does more purely, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently do? The <hi>Philosopher Pyrrho,</hi> being at Sea in very great Danger, by reason of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Storm, presented nothing to those who were with him, to imitate in this Extremity, but the Security of a Hog they had aboard, that was Fearless and unconcerned at the Tempest. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,</hi> when she has said all she can, refers us at last, to the Example of a <hi>Wrestler,</hi> or a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letteer,</hi> in which sort of People we commonly observe much less apprehension of Death, sense of Pain, and other Infirmities, and more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, than ever Knowledg furnished any one withal, that was not born with those Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of himself prepared by a natural Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. What is the Cause, that we make Incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cut the tender Limbs of an Infant, and those of a Horse, more easily than ours, but Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance only?

                        </note> We often see Men cause themselves to be let Blood, Purg'd and Physick'd, to be cured of Diseases they only feel in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When real Infirmities fail us, Knowledg lends us hers: That Colour, that Complexion, portend some Defluxion: This hot Season threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us with a Feaver: This breach in the life-Line of your left Hand, gives you notice of some near and dangerous Indisposition, and at

last roundly attacks Health it self; saying, this spriteliness and vigor of Youth, cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this Posture, there must be Blood taken, and the Heat abated, lest it turn to your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Compare the Life of a Man subjected to such Imaginations, to that of a Labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural Appetite, measuring things only by the present Sense, without Knowledg, and without Prognostick, that feels no Pain nor Sickness, but when he is really tormented, or sick: Whereas the other has the Stone in his Soul, before he has it either in his Reins or Bladder: As if it were not time enough to suffer the Evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by Fancy, and run to meet it. What I say of <hi>Physick</hi> may generally serve in Example for all other Sciences: From thence is derived that antient Opinion of Philosophers, that plac'd the soveraine Good, in the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the weakness of our Judgment. My Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance affords me as much occasion of Hope, as of Fear: And having no other Rule for my Health, than that of the Examples of others, and of Events I see elsewhere upon the like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; I find of all sorts, and rely upon the Comparisons are most favourable to me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Health with open Arms, free, full, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and by so much the more whet my Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary, and more rare: So far I am from troubling its Repose and Sweetness, with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of a new and constrain'd manner of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Beasts sufficiently shew us, how much the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53645:467" rendition="simple:additions"/>
agitation of the Soul brings Infirmities and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases upon us. That which is told us of those of <hi>Brazile,</hi> that they never died but of old Age, is attributed to the Serenity and tranquillity of the Air they live in; but I rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their Souls, free from all Passion, Thought or Employments, Tenter'd or Unpleasing, as People that pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Lives in an admirable Simplicity and Ignorance, without Letters, without Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out King, or any manner of Religion. And whence comes that, which we find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the greatest and most rough-hewn Clowns are the most able, and the most to be desired in amorous Performances? And that the Love of a <hi>Muletter,</hi> oft renders it self more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable than that of a well-bred Man? If it be not, that the Agitation of the Soul, in the later, disturbs his natural Ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also troubles and tires it self. What puts the Soul besides it self, and more usually throws it into Madness, but her own Promptness, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Agility, and finally, her own proper Force? Of what is the most subtile Folly made, but of the most subtile Wisdom? As great Friendships spring from great Enmities, and vigorous Healths from mortal Diseases: So from the rare and quick Agitations of our Souls, proceed the most wonderful and most deprav'd Frenzies; 'tis but a half turn of the Toe from the one to the other. In the Actions of mad Men, we see how infinitely that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness resembles the most vigorous Operations
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53645:468" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Soul. Who does not know how indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernable the difference is betwixt Folly, and the Elevations of a spritely Soul, and the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a supream and extraordinary Vertue? <hi>Plato</hi> says, that melancholick persons are the most capable of Discipline, and the most excellent, nor indeed is there in any so great a propension to madness.

Our Well-being is nothing but the privation of Evil. Which is the reason why that <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who sets the greatest value upon
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53645:469" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pleasure, has yet fixt it chiefly in Insensibility of Pain. To be freed from Ill, is the greatest Good that Man can hope for or desire: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Eunius.</hi>
                        <q>Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali.</q>
For that very tickling and sting, which are in certain Pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple Health and Insensibility; that active, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and, I know not how, itching and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pleasure; even that very Pleasure it self levels at nothing but Insensibility, as its mark. The Lust that carries us headlong to Womens Embraces, is directed for no other end, but only to cure the Torment of our ardent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and deliver'd from that Feaver. And so of the rest. I say then, that if Simplicity conducts us to an Estate free from Evil, she leads us to a very happy one, according to our condition. And yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an Insensibility, as to be totally without Sence: For <hi>Crantor</hi> had very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to controvert the Insensibility of <hi>Epicurus</hi>; if founded so deep, that the very first Attack and Birth of Evils were not to be perceiv'd. I do not approve such an Insensibility, as is neither possible, nor to be desir'd. I am very well content not to be sick: But if I am, I would, know that I am so; and if a Caustick be apply'd, or Incisions made in any part, I would feel them. In truth, whoever would
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53645:469" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take away the knowledge and Sence of Evil, would at the same time eradicate the Sence of Pleasure, and finally annihilate Man himself. <hi>Istud nihil dolere, non sine magna mercede contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corde.</hi>

It was what a Roman <hi>Senator</hi> said of the later Ages, that their Predecessors Breath stunk of Garlick, but their Stomachs were perfum'd with a good Conscience: And that on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet Odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of Vices, that is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with Learning and Eloquence, but were very defective in moral Honesty. Incivility, Ignorance, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Roughness, are the Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of Innocency: Curiosity, Subtlety and Knowledge bring Malice in their Train: Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Fear, Obedience and Affability (which are the principal things that support and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Human Society) require an empty and docile Soul, and little presuming upon it self. <hi>Christians</hi> have a particular Knowledge, how Natural and Original an evil Curiosity is in Man. The Thirst of Knowledge, and the Desire to become more Wise, was the first ruin of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-kind, and the way by which he precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himself into Eternal Damnation. Pride was his ruin and corruption: 'is Pride that diverts from the Common Path, and makes him embrace Novelties, and rather chuse to be Head of a Troop, lost and wandring in the

After that, <hi>Socrates</hi> was told, That the God of Wisdom had attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him the Title of a Sage, he was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at it, and searching and examining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self throughout, could find no Foundation for this Divine Sentence. He knew others as just, temperate, valiant and learned as himself: And more eloquent, more handsom, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to their Country, than he. At last he concluded, that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so. And that his God consider'd the Opinion of Knowledge and Wisdom as a singular Brutality in Man; and that his best Doctrine was the Doctrine of Ignorance, and Simplicity the best Wisdom. The Sacred Word declares those Miserable, who have an Opinion of themselves: <hi>Dust and Ashes,</hi> says it to such, <hi>What hast thou wherein to Glorifie thy self?</hi> And in another place, <hi>God has made Man like unto a Shadow,</hi> of whom, who can judge, when by the removing of the Light, it shall be vanished? Man is a thing of nothing, whose Force is so far from being able to comprehend the Divine Height: That of the Works of our Creator,

those best bear his Mark, and are with better Title, his, which we the least understand. To meet with an incredible thing, is an Occasion to Christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against Human Reason. If it were according to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it would be no more a singular thing. <q>Melius scitur Deus nesciendo,</q> says St. <hi>Austin,</hi>

The Ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute Ignorance: Which to be, it must be ignorant of itself. So that the Profession of the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> is to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, doubt and enquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. Of the three Actions of the Soul, the Imaginative, Appetitive, and the Consenting, they receive the two first; the last they keep ambiguous, without Inclination or Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of one thing or another, so light and

voluble it is. <hi>Zeno</hi> represented the Motion of his Imagination, upon these divisions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, an open and expanded Hand signified Apparence: A Hand half shut, and the Fingers a little bending, Consent: A clutch'd Fist, Comprehension: When with the left he yet thrust the Fist closer, Knowledg. Now this scituation of their Judgment upright and inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, receiving all Objects without Application, or Consent, lead them to their <hi>Ataraxie,</hi> which is a peaceable Condition of Life,<note place="margin">Ataraxie <hi>what.</hi>

                        </note> When they affirm that heavy things descend; they would be sorry to be believ'd, and love to be contradicted, to engender doubt and suspence of Judgment, which is their End. They only put out Propositions to contend with those they think we have in our Belief. If you take their Arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary: 'Tis all one to them, they have no Choice. If you maintain that Snow is Black, they will argue on the contrary that it is White; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that 'tis both. If you hold
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53645:478"/>
by a certain Judgment that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. Yes, and if by an affirmative Axiome you assure them that you doubt; they will argue against you, that you doubt not; or that you cannot judg and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine that Doubt. And by this extremity of Doubt, which justles it self, they separate and divide themselves from many Opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning Doubt and Ignorance. Why shall not they be allow'd, say they, as well as the <hi>Dogmatists,</hi> one to say Green, another Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and even of those to doubt?

If they overcome, your Argument is Lame; if you, theirs: If they fall short, they verify Ignorance; if you fall short, you do it: If they prove, that nothing is known, it goes well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis as well: <hi>Vt quum in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio sustineatur.

He would never make himself a Stock or a Stone, he would shew himself a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Man, Discoursing, Reasoning, Enjoying all natural Conveniences and Pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual Faculties in Rule and Reason.

After which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be govern'd by Apparences, provided there be no express and manifest Contrariety in them. He has a Body, he has a Soul, the Senses push them, the Mind spurs them on. And altho he do not find in himself this proper and singular sign of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that he does perceive that he ought not to engage his Consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, yet does he not for all that fail of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Offices of his Life with great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Convenience. How many Arts are there that profess to consist more in Conjecture than Knowledg? That decide not true and false, and only follow that, which seems the one or the other? There are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it.

no other Science but that of opposing himself. <hi>Homer,</hi> their Author, has equally laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of all the Sects of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to shew how indifferent it was, which way we should choose. 'Tis said, that ten several <hi>Sects</hi> sprung from <hi>Plato</hi>; and in my Opinion, never did any Instruction hault and stumble, if his does not: <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> said, that <note n="*" place="margin">

It is so with the most part of this third sort of Authors, as the Ancients have observ'd in the Writings of <hi>Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Zenophanes</hi> and others. They have a way of Writing, doubtful in Substance and Design, rather enquiring than teaching; though they mix their Style with some Dogmatical Periods. Is not the same thing seen in <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi>? How many Contradictions are there to be found, if a Man pry narrowly into them? So many, that the reconciling Lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> seems to have affected this Method of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophizing</hi> in Dialogues; to the end, that he might
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53645:484"/>
with greater Decency from several Mouths, deliver the Diversity and Variety of his own Fancies. To treat variously of things, is as well to treat of them, as conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Profit. Let us take Example from our selves. Judgments are the utmost Period of all Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and determinative speaking: And yet those <hi>Arrests</hi> that our <hi>Parliaments</hi> give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the most exemplary of them, and those are most proper to nourish in them the Reverence due to that Dignity, principally through the Sufficiency of the Persons Acting, derive their Beauty, not so much from the Conclusion, which with them is <hi>quotidien</hi> and common to every Judg, as from the Dispute and Heat of diverse and contrary Arguments, that the matter of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> will permit. And the largest Field for Reprehension, that some <hi>Philosophers</hi> have against others, is drawn from the Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Contradictions, wherein every one of them finds himself Perplex'd: Either on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to shew the Vacillation of human Wit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every thing; or ignorantly compell'd by the Volability and Incomprehensibility of all Matter. What means this Clinck in the Close? In a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our Belief: For as <hi>Euripedes</hi> says.

He was vext at
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53645:485" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Discovery, and that she had depriv'd him of the Occasion of this Inquisition, and robb'd his Curiosity of Matter to work upon. <hi>Go thy way,</hi> said he, <hi>thou hath done me an Injury</hi>; but for all that, I will seek out the Cause as if it were natural; and would willingly have found out some true Reason, for a false and imaginary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. This Story of a famous and great <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi> does very clearly represent to us the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Passion, that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the Acquisition of which we despair. <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives a like Example of some one, who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in Doubt, that he might not lose the Pleasure of enquiring into it: Like the other, who would not that his <hi>Physitian</hi> should allay the Thirst of his Feaver, that he might not lose the Pleasure of quenching it by drinking. <hi>Satius est supervacua discere,</hi>

Thus, they say, the consideration of Nature is a Diet proper for our Minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial Things, by comparing them with those that are Celestial and high: Even the Inquisition of great and occult things is very Pleasant, even to those who

They were too wise to establish their Articles of Faith upon things so Disputable and so Incertain: But in the Obscurity and Ignorance the World then was, every one of these great Men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to present some kind of Image or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of Light; and work'd their Brains for Inventions, that might have a pleasant and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Apparence; provided, that false as they were, they might make good their Ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that would oppose them. <hi>Vnicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ista pro ingenio singuntur, non ex scientiae vi.

Some things they have writ for the benefit of publick Society, as their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> and for that Consideration it was but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that they should not examine publick Opinions to the Quick, that they might not disturb the common Obedience to the Laws and Customs of their Country. <hi>Plato</hi> treats of this Mystery with a Raillery manifest enough. For where he writes according to his own Method; he gives no certain Rule. When he plays the <hi>Legislator,</hi> he borrows a magisterial and positive Style, and boldly there foists in his most fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Inventions, as fit to persuade the Vulgar, as impossible to be believ'd by himself: Knowing very well, how fit we are to receive all sorts of Impressions, especially the most immoderate and wicked. And yet in his <hi>Laws,</hi> he takes singular Care that nothing be sung in Publick but Poetry; of which, the Fiction and fabulous Relations tend to some advantageous End: It being so easy to imprint all sorts of <hi>Phantasmes</hi> in human Minds, that it were Injustice not to feed them rather with profitable Untruths, than with Untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. He says ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly in his Commonwealth, that it is very oft necessary for the profit of Men, to deceive them. It is very easy to distinguish, that some of the <hi>Sects</hi> have more followed <hi>Truth,</hi> and the others <hi>Vtility,</hi> by which the last have gain'd their Reputation. 'Tis the misery of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53645:486"/>
that often that which presents it self to our Imagination for the most true, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the most utile to Life. The boldest <hi>Sects,</hi> as the <hi>Epicurean, Pyrrhonian,</hi> and the new Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick, are yet constrain'd to submit to the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law,</hi> at the end of the Account. Other Subjects there are, that they have tumbl'd and tost some to the right, and others to the left, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of Colour; for having found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so Abstruse, they would not venture to speak to: They are very often forc'd to forge weak and ridiculous Conjectures; not that they themselves look'd upon them as any Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or establish any certain Truth, but meerly for Exercise. <hi>Non tam id sensisse, quod dicerent,</hi>

For for Example, what can be more Vain than to imagine to guess at Almighty God by our Analogies and Conjectures? To direct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him and the World, by our <hi>Capacities</hi> and our <hi>Laws</hi>?

And because we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Sight to his glorious Throne, to have
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53645:487"/>
brought him down to our Corruption, and our Miseries? Of all human and ancient Opinions concerning Religion, that seems to me the most likely, and most excusable, that acknowledg'd God an Incomprehensible Power; the Original and Preserver of all things, all Bounty, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, receiving and taking in good part the Honor and Reverence that Man paid unto him, under what Method, Name or Ceremonies so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

One while that Men are not to inquire into the Form of God, and presently makes him maintain that the <hi>Sun</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Soul, God</hi>; and the first, that there is but one God, and afterwards that there are many. <hi>Speucippus</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Plato</hi> makes <hi>God</hi> a certain Power governing all things, and that he has a Soul. <hi>Aristotle</hi> one while says, it is the Spirit, and another, the World; one while he gives this World another <hi>Master,</hi> and another makes <hi>God</hi> the Ardour of <hi>Heaven. Zenocrates</hi> makes eight, five nam'd amongst the <hi>Planets,</hi> the sixth compos'd of all the fixt Stars, as of so many Members, the seventh and the eighth, the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Moon. Heraclides Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> does nothing but float in his Opinion, and finally deprives God of Sense, and makes him shift from one Form to another, and at last says, that 'tis <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth. Theophrastus</hi> wanders in the same Irresolution amongst his Fancies, attributing the Superintendency of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53645:489"/>
World, one while, to the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and another to the <hi>Stars. Strato,</hi> that 'tis <hi>Nature,</hi> she having the power of Generation, Augmentation and Diminuition, without Form and Sentiment. <hi>Zeno</hi> says, 'tis the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> commanding Good, and prohibiting Evil; which <hi>Law</hi> is an Animal, and takes away the accustom'd Gods, <hi>Jupiter, Juno</hi> and <hi>Vesta: Diogenes Apolloniates,</hi> this 'tis <hi>Age. Zenophanes</hi> makes <hi>God</hi> round, seeing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with Human Nature. <hi>Aristo</hi> thinks the Form of God to be incomprehensible, deprives him of Sence, and knows not whether he be an Animal, or something else. <hi>Cleanthes</hi> one while supposes it to be <hi>Reason</hi>; another while, the <hi>World</hi>; another, the <hi>Soul</hi> of Nature; and then the supream Heat rouling about, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironing all. <hi>Perseus, Zeno</hi>'s Disciple, was of Opinion, that Men have given the Title of Gods to such as have been useful, and have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any advantage to Human Life, and even to profitable things themselves. <hi>Crysippus</hi> made a confus'd heap of Old Sentences, and reckons amongst a thousand Forms of <hi>Gods</hi> that he makes, the Men also that have been <hi>Deified. Diagoras</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> flatly deny'd, that there were any <hi>Gods</hi> at all. <hi>Epicurus</hi> makes the Gods shining, transparent and perflable, lodg'd, as betwixt two Forts, betwixt the two <hi>Worlds,</hi> secure from blows, cloth'd in a Human Figure, and with such Members as we have; which Members are to them of no use.

Trust to your <hi>Philosophy,</hi> my Masters: And brag, that you have <hi>found the Bean in the Cake</hi>; What a Rattle is here with so many <hi>Philosophical</hi> Heads! The perplexity of so many Worldly Forms have gain'd this over me, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Opinions contrary to mine, do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud, as they humble me in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them. And all other choice, than what comes from the Express and immediate Hand of God, seems to me a Choice of very little Priviledge. The Policies of the World are no less opposite upon this Subject, than the Schools, by which we may understand, that Fortune it self is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate than our <hi>Reason.</hi> The things that are most unknown, are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make Gods of our selves, as the Ancients did, exceeds the extreamest Weakness of Understanding.

The <hi>Egyptians</hi> with an impudent Prudence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted upon pain of hanging, that any one should say, that their Gods, <hi>Serapis</hi> and <hi>Isis,</hi> had formerly been Men: And yet no one was ignorant, that they had been such.

When <hi>Mahomet</hi> promises his Followers a <hi>Paradise</hi> hung with Tapestry, guilded and enamel'd with Gold and precious Stones, furnished with Wenches of excelling Beauty, rare Wines, and delicate Dishes, it is easily discern'd that these are Deceivers that accommodate their Promises to our Sensuality, to attract and allure us by Hopes and Opinions suitable to our mortal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. And yet some amongst us are fallen into the like Error, promising to themselves, after the Resurrection, a Terrestial and Temporal Life, accompanied with all sorts of Worldly Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Pleasures. Can we believe that <hi>Plato,</hi> he who had so heavenly Conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the Divinity, as thence to derive the Name of the <hi>Divine Plato,</hi> ever thought that the poor Creature, <hi>Man,</hi> had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible Power? And that he believ'd that the weak Holds we are able to take, were capable, or the Force of our Understanding sufficient to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53645:492" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Beatitude, or Eternal Pains? We should then tell him from Human Reason; If the Pleasures thou dost promise us in the other Life, are of the same kind that I have injoy'd here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, this has nothing in common with Infinity: Though all my five Natural Senses should be even loaded with Pleasure, and my Soul full of all the Contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing: If there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing Divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present Condition, it cannot be of any value. All Contentment of Mortals is mortal. Even the Knowledge of our <hi>Parents, Children</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> if that can effect and delight us in the other World, if there that still continue a satisfaction to us, we still remain in earthly and finite Conveniences. We cannot, as we ought, conceive the greatness of these High and Divine Promises, if we could in any sort conceive them: To have a worthy Imagination of them, we must imagine them inimaginable, inexplicable and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing, than those of our miserable experience.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note>

Especially if it be a living Creature, which its
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53645:498"/>
motions renders so credible, that <hi>Plato</hi> affirms it, and that many of our People do either confirm, or dare not deny: No more than that ancient Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> and other Members of the World, are Creatures compos'd of Body and Soul: Mortal in respect of their Composition, but Immortal by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Creator.</hi> Now if there be many Worlds, as <hi>Democritus, Epicurus,</hi> and almost all <hi>Philosophy</hi> has believ'd, what do we know but that the Principles and Rules of this of ours, may in like manner concern the rest? They may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture have another <hi>Form,</hi> and another <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Epicurus</hi> supposes them either like or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. We see in this World an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of Places. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Corn, Wine, nor any of our Animals are to be seen in that new corner of the World discovered by our Fathers, 'tis all there another thing. And in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the World they had no Knowledg either of <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Ceres.</hi> If <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> are to be believed, there are in certain Places a kind of Men very little resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us. And there are mungrel and ambiguous Forms, betwixt the human and brutal Natures. There are Countries, where men are born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heads, having their Mouth and Eyes in their Breast: Where they are all <hi>Hermaphodrites</hi>; where they go on all four; where they have but one Eye in the Forehead, and a Head more like a Dog than one of us: Where they are half Fish, the lower part, and live in the Water: Where
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53645:499" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Women bear at five years old, and live but eight: Where the Head and Skin of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is so hard, that a Sword will not touch it, but rebounds again: Where Men have no Beards: Nations that know not the use of Fire, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that eject Seed of a black Colour. What shall we say of those that naturally change them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Woolves, Colts, and then into men again? And if it be true as <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, that in some place of the <hi>Indies,</hi> there are men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain Odours, how many of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions are false? He is no more risible nor peradventure, capable of Reason and Society: The disposition and cause of our internal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position would then for the most part be to no purpose, nor of no use; moreover how many things are there in our own Knowledg, that oppose those fine Rules we have cut out for, and prescribed to <hi>Nature</hi>? And yet we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to circumscribe <hi>God</hi> himself! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things do we call miraculous and contrary to <hi>Nature</hi>? This is done by every <hi>Nation,</hi> and by every <hi>Man,</hi> according to the Proportion of his Ignorance. How many occult Properties and Quintessences do we daily discover? For, for us to go according to <hi>Nature,</hi> is no more but to go according to our Intelligence, as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it: All beyond that must be monstrous and irregular. Now by this Account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing men; for human Reason has persuaded
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53645:499" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, that there was no manner of Ground or Foundation, not so much as to be assured that Snow is white; and <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> affirm'd it to be black: If there be any thing, or if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: If there be Knowledg or Ignorance; which <hi>Metrodorus Chius</hi> denied that Man was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to determine: Or whether we live, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides</hi> doubts, whether the Life we live is Life, or whether that we call Death be not Life:
<q>
                           <l>Who knows if Life been't that which we call Death,</l>
                           <l>And Death the thing that we call Life.</l>
                        </q>
And not without some apparence. For why do we from this Instant derive the Title of Being, which is but a Flash in the infinite Course of an eternal Night, and so short an Interruption of our perpetual and natural Condition? Death possessing all that past before, and all the future of this moment, and also a good part of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self. Others swear there is no motion at all, as the Followers of <hi>Melissus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Motion of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low denyed.</hi>
                        </note> and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing stirs. For if there be but one, neither can that Spherical Motion be of any use to him, nor the Motion from one place to another, as <hi>Plato</hi> proves, That there is neither Generation nor Corruption in Nature. <hi>Protagoras</hi> says, That there is nothing in Nature but Doubt: That a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things: <hi>Mansiphanes,</hi> that of things which seem to be, nothing is, more than it is not. That there is nothing certain, but incertainty. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides,</hi>
                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:53645:500" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general. That there is but one thing. <hi>Zeno,</hi> that one same is not; and that there is nothing. If there were one thing, it would either be in another, or in it self. If it be in another, they are two: If it be in it self, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. According to these Doctrines the Nature of things, is no other than a Shadow, either false or vain. This way of speaking in a Christian Man, has ever seem'd to me very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet and Irreverent. <hi>God cannot dye; God cannot contradict himself; God cannot do this, or that,</hi> I do not like to have the divine Power so limited by the Laws of Mens Mouths. And the apparence which presents itself to us in those Propositions, ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed. Our speaking has its Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Defects, as well as all the rest. <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> is that which creates most Disturbance in the World. Our Suits only spring from the Debate of the interpretation of <hi>Laws</hi>: And most Wars proceed from the Inability of <hi>Ministers,</hi> clearly to express the Conventions and Treaties of Amity of <hi>Princes.</hi> How many Quarrels, and of how great Importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this Sillable <hi>Hoc</hi> created in the World? Let us take the clearest Conclusion that <hi>Logick</hi> it self presents us with. If you say it is fair, and that you say true, it is then fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Is not this a very certain form of speaking? And yet it will deceive us: That it will do so, let us follow the Example. If you say you lye,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53645:500" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that you say true, then you do lye. The <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> of the Conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. The <hi>Pyrrhonian Philosophers,</hi> I discern, cannot express their general Conception in any kind of speaking: For the World requires a new Language on purpose. Ours is all form'd of affirmative Propositions, which are totally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick to them. Insomuch that when they say <hi>I doubt,</hi> they are presently taken by the Throat, to make them confess, that at least they know, and are assur'd that they do doubt. By which means they have been compelled to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselves under this medicinal Comparison, without which, their Humor would be inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. When they pronounce, <hi>I know not</hi>: Or, <hi>I doubt</hi>; they say, that this Proposition carries off it self with the rest, no more, nor less than <hi>Rubarb,</hi> that drives out the ill Humors, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it self off with them. This Fancy will be more certainly understood by Interrogation: <hi>What do I know?</hi> (as I bear it in the Emblem of a Ballance.) See what use they make of this irreverend way of speaking. In the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about our <hi>Religion,</hi> if you press the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to it too hard, they will roundly tell you, that it is not in the Power of <hi>God,</hi> to make it so, that his Body should be in <hi>Paradice</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Earth,</hi> and in several Places at once. And see what Advantage the old Scoffer makes of this? <hi>At least,</hi> says he, <hi>it is no little Consolation to Man, to see that God cannot do all things: For he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53645:501"/>
the greatest Privilege we have in our Condition: He cannot make Mortals Immortal, nor revive the Dead: Nor make it so, that he who has lived, has not; nor that he, who has had Honours, has not had them, having no other right to the past, than that of Oblivion.</hi> And that the Comparison of a Man to <hi>God</hi> may yet be made out by pleasant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, <hi>he cannot order it so,</hi> he says, <hi>that twice ten shall not be twenty.</hi> This is what he says, and what a Christian ought to take heed shall not escape his Lips. Whereas on the contrary, it seems, as if all Men studied this impudent kind of blasphemous Language, to reduce <hi>God</hi> to their own measure.

much greater than we? Is not the most Supream always the most Worthy? And we are subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. Nothing without a Soul and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason, can produce a living Creature ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reason. The World produces us, the World then has Soul and Reason. Every part of us is less than we. We are part of the World, the World therefore is endued with Wisdom and Reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'Tis a fine thing to have a great Government. <note place="margin">

Wordly Goods are not Goods to <hi>God</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not Goods to us: Offending, and being Offended, are equally Testimonies of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity: 'Tis therefore folly to fear <hi>God. God</hi> is good by his Nature; Man by his Industry, which is more. The divine and human Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have no other Distinction, but that the first is Eternal. But Duration is no accession to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, therefore we are Companions. We have Life, Reason and Liberty; we esteem Bounty, Charity and Justice: These Qualities are in him. In conclusion, the building and destroying, and the conditions of the Divinity, are forg'd by Man according as they relate to himself. What a Pattern, and what a Model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human Qualities as much as we please. Puff up thy self, vain Man, yet more and more, and more.

The <hi>Sexton</hi> lost, and paid the Supper and the Whore.

As if it had not been sufficient that <hi>Plato</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally descended from the <hi>Gods</hi> by a double Line, and that he had <hi>Neptune</hi> for the common Father of his Race: It was certainly believ'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> that <hi>Aristo</hi> having a mind to enjoy the fair <hi>Perictione,</hi> could not, and was warn'd by the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> in a Dream, to leave her unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and untouch'd, till she should first be brought to Bed.

We are to observe, that to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the Lyon, the Eagle and the Dolphin, prize nothing above their own Kind)
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53645:505"/>
and that every thing assimilates the Qualities of all other things to its own proper Qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that Relation and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our Imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, or stretch beyond it: From whence spring these ancient Conclusions. Of all Figures, the most beautiful is that of Man; therefore <hi>God</hi> must be of that Form. No one can be happy without Vertue, nor Vertue be without Reason, and Reason cannot inhabit any where but in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Shape: God is therefore cloathed in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Figure. <hi>Ita est informatum, anticipatum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que mentibus nostris,</hi>

Ancient Writers extract their Authorities, but from the <hi>Poets</hi>? And the first of them were <hi>Poets</hi> themselves, and writ accordingly. <hi>Plato</hi> is but a <hi>Poet</hi> unript. All super-human Sciences make use of the Poetick Style. Just as Women make use of Teeth of Ivory, where the Natural are wanting, and instead of their true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, make one of some artificial Matter; as they stuff themselves with Cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one, paint, patch, and trick up themselves with an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and borrow'd Beauty: So does Science, (and even our <hi>Law</hi> it self has, they say, Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Fictions, whereon it builds the Truth of its <hi>Justice</hi>) she gives us in Presupposition, and for currant pay, things which themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us were invented: For these <hi>Epicycles, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricks</hi> and <hi>Concentricks,</hi> which <hi>Astology</hi> makes use of to carry on the Motions of the Stars, she gives us for the best she could contrive upon that Subject; as also in all the rest, <hi>Philosophy</hi> presents us, not that which really is, or what she does really believe, but what she has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd with the greatest and most plausible like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of Truth, and the quaintest Invention. <hi>Plato</hi> upon the Discourse of the State of Human Bodies, and those of Beasts, <hi>I should, know that what I have said is truth,</hi> says he, <hi>had I the Confirmation of an Oracle: But this I will affirm, that, what I have said, is the most likely to be true of any thing, I could say.</hi> 'Tis not to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only that Art sends her Ropes, Engines and Wheels; let us consider a little what she

There is not more Retrogradation, Trepidation, Accession, Recession, and Astonishment in the Stars and Celestial Bodys, than they have found out in this poor little Human Body. In earnest, they have very good reason upon that very account, to call it a little World, so many Tools and Parts have they imployed to erect and build it. To assist the Motions they see in Man, and the various Functions that we find in our selves, into how many parts have they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Soul? In how many places lodg'd it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how many Orders have they divided, and to how many Stories have they rais'd this poor Creature Man, besides those that are natural, and to be perceiv'd? And how many Offices and Vocations have they assign'd him? They make an Imaginary of a Publick thing. 'Tis a Subject that they hold and handle: And they have full power granted to them, to rip, place, displace, peice and stuff it every one according to his own Fancy, and yet they possess it not. They cannot, not in reality only, but even in Dreams, so govern it, that there will not be some Cadence or Sound that will escape their Architecture as enormous as it is, and botch'd with a thousand false and fantastick Patches<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> And it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with <hi>Painters</hi> when they paint <hi>Heaven, Earth, Seas, Mountains</hi> and remote <hi>Islands,</hi> that they give us but some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a faint and obscure Description: Yet

I am very well pleas'd with the <hi>Milesian</hi> Girl, who observing the Philosopher <hi>Thales</hi> to be always contemplating the Celestial Arch; and to save his Eyes still gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble at, to put him in mind, that it would be time to take up his Thoughts about things that are in the Clouds, when he had provided for those that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet. Doubtless she advis'd him very well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at Heaven. For, as <hi>Democritus</hi> says, by the Mouth of <hi>Cicero,</hi>

No Man regards what is under his Feet, they are always prying towards Heaven.</hi> But our condition will have it so, that the Knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the Clouds, as that of the Stars: As <hi>Socrates</hi> says in <hi>Plato,</hi> That, whoever tampers with <hi>Philosophy,</hi> may be reproach'd as <hi>Thales</hi> was by the Woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. For every Philosopher is ignorant of what his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour does: Yes, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether Beasts or Men. And these people who find <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonde</hi>'s Arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the World, and that know all:

To those that contend upon Presupposition, we must on the contrary presuppose to them the same <hi>Axiom</hi> upon which the dispute is. For every Human Presupposition and Declaration has as much Authority one as another, if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son do not make the difference. Wherefore they are all to be put into the Ballance, and first the Generals, and those that tyrannize over us. The Persuasion of Certainty is a certain Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Folly and extream Incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of Men, nor that are less <hi>Philosophers,</hi> than the <hi>Philodoxes</hi> of <hi>Plato.</hi> We must inquire, whether <hi>Fire</hi> be hot, whether <hi>Snow</hi> be white, if there be any such things as <hi>hard</hi> or <hi>soft.</hi> And as to those Answers of which they make old Stories, as he that doubted if there were any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the Fire, and he that denyed the coldness of Ice, whom they bad to put a Cake of Ice into his Bosom, they are pitiful things unworthy of, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Profession of <hi>Philosophy.</hi> If they had let us alone in our Natural Being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our Senses; and had permitted us to follow our own Natural Appetites, and govern'd by the Condition of our Birth, they might then have reason to talk

at that rate; but 'tis from them, that we have learned to make our selves Judges of the World: 'Tis from them that we derive this Fancy, that Human Reason is Controller General of all that is without and within the Roof of Heaven, that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing: By the means of which, every thing is known and understood. This Answer would be good amongst <hi>Cannibals,</hi> who injoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of a long, quiet and peaceable Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Precepts, and without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Name of <hi>Physicks.</hi> This Answer would peradventure be of more value, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force than all those they borrow from their Reason and Invention. Of this, all Animals, and all, where the power of the Law of Nature is yet pure and simple, but those they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, would be as capable as we. They need not tell us, it is true, for we see and feel it to be so: They must tell me whether I real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel what I think I do; and if I do feel it, they must then tell me why I feel it, and how, and what: Let them tell me the Name, Original, the Part and Junctures of Heat and Cold, the Qualities of the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient</hi>: Or let them give up their Profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing, but by the way of Reason, that is, their <hi>Test</hi> in all sorts of Essays. But certainly 'tis a <hi>Test</hi> full of Falsity, Error, Weakness and Defect. Which way can we better prove it, than by it self? If we are not to believe her when speaking of her self, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of

Exotick things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own Being and Abode. She is in the Soul, and either a part or an effect of it: For true and essential Reason, from which we by a false Colour borrow the Name, is lodg'd in the Bosom of the <hi>Almighty.</hi> There is her Habitation and Recess, and 'tis from thence that she imparts her rays, when <hi>God</hi> is pleas'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part any beam of it to Mankind, as <hi>Pallas</hi> is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued from her Father's Head, to communicate her self to the World. Now let us see what Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reason tells us of her self, and of the Soul: Not of the Soul in general, of which almost all <hi>Philosophy</hi> makes the Celestial and first Bodies Participants: Nor of that which <hi>Thales</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to things, which themselves are reputed inanimate, drawn on so to do by the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Load-stone:</hi> But of that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to us, and that we ought the best to know,

Let us not forget <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who held the Soul to be that which naturally causes the Body to move, which he calls <hi>Entelechia,</hi> with as cold an Invention as any of the rest: For he neither speaks of the <hi>Essence,</hi> nor of the Original, nor of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Soul, only takes notice of the Effect. <hi>Lactantius, Seneca,</hi> and most of the

This place ought not to be over-slipt without a Remark upon the Vanity of so great a Man: For besides that these Considerations are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely light in themselves, the last is only a a proof to the Greeks, that they have their Souls lodg'd in that part. No Human Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so spritely and vigilant, that it does not sometimes sleep. Why should we be afraid to speak? We see the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who are the Fathers of Human Prudence, have found out, that the Soul of Man crushed under a ruin, does long labour and strive to get out, like a Mouse caught in a Trap, before it can disingage it self from the Burthen. Some hold, that the World was made to give Bodies, by way of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Spirits fallen, by their own Fault,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53645:515"/>
from the Purity wherein they had been created: The first <hi>Creation</hi> having been no other than incorporeal: And that according as they are more or less deprav'd from their Spirituality, so are they, or more or less jocundly or dully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated. And that thence proceeds all the Variety of so much created Matter. But the Spirit that, for his Punishment, was invested with the Body of the Sun, must certainly have a very rare and particular Measure of Thirst. The extremities of our Perquisition do all fall into, and terminate in, Astonishment and Blindness. As <hi>Plutarch</hi> says of the Testimony of <hi>Histories</hi>; that, according to Charts and Maps, the utmost Bounds of known Countries are taken up with Marishes, impenetrable Forests, Desarts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable places. And this is the reason why the most gross and childish Ravings were most found in those Authors who treat of the most elevated Subjects, and proceed the furthest in them: Losing themselves in their own Curiosity and Presumption. The beginning and end of Knowledge, are equally reputed Foolish. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to what a pitch <hi>Plato</hi> flyes in his Poetick Clouds: Do but take notice there of the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berish of the <hi>Gods.</hi> But what did he dream of when he defin'd a Man to be a two begg'd Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal without Feathers: Giving those who had a mind to deride him, a pleasant occasion? For having pull'd a Capon alive, they call'd it the Man of <hi>Plato.</hi> And what did the <hi>Epicureans</hi> think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine, that their <hi>Atomes,</hi> that they said
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53645:516"/>
were Bodies,<note place="margin">

                        </note> having some weight and a natural motion downwards, had made the World: Till they were put in mind by their Adversaries, that, according to this Description, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should unite and joyn to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and many, so many parrallel Lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and side-ways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their <hi>Atomes</hi> with hooked Tails, by which they might afterwards unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that attack them upon this Second Invention, put them hardly to it? If the <hi>Atomes</hi> have by chance form'd so many sorts of Figures, why did it never fall out that they made a House or a Shoe? Why at the same rate should we not believe, that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Greek Letters, strow'd all over a certain place, might possibly fall into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the <hi>Iliad</hi>? VVhatever is capable of Reason, says <hi>Zeno,</hi> is better than that which is not capable: There is nothing better than the VVorld: The VVorld is therefore capable of Reason. <hi>Cotta,</hi> by this way of Argumentation, makes the VVorld a Mathematician: And 'tis also made a Musician and an Organist, by this other Argumentation of <hi>Zeno</hi>: The Whole is more than a Part; we are capable of VVisdom, and are part of the World: Therefore the World is wise. There are infinite like Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not only of Arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53645:516" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in themselves, and that accuse their Authors not so much of Ignorance, as Impudence in the Reproaches, the Philosophers dash one another in the Teeth withal, upon the Dissentions in their Sects and Opinions. Whoever should bundle up a lusty Faggot of the Fooleries of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wisdom, would produce wonders. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly muster up these few for a Pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable, than the most moderate Instructions. Let us judge by these, what Opinion we are to have of Man of his Sense and Reason; when in these great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and that have raised Human Knowledge so high, so many gross and manifest Errors and Mistakes are to be found. For my part, I am apt to believe, that they have treated of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge casually; and like a Toy, with both hands, and have contended about Reason, as of a vain and frivolous Instrument, setting on foot all sorts of Fancies and Inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. This same <hi>Plato,</hi> who defines Man, as if he were a Cock, says elsewhere, after <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he does not in truth, know what Man is, and that he is a Member of the World the hardest to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. By this variety and instability of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they tacitly lead us, as it were, by the hand to this Resolution of their Irresolution. They profess not always to deliver their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bare-fac'd and apparent to us; they have one while disguis'd them in the fabulous Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Poesie,</hi> and another in some other Vizor: For our Imperfection carries this also along with
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53645:517" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, that crude Meats are not always proper for our Stomachs; they must dry, alter and mix them: They do the same: They oft conceal their real Opinions and Judgments, and falsifie them to accommodate themselves to the Publick Usance: They will not make an open Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Ignorance, and of the Imbecillity of Human Reason, that they may not fright Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: But they sufficiently discover it to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the appearance of a troubled and inconstant Science. I advis'd a Person in <hi>Italy,</hi> who had a great mind to speak Italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious to excel, that he should only make use of the first words that came to the Tongues end, whether <hi>Latin, French, Spanish</hi> or <hi>Gascon,</hi> and that in adding the Italian Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, he could not fail of hitting upon some <hi>Idiom</hi> of the Country either <hi>Thuscan, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Venetian, Piedmentois</hi> or <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and to apply himself to some one of those many Forms.

For to make the condition of our Souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all knowing, even in their Natural Simplicity and Purity. By these means they had been such, being free from the Prison of the Body, as well before they entred into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it. And from this knowledge it should follow, that they should remember being get in the Body, as <hi>Plato</hi> said, <hi>That what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before</hi>; a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. Forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing, but
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53645:519"/>
what we have been taught: And that if the Memory did purely perform its Office, it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. Secondly, That which she knew being in her Purity, was a true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, knowing things as they are by her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intelligence: Whereas here we make her receive Falshood and Vice, when we instruct her; wherein she cannot imploy her Remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, that Image and Conception having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been planted in her. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

future Torments. But thereby they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a good Game.

The sight of our Judgment is to Truth, the same that the Owles Eyes are to the Sun, says <hi>Aristotle</hi>: By what can we better convince him, than by so gross Blindness in so apparent a Light?

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53645:523" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conceals himself in clouds of Words of difficult and unintelligible Sense, and has left to those of his Sect as great a Dispute about his Judgment, as the matter it self. Two things rendred this Opinion plausible to them: One, that without the immortality of Souls, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereon to ground the vain Hopes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is a Consideration of wonderful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the World: The other, that it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable Impression,<note place="margin">

Man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively solicitous to prolong his Being, and has to the utmost of his Power provided for it. Monuments are erected, and embalming in use, for the Conservation of the Body, and glory to preserve the Name. He has employed all his Wit and Opinion to the rebuilding of himself (impatient of his Form) and to prop himself by his Inventions. The Soul by reason of its Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Impotence, being unable to stand by it self, wanders up and down to seek out Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Hopes and Foundations, and alien Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to which she adheres and fixes. And how light or fantastick soever Invention deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them to it, relies more willingly and with greater Assurance upon them, than it self. But 'tis wonderful to observe, how short the most constant and obstinate Maintainers of this just and clear Persuasion of the Immortality of the Soul do fall, and how weak their Arguments are,

                        <hi>They are Dreams not of the Teacher but Wisher,</hi> says one of the Antients. By which Testimony Man may know, that he owes the Truth he himself finds out to Fortune and Accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his Hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his Reason has not Force to make use of it. All things produc'd by our own Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Understanding, whether true or false, are subject to Incertitude and Controversy.

and Reasons, which accompany and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the vain Building of human Wisdom? And 'tis to very good effect, that they do so.

But to return to my Subject, it was truly very good Reason, that we should be beholding to <hi>God</hi> only, and to the favour of his Grace, for the Truth of so noble a Belief, since from his sole Bounty we receive the Fruit of Immortality, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Enjoyment of eternal Beatitude. Let us ingeniously confess, that <hi>God</hi> alone has dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to us and the Faith: For 'tis no Lesson of Nature and our own Reason. And whoever will enquire into his own Being and Power, both within and without, without this divine Privilege: Whoever shall consider Man impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and without Flattery, will see nothing in him of Efficacy, nor any kind of Faculty, that relishes of any thing but Death and Earth. The more we give and confess to owe and render to <hi>God,</hi> we do it with the greater Christianity. That which this Stoick <hi>Philosopher</hi> says, he holds from the fortuitous Consent of the popular Voice, had it not been better, that he had held it from <hi>God?

The Opinion that <hi>Varro</hi> makes mention of, is, that after four hundred and forty Years Revolution, they should be re-united to their first Bodies. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus</hi> held, that that would happen after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain space of time unknown and unlimited. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> (who professes to have embraced this Belief from <hi>Pindar</hi> and the ancient Poets) thinks they are to undergo infinite Vicissitudes of Mutation, for which the Soul is prepar'd, having neither Punishment nor reward in the other World, but what is Temporal, as its Life here is but Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, concludes that it has a singular Knowledg of the Affairs of Heaven, of Hell, of the World, through all which it has past, repast, and made stay in several Voyages; fit matters for her Memory. Observe her Progress elsewhere; the Soul that has liv'd well is reunited to the Star, to which it is assign'd: That removes into a Woman, and, if it do not there reform, is again removed into a Beast of Condition suitable to its vicious Manners, and shall see no end of its pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments, till it be returned to its natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and that it has by the force of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son purg'd it self from those gross, stupid, and elementary Qualities it was polluted with.

I will not omit the Objection the <hi>Epicureans</hi> make against this Transmigration from one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to another, and 'tis a pleasant one. They ask, what Expedient would be found out, if the number of the dying should chance to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than that of those who are coming into the World. For the Souls, turned out of their old Habitation, would scuffle and croud which should first get Possession of this new Lodging. And they further demand, how they should pass away their time, whilst waiting till a new Quarter were made ready for them: Or on the contrary, if more Animals should be born, than dye, the Body, they say, would be but in an ill Condition, whilst in expectation of a Soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out, that some Bodies would dye, before they had been alive.

Others have arrested the Soul in the Body of the Deceased, with it to animate Serpents, Worms, and other Beasts, which are said to be bred out of the Corruption of our Members, and even out of our Ashes; Others divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, the one mortal, and the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.

Others make it Corporeal, and never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless Immortal. Some make it Immortal without Science or Knowledg. And there are even of us our selves who have believed, that Devils were made of the Souls of the Damned; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> thinks, that <hi>Gods</hi> we made of those that were saved. For there are few things which that Author is so positive in, as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous way of Expression. We are to hold, says he, and steadfastly to believe, that the Souls of Virtuous Men, both according to Nature and the divine Justice, become Saints, and from Saints Demy-Gods, and from Demy-Gods, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are perfectly, as in Sacrifices of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all Passibility, and all Mortality, they become not by any civil Decree, but in real Truth, and according to all probability of Reason, entire and perfect Gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious End. But who desires to see him, him, I say, who is the most sober and moderate of the whole Gang of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> lay about him with greater Boldness, and relate his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles upon this Subject, I refer him to his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and his <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> where he may as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself and affirm, that the Mysteries of <hi>Philosophy</hi> have many strange things in common with those of <hi>Poesy</hi>; human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing losing it self, in attempting to sound and search all things to the Bottom: Even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of Life, return to Infancy and Dotage. See here
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53645:526" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fine and certain Instructions, which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from human Knowledg, concerning the Soul. Neither is there less Temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal Parts. Let us choose out one or two Examples; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we should lose our selves in this vast and troubled <hi>Ocean</hi> of Medicinal Errors. Let us first know, whether at least they agree about the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof Men produce one another. For as to their first Production, it is no wonder if in a thing so high, and so long since past, human Understanding finds it self puzzled and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Physitian, whose Disciple and Favourite <hi>Socrates</hi> was, according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoxenus,</hi> said, that both Men and Beasts were made of a lacteous Slime, exprest by the Heat of the Earth. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> says, that our Seed is the Foam or Cream of our better Blood. <hi>Plato,</hi> that it is the Distillation of the Marrow of the Back-bone, and raises his Argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the Work. <hi>Alcmeon,</hi> that it is part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Brain, and that it is so, says he, it causes weakness of the Eyes in those who are over-immoderately addicted to that Exercise: <hi>Democritus,</hi> that it is a Substance extracted from the whole Mass of the Body: <hi>Epicurus,</hi> extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Soul and Body: <hi>Aristotle,</hi> an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the Aliment of the last Blood which is diffused over all our Members: Others, that it is a Blood concocted and digested by the heat of the Genitories, which they judg, by reason that in excessive Endeavours a Man voids pure florid Blood: Wherein there seems to be
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53645:527" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the most likelyhood, could a Man extract any apparance from so infinite a Confusion. Now to bring this Seed to do its Work, how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions do they set on Foot? <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Democritus</hi> are of Opinion, that Women have no Sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a Sweat that they distil in the heat of Pleasure and Motion, that contributes nothing at all to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. <hi>Galen</hi> on the contrary, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, believe that without the Concurrence of Seeds, there can be no Generation. Here are the <hi>Physitians,</hi> the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> by the Ears with our Wives, about the Dispute, upon what Terms Women conceive their Fruit. And I for my part, by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of myself, stickle with those that maintain a Woman going eleven Months with Child. The World is built upon this Experience; there is not so pitiful a little Female that cannot give her Judgment in all these Controversies; and yet we cannot agree. Here is enough to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Man is no better instructed in the Knowledg of himself, in his corporal, than in his spiritual Part. We have proposed himself to himself, and his Reason to his Reason, to see what she could say, and, I think, I have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated how little she understands her self in her self. And who understands not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in himself, in what can he possibly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand?<note place="margin">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note>

Utile, it is hard to couple any Order or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to it. In those of our own time, who are endued with any rare Excellence above others, or any extraordinary Vivacity of Understanding, we see them almost all lash out into Licence of Opinions and Manners; and 'tis almost a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to find one Temperate and Sociable. 'Tis all the Reason in the World to limit human Wit within the strictest Limits imaginable. In Study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its Steps and Advances numbred and fix'd, and that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of its Inquisition be bounded by Act. It is curb'd and fetter'd by <hi>Religions, Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> by <hi>Sciences, Precepts,</hi> mortal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Penalties:</hi> and yet we see, that it escapes from all these Bounds by its Volubility and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. 'Tis a vain Body which has nothing to lay hold on, or to seize, a various and difform Body, incapable of being either bound or held. In earnest, there are few Souls so regular, firm, and well descended, that are to be trusted with their own Conduct; and that can with Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and without Temerity sayl in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their own Judgments, beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received Opinions. 'Tis more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to put them under Pupillage. Wit is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Weapon, even to the Possessor, if he knows not discreetly how to use it, and there is not a Beast to whom a Head-board is more justly to be given, to keep his Looks down and before his Feet, and to hinder him from wandring here and there out of the Tracks, which Custom and the Laws have laid before him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will much better become you to keep

The <hi>Academicks</hi> admitted a certain Partiality of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thought it too crude to say, that it was not more likely, that Snow was white, than black, and that we were no more assur'd of the motion of a Stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth Sphear. And to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can, in truth, hardly lodg in our Imagination; though they did conclude, that we were in no sort ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Knowledge, and that Truth is ingulfed in so profound an <hi>Abyss,</hi> as is not to be penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Human Sight: Yet do they acknowledge something to be more likely than others, and receiv'd into their Judgment this Faculty, that they had a power to incline to one apparence
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53645:531"/>
more than another. They allow'd him this propension, interdicting all Resolution. The <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> Opinon is more bold, and also more likely. For this <hi>Academick</hi> Inclination, and this Propension to one Proposition rather than another; what is it other, than a Discovery of some more apparent Truth in this, than in that? If our Understanding be capable of the Form, Lineaments, Comportment and Face of Truth, it might as well see it intire, as by halves, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and imperfect. This apparence of likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which makes them rather take the Left hand, than the Right, augments it: Multiply this Ounce of Verisimilitude, that turns the Scales to a hundred, to a thousand Ounces, it will happen in the end, that the Ballance will it self end the Controversie, and determine one Choice, and intire Truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to, and be sway'd by Verisimilitude, if they know not the Truth? How should they know the Similitude of that, whereof they do not know the Essence: Either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. If our intellectual and sensible Faculties are without Foot or Foundation; if they only <hi>hull</hi> and <hi>drive,</hi> 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our Judgments to be carried away with any thing of their Operation, what apparence so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may seem to present us. And the surest and most happy Seat of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be that, where it kept it self tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, upright and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation.<note place="margin">Cic. Acad. lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Inter visa, vera, aut fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest. Amongst
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53645:531" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind.</hi> That things do not lodge in us in their Form and Essence, and do not there make their entry by their own Force and Authority, we sufficiently see. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if it were so, we should receive them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner: Wine would have the same relish with the sick, as with the healthful. He who has his Finger chapt or benum'd, would find the same hardness in Wood or Iron that he handles, that another does. Strange Subjects then surrender themselves to our Mercy, and are seated in us as we please. Now if on our part we did receive any thing without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if Human Grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on Truth by our own means, being common to all Men, this Truth would be convey'd from hand to hand from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the World amongst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as there are, that would be believ'd by Men with an universal Consent. But this, that there is no one Proposition, that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest, that our Natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not very clearly discern what it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces: For my Judgment cannot make my Companions approve of what it approves: Which is a sign that I seiz'd it by some other means, than by a Natural Power that is in me, and in all other Men. Let us lay aside this infinite Confusion of Opinions, which we see even amongst the <hi>Philosophers</hi> themselves, and this perpetual and universal Dispute about the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53645:532" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knowledge of things. For this is truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppos'd, that Men, I mean the most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the best born, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing: Not that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is over our heads: For they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> say, that we have not comprehended, that the <hi>Heaven</hi> is over our heads, and these two Opinions are without comparison the stronger in number. Besides this infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and Division, through the Trouble that our Judgment gives our selves, and the Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easie to perceive that its Seat is very unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unsecure. How variously do we judge of things? How often do we alter our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? What I hold and believe to day, I hold and believe with my whole Belief: All my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and Engines seize and take hold of this Opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lyes; I could not imbrace, nor conserve any Truth with greater confidence and assurance<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> than I do this. I am wholly and intirely possess'd with it: But has it not befallen me not only once, but a thousand times every day to have imbrac'd some other thing with all the same Instruments, and in the same condition, which I have since judg'd to be false? A Man must at least become wise at his own expence. If I have often found my self betrayed under this colour, if my Touch prove ordinarily false, and my Ballance unequal and unjust, what assurance can I now
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53645:532" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have more, than at other times? Is it not stupidity and madness to suffer my self to be so often deceiv'd by my Guide? Nevertheless let Fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place ro place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our Belief, as into a Vessel, other and other Opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible: For this we must abandon Goods, Honour, Life, Health and all.

Whatever is preach'd to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember, that it is Man that gives, and Man that receives; 'tis a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Hand that presents it to us, 'tis a mortal Hand that accepts it. The things that come to us from Heaven, have the sole Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Persuasion, the sole mark of Truth: Which also we do not see with our own Eyes, nor receive by our own means: That Great and Sacred Image could not abide in so wretched a Habitation, if <hi>God</hi> for this end did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it, if <hi>God</hi> did not by his particular and supernatural Grace and Favour, fortifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: At least our frail and defective conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to make us comport our selves with more reservedness and moderation in our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and Change.

It is certain that our Apprehensions, our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Faculties of the Soul in general, suffer according to the Movements and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Body; which Alterations are continual.

sake undertaken to maintain an Opinion contrary to my own, my Mind bending and applying it self that way, does so rarely engage me in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that I no more discern the Reason of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Belief, and forsake it. I am as it were mislead by the Side to which I encline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own Weight. Every one would almost say the same of himself, if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered himself as I do. <hi>Preachers</hi> very well know, that the Emotions which steals upon them in speaking, does animate them towards Belief; and that in Passion we are more stiff in the Defence of our Proposition, take our selves a deeper Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, and imbrace it with greater Vehemence and Approbation, than we do in our colder and more temperate Sense. You only give your <hi>Councel</hi> a simple <hi>Breviate</hi> of your Cause, he returns you a dubious and uncertain Answer, by which you find him indifferent, which side he takes: Have you fed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concern'd, and do you find him truly interested and zealous in your Quarrel?

Nay I do not know whether the Ardour that springs from Spite and Obstinacy, against the Power and Violence of the Magistrate and Danger; or the Interest of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may it not have made some Men even to the Stake maintain the Opinion, for which at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and amongst Friends, he would not have

The Shocks and Justles, that the Soul receives from the Bodies Passions<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more: To which it is so subjected, that peradventure it is to be made good, that it has no other Pace and Motion, but from the Breath of those Winds, without the Agitation of which, it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd and without Action, like a Ship in the middle of the Sea, to which the Winds have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed their Assistance. And whoever should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this, siding with the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> would do us no great Wrong.

What Assurance than can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Dominion of Trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed Pace? If our Judgment be in the Power even of Sickness and Perturbation: If it be from Folly and Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it is held to receive the Impression of things, what Assurance can we expect from it? Is it not a great Boldness in Philosophy, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Men perform the greatest Actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they are Furious, Mad, and besides themselves? We bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53645:536" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our selves by the Astonishment and Privation of Reason. The two natural Ways to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cabinet of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and there to foresee the Course of Destiny are Fury and Sleep. This is pleasant to consider. By the Dislocation that Passions cause in our Reason, we must become Vertuous: By its Extirpation occasioned by Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as the Image of Death, we become <hi>Diviners</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> I was never so willing to believe Philosophy in any thing, as this. 'Tis a Pure <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> wherewith Sacred Truth has inspir'd the Spirit of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which makes it confess contrary to its own Proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful Estate of the Soul, that <hi>Philosophy</hi> can seat it in, is not its best Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our waking is more asleep, than Sleep it self; our Wisdom less Wise than Folly: Our Dreams are worth more than our Meditation; and the worst Place we can take is in our selves. But does not Philosophy think that we are VVise enough to consider, that the Voice that the Spirit utters, when dismist from Man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in Man so terrestrial Ignorant and dark, is a Voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Spirit of a dark, terrestrial and ignorant Man; and for this Reason a Voice not to be trusted and believed? I have no great Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of these vehement Agitations, being of a soft and heavy Complexion, the most of which surprize the Soul on a suddain, without giving it leisure to recollect it self. But the Passion, that is said to be produced by Idleness in the Hearts of young Men, tho' it proceed leisurely, and with a measured Progress, does evidently manifest to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53645:537" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those who have tryed to oppose its Power, the Violence our Judgment suffers in this Alteration and Conversion. I have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it. For I am so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of those who invite Vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if they do not hale me along: I perceiv'd it to spring, grow and encrease in despight of my Resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was, wholy to seize and possess me; so that, as if newly rous'd frum Drunkenness, the Images of things began to appear to me quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they were wont to be: I evidently saw the Person, I desired, grow and encrease in Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Beauty, and to expand and blow fairer by the influence of my Imagination, the Difficulties of my Attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my Reason and Conscience to be laid aside: But this Fire being evaporated in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, as from a flash of Lightning, I was aware that my Soul resum'd another kind of Sight, and another sort of Estate, and another Judgment. The Difficulties of my Retreat appear'd great and invincible, and the same things had quite another Tast and Aspect, than the heat of Desire had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them to me. Than which <hi>Pyrrho</hi> himself knows nothing more truly. We are never without Sickness. Agues have their hot and cold Fits; from the Effects of an ardent Passion, we fall again to shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. As much as I had advanc'd, so much I retir'd.

Now from the Knowlege of this Volubility of mine, I have accidentally begot in myself a certain Constancy of Opinions, and have not much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered those that were first and natural in me. For what Apparence soever there may be in Novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of losing by the Bargain: And besides, I am not capable of chusing, I take other Mens Choice, and keep myself in the Station wherein <hi>God</hi> has plac'd me, I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rouling. Thus have I, by the Grace of <hi>God,</hi> preserved my self entire, without Anxiety or trouble of Conscience, amidst so many Sects and Divisions, as our Age has produced. The Writings of the Ancients, the best Authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will: He, that I am reading, seems always to have the most Force, and I find that every one has Reason, tho' they contradict one another. The Facility that good Wits have of rendring every thing likely they would recommend; and that nothing is so strange, to which they do not undertake to give Colour enough to deceive such a Simplicity as mine, this does evidently shew the Weakness of their Testimony. The Heaven and the Stars have been three thousand Years in Motion, and all the World were of that Belief, till <hi>Cleanthes</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> or (according to <hi>Theophrastus) Nicetas</hi> of

So that when any new Doctrine presents it self to us,<note place="margin">

                        </note> we have great Reason to mistrust; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that before that was set on foot, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had been generally received; and that as that has been overthrown by this,<note place="margin">Aristotle's <hi>Principles in Vogue.</hi>

of Doors than their Predecessors were. When any one presses me with a new Argument, I ought to believe, that what I cannot answer, another can: For to believe all Likelyhoods that a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confute, is great Simplicity: It would by that means come to pass, that all the Vulgar, (and we are all of the Vulgar, would have their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as turnable as a Weathercock: For the Soul being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any Resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other Impressions, the last still effacing all Footsteps, of that which went before. He that finds himself weak, ought to answer according to Practice, that he will speak with his <hi>Councel,</hi> or refer himself to the Wise, from whom he receiv'd his Instruction. How long is it that <hi>Physick</hi> has been practised in the World? 'Tis said, that a new Commer, call'd <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> changes and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the whole Order of antient Rules, and maintains that till now, it has been of no other use, but to kill Men. I do believe that he will easily make this good: But I do not think it were Wisdom to venture my Life in making tryal of his own Experience. VVe are not to believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, (says the Precept) because every one can say all things. A Man of this Profession of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and Physical Reformations, not long since told me, that all the <hi>Ancients</hi> were notoriously mistaken in the Nature and Motions of the Winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me, if I would give him the hearing. After I had with some Patience heard his Arguments, which were all full of likelyhood of Truth: What then said I, did those that fail'd according to <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> make
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53645:539" rendition="simple:additions"/>
way <hi>Westward,</hi> when they had the Prow towards the <hi>East</hi>! did they go Sideward or Backward? That's Fortune, answered he; but so it is, that they were mistaken. I then replyed, that I had rather follow Effects than Reason. Now these are things that often interfere, and I have been told that in <hi>Geometrie,</hi> (which pretends to have gain'd the highest Point of Certainty of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) there are Demonstrations found so inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as subvert the Truth of all Experience. As <hi>Jaques Pelletier</hi> told me at my own House, that he had found out two Lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he affirmed, though extended to all Infinity, could never happen to touch one another; and the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> make no other use of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and their Reason, than to ruine the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of Experience; and 'tis a wonder, how far the suppleness of our Reason has followed them in this Design of controverting the Evidence of Effects. For they affirm, that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither Weight nor Heat, with the same force of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we verify the most likely things. <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> who was a great Man, had established the Bounds of this VVorld of ours: All the Ancient Philosophers thought they had the Measure of it, excepting some remote <hi>Isles,</hi> that might escape their Knowledg: It had been <hi>Pyrrh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Question is, whether, if <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in formerly deceiv'd, upon the Foundations of his Reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these People say: And whether it is not more like, that this great Body, which we call the VVorld, is not quite another thing, than what we imagine. <hi>Plato</hi> says, that it changes Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in all Respects: That the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> have all of them sometimes Motions retrograde to what we see, changing <hi>East</hi> into <hi>West.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian Priests</hi> told <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi> that from the time of their first King,<note place="margin">

And some amongst us are of Opinion, that it has been from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is mortal, and renued again by several Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes; calling <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> to witness: To evade those Oppositions, that <hi>God</hi> has once been a <hi>Creator</hi> without a <hi>Creature</hi>; that he has had nothing to do, that he has contradicted that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, by putting his Hand to this VVork; and that consequently he is subject to Change.

strip and unmuffle the Glances of their Instruments and clipt off the Prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others, who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully purs'd it up with little Strings, to keep that end from peeping into the Air. And of this other diversity, that whereas we to honour Kings and Festivals, put on the best Cloths we have: In some Religions to express their Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Submission to their King, his Subjects present themselves before him in their vilest Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and entring his <hi>Palace,</hi> throw some old tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Garment over their better Apparel, to the end that all the Lustre and Ornament may solely remain in him.

If we experimentally see, that the Form of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depends upon the Air, upon the Climat, and upon the Soile where we are born: And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Colour, the Stature, the Complexion and the Countenances, but moreover the very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul it self: <hi>Et plaga Caeli non solÃ¹m ad robur corporum,</hi>

this ought not to be forgotten, that Man cannot, by his own Wish and Desire, find out what is necessary for him, that not in Fruition only, but in Imagination and Wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfie and content us. Let us leave it to our own Thought to cut out and make up at pleasure: It cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfie it self.

to the bounty of our Sovereign <hi>Creator,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving disabus'd our Belief from wandring and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Devotions, and for having seated it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eternal foundation of the Holy Word?

As to the liberty of

Philosophical Opinions concerning Vice and Vertue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; and wherein are found many Opinions that are better conceal'd than publish'd to weak Spirits: <hi>Archesilaus</hi> said, that in Fornication it was no matter where, or with whom it was committed. <hi>Et obscoenas voluptates,</hi>

thing to Reason, and who admit nothing by Authority, or upon Trust; have their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments very remote and differing from those of the Publick. It is no wonder if People, who take their pattern from the first Image of Nature, should in most of their Opinions swerve from the common path: As for Example, few amongst them would have approv'd of the strict Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Marriages, and most of them have been for having Wives in Common, and without Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: They would refuse our Ceremonies. <hi>Chrysippus</hi> said, that a certain Philosopher would have made a dozen Somersaults, and turn'd up his Tail without his Breeches, for a dozen of Olives. That Philosopher would hardly have advis'd <hi>Calisthenes</hi> to have refus'd <hi>Hippoclides</hi> the fair <hi>Agarista</hi> his Daughter, for having seen him stand on his Head upon a Table. <hi>Metrocles</hi> let a Fart a little indiscreetly in Disputation, in the presence of a great Auditory in his School, and kept himself hid in his own House for shame, till <hi>Crates</hi> comming to visit him, and adding to his Consolations and Reasons, the Example of his own Liberty, falling to Fart with him who should let most, cur'd him of that scruple, and withall drew him to his own Stoical <hi>Sect,</hi> more free than that more reserv'd one of the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks,</hi> of which he had been till then. That which we call Decency, not to dare to do that in publick which it is decent enough to do in private, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> call foppery, and to mince it, and be so modest as to conceal and disown what Nature, Custom, and our desires publish
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53645:550" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and proclaim of our Actions, they reputed a Vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of <hi>Venus,</hi> to draw them out of her private Oratory, to expose them to the view of the People: And that to bring them out from behind the Curtain, was to loose them. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty is a thing of weight; Secresie, Reservation, and Circumscription are Parts of Esteem. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure did very ingeniously, when under the visor of Virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open Streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the publick View, wanting the dignity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of her private <hi>Cabinets.</hi> Hence some say, that to put down publick Stews, is not only to disperse Fornication into all Places that was a sign for one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and wanton People to this Vice.

curb to Voluptuousness, but Moderation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Conservation of the Liberty of others. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Protagoras,</hi> forasmuch as Wine seem'd bitter to the Sick, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the sound, the Rudder crook'd in the Water, and strait when out, and such like contrary apparences as are found in Subjects, argued from thence, that all Subjects had in themselves the Causes of these Apparences; and that there was some bitterness in the Wine, which had some sympathy with the sick man's Taste, and the Rudder some bending Quality, sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the Water. And so of all the rest, which is to say, that all is in all things, and consequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in any one, for where all is there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This Opinion put me in mind of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience we have, that there is no sence nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of any thing whether bitter or sweet, strait or crooked, that humane Wit does not find out in the Writings he undertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that can possibly be,<note place="margin">The purest way of Speaking, capable of various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> how many Lyes and Falsities have we suggested? What Heresie has not there found Ground and Testimony suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make it self embrac'd and defended? 'Tis for this, that the Authors of such Errors will never depart from proof of the Testimony of the interpretation of Words. A Person of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who would prove to me by Authority, the search of the Philosophers Stone,<note place="margin">The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers Stone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> wherein he was over head and ears ingag'd; alledg'd to me at last five or six Passages in the <hi>Bible,</hi> upon
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53645:551" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which he said he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his Conscience; (for he is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) and in truth the Invention was not only pleasant, but moreover very well accomodated to the Defence of this fine Science. By this way the Reputation of divining Fables is acquir'd. There is no Fortune-teller, if he have this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but, if a Man will take the Pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his Words, he may make him, like the <hi>Sibils,</hi> say what he will. There are so many ways of Interpretation, that it will be hard but that, either obliquely, or in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Line, an ingenious Wit will find out in every Subject, some Air that will serve for his Purpose. Therefore there is a cloudy and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Stile in this so frequent and antient use; let the Author but make himself Master of that, he may attract and busie Posterity about his Predictions; which not only his own Parts, but the accidental Favour of the Matter it self, may as much or more assist him to obtain. That, as to the rest, he express himself after a foolish, or a subtle manner, whether obscurely, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorily, 'tis no matter; a number of Wits shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several Forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary to it, which will all redound to his Honour. He will see himself enrich'd by the means of his Disciples, like the Regents of Colledges, by their Pupils yearly Presents. This is it which has given Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to many things of no worth at all;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53645:552"/>
that has brought several Writings in Vogue, and given them the Fame of containing all sorts of Matter can be desir'd; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand Images and various Considerations, nay, even as many as we please. Is it possible that <hi>Homer</hi> could design to say all that we make him: and that he design'd so many, and so various Figures, as that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Law-givers, Captains, Philosophers,</hi> and all sorts of Men who treat of Sciences,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Homer</hi> the general Leader of all sorts of People.</note> how vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and oppositely soever, should indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quote him, and support their Arguments by his Authority, as the Sovereign Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all Offices, Works and Artizans, and Councellor General of all Enterprizes? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has had occasion for Oracles and Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'Tis a Wonder how many, and how admirable Concurrences an intelligent Person, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friend of mine, has there found out in Favour of our Religion; and cannot easily be put out of the Conceit that it was <hi>Homer's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign: and yet he is as well acquainted with this Author, as any Man whatever of his Time. And what he has found out in Favour of ours, very many anciently have found in Favour of theirs. Do but observe how <hi>Plato</hi> is tumbled and tost, every one ennobling his own Opinions by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying him to himself, make him take what side they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new Opinions the World receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself: every one makes
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53645:552"/>
him according to his own Sense, the Manners and Customs lawful in his Age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with Vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power, according to the force and sprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the Wit of the Interpreter. From the same Foundation that <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his had, <hi>That all things had in them those forms that we discern'd, Democritus</hi> drew a quite contrary conclusion; namely, <hi>That Subjects had nothing at all in them of what we there find</hi>: and that forasmuch as Honey is sweet to one, and bitter to another, he thence argued, that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> would say, that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or neither the one or the other, or both; for those always gain the highest point of Dubitation. The <hi>Cyrenaicks</hi> held, that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible, that internally touch'd us, as Grief and Pleasure; acknowledging neither Sound, nor Colour, but certain Affections only that we receive from them, and that mans Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no other Seat. <hi>Protagoras</hi> believ'd, that what seem'd to every one was true to every one. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> lodg'd all Judgment in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in the Knowledge of things, and in Pleasure. <hi>Plato</hi> would have the Judgment of Truth, and Truth it self deriv'd from Opinions, and the Senses to appertain to the Wit and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation. This Discourse put me upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Senses, in which lies the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Foundation and Proof of our Ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53645:553" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Faculty of the knower; for seeing the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from the Operation of him that judges, 'tis Reason that this Operation performs it by his means, and will not by the constraint of another; as it would happen, if we knew things by the Power, and according to the Law of their Essence. Now all Knowledge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to us by the Senses, they are our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:

The first Consideration I have upon the Subject of the Senses is,<note place="margin">Doubt whether man have all his Senses.</note> that I make a doubt whether or no Man be furnish'd with all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senses.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53645:554" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also, one, two, or three, or many other Senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, our Examination cannot discover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. 'Tis the priviledge of the Senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond them that can assist us in Explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not so much as one Sense in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of another.

                     <p>It is impossible to make a man, naturally blind, conceive that he does not see, impossible to make him desire Sight, or to be sensible of his defect. For which Reason, we ought not to derive any assurance from the Soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have: considering that it cannot be sensible herein of it's Infirmity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53645:554" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if there be any such thing. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to say any thing to this blind Man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Argument or Similitude, that can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess his Imagination with any Apprehension of Light, Colour, or Sight. There nothing remains behind that can push on the Senses to Evidence. Those that are born Blind, whom we hear to wish they could see, it is not that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they desire: They have learn'd from us that they want something, that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed, and speak of it's Effects and Consequence, but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it not at all. I have seen a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a good Family, who was born Blind, or at least Blind from such an Age that he knows not what Sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect, that he makes use as we do of Words proper for Seeing, and applies them after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wholly particular, and his own. They brought him a Child to which he was Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which having taken into his Arms: <hi>Good God</hi> (said he) <hi>what a fine Child is this, how beautiful to look upon, what a pretty Face it has!</hi> He will say, like one of us, this Room has a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine Prospect, it is clear Weather, the Sun shines bright. And moreover, being that Hunting, Tennis, and Butts, are our Exercises, and that he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will Ride a Hunting; and believes he has as good a share of the Sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleas'd as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it, but by the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53645:555" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ear. One cries out to him, here's a Hare, when he is upon some even Plain where he may safely Ride; and afterwards, when they tell him the Hare is kill'd, he will be as overjoy'd, and proud of it, as he hears others say they are. He will take a Tennis Ball in his left hand, and strike it away with the Racket: He will shoot with a Musket at random, and is contented with what his People tell him, that he is over or wide. Who knows whether all humane kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some Sense, and that through this Default, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the face of things is conceal'd from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several effects of Animals which exceed our Capacity, are not produc'd by facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some sense that we are defective in? And whether some of them have not by this means a Life more full and entire than ours? We seize an Apple as it were with all our Senses: We there find Redness, Smoothness, Odour, and Sweetness: But it may have other Vertues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, as to heat, or bind, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in Nature that are fit to judge of, and to discern those which we call the occult Proprieties in several things, as for the Load-stone to attract Iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true Essence of such things? 'Tis peradventure some particular Sense that gives Cocks to understand what hour it is of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and when it grows to be towards Day, and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53645:555" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that makes them to Crow accordingly; that teaches Chickens, before they have any Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of what they are, to fear a <hi>Spar-hawk,</hi> and not a <hi>Goose,</hi> or a <hi>Peacock,</hi> though Birds of a much larger Size: That cautions them of the hostil Quality the <hi>Cat</hi> has against them, and makes them not to fear a <hi>Dog</hi>: To arm themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the meawing (a kind of flattering Voice) of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill, and threatning Voice of the other. That teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <hi>Wasps, Ants,</hi> and <hi>Rats,</hi> to fall upon the best Pear, and the best Cheese, before they have tasted them, and inspires the <hi>Stag, Elephant,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> with the knowledge of a certain Herb proper for their Cure. There is no Sense that has not a mighty Dominion, and that does not by it's power introduce an infinite number of Knowledges. If we were defective in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of sounds of Musick, and of the Voice, it would cause an inimaginable confusion in all the rest of our Science. For, besides what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the proper effect of every Sense, how many Arguments, Consequences, and Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do we draw to other things, by comparing one Sense with another? Let an Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man imagine humane Nature originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd without the Sense of Seeing, and consider what Ignorance and Trouble such a Defect would bring upon him, what a Darkness, and Blindness in the Soul; he will then see by that of how great Importance to the knowledge of Truth, the privation of such another Sense, or of two, or three, should we be so depriv'd, would be. We
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53645:556" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have form'd a Truth by the Consultation and Concurrence of our five Senses, but peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we should have the consent and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eight or ten, to make a certain discovery of our own Being. The <hi>Sects</hi> that controvert the Knowledge of man, do it principally by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and weakness of our Senses. For since all Knowledge is by their means and mediation convey'd unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt, or alter what they bring us from without, if the Light which by them creeps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul be obscur'd in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extream dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty all these fancies proceed, that every sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has all we there find in it self: That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find; and that of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> is no bigger than 'tis judg'd by our sight to be:

                     <p>Like a Musket Bullet, under the Fore-finger, the middle Finger being lap'd over it, which feels so like two, that a Man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two Fingers feeling each of them one at the same time. For that the Senses are very often Masters of our Reason, and constrain it to receive Impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the Sense of feeling, that has its Functions nearer, more lively and substantial; that so often by the effect of the Pains it helps the Body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical Resolutions, and compells him to cry out of his Belly, who has resolutely establish'd this Doctrine in his Soul, that the Cholick, and all other Pains and Diseases are indifferent things; not having the Power to abate any thing of the Sovereign Felicity, wherein the wise man is seated by his Vertue. There is no Heart so effeminate, that the rattle and sound of our Drums and Trumpets will not enflame with Courage; nor so sullen, that the Harmony of our Musick will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn Soul, that will not feel it self struck with some Reverence, in considering the gloomy vastness of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the variety of Ornaments, and Order of our Ceremonies, and to hear the solemn Musick of our Organs, and the Grace and devout Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

of our Voices. Even those that come in with Contempt, feel a certain shivering in their Hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their Opinions. For my part, I do not think my self strong enough to hear an Ode of <hi>Horace</hi> or <hi>Catullus</hi> Sung by a beautiful young Mouth without emotion. And <hi>Zeno</hi> had reason to say,<note place="margin">The Voice, the flower of Beauty.</note> That the Voice was the flower of Beauty. One would once make me believe, that a certain Person, whom all we <hi>Frenchmen</hi> know, had impos'd upon me, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating some Verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon the Paper that they were in the Air, and that my Eyes would make a contrary Judgement to my Ears: So great a Power has Pronuntiation to give fashion and value to Works that are left to the Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Modulation of the Voice. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was not so much too blame, hearing one give an ill Accent to some Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his, for spurning and breaking certain Earthen Vessels of his, saying, <hi>I break what is thine, because thou corrupt'st what is mine.</hi> To what end did those Men, who have with a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Resolution destroy'd themselves, turn away their Faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? and that those, who for their Health desire and command Incisions to be made, and Cauteries to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them, cannot endure the sight of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, Instruments, and Operations of the <hi>Chyrurgeon</hi>; being that the Sight is not any way to participate in the Pain? Are not these
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53645:559" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proper Examples to verifie the authority the Senses have over the Imagination?

                     <p>Let a <hi>Philosopher</hi> be put into a Cage of small thin set Bars of Iron, and hang him on the Top of the high Tower of <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>; He will see by manifest Reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he have been used to the Plummers Trade) that he cannot help, but that the excessive height will fright and astonish him. For we have enough to do to assure our selves in the <hi>Galleries</hi> of our Steeples, if they are made with Rail and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luster, altho they are of Stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a Beam thrown over betwixt these two Towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no Philosophical Wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it, as we should do upon the Ground. I have often tried this upon our Mountains in these Parts; and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53645:560"/>
yet I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, that I was not able to endure to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that infinite Depth without horror and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the Precipice, and could not have fall'n down if I would. Where I also observ'd, that what height soever the Precipice were, provided there were some Tree, or some jutting out of a Rock, a little to support and divide the Sight, it a little eases our Fears, and gives greater Assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief: But that direct Precipices we are not able to look upon without being giddy; <hi>ut despici sine vertigine simul oculorum animique non possit.</hi> Which is a manifest imposture of the Sight. And therefore it was, that the fine Philosopher put out his own Eyes, to free the Soul from being diverted by them, and that he might Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phise at greater liberty. But by the same Rule, he should have damm'd up his Ears, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus</hi> says are the most dangerous Instruments about us, for receiving violent Impressions to alter and disturb us; and finally, should have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd himself of all his other Senses, that is to say, of his Life and Being; For they have all the power to command our Soul and Reason. <hi>Fit etiam saepe specie quadam, saepe vocum gravitate &amp; cantibus,</hi>

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53645:560" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that there are certain Complexions that are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by some Sounds, and Instruments, even to Fury. I have seen some, who could not hear a Bone gnaw'd under the Table without impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and there is scarce any man, who is not disturb'd at the sharp and shrill noise that the File makes in grating upon the Iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak, who has any impediment in the Throat or Nose, will move some People even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> who softened, raised, and mov'd his Master's Voice, whilst he declaim'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the Judgments of the Auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmity of this fine piece, that suffers it self to be turn'd and twin'd by the motion and accidents of so light a wind. The same cheat that the Senses put upon our Understanding, they have in turn put upon them. The Soul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sometimes has its revenge, they lye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear when we are transported with Passion, we neither see nor hear as it is.

of the operations of the Senses, be first agreed with Beasts, and secondly, amongst our selves, which we by no means are, but enter at every turn into Dispute; forasmuch as one Hears, Sees, or Tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests as much as upon any other thing, of the diversity of the Images that the Senses represent to us. A Child, by the ordinary rule of Nature, Hears, Sees, and Tastes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than a Man of thirty years old, and he, than one of threescore.

Now our Perception being so uncertain and controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that Snow appears white to us, but that to affirm that it is in it's own Essence really so, is more than we are able to justifie: and this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being shaken, all the Knowledge in the World must of necessity fall to ruine.

                     <p>As to what remains, who can be fit to judge of, and to determine these Differences? As we say in Controversies of Religion, that we must have a Judge, neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all Choice and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot be amongst Christians; just so it falls out in this; for if he be old, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of the sense of old Age, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Party in the Case: if Young, there is the same Exception; if Healthful, Sick, Asleep, or Awake, he is still the same incompetent Judge: We must have some one exempt from all these Propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this Rule we must have a Judge that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was. To judge of the apparence that we receive of Subjects, we ought to have a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Instrument, to prove this Instrument, we must have Demonstration, to verifie this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, an Instrument, and here we are upon the Wheel. Seeing the Senses cannot determine
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53645:565" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Dispute, being full of incertainty themselves, it must then be Reason that must do it; but no Reason can be erected upon any other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that of another Reason, and so we run back to all Infinity. Our fancy does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it self to things that are strange, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the mediation of the Senses, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do not comprehend a foreign Subject, but only their own Passions, by which means fancy and apparence are no part of the Subject, but only of the Passion and Sufferance of Sense, which Passion and Subject are several things; wherefore, whoever judges by Apparences, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by another thing than the Subject. And to say that the Passions of the Senses convey to the Soul the quality of strange Subjects by Resemblance: how can the Soul and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be assur'd of this Resemblance, having of it self no Commerce with foreign Subjects? As they who never knew <hi>Socrates,</hi> cannot, when they see his Picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would notwithstanding judge by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences, if it be by all, it is impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they hinder one another by their Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and Discrepancies, as we by Experience see. Shall some select Apparences govern the rest? You must verifie this Select by another Select, the second by the third, and consequently there will never be any end on't. Finally, there is no constant Existence neither of the Objects Being, nor our own. Both we, and our Judgements, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rowling, and consequently, nothing certain
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53645:566" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can be establish'd from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual Motion and Mutation: We have no Communication with <hi>Being,</hi> by reason that all humane Nature is always in the mid'st, betwixt being Born and Dying, giving but an obscure Apparence and Shadow, a weak and uncertain Opinion of it self. And if peradventure you fix your thought to apprehend your Being, it would be but like grasping Water, for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in it's own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold: So seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, Reason, that there looks for a real Substance, finds it self deceiv'd, not being able to apprehend any thing that is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent and Permanent, because that every thing is either entring into Being, and is not yet wholly arriv'd at it, or begins to Dye before it is Born. <hi>Plato</hi> said, that Bodies had never any Existence, but only Birth; conceiving that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had made the Ocean, and <hi>Thetis,</hi> Father and Mother of the <hi>Gods,</hi> to shew us, that all things are in a perpetual Fluctuation, Motion, and Variation; the Opinion of all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as he says, before his time, <hi>Parmenides</hi> only excepted, who would not allow things to have Motion, of the Power whereof he sets a mighty Value. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was of Opinion, that all <hi>Matter</hi> was flowing and unstable: The <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> that there is no time present, and that what we call so, is nothing but the juncture, and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53645:566" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meeting of the future and the past: <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that never any man entred twice into the same River: <hi>Epicharmus</hi>; that who borrow'd Money but an hour ago, does not owe it now; and, that he, who was invited over-night to come the next day to Dinner, comes nevertheless uninvited, considering, that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and, that there could not a mortal Substance be found twice in the same Condition: for, by the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness and quickness of Change, it one while disperses, and another reassembles; it comes and goes after such a manner, that what begins to be Born, never arrives to the Perfection of Being; forasmuch as that Birth is never finish'd, and never stays, as being at an end, but from the Seed is evermore changing and shifting from one to another. As humane Seed is first in the Mothers Womb made a formless <hi>Embrio,</hi> after deliver'd thence a sucking Infant; afterwards it becomes a Boy, then consequently a Youth, after that a full Man, then a middle-ag'd Man, and at last a decrepid old Man. So that Age and subsequent Generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before.

And yet we foolishly fear one kind of Death, whereas we have already past, and do daily pass so many other. For not only, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> said, the Death of the Fire is the Generation of the Air, and the Death of Air the Generation of Water: but moreover, we may more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly discern it in our selves: The Flower of Youth dies, and passes away when Age comes on, and youth is terminated in the Flower of Age of a full grown Man; Infancy in Youth, and the first Age dies in Infancy: Yesterday di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in to Day, and to Day will die in to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so, let this be the Proof; If we are alwayes one and the same, how comes it then to pass, that we are now pleas'd with one thing, and by and by with another? How comes it to pass that we love contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different Affections, and no more retain the same Sentiment in the same Thought? For it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other Passions; and that which suffers Mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same, it is not at all: But the same that the Being is, does, like it, unknowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change and alter, becoming evermore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from another thing: And consequently the natural Senses abuse and deceive themselves,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53645:567" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taking that which seems, for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is Eternal: that is to say, that never had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor never shall have ending, and to which Time can bring no mutation.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Time a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing without permanency.</hi>
                        </note> For <hi>Time</hi> is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile thing, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever remaining stable and permanent: and to which those words appertain, before, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, has been, or shall be: Which at the first sight evidently shew, that it is not a thing that is; and it were a great folly, and an apparent falsity, to say that that is, which is not yet in being, or that has already ceas'd to be. And as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of <hi>Time,</hi> Reason disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, does presently destroy it; for it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The same happens to <hi>Nature,</hi> that is measur'd, as to Time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or dying. By which means, it were a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful saying, to say of <hi>God,</hi> who is He who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>is,</hi> that <hi>He was,</hi> or that <hi>He shall be</hi>: for those are Terms of declension, transportation, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude, of what cannot continue, nor remain in <hi>Being.</hi> Wherefore we are to conclude, that <hi>God</hi> only is, not according to any measure of Time, but according to an immutable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53645:568" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eternity, not measur'd by Time, nor subject to any Declension: before whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was, and after whom nothing shall be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more new, or more recent, but a real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that with one sole <hi>Now</hi> fills the <hi>for ever,</hi> and that there is nothing that truly is, but He alone; without being able to say, He has been, or shall be, without beginning, and without end. To this Religious conclusion of a Pagan, I shall only add this testimony of one of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the close of this long and tedious Discourse, which would furnish me with end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less matter. <hi>What a vile and abject thing,</hi> says he, <hi>is man, if he do not raise himself above Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> 'Tis a good word, and a profitable desire, but withall absurd; For to make the handle bigger than the Hand, and the Cubit longer than the Arm, and to hope to stride further than our Legs can reach, is both impossible and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous; or that Man should rise above himself and Humanity: for he cannot see but with his Eyes, nor seize but with his Power. He shall be exalted, if <hi>God</hi> will lend him his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be rais'd and elevated by means purely Celestial; It belongs to our Christian Faith, and not to the Stoical Vertue, to pretend to that Divine and miraculous <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis.</hi>

                     <p>WHen we judge of another's assurance in Death, which without doubt is the most remarkable action of humane Life; we are to take notice of one thing, which is, that men very hardly believe themselves to be arriv'd to that period. Few men dye in an opinion that it is their latest hour, and there is nothing wherein the flattery of Hope does more delude us. It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceases to whisper in our Ears,<note place="margin">No very resolute assurance at the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of death.</note> Others have been much sicker without dying; my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not so desperate as 'tis thought, and at the worst, <hi>God</hi> has done other Miracles. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, by reason that we set too much value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves. It seems as if the Universality of things were in some measure to suffer by our dissolution, and that it did commiserate our condition. For as much as our deprav'd sight represents things to it self after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that we are of opinion they stand in as much need of us as we do of them; like Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at Sea, to whom Mountains, Fields, Cities, Heaven and Earth are toss'd at the same rate they are:

'Tis far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond not fearing Death, to taste and relish it. The Story of the Philosopher <hi>Cleanthes</hi> is very like this. He had his Gums swell'd and rotten; his <hi>Physicians</hi> advis'd him to great Abstinence: having fasted two days, he was so much better, that they pronounc'd him cur'd, and permitted him to his ordinary course of Diet: he, on the contrary, already tasting some sweetness in this Faintness of his, would not be persuaded to go back, but resolv'd to proceed, and to finish what he had so far advanc'd. <hi>Tullius Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Young-man of <hi>Rome,</hi> having a mind to anticipate the hour of his Destiny, to be rid of a Disease that was more trouble to him than he was willing to endure; though his <hi>Physicians</hi> assur'd him of a certain, tho not sudden Cure, call'd a Council of his Friends, to consult about it; of which, some, says <hi>Seneca,</hi> gave him the Counsel, that out of Unmanliness they would have taken themselves, others, out of Flattery, such as they thought he would best like: but a

I was fain to turn out an old Stallion into the Paddock, being he was vicious, and not to be govern'd when he smelt a Mare: the facility presently sated him, as towards his own, but towards strange Mares, and the first that past by the Pale of his Pasture, he would again fall to his importunate Neighings and his furious Heats, as before.

                     <p>To what use serves the artifice of this Virgin Modesty? this grave Coldness, this severe Countenance, this profession to be ignorant of things that they know better than we who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them in them, but to encrease in us the desire to overcome, controul, and trample under foot at pleasure, all this Ceremony, and all these Obstacles? For there is not only Pleasure, but moreover, Glory, to conquer and debauch that soft Sweetness, and that child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Modesty, and to reduce a cold and Matron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Gravity to the Mercy of our ardent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: 'Tis a glory, say they, to triumph over Modesty, Chastity, and Temperance; and whoever disswades Ladies from those Qualities, betray both them and themselves. They are to believe, That their Hearts tremble with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, that the very sound of our Words of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the purity of their Ears, that they hate us for talking so, and only yield to our Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity by a compulsive force. Beauty, as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as it is, has not wherewithal to make it self relish'd, without the Mediation of these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arts: look into <hi>Italy,</hi> where there is the most and the finest Beauty to be sold, how it is nevertheless necessitated to have recourse to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:53645:577" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other means and other artifices to render it self charming, and if in truth, whatever it may do being venal and publick, it does not remain fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and languishing in it self. Even as in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it self, of two like effects, we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing look upon that as the best and most worthy, wherein the most trouble and hazard is propos'd. 'Tis an effect of the divine <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to suffer the holy <hi>Church</hi> to be afflicted, as we see it, with so many Storms and Troubles, by this opposition to rouze pious Souls, and to awake them from that drowsie Lethargy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, by so long Tranquility, they had been immerg'd. If we should lay the loss we have sustain'd in the number of those who have gone astray, in the Ballance against the Benefit we have had by being again put in breath, and by having our Zeal and Forces exercis'd by reason of this Opposition; I know not whether the Utility would not surmount the Damage. We have thought to tye the Nuptial Knot of our Marriages more fast and firm, for having taken all means of dissolving it; but the Knot of the Will and Affection is so much the more slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made loose, by how much that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint is drawn closer together.

There is a certain Nation, where the Inclosures of Gardens and Fields they would preserve, is made only of a string of

                        <hi>Things seal'd up invite a Thief. House-breakers pass by open doors.</hi> Peradventure the facility of entring my House, amongst other things, has been a means to preserve it from the Violence of our Civil Wars. Defence allures Attempt, and Defiance provokes an Enemy. I enervated the Souldier's design, by depriving the Exploit of Danger, and all matter of Military Glory, which is wont to serve them for pretence and excuse. Whatever is bravely, is ever honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly done, at a time when Justice is dead. I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them the Conquest of my House cowardly and base; it is never shut to any one that knocks. My Gate has no other Guard than a Porter, and that of ancient Custom and Ceremony; who does not so much serve to defend it, as to offer it with more decency, and the better grace. I have no other <hi>Guard</hi> nor <hi>Centinel</hi> than the Stars. A Gentleman would play the Fool to make a shew of Defence, if he be not really in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend himself. He that lies open on one side, is every where so. Our Ancestors did not think of building frontier Garrisons. The means of assaulting, I mean without Battery, or Army, and of surprizing our Houses, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease every day above the means to guard them. Mens Wits are generally bent that way. Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion every one is concern'd in, none but the Rich in Defence. Mine was strong for the time when it was built, I have added nothing to it
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53645:579" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of that kind, and should fear that its strength should turn against my self; to which we are to consider, that a peaceable time would require it should be dismantled. There is danger never to be able to regain it, and it would be very hard to keep. For in intestine Dissentions your man may be of the Party you fear; and where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the Pretext, even a man's nearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations becomes unfaithful with a colour of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. The publick <hi>Exchequer</hi> will not maintain our domestick Garrisons; they would exhaust it. We our selves have not means to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ruine, or which is more inconvenient and injurious, without ruining the People. As to the rest, you there lose all, and even your Friends will be more ready to accuse your want of Vigilancy, and your Improvidence, than to lament you. That so many garrison'd Houses have been lost, whereas this of mine remains, makes me apt to believe, that they were only lost, by being guarded. This gives an Enemy both an Invitation and colour of reason. All defence shews a face of War. Let who will come to me in God's Name; but I shall not invite them. 'Tis the Retirement I have chosen for my repose from War. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to withdraw this corner from the publick Tempest, as I also do another corner in my Soul. Our War may put on what forms it will, multiply, and diversify it self into new Parties; for my part I shall not budge. Amongst so many garrison'd Houses, I am the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my Condition, that I know of, who
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53645:579" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have purely intrusted mine to the Protection of Heaven; without removing either Plate, Deeds, or Hangings. I will neither fear, nor save my self by halfs. If a full acknowledgment can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Divine Favour, it will stay with me to the end: if not, I have however continued long enough, to render my continuance remarkable and fit to be recorded. How? Why, I have liv'd thirty Years.</p>

within, our Essence being imperfect, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of Melioration, 'tis to that, that we ought to employ all our endeavour. We are all hollow and empty: 'tis not with wind and voice that we are to fill our selves; we want a more solid substance to repair us: a man starv'd with hunger, would be very simple to seek ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provide himself of a gay Garment, than a good Meal: we are to look after that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have most need. As we have it in our ordinary Prayers, <hi>Gloria in excelsis Deo, in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra pax hominibus.</hi>

And in truth, Experience makes us sensible of many very hurtful Treasons in it. There is nothing that so poisons <hi>Princes,</hi> as flattery, nor any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wicked men more easily obtain Credit and Favour with them: nor Pandarism so proper and usually made use of to corrupt the Chastity of Women, than to wheedle and entertain them with their own Prayers.

I say for it alone: for it often brings several commodities along with it, for which it may justly be desir'd: it acquires us good will, and renders us less subject and expos'd to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others, and the like. It was also one of the principal Doctrines of <hi>Epicurus</hi>; for this Precept of his <hi>Sect, Conceal thy Life,</hi> that forbids men to incumber themselves with Offices and publick Negotiations, does also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily presuppose a contempt of Glory, which is the worlds approbation of those actions we produce in publick. He that bids us conceal our selves, and to have no other Concern but for our selves, and that will not have us known to others, would much less have us honour'd and glorifi'd. He advises <hi>Idomeneus</hi> also, not in any sort to regulate his Actions by the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53645:581"/>
or opinion; if not to avoid the other accidental inconveniences that the contempt of men might bring upon him. Those Discourses are in my opinion very true and rational: but we are, I know not how, double in our selves, which is the cause that what we believe we do not believe, and cannot disengage our selves from what we condem. Let us see the last, and dying words of <hi>Epicurus</hi>; they are great, and worthy of such a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and yet they carry some marks of the recommendation of his name, and of that humour he had decried by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Here is a Letter that he dictated a little before his last gasp.</p>

But it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd with the Pleasure the remembrance of my Inventions and Doctrines suggested to my Soul. Now, as the affection thou hast ever from thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy borne towards me, and Philosophy does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, take upon thee the Protection of <hi>Metrodorus</hi> his Children.</p>

                     <p>This is the Letter. And that which makes me interpret that the Pleasure he says he had in his Soul, concerning his Inventions, has some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Reputation he hop'd for after his Death, is the manner of his Will. In which he gives order, that <hi>Aminomachus</hi> and <hi>Timocrates,</hi>
                        <pb n="461" facs="tcp:53645:581" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Heirs, should every <hi>January</hi> defray the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the Celebration of his Nativity, that <hi>Hermachus</hi> should appoint; and also the expence that should be made the twentieth of every Moon in entertaining of the Philosophers, his Friends, who should assemble in Honour of the Memory of him and <hi>Metrodorus. Carneades</hi> was <hi>Head</hi> of the contrary Opinion: and maintain'd that Glory was to be desir'd for it self, even as we embrace our <hi>Posthumes</hi> for themselves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Knowledge nor Enjoyment of them. This Opinion was more universally follow'd, as those commonly are that are most suitable to our Inclinations. <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives it the first place amongst eternal Goods: and avoids, as too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Vices, the immoderate either seeking or evading it. I believe that if we had the Books <hi>Cicero</hi> has writ upon this Subject, we should there find fine Stories, for he was so possess'd with this Passion, that if he had dar'd, I think he could willingly have fallen into the excess that others did, <hi>that Virtue it self was not to be coveted,</hi>

Which is an Opinion so false, that I am vext it could ever enter into the Understanding of a man that was honour'd with the name of a Philosopher. If this was true, Men should not be Virtuous
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53645:582" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but in publick, and he should be no further concern'd to keep the operation of the Soul, which is the true seat of Vertue, regular and in order, than as they are to arrive at the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of others. Is there no more in it then but only slily, and with Circumspection to do ill? <hi>If thou knowest,</hi> says <hi>Carneades, of a Serpent lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a place, where without suspicion, a Person is going to sit down, by whose Death thou expect'st an Advantage, thou dost ill, if thou dost not give him caution of his Danger; and so much the more because the Action is to be known by none but thy self.</hi> If we do not take up of our selves a rule of well doing, if Impunity passes with us for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to how many sorts of Wickedness shall we every day abandon our selves? I do not find what <hi>Sp. Peduceus</hi> did, in faithfully restoring the Treasure that <hi>C. Plotius</hi> had committed to his sole Secrecy and Trust; (a thing that I have often done my self) so commendable, as I should think it an execrable baseness had we done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And think it of good use in our dayes to introduce the Example of <hi>P. Sextilius Ruffus,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> accuses to have enter'd upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance contrary to his Conscience, not only not against Law, but even by the Determination of the Laws themselves. And <hi>M. Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Hortensius,</hi> who, by reason of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power, having been call'd in by a Stranger to share in the Succession of a forg'd Will, that so he might secure his own part; satisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with having no hand in the Forgery, and refus'd not to make their Advantage, and to
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53645:582" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come in for a share: secure enough if they could shrowd themselves from Accusations, Witnesses, and the Cognizance of the <hi>Laws. Meminerint Deum se habere testem,</hi>

Let them consider they have God to witness, that is (as I interpret it) their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi> Vertue is a very vain and frivolous thing, if it derives its recommendation from Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And 'tis to no purpose that we endeavour to give it a Station by it self, and separate it from Fortune; for what is more accidental than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? <hi>Profecto Fortuna, in omni re domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: ea res cunctas ex libidine,</hi>

                        <hi>magis quam ex vero celebrat, obscuratque. Fortune rules in all things, and does advance and depress things more out of her own Will, than Right and Justice.</hi> So to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it that Actions may be known and seen, is purely the work of Fortune; 'tis Chance that helps us to glory, according to its own temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I have often seen her go along with Merit, and often very much exceed it. He that first li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Glory to a shadow, did better than he was aware of. They are both of them things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently vain. Glory also, like a shadow, goes sometimes before the Body, and sometimes in length infinitely exceeds it.

                        <hi>quod nobilitatum non sit. As though it were not a Vertue unless ennobled.</hi> What do they intend by that, but to instruct them never to hazard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves if they are not seen, and to observe well, if there be Witnesses present, who may carry
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53645:583" rendition="simple:additions"/>
News of their Valour; whereas a thousand Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of well doing present themselves, when we cannot be taken notice of? How many brave Actions are buried in the crowd of a Battel? Whoever shall take upon him to censure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Behaviour in such a Confusion, is not very busie himself; and the Testimony he shall give of his Companions Deportments, will be Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against himself. <hi>Vera, &amp; sapiens Animi magnitudo honestum illud quod maxime naturam sequitur, in factis positum, non in Gloria judicat. The true and wise magnanimity judges, that the bravery which most follows Nature, more consists in Act than Glory.</hi> All the Glory that I pretend to derive from my Life, is that I have liv'd it in quiet. In quiet, not according to <hi>Metrodorus, Archesilans,</hi> or <hi>Aristippus,</hi> but according to my self; for seeing <hi>Philosophy</hi> has not been able to find out any way to tranquility that is good in common, let every one seek it in particular. To what do <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> owe the infinite grandeur of their Renown, but to Fortune? How many Men has she extinguish'd in the beginning of their Progress, of whom we have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; who brought as much Courage to the Work as they, if their adverse hap had not cut them off in the first sally of their Arms? Amongst so many and so great Dangers, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have any where read, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was ever wounded; a thousand have fallen in less Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, than the least of those he went through. A great many brave Actions must be expected to be perform'd without Witness, and so lost,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:53645:583" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before one turn to account. A man is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the top of a Breach, or at the head of an Army in the sight of his <hi>General,</hi> as upon a Scaffold. A man is oft surpris'd betwixt the Hedg and the Ditch, he must run the hazard of his Life against a <hi>Hen-roost,</hi> he must bolt four ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Musketeers out of a Barn, he must prick out single from his Party, and alone make some Attempts, according as Necessity will have it. And whoever will observe, will, I believe, find it experimentally true, that Occasions of the least Lustre, are ever the most dangerous: and that in the Wars of our own Times there have more brave Men been lost in Occasions of little moment, and in the dispute about some little paltery Fort, than in Places of greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and where their Valours might have been more honourably employ'd. Who thinks his Death unworthy of him, if he do not fall in some signal Occasions; instead of illustrating his Death, does willfully obscure his Life, suffering in the mean time many very just Occasions of hazarding himself to slip out of his Hands. And every just one is illustrious enough: every mans Conscience being a sufficient Trumpet to him. <hi>Gloria nostra est, Testimonium Conscientiae nostrae.</hi>

It should seem, that to be known, is in some sort to have a Man's Life and its duration in another's keeping. I for my part hold, that I am not but in my self, and of that other Life of mine which lies in the Knowledge of my Friends, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it naked and simply in it self, I know very well that I am sensible of no Fruit nor Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by the Vanity of a fantastick Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and when I shall be dead, I shall be much less sensible of it; and shall withall absolutely lose the use of those real Advantages that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accidentally follow it; I shall have no more handle whereby to take hold of Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; neither shall it have any whereby to take hold of, or to cleave to me.

But of this I have spoken elsewhere. As to what remains, in a great Battel where ten thousand Men are maim'd or kill'd, there are not fifteen that are taken notice of. It must be some very eminent greatness, or some consequence of great Importance, that Fortune has added to it, that must signalize a private Action, not of a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buser only, but of a great Captain; for to kill a man, or two, or ten, to expose a Mans self bravely to the utmost Peril of Death, is indeed something in every one of us, because we there hazard all; but for the Worlds concern, they are things so ordinary, and so many of them are every day seen, and there must of Necessity be so many of the same kind to produce any notable Effect, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect any particular Renown.</p>

                     <p>THere is another sort of Glory, which is the having too good an opinion of our own Worth. 'Tis an inconsiderate Affection,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53645:591" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with which we flatter our selves, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents us to our selves other than we truly are. Like the passion of Love, that lends beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and graces to the Person it does embrace; and that makes those who are caught with it, with a deprav'd and corrupt Judgement, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing they love, other and more perfect than it is. I would not nevertheless for fear of failing on the other side, that a man should not know himself aright, or think himself less than he is, the Judgement ought in all things to keep it self upright and just: 'tis all the reason in the world he should discern in himself, as well as in others, what Truth sets before him; if it be <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> let him boldly think himself the greatest Captain in the world. We are nothing but Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; Ceremony carries us away, and we leave the Substance of things: we hold by the Branches, and quit the Trunk. We have taught the Ladies to blush when they hear that but nam'd, that they are not at all afraid to do: we dare not call our members by their right names, and are not afraid to employ them in all sorts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches. Ceremony forbids us to express by words things that are lawful and natural, and we obey it: Reason forbids us to do things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and ill, and no body obeys it.

Such Motions as these may imperceptibly happen in us: there are other artificial ones which I meddle not with; as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations and Congees, by which Men for the most part unjustly acquire the Reputation of being humble and courteous; or perhaps, humble out of Pride. I am prodigal enough of my Hat, especially in Summer, and never am so saluted, but I pay it again, from Persons of what quality soever, unless they be in my own dependance. I should make it my Request to some Princes that I know, that they would be more sparing of that Ceremony, and bestow that Courtesie where it is more due; for being so indiscreetly and indifferently confer'd on all, they are thrown away to no purpose, if they be without respect of Persons, they lose their Effect. Amongst ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Countenances, let us not forget that severe one of the Emperour <hi>Constantius,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in publick held his Head upright and steady, without bending or turning on either side, not so much as to look upon those who sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him on one side, planting his Body in a stiff immoveable posture, without suffering it to yield to the Motion of his Coach; not daring so much as to spit, blow his Nose, or wipe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:53645:592" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Face before People. I know not whether the Gestures that were observ'd in me were of this first quality, and whether I had really any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret propension to this Vice, as it might well be; and I cannot be responsible for the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Body: but as to the Motions of the Soul, I must here confess that I am sensible of something of that kind there.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divided into two parts.</hi>
                        </note> This Glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of two parts, the one in setting too great a value upon our selves, and the other in setting too little a value upon others. As to the one, methinks these Considerations ought in the first place to be of some force. I feel my self impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd by an Errour of the Soul that displeases me, both as it is unjust, and as it is troublesome. I attempt to correct it, but I cannot root it out, which is, that I lessen the just value of things that I possess, and overvalue others, because they are foreign, absent, and none of mine. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour spreads very far. As the prerogative of the Authority which makes Husbands look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Wives with a vicious disdain, and many Fathers their Children, so do I: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two equal Merits should alwayes be sway'd against my own. Not so much that the jealousie of my Preferment, and the bettering of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs does trouble my Judgment, and hinders me from satisfying my self, as that Dominion of it self begets a Contempt of what is our own, and over which we have an absolute Command. Foreign Governments, Manners, and Languages, insinuate themselves into my esteem; and I am very sensible that <hi>Latin</hi> allures me by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:53645:593" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of it's Dignity, to value it above it's due, as it does Children, and the common sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>Oeconomy, House,</hi> and <hi>Horse</hi> of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though no better than my own, I prize above my own, because they are not mine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, I am very ignorant in my own Affairs; I am astonish'd at the assurance that every one has of himself: whereas there is not almost any thing that I am sure I know, or that I dare be responsible to my self that I can do: I have not my means of doing any thing stated and ready, and am only instructed after the effect, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my own force as I am of anothers; whence it comes to pass, that if I happen to do any thing commendable, I attribute it more to my Fortune than Industry: forasmuch as I design every thing by chance, and in fear. I have this also in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that of all the Opinions Antiquity has held of men in gross, I most willingly embrace, and most adhere to those that most contemn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue us. Methinks <hi>Philosophy</hi> has never so fair a Game to play as when it falls upon our Vanity and Presumption; when it most lays open their Irresolution, Weakness, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. I look upon the too good Opinion that Man has of himself to be the nursing Mother of all the most false, both publick and private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Those People, who ride astride upon the <hi>Epicicle</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who see so far into the Heavens, are worse to me than a Tooth-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that comes to draw my Teeth: for in my Study, the Subject of which is Man, finding so great a variety of Judgements, so great a
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53645:593" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Labyrinth of Difficulties one upon another, so great diversity and incertainty, even in the School of Wisdom it self, you may judge, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those People could not resolve upon the knowledge of themselves, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is continually before their Eyes, and within them, seeing they do not know how that moves which they themselves move, nor how to give us a Description of the Springs they themselves govern and make use of; how can I believe them about the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of <hi>Nile.</hi> The curiosity of knowing things, has been given to Man for a Scourge, says the holy Scripture. But to return to what concerns my self; I think it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, that any other should have a meaner Opinion of himself, nay, that any other should have a meaner Opinion of me than I have of my self. I look upon my self as one of the common sort, saving in this, that I have no better an Opinion of my self; guilty of the meanest and most popular defects, but not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd or excus'd; and do not value my self upon any other account than because I know my own value. If there be any Glory in the case, 'tis superficially infus'd into me by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of my Complexion, and has no Body that my Judgement can discern. I am sprinkled, but not tincted. For in Truth, as to the effects of the Mind, there is no part of me, be it what it will, with which I am satisfied: and the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of others makes me not think the better of my self; my Judgement is tender and tickle,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:53645:594" rendition="simple:additions"/>
especially in things that concern my self; I feel my self float and waver by reason of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. I have nothing of my own that satisfies my Judgment: my sight is clear and regular enough, but in opening it, it is apt to dazle; as I most manifestly find in Poesie. I love it infinitely, and am able to give a tolerable Judgment of other mens Works: but in good earnest, when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my self to it, I play the Child, and am not able to endure my self. A Man may play the fool in every thing else, but not in Poetry.</p>

Agility and address I never had; and yet am the Son of a very active and spritely Father, and that continued to be so to an extream old age. I have sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom known any man of his Condition, his equal in all bodily Exercises: as I have seldom met with any who have not excell'd me, except in running, at
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:53645:600" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which I was pretty good. In Musick or Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for which I have a very unfit Voice, or to play on any sort of Instrument, they could never teach me any thing. In Dancing, Tennis, or Wrestling, I could never arrive to more than an ordinary pitch; in Swimming, Fencing, Vaulting, and Leaping, to none at all. My Hands are so clumsie, that I cannot so much as write so as to read it my self, so that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do what I have scribled over again, than to take upon me the trouble to correct it, and do not read much better than I write. I cannot handsomely fold up a Letter, nor could ever make a Pen, or carve at Table worth a Pin, nor saddle a Horse, nor carry a Hawk and flye her, nor hunt the Dogs, nor lure a Hawk, nor speak to a Horse. In fine, my bodily Qualities are very well suited to those of my Soul, there is nothing spritely, only a full and firm Vigour. I am patient enough of Labour and Pains, but it is only when I go voluntary to the Work, and only so long as my own desire prompts me to it.</p>

I had only need of what was sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me: which nevertheless is a Government of Soul, to take it right, equally difficult in all sorts of Conditions, and that by Custom, we see more easily found in want than abundance: forasmuch, peradventure, as according to the course of others Passions, the desire of Riches is more sharp'ned by the use we make of them, than by the need we have of them: and the virtue of Moderation more rare than that of Patience. And never had any thing to desire, but happily to enjoy the Estate that <hi>God</hi> by his Bounty had put into my Hands: I have never known any thing of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and have had little to do in any thing but the management of my own Affairs: or, if I have, it has been upon Condition to do them at my own leisure, and after my own Method, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my trust by such as had a confidence in me, that did not importune me, and that knew my Humor.

I do not love to know what I have, that I may be less sensible of my Loss. I intreat those that serve me, where Affection and Integrity are wanting, to deceive me with something that may look tollerably handsome. For want of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy enough to support the shock of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Accidents, to which we are subject, and of patience seriously to apply my self to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of my Affairs; I nourish as much as I can this in my self, wholly leaving all to Fortune; to take all things at the worst, and to resolve to bear that worst with Temper and Patience. That is the only thing I aim at, and to which I apply my whole Meditation. In a Danger, I do not so much consider how I shall escape it, as of how little importance it is whether I escape it or no: should I be left dead upon the place, what matter? Not being able to govern Events, I govern my self,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:53645:602" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and apply my self to them, if they will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves to me. I have no great art to evade, escape from, or to force Fortune, and by Prudence to guide and incline things to my own Biass. I have the least Patience of all to undergo the troublesome and painfull Care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in requir'd; and the most uneasie condition for me is to be suspended in urgent Occasions, and to be agitated betwixt Hope and Fear. Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, even in things of lightest moment, is very troublesome to me; and I find my Mind more put to it to undergo the various tumbling and tossing of Doubt and Consultation, than to set up it's rest, and to acquiesce in what ever shall happen after the Die is thrown. Few Passions break my sleep, but of deliberations, the least will do it. As in Ways, I willingly avoid those that are sloping and slippery, and put my self into the beaten track how durty or deep soever, where I can fall no lower, and there seek my safety: so I love Misfortunes that are purely so, that do not torment and teaze me with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of their growing better; but that at the first push plunge me directly into the worst can be expected.

In Events, I carry my self like a Man, in the Conduct, like a Child. The fear of the Fall more astonishes me than the Fall it self. It will not
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:53645:602" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quit cost. The covetous Man has a worse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Passion than the poor, and the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Man than the Cuckold; and a man oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times loses more by defending his Vine-yard than if he gave it up. The lowest walk is the safest; 'tis the Seat of Constancy: you have there need of no one but your self, 'tis there founded, and wholly stands upon it's own Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. Has not this Example of a Gentleman very well known some air of <hi>Philosophy</hi> in it? He married, being well advanc'd in years, having spent his Youth in Good-fellowship, a great Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and a great Jeerer; calling to mind how much the subject of Cuckoldry had given him occasion to talk and scoff at others, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from paying him in his own coin, he married a Wife from a Place where any may have flesh for his money: <hi>Good morrow Whore, Good morrow Cuckold</hi>; and there was not any thing wherewith he more commonly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain'd those that came to see him than with this design of his, by which he stop'd the private muttering of Mockers, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from this Reproach. As to Ambition, which is Neighbour, or rather Daughter to Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fortune, to advance me, must have come and taken me by the hand; for to trouble my self for an uncertain Hope, and to have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my self to all the Difficulties that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny those who endeavour to bring themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Credit in the beginning of their progress, I could never have done it.</p>

And never was time or place wherein <hi>Princes</hi> might propose to themselves more certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for their Virtue and Justice. The first that shall make it his business to get himself into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and esteem by those ways, I am much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd if he do not, and by the best Title out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip his Concurrents.

They perform honourable Actions both in publick Engagements and private Quarrels, they fight Duels, and defend Towns in our present Wars. A Prince stifles his Renown in this crowd. Let him shine bright in Humanity, Truth, Loyalty, Temperance, and especially in Justice; marks rare, unknown, and exil'd; 'tis by no other means but by the sole good-will of the People that he can do his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and no other Qualities can attract their
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:53645:604" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good-will like those, as being of greatest Utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them. <hi>Nil est tam populare quÃ m bonitas.</hi>

                        <hi>Nothing is so popular as goodness.</hi> By this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion I had been great and rare, as I find my self now a Pigmee, and popular by the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some past Ages; wherein, if other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Qualities did not concur, it was ordinary and common to see a Man moderate in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges, gentle in resenting Injuries, in absence religious of his Word, neither double nor too supple, nor accomodating his Faith to the will of others, or the turns of Times: I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see all Affairs go to wrack and ruine than falsifie my Faith to secure them. For as to this Virtue of Dissimulation, which is now in so great request, I mortally hate it; and of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, find none that does evidence so much base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and meanness of Spirit. 'Tis a cowardly and servile Humour to hide and disguise a man's self under a Vizor, and not to dare to shew himself what he is. By that our followers are train'd up to Treachery. Being brought up to speak what is not true, they make no Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Lye. A generous Heart ought not to belye its own Thoughts, but will make it self seen within, all there is good, or at least manly: <hi>Aristotle</hi> reputes it the Office of Magnanimity, openly and profess'dly to love and hate, to judge and speak with all freedom; and not to value the approbation or dislike of others in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of <hi>Truth: Apollonius</hi> said, it was for Slaves to lye, and for Free-men to speak truth. 'Tis the chief and fundamental part of <hi>Vertue,</hi> we
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:53645:605" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must love it for it self. He that speaks truth, because he is oblig'd so to do, and because he serves; and that is not afraid to lye when it signifies nothing to any body, is not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true.<note place="margin">Lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd.</note> My Soul naturally abominates Lying, and hates the thought of it. I have an inward bashfulness, and a sharp remorse, if sometimes a Lye escape me, as sometimes it does, being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by Occasions that allow me no Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. A Man must not always tell all, for that were folly: but what a man says should be what he thinks, otherwise 'tis knavery. I do not know what advantage men pretend to by eternally counterfeiting and dissembling, if not, never to be believ'd when they speak the truth. This may once or twice pass upon men; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess concealing their Thoughts, and to brag, as some of our <hi>Princes</hi> have done, <hi>that they would burn their Shirts if they knew their true Intentions</hi>; which was a saying of the Ancient <hi>Metellus</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi>; and, <hi>that who knows not how to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, knows not how to Rule</hi>: is to give warning to all who have any thing to do with them, that all they say is nothing but Lying and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.<note place="margin">

By how much any one is more subtle and cunning, by so much is he hated and suspected, the Opinion of his Integrity being lost and gone.</hi> It were a great simplicity in any one to lay any stress either on the Countenance or word of a man, that has past on a Resolution to be always another thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out than he is within, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did; and I cannot
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:53645:605" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conceive what Interest such can have in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with men, seeing they produce nothing that is current and true. Whoever is disloyal to Truth, is the same to Falshood also. Those of our time, who have considered in the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the duty of a <hi>Prince,</hi> the good of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs only, and have preferr'd that to the care of his Faith and Conscience; might say something to a <hi>Prince</hi> whose Affairs <hi>Fortune</hi> had put into such a posture, that he might for ever Establish them by only once breaking his Word: but it will not go so, they often buy in the same Market, they make more than once Peace, and enter into more than one Treaty in their lives. Gain tempts them to the first breach of Faith, and almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways presents it self, as in all other ill Acts, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, Murthers, Rebellions, Treasons, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways undertaken for some kind of Advantage. But this first Gain has infinite mischievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences; throws this <hi>Prince</hi> out of all Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence and Negotiation, by this Example of Infidelity. <hi>Soliman,</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Race, a Race not very sollicitous of keeping their Words or Articles, when in my Infancy he made his Army land at <hi>Otranto,</hi> being inform'd that <hi>Mercurino de Gratinare,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Castro</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Prisoners, after having surrendred the Place, contrary to the Articles of their Capitulation, sent order to have them set at Liberty, saying, That having other great Enterprizes in hand in those Parts, the disloyalty, though it carried a shew of present Utility, would for the future bring on him a disrepute and diffidence of infinite prejudice.

Now, for my part, I had rather be troublesome and indiscreet, than a Flatterer and a Dissembler. I confess that there may be some mixture of Pride and Obstinacy in keeping my self so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and open as I do without any Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others; and methinks I am a little too free, where I ought least to be so, and that I grow hot by the opposition of Respect; and it may be also, that I suffer my self to follow the Propension of my own Nature for want of Art; using the same liberty of Speech and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards great Persons, that I bring with me from my own House: I am sensible how much it declines towards Incivility and Indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but besides that, I am so bred, I have not a Wit supple enough to evade a sudden Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to escape by some Evasion, nor to feign a Truth, nor Memory enough to retain it so feign'd; nor truly assurance enough to maintain it, and play the brave out of Weakness. And therefore it is that I abandon my self to Candor, always to speak as I think, both by Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Design, leaving the event to Fortune. <hi>Aristippus</hi> was wont to say, that the principal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he had extracted from <hi>Philosophy</hi> was, that he spoke freely and openly to all.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Memory ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useful to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                        </note> Memory is a faculty of wonderful use, and without which the Judgment can very hardly perform its Office: for my part I have none at all. What any one will propose to me, he must do it by parcels, for to answer a speech consisting of several heads, I am not able. I could not receive a Commission by word of mouth, without a Note-book: and when I have a
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:53645:606" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Speech of Consequence to make, if it be long, I am reduc'd to the miserable Necessity of getting it Word for Word what I am to say by Heart; I should otherwise have neither fashion nor assurance, being in fear that my Memory would play me a slippery trick. But this way is no less difficult to me than the other. I must have three hours to learn three Verses. And besides, in a Work of a man's own, the Liberty and Authority of altering the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of changing a Word, incessantly varying the matter, makes it harder to stick in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Author. The more I mistrust it, the worse it is, it serves me best by chance, I must negligently sollicit it, for if I press it, 'tis asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and after it once begins to stagger, the more I sound it, the more it is perplex'd; it serves me at it's own hour, not at mine. And the same defect I find in my Memory, I find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in several other Parts. I fly command, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and constraint. That which I can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise naturally and easily do; if I impose it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my self by an express and strict Injunction, I cannot do it. Even the members of my Body, over which a man has a more particular jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, sometimes refuse to obey me, if I enjoin them a necessary service at a certain hour. This tyrannical and compulsive Appointment baffles them, they shrink up either through fear or spite, and fall into a Trance. Being once in a Place where it is look'd upon as the greatest discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie imaginable not to pledge those who drink to you, though I had there all liberty allowed
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:53645:607" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me, I try'd to play the good Fellow, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Ladies that were there, according to the Custom of the Country; But there was sport enough, for this Threatning and Preparation, that I was to force my self contrary to my Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and Inclination, did so stop my Throat, that I could not swallow one drop, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of drinking so much as to my Meat. I found my self gorg'd, and my Thirst quench'd by so much Drink as my Imagination had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. This Effect is most manifest in such as have the most vehement and powerful Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but it is natural notwithstanding, and there is no one that does not in some measure find it. They offer'd an excellent <hi>Archer,</hi> condemn'd to dye, to save his Life, if he would shew some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table proof of his Art; but he refused to try, fearing lest the too great Contention of his Will should make him shoot wide, and that instead of saving his Life, he should also lose the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had got of being a good Marks-man. A Man that thinks of something else, will not fail to take over and over again the same number and measure of steps, even to an inch, in the place where he walks: but if he makes it his Business to measure and count them, he will find that what he did by Nature and Accident, he cannot so exactly do by Design. My <hi>Library,</hi> which is of the best sort of Country <hi>Libraries,</hi> is scituated in a corner of my House, if any thing comes into my Head that I have a Mind to look on or to write; lest I should forget it in but going cross the Court, I am fain to commit
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53645:607" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it to the Memory of some other. If I venture in speaking to digress never so little from my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I am infallibly lost, which is the reason that I keep my self in Discourse strictly close. I am forc'd to call the Men that serve me either by the Names of their Offices, or their Country; for Names are very hard for me to remember. I can tell indeed that there are three Syllables, that it has a harsh sound, and that it begins or ends with such a Letter, but that's all: and if I should live long,<note place="margin">Memory quite lost.</note> I do not think but I should forget my own Name, as some others have done. <hi>Messala Corvinus,</hi> was two years without any trace of Memory, which is also said of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Trapezuntius.</hi> For my own interest, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meditate what a kind of Life theirs was, and if, without this Faculty, I should have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough left to support me with any manner of ease, and prying narrowly into it, I fear that this Privation, if absolute, destroys all the other functions of the Soul.</p>

And how it comes to pass that a Man blind and asleep to every thing else, shall be found spritely, clear, and excellent in some one particular Effect, we are to enquire of our Masters: but the beautiful Souls are they that are Universal, Open, and Ready for all things, if not instructed, at least capable of being so. Which I say to accuse my own; for whether it be through Infirmity or Negligence, (and to neglect that which lies at our feet, which we have in our hands, and what nearest concerns the use of Life, is far from my Doctrine) there is not a Soul in the World so aukward as mine, and so ignorant of several vulgar things, and such as a man cannot without shame be ignorant of. I must give some Examples: I was born and
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:53645:609" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bred up in the Country, and amongst Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; I have had Business and Husbandry in my own Hands ever since my Predecessors, who were Lords of the Estate I now enjoy, left me to succeed them: and yet I can neither cast account, nor reckon my Counters: most of our current Money I do not know, nor the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Grain and another, either growing or in the Barn, if it be not too apparent; and scarcely can distinguish the Cabidge and Lettuce in my Garden. I do not so much as understand the Names of the chief Instruments of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, nor the most ordinary Elements of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,</hi> which the very Children know; much less the mechanick Arts, Traffick, Merchandize, the variety and Nature of Fruits, Wines and Vines: nor how to make a Hawk fly, nor to physick a Horse, or a Dog. And, since I must publish my whole shame, 'tis not above a Month ago, that I was trapt in my ignorance of the use of leaven to make Bread, or to what end it was to keep Wine in the Vat. They conjectur'd of old at <hi>Athens,</hi> an aptitude to the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> in him they saw ingeniously bavin up a Burthen of Brush-wood. In earnest, they would draw a quite contrary Conclusion from me, for give me the whole Provision and Necessaries of a Kitchin, I should starve. By these features of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession Men may imagin others to my Prejudice: but whatever I deliver my self to be, provided it be such as I really am, I have my end; neither will I make any excuse for committing to Paper such mean and frivolous things as these: the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:53645:609" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanness of the Subject compells me to it. They may if they please accuse my Project, but not my Progress. So it is, that without any bodies need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tell me, I sufficiently see of how little weight and value all this is, and the Folly of my Design. 'Tis enough that my Judgment does not contradict it self, of which these are the Essays.

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:53645:612" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Clothes cannot settle in any certain Form. It is very easie to accuse a Government of Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for all mortal things are full of it: it is very easie to beget in a People a contempt of Ancient Observances, never any man undertook it but he did it; but to establish a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in the stead of that a man has overthrown, many who have attempted that have been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in the attempt. I very little consult my Prudence in my Conduct; I am willing to let it be guided by the publick Rule. Happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who do what they are commanded better than they who command, without tormenting themselves with the causes, who suffer themselves gently to roul after the Coelestial Revolution. Obedience is never pure nor calm in him who argues and disputes. In fine, to return to my self; the only thing by which I esteem my self to be something, is, that wherein never any man thought himself to be defective; my recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is vulgar and common, for who ever thought he wanted Sense? It would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that would imply a Contradiction in it self, 'tis a Disease that never is where it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, 'tis tenacious and strong, but that the first ray of the Patients Sight does nevertheless pierce through and disperse as the Beams of the Sun do thick and obscure Mists. To accuse one's self would be to excuse in this case, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn to absolve. There never was Porter, or the silliest Girl, that did not think they had sense enough to do their business. We easily enough confess an advantage of Courage, Strength, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53645:612" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Activity and Beauty in others; but an Advantage in Judgment we yield to none, and the Reasons that simply proceed from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral arguing of others, we think, if we had but turn'd our Thoughts that way, we should our selves have found out as well as they. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Stile, and such Parts as we see in others works, we are soon aware of, if they excell our own: but for the simple Products of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, every one thinks he could have found out the like, and is hardly sensible of the weight and difficulty, if not, (and then with much ado) in an extream and incomparable distance. And whoever should be able clearly to discern the height of anothers Judgment, would be also able to raise his own to the same pitch. So that it is a sort of Exercise, from which a Man is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect very little Praise, a kind of Composition of small Repute. And besides, for whom do you write? The Learned, to whom the Authority appertains of judging Books, know no other value but that of Learning, and allow of no other proceeding of Wit, but that of Erudition and Art: if you have mistaken one of the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios</hi> for another, what is all the rest you have to say worth? Whoever is ignorant of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> according to their Rule, is in some sort igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of himself. Heavy, ill bred, and vulgar Souls, cannot discern the Grace of a delicate Stile. Now these two sorts of Men take up the World. The third sort, into whose hands you fall, of Souls that are regular and strong of themselves, is so rare, that it justly has neither
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:53645:613" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Name nor Place amongst us; and 'tis so much time lost to aspire unto it, or to endeavour to please it. 'Tis commonly said, that the justest divident <hi>Nature</hi> has given of her Favours, is that of Sense; for there is no one that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his share: is it not Reason? for whoever should discern beyond that, would see beyond his sight. I think my Opinions are good and sound, but who does not think the same of his? one of the best Proofs I have that mine are so, is the small esteem I have of my self; for had they not been very well assur'd, they would easily have suffer'd themselves to have been deceiv'd by the peculiar Affection I have to my self, as one that place it almost wholly in my self, and do not let much run by. All that others distribute amongst an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Friends and Acquaintance, to their Glory and Grandeur, I dedicate to the repose of my own mind and to my self. That which escapes thence is not properly by my direction.

for my part, I circulate in my self: and this free Humour of not over easily subjecting my Belief, I owe principally to my self; for the strongest and most general Imaginations I have, are those, that as a man may say, were born with me; they are natural and entirely my own.

As to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which consists in not having a sufficient esteem for others; I know not whether or no I can so well excuse my self; but whatever comes on't, I am resolv'd to speak the Truth. And whether peradventure it be, that the continual frequentation I have had with the Humors of the Antients, and the <hi>Idea</hi> of those great Souls of past Ages, put me out of taste both with others and my self; or that, in truth, the Age we live in does produce but very indifferent things; yet so it is, that I see nothing worthy of any great admiration. Neither indeed have I so great an intimacy with many Men, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to make a right Judgment of them: and those with whom my Condition makes me the most frequent, are, for the most part, Men that have little care of the culture of the Soul; but that look upon Honour as the sum of all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and Valour as the height of all Perfection. What I see that is handsome in others, I very readily commend, and highly esteem: nay, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten say more in their Commendation, than I think they really deserve, and give my self so far
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:53645:614" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leave to lye; for I cannot invent a false Subject. My Testimony is never wanting to my Friends in what I conceive deserves Praise: and where a foot is due, I am willing to give them a foot and a half; but to attribute to them Qualities that they have not, I cannot do it, nor openly defend their Imperfections. Nay, I frankly and ingeniously give my very Enemies their due Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Honour. My Affection alters, my Judgment does not; and I never confound my Animosity with other Circumstances that are foreign to it: and am so jealous of the libertyof my Judgment, that I can very hardly part with it for any Passion whatever. I do my self a greater injury in lying, than I do him of whom I tell a Lye. This commendable and generous Custom is observ'd of the <hi>Persian</hi> Nation,<note place="margin">

I know Men enough, that have several fine Parts; one Wit, another Courage, another Address, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conscience, another Language, one, one Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, another, another; but a generally great Man, and that has all these brave Parts together, or any one of them to such a degree of Excellence that we should admire him, or compare him with those we honour of times past, my Fortune ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought me acquainted with; and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est I ever knew, I mean for the natural parts of the Soul, was <hi>Stephen Boetius</hi>;<note place="margin">

<pb n="528" facs="tcp:53645:615" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had produc'd great Effects, had Fortune been so pleas'd: having added much to those great natural Parts by learning and study. But how it comes to pass I know not, and yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly so, there is as much vanity and weakness of Judgment in those who profess the greatest Abilities, who take upon them learned Callings, and bookish Employments, as in any other sort of Men whatever: either because more is requir'd and expected from them, and that common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are inexcusable in them; or because the Opinion they have of their own Learning makes them more bold to expose and lay themselves too open, by which they lose and betray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. As an Artificer more betrays his want of Skill in a rich Matter he has in hand, if he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Work by ill handling, and contrary to the Rules requir'd, than in a Matter of less value; and Men are more displeas'd at a Dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in a <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> than in one of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baster</hi>; so do these, when they exhibit things that in themselves and in their place would be good: for they make use of them without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, honouring their Memories at the expence of their Understandings, and making themselves ridiculous to honour <hi>Cicero, Galen, Vlpian</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> I willingly fall again into the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Vanity of our Education; the end of which is not to render us good and wise, but learned; and she has obtain'd it. She has not taught us to follow and embrace Virtue and Prudence, but she has imprinted in us their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation and Etymologie. We know how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:53645:615" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Virtue, we know not how to love it. If we do not know what Prudence is really, and in effect, and by Experience, we have it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by heart. We are not content to know the Extraction, Kindred and Alliances of our Neighbours, we will moreover have them our Friends, and will establish a Correspondency and Intelligence with them: but this Education of ours has taught us Definitions, Divisions, and Partitions of Vertue, as so many Surnames and Branches of a Genealogie, without any further care of establishing any Familiarity or Intimacy betwixt her and us. She has cull'd out for our initiary Instruction, not such Books as contain the soundest and truest Opinions, but those that speak the best <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>; and by these queint Words has instill'd into our Fancy the vainest Humours of Antiquity. A good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alters the Judgment and Manners; as it hapned to <hi>Polemon,</hi> a young lewd and debauch'd <hi>Greek,</hi> who going by chance to hear one of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> his Lectures, did not only observe the Eloquence and Learning of the Reader, and not only brought away the knowledge of some fine matter; but a more manifest and a more solid Profit, which was the sudden Change and Reformation of his former Life. Who ever found such an Effect of our Discipline?

well, that a Tradesman will scarce lift his Eyes from his work to look at an ordinary man, when they will forsake their Business and their Shops to stare at an eminent Person when he comes to Town: it misbecomes any other to give his own Character, but such a one who has Qualities worthy of imitation, and whose Life and Opinions may serve for Example. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> had whereon to found their Narrations in the greatness of their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as a just and solid Foundation.

And though no body should read me, have I lost my time in entertaining my self so many idle hours, in so pleasing and useful Thoughts? In moulding this Figure upon my self, I have been so oft constrain'd to temper and compose my self in a right posture, that the Copy is truly taken, and has in some sort form'd it self. But painting for others, I represent my self in a better colouring than my own natural Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion. I have no more made my Book than my Book has made me. 'Tis a Book consubstantial with the Author, of a peculiar Design: a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Life, and whose Business is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for others, as that of all other Books is. In giving my self so continual, and so exact an
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:53645:619" rendition="simple:additions"/>
account of my self, have I lost my time? For they who sometimes cursorily survey themselves only, do not so strictly examine themselves, nor penetrate so deep, as he who makes it his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, his Study, and his whole Employment, who intends a lasting Record, with all his Fidelity, and with all his Force. The most delicious Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures do so digest themselves within, that they avoid leaving any trace of themselves, and avoid the sight not only of the People, but of any particular Man. How oft has this Meditation diverted me from troublesome Thoughts? and all that are frivolous should be reputed so. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has presented us with a large faculty of entertaining our selves alone: and oft calls us to it, to teach us, that we owe our selves in part to Society, but chiefly and mostly to our selves.

imprint themselves better upon Paper, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most sensible Flesh. What if I listen to Books a little more attentively than ordinary, since I watch if I can purloin any thing that may adorn or support my own? I have not at all studied to make a Book; but I have in some sort studied because I had made it, if it be study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to scratch and pinch now one Author, and then another, either by the head or foot; not with any design to steal Opinions from them; but to assist, second, and fortifie those I already have embrac'd. But who shall we believe in the report he makes of himself in so corrupt an Age? considering there are so few, if any at all, whom we can believe, when speaking of others, where there is less interest to lye. The first thing that is done in order to the corruption of Manners, is banishing of Truth; for, as <hi>Pindar</hi> says, to be sincerely true, is the beginning of a great Virtue, and the first Article that <hi>Plato</hi> requires in the Governour of his <hi>Republick.</hi> The truth of these dayes is not that which really is, but what every man persuades himself, or that he is made to believe; as we generally give the name of Money, not only to pieces of the just alloy, but even to the false also, if they are current, and will pass. Our Nation has long been reproach'd with this Vice; for <hi>Salvianus Massiliensis,</hi> who liv'd in the time of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> sayes, that lying and forswearing themselves is not a Vice in the <hi>French,</hi> but a way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He that would enhaunce upon this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, might say, that it is now a Virtue in
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:53645:620" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them. Men form and fashion themselves to it, as to an Excercise of Honour; for Dissimulation is one of the most notable Qualities of this Age. I have often consider'd whence this Custom that we so religiously observe should spring, of being more highly offended with the reproach of a Vice so familiar to us than any other, and that it should be the highest injury can in Words be done us, to reproach us with a Lye; and upon Examination, find, that it is natural to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the part that is most open, and lies expos'd to the greatest Danger. It seems as if by resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being mov'd at the Accusation, we in some sort acquitted our selves of the Fault; though we confess it in Effect, we condemn it in outward appearance. May it not also be, that this reproach seems to imply Cowardize and meanness of Courage? of which, can there be a more manifest sign, than to eat a Man's own Words? What, to lye against a Man's own Knowledge? Lying is a base unworthy Vice; a Vice that one of the Ancients pourtrays in the most odious colours, when he says, <hi>that it is to manifest a contempt of God,</hi>

and Wills; 'tis the Interpreter of the Soul, and if that deceive us, we no longer know, nor have no farther tye upon one another. If that deceive us, it breaks all our Correspondence, and dissolves all the tyes of Government. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Nations of the new discover'd <hi>Indies</hi> (no matter for naming them, being they are no more; for by a wonderful and unheard of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Desolation of that Conquest has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the utter abolition of Names, and the ancient knowledge of Places) offer'd to their <hi>Gods</hi> Humane Blood, but only such as was drawn from the Tongue and Ears, to expiate for the Sin of Lying, as well heard as pronounc'd. The good Fellow of <hi>Greece</hi> was wont to say, that Children were amus'd with Toyes, and Men with Words. As to the diverse usage of our gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lye, and the Laws of Honour in that Case, and the alterations they have receiv'd, I shall refer saying what I know of them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and shall learn, if I can, in the mean time, at what time the Custom took beginning of so exactly weighing and measuring Words, and of making our Honours so interested in them; for it is easie to judge, that it was not ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; and I have often thought it strange to see them rail at, and give one another the Lye without any farther Quarrel. Their <hi>Laws</hi> of Duty steer'd some other course than ours. <hi>Caesar</hi> is sometimes call'd <hi>Thief,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Drunkard</hi> to his Teeth.

                        </note> and moreover inconsiderate and rash.

to <hi>Letters,</hi> than all the Flames of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Of this <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> is a very good Testimony; for though the Emperour <hi>Tacitus,</hi> his Kinsman, had by express Order furnish'd all the Libraries in the World with it, nevertheless one entire Copy could not escape the curious examination of those who desir'd to abolish it, for only five or six idle Clauses that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our belief. They had also the trick ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to lend undue Praises to all the <hi>Emperours</hi> who did any thing for us, and universally to condemn all the Actions of those who were our Adversaries, as is evidently manifest in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Julian,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Apostate</hi>; who was in truth a very great and a rare Man,<note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</hi>

In <hi>Chastity,</hi> (of which the whole course of his Life has given manifest Proof) we read the same of him,<note place="margin">His Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that was said of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> that being in the Flower of his age, for he was slain by the <hi>Parthians</hi> at one and thirty, of a great many very beautiful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he would not so much as look upon one. As to his Justice, he took himself the Pains to hear the Parties, and although he would out of Curiosity enquire what <hi>Religion</hi> they were of, nevertheless the hatred he had to ours, never gave any counterpoise to the Balance. He made himself several good Laws, and cut off a great part of the Subsidies and Taxes impos'd and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:53645:622" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by his Predecessors. We have two good Historians who were eye Witnesses of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: one of which, <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> in several Places of his History, sharply reproves an <hi>Edict</hi> of his whereby he interdicted all Christian Rhetoricians and Grammarians to keep School, or to teach, and says he could wish that Act of his had been buried in Silence. It is very likely, that had he done any more severe things against us, he, so affectionate as he was to our party, would not have pass'd it over in silence. He was indeed sharp against us; but yet no cruel Enemy: for our own People tell this Story of him, that one day, walking about the City of <hi>Chalcedon, Maris,</hi> Bishop of the Place, was so bold as to tell him that he was impious, and an Enemy to <hi>Christ,</hi> at which, say they, therein affecting a philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Patience, he was no further mov'd, than to reply, <hi>Go Wretch, and lament the loss of thy Eyes,</hi> to which the <hi>Bishop</hi> reply'd again, <hi>I thank Jesus Christ for taking away my sight, that I may not see thy impudent Face.</hi> So it is, that this Action of his savours nothing of the Cruelty that he is said to have exercis'd towards us. <hi>He was</hi> (says <hi>Eutropius,</hi> my other Witness) <hi>an Enemy to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, but without putting his Hand to Blood.</hi> And to return to his Justice,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> there is nothing in that whereof he can be accus'd, the severity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted he practis'd in the beginning of his Reign, against those who had follow'd the Party of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi> his Predecessor. As to his Sobriety, he liv'd always a Souldier's kind of Life;<note place="margin">His Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</note> and kept a Table in the most profound Peace, like one that prepar'd
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:53645:622" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and inur'd himself to the austerities of War. His Vigilancy was such,<note place="margin">His Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy.</note> that he divided the Night into three or four parts, of which, always the least was dedicated to sleep, the rest was spent either in visiting the estate of his Army and Guards, in Person, or in Study; for, amongst other rare Qualities, he was very excellent in all sorts of Learning. 'Tis said of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that being in Bed, for fear lest sleep should divert him from his Thoughts and Studies, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Bason set by his Bed-side, and held one of his hands out with a Ball of Copper in it, to the end, that beginning to fall asleep, and his Fingers leaving their hold, the Ball by falling into the Bason might awake him. But the other had his mind so bent upon what he had a mind to do, and so little disturb'd with Fumes, by reason of his singular Abstinence, that he had no need of any such Invention.<note place="margin">His Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> As to his Military Experience, he was excellent in all the Qualities of a great Captain, as it was likely he should, being almost all his Life in a continual exercise of War, and most of that time with us in <hi>France,</hi> against the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Franes</hi>: We hardly read of any Man that ever saw more Dangers, or that made more frequent Proofs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Valour. His Death has something in it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with that of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> for he was wounded with an Arrow, and try'd to pull it out, and had done it, but that being edg'd, it cut and disabled his Hand. He incessantly call'd out, that they would carry him again in this condition into the heat of the Battel to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:53645:623" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Souldiers, who very bravely disputed the Battel without him, till Night parted the Armies. We stood oblig'd to his <hi>Philosophy</hi> for the singular contempt he had for his Life, and all Humane things. He had a firm Belief of the immortality of the Soul. In matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> he was vicious throughout, and was surnam'd the <hi>Apostate,</hi> for having relinquish'd ours: though methinks, 'tis more likely that he had never throughly embrac'd it, but had dissembled out of obedience to the Laws, till he came to the Empire. He was in his own so superstitious, that that he was laught at for it by those of the same Opinion of his own time, who jeeringly said, that had he got the Victory over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he had destroy'd the breed of Oxen in the World to supply his Sacrifices: He was more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over besotted with the Art of Divination, and gave Authority to all sorts of Predictions. He said, amongst other things, at his Death, that he was oblig'd to the <hi>Gods,</hi> and thank'd them, in that they would not cut him off by Surprize, having long before advertis'd him of the Place and Hour of his Death, nor by a mean and unmanly Death, more becomming lazy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate People, nor by a Death that was langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, long, and painful; and that they had thought him worthy to Dye after that noble manner, in the progress of his Victories, in the flower of his Age, and in the height of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makable Death of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Julian.</hi>
                        </note> He had a Vision like that of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> that first threatned him in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and afterward appear'd to him in <hi>Persia</hi> just before his Death.

These Words, that some make him say when he felt himself wounded, <hi>Thou hast overcome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaren</hi>; or as others, <hi>Content thy self Nazaren</hi>; would hardly have been omitted, had they been believ'd by my Witnesses, who being present in the <hi>Army,</hi> have set down to the least motions and words of his end, no more than certain other Miracles that are recorded of him. And to return to my Subject, he long nourish'd, says <hi>Marcellinus, Paganism</hi> in his Heart; but all his Army being <hi>Christians,</hi> he durst not own it. But in the end, seeing himself strong enough to dare to discover himself, he caus'd the Temples of the <hi>Gods</hi> to be thrown open, and did his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to set on foot and to encourage Idolatry: Which the better to effect, having at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> found the People disunited, and also the Prelates of the Church divided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, having conven'd them all before him, he gravely and earnestly admonish'd them to calm those civil Dissentions, and that every one might freely, and without fear follow his own <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Which he did the more sedulously sollicit, in hope that this Licence would augment the <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> of their Division, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the People from reuniting, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortifying themselves against him by their unanimous Intelligence and Concord; having experimented by the cruelty of some <hi>Christians,</hi> that there is no Beast in the World so much to be fear'd by Man, as Man. These are very near his Words, wherein this is very worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that the Emperor <hi>Julian</hi> made use
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:53645:624" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the same <hi>Receipt</hi> of Liberty of Conscience to inflame the civil Dissentions, that our Kings do to extinguish them. So that a man may say on one side, that to give the People the Reins to entertain every man his own Opinion,<note place="margin">Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> is to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sow Division, and, as it were, to lend a hand to augment it, their being no fence nor correction of Law to stop and hinder their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer; but on the other side, a Man may also say, that to give the People the Reins to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain every Man his own Opinion, is to mollifie and appease them by Facility and Toleration, and dull the point which is whetted and made sharper by variety, novelty, and difficulty. And I think it is better for the Honour of the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Kings,</hi> that not having been able to do what they would, they have made a shew of being willing to do what they could.</p>

                        <hi>must dye standing.</hi> A fine saying in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and worthy a great <hi>Prince.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> since made use of the same Words, and Kings should be often put in mind of it, to make them know, that the great Office con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon them of the command of so many men, is not an Employment of ease; and that there is nothing can so justly disgust a Subject, and make him unwilling to expose himself to Labour and Danger for the Service of his <hi>Prince,</hi> than to see him in the mean time devoted to his Ease and unmanly Delights: and to be sollicitous of his Preservation, who so much neglects that of his People. Whoever will take upon him to maintain, that 'tis better for a <hi>Prince</hi> to carry on his Wars by others, than in his own Person; Fortune will furnish him with Examples enough of those whose <hi>Lieutenants</hi> have brought great Enterprizes to a happy Issue, and of those also whose Presence has done more hurt than good. But no virtuous and valiant <hi>Prince,</hi> can with Patience endure so dishonourable Councils, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of saving his Head, like the Statue of a Saint, for the Happiness of his Kingdom; they degrade him from, and declare him incapable of his Office, which is Military throughout. I know one who had much rather be beaten, than to sleep whilst another fights for him; and who never without jealousie heard of any brave thing done even by his own Officers in his Absence. And <hi>Selimus</hi> said, with very good Reason, in my Opinion, <hi>That Victories obtain'd without the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, were never compleat.</hi> Much more would he
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53645:627" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have said, that that Master ought to blush for shame, to pretend to any share in the Honour, having contributed nothing to the work, but his Voice and thought; nor even so much as those, considering that in such work as that, the Direction and Command that deserve Honour are only such as are given upon the place, and in the heat of the Business. No <hi>Pilot</hi> performs his Office by standing still. The <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, the chiefest in the World in Military Fortune, have warmly embrac'd this Opinion, and <hi>Bajazet</hi> the second, with his Son that swerv'd from it, spending their time in Sciences and other retir'd Employments, gave great blows to their Empire: and <hi>Amurath</hi> the third, now reigning, following their Example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to find the same. Was it not <hi>Edward</hi> the Third King of <hi>England,</hi> who said this of our <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth? <hi>There never was King who so seldom put on his Arms, and yet never King who cut me out so much Work.</hi> He had reason to think it strange, as an effect of Chance more than of Reason. And let those seek out some other to joyn with them than me, who will reckon the Kings of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> amongst the warlike and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conquerors, because at the distance of twelve hundred Leagues from their lasie abode, by the Conduct of their <hi>Captains,</hi> they made themselves Masters of both <hi>Indies</hi>; of whom it would be known, if they have but the Courage to go and in Person enjoy them. The Emperour <hi>Julian</hi> said yet further, that a Philosopher, and a brave man, ought not so much as to breathe;

that is to say, not to allow any more to bodily Necessities, than what we cannot refuse; keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul and Body still intent and busie about honourable, great, and virtuous things: he was asham'd if any one in publick saw him spit, or sweat, (which is said by some also of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> young men, and that <hi>Xenophon</hi> says of the <hi>Persian</hi>) forasmuch as he conceiv'd that Exercise, continual Labour, and Sobriety, ought to have dried up all those Superfluities. What <hi>Seneca</hi> says will not be unfit for this Place; which is, that the antient <hi>Romans</hi> kept their Youth always standing, and taught them nothing that they were to learn sitting. 'Tis a generous desire to wish to dye usefully, and like a Man, but the Effect lies not so much in our Resolution as good Fortune. A thousand have propos'd to themselves in Battel, either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or dye, who have fail'd both in the one and the other: Wounds and Imprisonment cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Design, and compelling them to live against their Wills. There are Diseases that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw so much as our Desires, and our Knowledge. Fortune ought not to second the Vanity of the <hi>Roman Legions,</hi> who bound themselves by Oath, either to overcome<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or dye. <hi>Victor, Marce Fabi, revertar ex acie: si fallo, Jovem patrem Gradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vumque Martem, aliosque iratos invoco Deos. I will return</hi> (Marcus Fabius) <hi>a Conquerour from the Army: and if I fail, I wish the Indignation of</hi> Jove, Mars, <hi>and the other offended Gods, may light upon me.</hi> The <hi>Portuguese</hi> say, that in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Place of their Conquest of the <hi>Indies,</hi> they
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53645:628"/>
met with Souldiers who had damn'd themselves with horrible Execrations, to enter into no other Composition, but either to cause themselves to be slain, or to remain Victorious; and had their Heads and Beards shav'd in token of this Vow. 'Tis to much purpose for us to hazard our selves, and to be obstinate. It seems as if blows avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those that present themselves too briskly to Danger; and do not willingly fall upon those who too willingly seek them, and so defeat them of their Design. Such there have been, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving try'd all ways, not having been able with all their Endeavour to obtain the Favour of dying by the hand of the Enemy, have been constrain'd to make good their Resolution of bringing home the Honour of Victory, or of losing their Lives, to kill themselves even in the heat of Battel. Of which there are other Examples, but this is one. <hi>Philistus,</hi> General of the naval Army of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the younger against those of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> presented them Battel, which was sharply disputed, their Forces being equal. In which Engagement he had the better at the first, through his own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: but the <hi>Syracusans</hi> drawing about his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Gally</hi> to environ him, after having done great things in his own Person to disengage himself, hoping for no relief, with his own hand took away that Life he had so liberally, and in vain, expos'd to the Fury of the Enemy. <hi>Muley Moluck</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> who won the Battel against <hi>Sebastian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> so famous for the Death of three Kings, and by the transmission of that great Kingdom to the Crown of <hi>Castile</hi>;
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:53645:629"/>
was extreamly sick when the <hi>Portuguese</hi> enter'd in an hostile manner into his Dominions; and from that day forward grew worse and worse, still drawing nearer to, and foreseeing his end: Yet never did man better employ his own suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency more vigorously and bravely than he did upon this Occasion. He found himself too weak to undergo the Pomp and Ceremony of entring into his Camp, which after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is very Magnificent, and therefore resign'd that Honour to his Brother; but that was also all of the Office of a <hi>General</hi> that he resign'd, all the rest of greatest Utility and Necessity he most exactly and gloriously performed in his own Person; his body lying upon a Couch, but his Judgment and Courage upright and firm to his last gasp, and in some sort beyond it. He might have defeated his Enemy, indiscreetly advanc'd into his Dominions without striking a Blow; and it was a very unhappy Occurrence, that for want of a little Life or some body to substitute in the Conduct of this War, and the Affairs of a troubled State, he was compell'd to seek a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bloody Victory, having another by a better and surer way already in his hands. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he wonderfully manag'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his Sickness in consuming the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and in drawing them far from the assistance of the Naval Army they had in the Ports of <hi>Affrick,</hi> even till the last day of his Life, which he designedly reserv'd for this furious Battel. He order'd his Battel in a circular Form, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronning the <hi>Portugal</hi> Army on every side, which
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53645:629"/>
round comming to close in the Wings, and to draw up close together, did not only hinder them in the Conflict (which was very sharp through the Valour of the young invading King) considering they were every way to make a Front, but prevented their Flight after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, so that finding all Passages possest and shut up by the Enemy, they were constrain'd to close up together again; <hi>coacervanturque non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum caede, sed etiam fuga,</hi> and there they were slain in heaps upon one another, leaving to the Conquerour a very bloody and entire Victory. Dying, he caus'd himself to be carried and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from place to place where most need was, and passing through the Files, encouraged the Captains and Souldiers one after another. But a corner of his Battel being broken, he was not to be held from mounting on Horseback with his Sword in his hand. He did his utmost to break from those about him, and to rush into the thickest of the Battel, they all the while withholding him, some by the Bridle, some by his Robe, and others by his Stirrups. This last Effort totally overwhelm'd the little Life he had left, they again lay him upon his Bed; but comming to himself again, and starting out of his Swoon, all other faculties failing, to give his People notice that they were to conceal his Death (the most necessary command he had then to give, that his Souldiers might not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd with the news) he expos'd with his Finger upon his Mouth the ordinary sign of keeping silence. Who ever liv'd so long and
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:53645:630" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so far in Death? whoever died more like a Man? The most extream degree of entertaining Death, and the most natural, is to look upon it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without astonishment but without care, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the wonted course of Life even into it. As <hi>Cato</hi> did, who entertain'd himself in study, and went to sleep, having a violent and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy one in his Heart, and the Weapon in his hand, with which he was resolved to dispatch himself.</p>

but also to serve for a Blood-letting to their <hi>Republick,</hi> and a little to evaporate the too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement heat of their Youth, to prune and cleanse the Branches from the Stock too luxuriant in Wood; and to this end it was, that they formerly maintain'd so long a War with <hi>Carthage.</hi> In the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Bretigny, Edward</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> would not, in the general Peace he then made with our <hi>King,</hi> comprehend the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about the Dutchy of <hi>Brittany,</hi> that he might have a Place wherein to discharge himself of his Souldiers, and that the vast number of <hi>English</hi> he had brought over to serve him in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, might not return back into <hi>England.</hi> And this also was one reason why our King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> consented to send his Son <hi>John</hi> that Foreign Expedition, that he might take along with him a great number of hot Young-men that were then in his Pay.

                        <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> said, that the Grandeur of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> was not so much seen in what they took, as in what they gave.

I think I have read somewhere in <hi>Appian</hi> a story like this, of one who to escape the Proscriptions of the <hi>Triumviri</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the better to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from the discovery of those who pursued him, having shaded himself in a Disguise, would yet add this Invention to counterfeit having but one Eye; but when he came to have a little more
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:53645:636" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liberty, and went to take off the Plaister he had a great while worn over his Eye, he found he had totally lost the Sight of it indeed, and that it was absolutely gone. 'Tis possible that the Action of Sight was dull'd, for having been so long without exercise, and that the Optick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was wholly retir'd into the other Eye: For we evidently perceive, that the Eye we keep shut, sends some part of its vertue to its fellow, so that the remaining Eye will swell and grow bigger; as also Idleness, with the heat of Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Plaisters, might very well have brought some gouty Humour upon this dissembler of <hi>Martial.</hi> Reading in <hi>Froisard</hi> the Vow of a Troop of young <hi>English Gallants,</hi> to carry their left Eyes bound up till they were arriv'd in <hi>France,</hi> and had perform'd some notable Exploit upon us; I have oft been tickled with the conceit of it, in befalling them as it did the before named <hi>Roman,</hi> and that they had return'd with but an Eye a piece to their Mistrisses, for whose sakes they had entred into this ridiculous Vow. Mothers have reason to rebuke their Children when they counterfeit having but one Eye, Squinting, Lameness, or any other Personal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for besides that their Bodies being then so tender may be subject to take an ill bent, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I know not how, sometimes seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in taking us at our word; and I have heard several Examples related of People who have become really sick, by only feigning to be so. I have always us'd, whether on Horseback, or on foot, to carry a stick in my hand, and so
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:53645:636" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to affect doing it with a Grace. Many have threat'ned that this wantonness would one day be turn'd into necessity, that is, that I should be the first of my Family that should have the Gout. But let us a little lengthen this Chapter, and eech it with a piece of another colour, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Blindness. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of one, that once dreaming he was Blind, finding himself in the Morning so indeed, without any preceding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity in his Eyes. The force of Imagination might assist in this Case, as I have said elsewhere, and <hi>Pliny</hi> seems to be of the same Opinion; but it is more likely that the motions which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy felt within (of which <hi>Physicians</hi> if they please may find out the cause,) which took away his Sight, were the occasions of his Dream. Let us add another story, not very improper for this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which <hi>Seneca</hi> relates in one of his Epistles. <hi>You know,</hi> says he, writing to <hi>Lucullus, that</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, <hi>my Wives Fool, is thrown upon me as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary charge, for I have naturally an aversion to those Monsters; and if I have a mind to laugh at a Fool, I need not seek him far, I can laugh at my self. This Fool has suddenly lost her sight. I tell you a strange, but a very true thing; she is not sensible that she is blind, but eternally importunes her keeper to take her abroad, because she says the House is dark: I pray believe, that what we laugh at in her, happens to every one of us: no one knows himself to be avaricious. Besides, the blind call for a Guide, but we stray of our own accord.

Let us not seek our Disease out of our selves, 'tis in us, and planted in our Bowels. And even this, that we do not perceive our selves to be sick, renders us more hard to be cur'd. If we do not betimes begin to dress our selves, when shall we have done with so many Wounds and Evils wherewith we abound? And yet we have a most sweet and charming Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of Philosophy; for of all the rest we are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of no Pleasure till after the Cure: this pleases and heals at once.</hi> This is what <hi>Seneca</hi> says, that has carried me from my Subject, but there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the change.</p>

Like cowardly House-curs, that in the House worry and tear the Skins of wild Beasts they durst not come near in the Field. What is it in these times of ours that causes our mortal quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels? And that whereas our Fathers had some degree of revenge in their dayes, we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the last in ours, and that at the first meeting nothing is to be said but kill? What is this but Cowardize? Every one is sensible, that there is more bravery and disdain in subduing an Enemy, than in cutting his Throat; and in making him yield, than in putting him to the Sword: besides that, the appetite of Revenge is better satisfied and pleas'd because it's only aim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>s to make it self felt. And this is the reason why
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:53645:639" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we do not fall upon a Beast or a Stone when they hurt us, because they are not capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sensible of our Revenge; and therefore to kill a man, is to defend him from the Injury and Offence we intend him. And as <hi>Bias</hi> cry'd out to a wicked Fellow, <hi>I know that sooner or later thou wilt have thy Reward, but I am afraid I shall not see it.</hi> And as the <hi>Orchomenians</hi> complain'd, that the Penitence of <hi>Lyciscus</hi> for the Treason committed against them, came in season, because there was no one remaining alive of those who had been interested in the Offence, and whom the Pleasure of this Penitency should affect: so Revenge is to be repented of, when the Person on whom it is executed is depriv'd of means of suffering under it: for as the Avenger will look on to enjoy the Pleasure of his Revenge, so the Person on whom he takes Revenge, should be a Spectator too, to be afflicted, and to repent. He will repent it, we say, and because we have given him a Pistol-shot through the Head, do we imagine he will repent? On the contrary, if we but observe, we shall find, that he makes a Mouth at us in falling: and is so far from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, that he does not so much as repine at us. And we do him the kindest Office of Life, which is to make him die insensibly, and soon. We are afterwards to hide our selves, and to shift and flye from the <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> who pursue us whilst he is at rest. Killing is good to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate an Offence to come, not to revenge one that is already past: and more an Act of Fear than Bravery; of Precaution, than Courage, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:53645:639" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Defence than of attempt. It is manifest that by it we quit both the true end of Revenge, and the care of our Reputation; we are afraid if he lives he will do us another injury as great as the first; 'tis not out of Animosity to him, but care of thy self, that thou rid'st him out of the way.<note place="margin">Duels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Kingdom of <hi>Narsin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua.</hi>
                        </note> In the Kingdom of <hi>Narsingua</hi> this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient would be useless to us, where not only Souldiers, but Trades-men also end their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences by the Sword.

If we thought by Vertue to be always Masters of our Enemies, and to triumph over them at pleasure, we should be sorry they should escape from us as they do, by dying: but we have a mind to conquer more with Safety than Honour, and in our quarrel, more pursue the end than the Glory. <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> who,<note place="margin">

And it was also said in his behalf, that it was only for <hi>Hobgoblins</hi> to wrestle with the dead. He that stays to see the Author dye, whose Writings he
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:53645:640" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And that this is so, does not our noble practice of these days, equally to prosecute to death both him that has offended us, and him we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, make it out? 'Tis also a kind of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize that has introduc'd the custom of having seconds, thirds, and fourths in our Duels.

<pb n="579" facs="tcp:53645:640" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to a brave man, and who wholly relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, to shuffle his Fortune with that of a Second; since every one runs hazard enough in himself, without hazarding for another, and has enough to do to assure himself in his own Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for the defence of his Life, without intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing so dear in a third man's hand. For, if it be not expresly agreed upon before to the contrary, 'tis a combin'd Party of all four, and if your Second be kill'd, you have two to deal withal with good reason. And to say that it is foul play, it is so indeed, as it is well arm'd to charge a man that has but the hilts of a broken Sword in his hand, or clear and untouch'd a man that is desperately wounded: but if these be advantages you have got by fighting, you may make use of them without reproach: the disparity and inequality is only weigh'd and consider'd from the condition of the Combatants when they begun, as to the rest, you must take your Fortune: and though you had alone three Enemies upon you at once, your two Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being kill'd, you have no more wrong done you, than I should do in a Battel, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a man through I should see engag'd with one of our own men with the like advantage. The nature of Society will have it so, that where there is Troop against Troop (as where our Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> challeng'd <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an hundred against an hundred: three hundred against as many as the <hi>Argians</hi> against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and three to three, as the <hi>Horatii</hi> against the <hi>Curiatii</hi>) the multitude on

either side is consider'd but as one single man, the hazard every where, where there is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, being confus'd and mix'd. I have a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Interest in this Discourse; for my Brother, the Sieur <hi>de Matecoulom,</hi> was at <hi>Rome</hi> entreated by a Gentleman with whom he had no great acquaintance, and who was Defendant, and challeng'd by another, to be his Second; In this Duel he found himself match'd with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man much better known to him, where, after having dispatch'd his man, seeing the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal still on foot, and sound, he ran in to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage his Friend. What could he do less? should he have stood still, and if Chance would have order'd it so, have seen him he was come thither to defend kill'd before his face, what he had thither done signified nothing to the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, the Quarrel was yet undecided. The courtesie that you can, and certainly ought to shew to your Enemy, when you have reduc'd him to an ill Condition, and have a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over him, I do not see how you can do it, where the Interest of another is in the case, where you are only call'd in as an Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and the Quarrel is none of yours. He could neither be just nor courteous at the hazard of him he was there to serve; and was also inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Prisons of <hi>Italy</hi> at the speedy and solemn request of our King.

I know Fencing is an Art very useful to its end, (in a Duel betwixt two Princes, Cousin-ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in <hi>Spain,</hi> the elder, sayes <hi>Livie,</hi> by his skill and dexterity in Arms, easily surmounting the greater and more aukward Strength of the younger) and of which, the knowledge, as I experimentally know, hath inspir'd some with Courage above their natural Talent: but this is not properly Valour, because it supports it self upon Address, and is founded upon some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing besides it self. The honour of Combat consists in the jealousie of Courage, and not of Skill; and therefore I have known a Friend of mine, fam'd for a great Master in this Exercise, in his Quarrels make choice of such Arms as

                     <p>Butts, Tilting, and Barriers, the images of Warlike Fights, were the Exercises of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: this other Exercise is so much the less noble, as it only respects a private end, that

teaches us to ruine one another, against <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> and that every way always produces very ill effects. It is much more worthy, and more becoming, to exercise our selves in things that strengthen, than that weaken our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that tend to the publick safety and common glory. <hi>Publius Rutilius Consus</hi> was the first that taught the Souldiers to handle their Arms with skill, and joyn'd Art to Vertue: not for the use of private quarrel, but for War, and the Quarrels of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> A popular and civil Art of Defence. And besides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who commanded his men to shoot chiefly at the face of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s <hi>Gensdarmes</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia</hi>: a thousand other Commanders have also unbethought them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new forms of Weapons, and new ways of striking and defending, according as occasion shall require. But as <hi>Philopaemen</hi> condemn'd wrestling, wherein he excell'd, because the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives that were therein employ'd were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from those that appertain to Military Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to which alone he conceiv'd men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ought wholly to apply themselves; so it seems to me, that this Address to which we form our Limbs, those Writings and Motions young men are taught in this new School, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of no Use, but rather contrary and hurtful to the manner of fight in Battel: and also our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commonly make use of particular Weapons, and peculiarly design'd for Duel. And I have known when it has been disapprov'd, that a Gentleman challeng'd to fight with Rapier and
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:53645:643" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Poignard, should appear in the equipage of a man at Arms; or that another should take his Cloke instead of a Poignard. It is worthy of Consideration, that <hi>Lachez</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> speaking of learning to fence after our manner, says, that he never knew any great Souldier come out of that School, especially the Masters of it: and indeed as to them our own experience tells us as much. As to the rest, we may at least conclude, that they are Qualities of no Relation nor Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. And in the Education of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his Government,<note place="margin">The Art of cuffing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted by <hi>Plato.</hi>

The first Cruelties are exercis'd for themselves: from thence springs the fear of a just Revenge, which afterwards produces a series of new Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, to obliterate one another. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who had so much to do with the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> agitated with the horror of so many Murthers committed by his appointment, and doubting of being able to keep himself se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from so many Families, at divers times mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally injur'd and offended by him; resolv'd to seize all the Children of those he had caus'd to be slain, to dispatch them daily one after another, and so to establish his own repose. Fine Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are never impertinent however plac'd; and therefore I, who more consider the weight and utility of what I deliver than their Order and Connexion, need not fear in this place to bring in a fine story, though it be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by the bye; for when they are rich in their own native Beauty, and are able to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the least end of a Hair will serve to draw them into my Argument. Amongst others condemn'd by <hi>Philip, Herodicus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,</hi> had been one. He had moreover after him caus'd his two Sons in Law to be put to Death, each leaving a Son very young behind him. <hi>Theoxena</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and <hi>Archo,</hi> were their two Widows. <hi>Theoxena,</hi> though highly courted to it, could not be perswaded to marry again: <hi>Archo</hi> married
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:53645:644"/>
                        <hi>Poris,</hi> the greatest Man of the <hi>Aenians,</hi> and by him had a great many Children, which she dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, left in a very tender Age. <hi>Theoxena,</hi> mov'd with a Maternal charity towards her Nephews, that she might have them under her own Eyes, and in her own Protection, married <hi>Poris</hi>: when presently comes a Proclamation of the King's <hi>Edict.</hi> This brave spirited Mother, suspecting the cruelty of <hi>Philip,</hi> and afraid of the Insolence of the Souldiers towards these fine and tender Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was so bold as to declare, that she would rather kill them with her own hands than deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. <hi>Poris,</hi> startled at this Protestation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd her to steal them away, and to Transport them to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there commit them to the Custody of some faithful Friends of his. They took therefore the opportunity of an Annual Feast which was celebrated at <hi>Aenia</hi> in Honour of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and thither they went. Having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by day at the Publick Ceremonies, and Banquet, they stole the Night following into a Vessel laid ready for the purpose, to escape away by Sea. The Wind prov'd contrary, and finding themselves in the Morning within sight of the Land from whence they had launch'd over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, were made after by the Guards of the Port: which <hi>Poris</hi> perceiving, he labour'd all he could to make the Mariners do their utmost to escape from the Pursuers. But <hi>Theoxena,</hi> frantick with Affection and Revenge, in pursuance of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Resolution, prepar'd both Arms and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and exposing them before them; <hi>Go to, my Children,</hi> said she, <hi>Death is now the only means of

your Defence and Liberty, and shall administer occasion to the Gods to exercise their sacred Justice: These sharp Swords, and these full Cups, will open you the way into it: Courage, fear nothing. And thou, my Son, who art the eldest, take this Steel into thy Hand, that thou may'st the more bravely Dye.</hi> The Children having on one side so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull a Counsellour, and the Enemy at their Throats on the other, ran all of them eagerly upon what was next to hand; and half dead, were thrown into the Sea. <hi>Theoxena,</hi> proud of having so gloriously provided for the safety of her Children, clasping her Arms with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection about her Husband's Neck, <hi>Let us, my Friend,</hi> said she, <hi>follow these Boys, and enjoy the same Sepulchre they do</hi>: And so embrac'd, threw themselves head-long over-board into the Sea; so that the Ship was carried back empty of the Owners into the Harbour. <hi>Tyrants,</hi> at once both to kill and to make their Anger felt, have pump't their Wit to invent the most lingring Deaths. They will have their Enemies dispatch'd, but not so fast that they may not have leisure to taste their Vengeance. And therein they are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplex'd, for if the Torments they inflict are violent, they are short, if long, they are not then so painful as they desire; and thus torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in contriving how to torment others. Of this we have a thousand Examples of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and I know not whether we unawares do not retain some traces of this Barbarity: all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a simple Death appears to me absolute Cruelty; neither can our Justice expect, that
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:53645:645" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he, whom the fear of being executed by being Beheaded or Hang'd, will not restrain, should be any more aw'd by the imagination of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Fire, burning Pincers, or the Wheel. And I know not in the mean time, whether we do not throw them into despair; for in what condition can the Soul of a man, expecting four and twenty hours together to be broken upon a Wheel, or after the old way, nail'd to a Cross, be? <hi>Josephus</hi> relates, that in the time of the War the <hi>Romans</hi> made in <hi>Judea</hi>; happening to pass by where they had three days before crucified certain <hi>Jews,</hi> he amongst them knew three of his own Friends, and obtained the favour of having them taken down, of which, two he says died, the third liv'd a great while after. <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condilas,</hi> a Writer of good credit, in the Records he has left behind him of things that happen'd in his time, and near him, tell us, as of the most excessive Torment, of that the Emperour <hi>Meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> very often practis'd, of cutting off men in the middle by the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> with one blow of a Cimeter; by which it follow'd, that they died as it were two Deaths at once, and both the one part, says he, and the other, were seen to stir and strive a great while after in very great Torment. I do not think there was any great sufferance in this motion. The Torments that are the most dreadful to look on, are not always the greatest to endure; and I find those that other <hi>Historians</hi> relate to have been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd upon the <hi>Epirot</hi> Lords, to be more horrid and cruel, where they were condemn'd to be
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:53645:645" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flead alive by pieces, after so malicious a manner that they continued fifteen days in this misery. As also these other two following. <hi>Croesus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd a Gentleman, the favourite of his Brother <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> to be seized on, carried him into a Fuller's Shop, where he caus'd him to be scratch'd and carded with the Cards and Combs belonging to that Trade till he died. <hi>George Jechel,</hi> chief Commander of the Peasants of <hi>Polonia,</hi> who committed so many Mischiefs under the Title of the <hi>Crusado,</hi> being defeated in Battel, and taken by the <hi>Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> was three days bound naked upon the Rack, exposed to all sorts of Torments that any one could contrive against him; during which time, many other Prisoners were kept fasting; in the end, he living, and looking on, they made his beloved Brother <hi>Lucat,</hi> for whom he only entreated, taking upon himself the blame of all their evil Actions, to drink his Blood, and caused twenty of his most favour'd Captains to feed upon him, tearing his flesh in pieces with their Teeth, and swallowing the morsels. The remainder of his Body and his Bowels, so soon as he was dead, were boyl'd, and others of his followers compell'd to eat them.</p>

                     <p>I Find by experience, that there is a vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the starts and sallies of the Soul, and a resolute and constant habit; and very well perceive, that there is nothing we may not do, nay, even to the surpassing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity it self, says a certain Person, forasmuch as it is more to render a mans self impassible by his own study and industry, than to be so by his natural condition; and even to be able to conjoyn to man's imbecillity and frailty a God-like resolution and assurance. But it is by fits and starts; and in the Lives of those <hi>Heroes</hi> of Times past there are sometimes miraculous Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and that seem infinitely to exceed our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force, but they are indeed but sallies: and 'tis hard to believe, that in these so elevated qualities a man can so thoroughly tinct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bue the Soul, that they should become constant, and as it were, natural in him. It accidentally happens even to us, who are but abortive births of men, sometimes to dart out our Souls, when
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:53645:648" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rous'd by the Discourses or Examples of others, much beyond their ordinary stretch; but 'tis a kind of Passion which does push and prick them on, and in some sort ravishes them from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: but this Whirlwind once blown over, we see that they insensibly flag, and slacken of themselves, if not to the lowest degree, at least so as to be no more the same; insomuch as that upon every trivial occasion, the losing of a Hawk, or the breaking of a Glass, we suffer our selves to be mov'd little less than one of the common People. I am of opinion, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Moderation, and Constancy excepted, all things are to be done by a man that is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and defective in general. Therefore it is, say the <hi>Sages,</hi> that to make a right judgment of a man, you are chiefly to pry into his common Actions, and surprize him in his every day ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> he who erected so pleasant a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon Ignorance, endeavour'd, as all the rest who were really <hi>Philosophers</hi> did, to make his <hi>Life</hi> correspond with his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he maintain'd the imbecillity of Humane Judgment to be so extreme as to be incapable of any choice or inclination, and would have it wavering and suspended, considering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all things as indifferent, 'tis said, that he always comported himself after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and countenance: if he had begun a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he would always end what he had to say, though the Person he was speaking to was gone away: and if he walk'd, he never stop'd for any impediment that stood in his way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:53645:648" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preserv'd from Precipices, the justle of Carts, and other like accidents, by the care of his Friends: for, to fear, or to avoid any thing, had been to justle his own Propositions, which depriv'd the Senses themselves of all certainty and election. Sometimes he suffer'd Incisions and Cauteries with so great constancy, as never to be seen so much as to winch or stir. 'Tis something to bring the Soul to these imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, more to joyn the effects, and yet not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; but to conjoyn them with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance and constancy as to make them habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, is certainly, in attempts so remote from the common usance, almost incredible to be done. Therefore it was, that being one day taken in his House terribly scolding with his Sister, and being reproach'd that he therein transgress'd his own Rules of indifference; <hi>What,</hi> said he, <hi>must this foolish Woman also serve for a testimony to my Rules?</hi> Another time, being seen to defend himself against a Dog, <hi>It is,</hi> said he, <hi>very hard totally to put off man; and we must endeavour and force our selves to resist and encounter things, first by Effects, but at least by Reason.</hi> About se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight years since, a Husbandman yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but two Leagues from my House, having long been tormented with his Wifes Jealousie, coming one day home from his work, and she welcoming him with her accustomed railing, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into so great fury, that with a Sickle he had yet in his hand he totally cut off all those Parts that she was jealous of, and threw them in her face. And, 'tis said, that a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:53645:649" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our Nation, brisk and amorous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his perseverance at last mollified the heart of a fair Mistress, enrag'd, that upon the point of fruition he found himself unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and that,

so soon as ever he came home he depriv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of it, and sent it his Mistriss, a cruel and bloody Victim for the expiation of his offence. If this had been done upon mature consideration, and upon the account of Religion, as the Priests of <hi>Cybele</hi> did, what should we say of so high an action? A few dayes since, at <hi>Bergerac,</hi> within five Leagues of my House, up the River <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogne,</hi> a Woman having over-night been beaten and abus'd by her Husband, a cholerick ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd fellow, resolv'd to escape from his ill usage at the price of her life; and going so soon as she was up the next morning to visit her Neighbours, as she was wont to do, and having let some words fall of the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Affairs, she took a Sister of hers by the hand, and led her to the Bridge; whither being come, as it were in jest, without any manner of alteration in her Countenance, there taking leave of her, she threw her self headlong from the top into the River, and was there drown'd. That which is the most remarkable in this, is, that this resolution was a whole night forming in her head: But it is quite another thing with the <hi>Indian</hi> Women, for it being the
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:53645:649" rendition="simple:additions"/>
custom there for the men to have many Wives, and the best beloved of them to kill her self at her Husband's decease, every one of them makes it the Business of her whole Life to obtain this Priviledge, and gain this Advantage over her Companions, and the good Offices they do their Husband's, aim at no other Recompence, but to be preferr'd in accompanying him in Death.</p>

The day being come, she mounts on
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:53645:650"/>
Horse-back, dress'd as fine as at her Wedding, and with a cheerful Countenance says, she is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sleep with her Spouse, holding a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glass in her left hand, and an Arrow in the other. Being thus conducted in pomp, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with her Kindred and Friends, and a great concourse of People, with great Joy, she is at last brought to the publick Place appointed for such Spectacles: This is a spacious Place, in the midst of which is a Pit full of Wood, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to it a Mount raised four or five steps, upon which she is brought and served with a magnificent Repast; which being done, she falls to Dancing and Singing, and gives order when she thinks fit to kindle the Fire; which being perform'd, she Descends, and taking the nearest of her Husband's Relations by the hand, they walk together to the River close by, where she strips her self stark naked, and having distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Clothes and Jewels to her Friends, plunges her self into the Water, as if there to cleanse her self from her Sins; comming out thence, she wraps her self in a yellow Linnen of five and twenty Ells long, and again giving her hand to this Kinsman of her Husband's, they return back to the Mount, where she makes a Speech to the People, and recommends her Children to them, if she have any. Betwixt the Pit and the Mount, there is commonly a Curtain drawn to skreen the burning Furnace from their sight, which some of them to manifest the greater Courage, forbid. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ended what she has to say, a Woman presents her with a Vessel of Oil, wherewith to anoint
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:53645:650"/>
her head, and her whole Body; which having done with, she throws into the Fire, and in an instant precipitates her self after. Imediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the People throw a great many Billets and Logs upon her, that she may not be long in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and convert all their Joy into Sorrow and Mourning. If they are Persons of meaner Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Body of the defunct is carried to the place of Sepulture, and there plac'd sitting, the Widdow kneeling before him, embracing the dead Body; and continue in this posture whilst they build a Wall about them, which so soon as it is raised to the height of the Womans Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, some of her Relations comes behind her, and taking hold of her Head writhe her Neck in two, and so soon as she is dead, the Wall is presently rais'd up, and clos'd, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main entomb'd. There was in this same Country something like this in their <hi>Gymnosophist</hi>;<note place="margin">The <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosophists voluntarily burnt.</hi>
                        </note> for not by constraint of others, nor by the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity of a sudden humour, but by the express Profession of their Order, their Custom was, that so soon as they arriv'd at a certain Age, or that they saw themselves threatned by any Disease, to cause a funeral Pile to be erected for them, and on the top a stately Bed, where, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving joyfully feasted their Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they laid them down with so great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that Fire being apply'd to it, they were never seen to stir either Hand or Foot; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner one of them, <hi>Calanus</hi> by Name, expir'd in the presence of the whole Army of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and he was neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

holy, nor happy amongst them, that did not thus destroy himself; dismissing his Soul purg'd and purified by the Fire, after having consum'd all that was earthy and mortal. This constant premeditation of the whole Life is that which makes the wonder. Amongst our other Controversies, that of <hi>Fatum</hi> is also crept in, and to tye things to come, and even our own Wills to a certain and inevitable Necessity, we are yet upon this Argument of time past; <hi>Since God foresees that all things shall so fall out, as doubtless he does, it must then necessarily follow, that they must so fall out</hi>: to which our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters reply, <hi>that the seeing any thing come to pass, as we do, and as God himself also does, (for all things being present with him, he rather sees, than foresees) is not to compell an Event: that is, we see because things do fall out, but things do not fall out because we see. Events cause Knowledge, but Knowledge does not cause Events. That which we see happen, does happen; but it might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned otherwise: and God, in the Catalogue of the Causes of Events which he has in his Prescience, has also those which we call accidental and unvolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>which depend upon the Liberty he has given our free Will, and knows that we do amiss because we would do so.</hi> I have seen a great many Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders encourage their Souldiers with this fatal Necessity;<note place="margin">

                        </note> for if our time be limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hour, neither the Enemies shot, nor our own Boldness, nor our Flight and Cowardize, can either shorten or prolong our Lives. This is easily said, but see who will be so perswaded,
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:53645:651" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if it be so that a strong and lively Faith draws along with it Actions of the same, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Faith we so much brag of, is very light in this Age of ours, unless the Contempt it has of Works, makes it disdain their Company. So it is, that to this very purpose the <hi>Sire de Joinville,</hi> as credible a Witness as any other whatever, tells us of the <hi>Bedoins,</hi> a Nation amongst the <hi>Saracens,</hi> with whom the King St. <hi>Lewis</hi> had to do in the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> that they in their Religion, did so firmly believe the number of every mans days to be from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity prefix'd, and set down by an inevitable <hi>Decree,</hi> that they went naked to the Wars, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a <hi>Turkish</hi> Sword, and their Bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover'd with a white Linnen Cloth: and for the greatest Curse they could invent when they were angry, this was always in their Mouths, <hi>Accursed be thou, as he that arms himself for fear of Death.</hi> This is a Testimony of Faith very much beyond ours. And of this sort is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that two Religious men of <hi>Florence</hi> gave in our Fathers days. Being engag'd in some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of Learning, they agreed to go both of them into the Fire in the sight of all the People, each for the verification of his Argument, and all things were already prepar'd, and the things just upon the point of Execution, when it was interrupted by an unexpected accident. A young <hi>Turkish</hi> Lord, having perform'd a notable Exploit in his own Person in the sight of both Armies, that of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and that of <hi>Hunniades</hi> ready to joyn Battel, being ask'd by <hi>Amurath,</hi> who in so
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:53645:652" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tender and unexperienc'd years (for it was his first sally into Arms) had inspir'd him with so brave a Courage, reply'd, that his chief <hi>Tutor</hi> for Valour was a <hi>Hare.</hi> For being, said he, one day a hunting, I found a Hare sitting, and though I had a brace of excellent Grey-hounds with me, yet methought it would be best for sureness to make use of my Bow; for she sat very fair. I then fell to letting fly my Arrows, and shot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I had in my Quiver, not only without hurting, but without starting her from her form. At last I slipt my Dogs after her, but to no more purpose than I had shot: by which I understood, that she had been secur'd by her Destiny; and that neither Darts nor Swords can wound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the permission of Fate, which we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hasten nor defer. This Story which I am going to tell, may serve by the way to let us see how flexible our Reason is to all sorts of Images. A Person of great Years, Name, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Learning, boasted to me to have been induc'd to a certain very important mutation in his Faith, by a strange, whimsical Incitation, and otherwise so very ill concluding, that I thought it much stronger being taken the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way: He call'd it a Miracle, I look upon it quite otherwise. The <hi>Turkish</hi> Historians say, that the perswasion those of their Nation have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in them of the fatal and unalterable Prescription of their Days, does manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the giving them great assurance in Dangers; and I know a great Prince, who makes very fortunate use of it; whether it be that he
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:53645:652"/>
does really believe it, or that he makes it his excuse, for so wonderfully hazarding himself, provided Fortune be not too soon weary of her Favour to him. There has not happened in our memory a more admirable effect of Resolution, than in those two who conspir'd the Death of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> 'Tis to be wonder'd at,<note place="margin">Assasinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                        </note> how the second that executed it, could ever be persuaded into an attempt, wherein his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who had done his utmost, had had so ill Success; and after the same Method, and with the same Arms, to go attaque a Lord, arm'd with a late Instruction of distrust, powerful in followers and bodily Strength, in his own Hall, amidst his Guards, and in a City wholly at his Devotion. He doubtless employ'd a very resolute Arm and a Courage enflam'd with furious Passions: A <hi>Poignard</hi> is surer for striking home, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that more motion and force of hand is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than with a Pistol, the Blow is more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be put by or hindred. That this man did not run to a certain Death, I make no great doubt; for the hopes any one could flatter him withall, could not find place in any sober Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and the Conduct of his Exploit does sufficiently manifest that he had no want of that no more than of Courage. The motives of so powerful a Perswasion may be divers, for our fancy does what it will both with it self and us.<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
                        </note> The Execution that was done near <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> was nothing like this, there was in that more of Chance than Vigour, the wound was not mortal, if Fortune had not made it so;
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:53645:653" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to attempt to shoot on Horse-back, and at a great distance, and at one whose body was in motion by the moving of his Horse, was the attempt of a man who had rather miss his blow, than fail of saving himself: as was apparent by what followed after; for he was so astonish'd and stupified with the thought of so high an Execution, that he totally lost his Judgment both to find his way and to govern his Tongue. What needed he to have done more than to fly back to his Friends cross a River? 'Tis what I have done in less Dangers, and that I think of very little hazard, how broad soever the River may be, provided your Horse have good going in, and that you see on the other side easie land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the stream. The other, when they pronounc'd his dreadful Sentence. <hi>I was prepar'd for this,</hi> said he, <hi>before-hand, and I will make you wonder at my Patience.</hi> The <hi>Assassins,</hi> a <hi>Nation</hi> bordering upon <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> are reputed amongst the <hi>Mahometans</hi> a People of very great Devotion, and purity of Manners. They hold that the nearest way to gain Paradise is to kill some one of a contrary Religion; which is the Reason they have often been seen, being but one or two, and without Arms, to attempt against powerful Enemies at the price of a certain Death, and without any Consideration of their own Danger. So was our Count <hi>Raimond</hi> of <hi>Tripoly</hi> assassinated (which Word is deriv'd from their Name) in the heart of his City, <hi>during</hi> our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of the Holy War.

                     <p>THis Story shall go by it self; for I will leave it to Physicians to Discourse of. Two days ago I saw a Child, that two Men and a Nurse, who said themselves to be the Father, the Uncle, and the Aunt of it, carried about to get money by shewing it, by reason it was so strange a Creature. It was, as to all the rest of a common Form, and could stand upon its Feet, could go and gabble much like other Children of the same Age; it had never as yet taken any other nourishment but from the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Breasts, and what, in my Presence, they tried to put into the Mouth of it, it only chew'd a little and spit it out again without swallowing; the Cry of it seem'd indeed a little odd and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and it was just fourteen Months old. Under the Breast it was joyned to another Child, but without a Head, and that had the spine of the Back without motion, the rest entire; for though it had one Arm shorter than the other, it had been broken by accident at their Birth; they were joyn'd Breast to Breast, and as if a lesser Ghild would reach the Arms about the Neck of one something bigger. The juncture
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:53645:654" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and thickness of the place where they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd was not above four Fingers, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, so that if you thrust up the imperfect Child you might see the Navel of the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, and the joyning was betwixt the Paps and the Navel. The Navel of the imperfect Child could not be seen, but all the rest of the Belly; so that all the rest that was not joyn'd of the imperfect one, as Arms, Buttocks, Thighs and Legs, hung dangling upon the other, and might reach to the Mid-leg. The <hi>Nurse</hi> more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over told us that it urin'd at both Bodies, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the members of the other were nourish'd, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and in the same plight with that she gave suck to, excepting that they were shorter, and less. This double Body, and several Limbs rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one Head, might be interpreted a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prognostick to the <hi>King,</hi> of maintaining these various Parts of our State under the union of his Laws; but lest the Event should prove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, 'tis better to let it alone, for in things already past,<note place="margin">

You shall see them come out with Fire and Fury sparkling in their Eyes,

There is no Passion that so much transports men from their right Judgments, as Anger. No one would demurr upon punishing a <hi>Judge</hi> with Death who should condemn a <hi>Criminal</hi> upon the account of his own Choler; why then should <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Pedants</hi> be any more allow'd to whip and chastise Children in their Anger? 'Tis then no longer <hi>Correction</hi> but <hi>Revenge.</hi> Chastisement is instead of <hi>Physick</hi> to Children; and should we suffer a <hi>Physician,</hi> who should be animated against and enrag'd at his <hi>Patient</hi>? We our selves, to do well, should never lay a Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Servants whilst our Anger lasts: whilst the Pulse beats, and that we feel an Emotion in our selves, let us defer the Business; things will indeed appear otherwise to us when we are calm and cool. 'Tis then Passion that commands, 'tis then Passion that speaks, and not we. Faults seen through Passion are magnified, and appear
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:53645:656" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much greater to us than they really are, as Bodies do being seen through a Mist. Who is hungry uses Meat, but he that will make use of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction should have no appetite neither of Hunger or Thirst to it. And moreover, Chastisements that are inflicted with weight and discretion, are much better receiv'd, and with greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by him who suffers. Otherwise he will not think himself justly condemn'd by a man transported with anger and fury, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Master's excessive Passion, his inflam'd Countenance, his unwonted Oaths, his Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and precipitous Rashness, for his own justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                        <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports, that <hi>Caius Rabirius</hi> having been condemn'd by <hi>Caesar,</hi> the thing that most prevail'd upon the People (to whom he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd) to determine the Cause in his favour, was, the animosity and vehemency that <hi>Caesar</hi> had manifested in that Sentence. Saying is one thing and Doing is another; we are distinctly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Sermon and the Preacher. These men took a pretty Business in hand, who in our Times have attempted to shake the Truth of our Church by the Vices of her Ministers; she extracts her Testimony elsewhere. 'Tis a foolish way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and that would throw all things into
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:53645:656" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confusion. A man whose Manners are good, may have false Opinions, and wicked men may preach Truth, nay, though he believe it not himself. 'Tis doubtless a fine Harmony when <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>saying</hi> go together; and I will not deny but that Saying, when the Actions follow, are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority and Efficacy, as <hi>Eudamidas</hi> said, hearing a <hi>Philosopher</hi> talk of Military Affairs; <hi>These things are finely said, but he that speaks them is not to be believed, for his Ears have never been used to the sound of the Trumpet.</hi> And <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> hearing an Orator declaming upon Valour, burst out into Laughter, at which the other being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, <hi>I should,</hi> said he to him, <hi>do the same if it were a Swallow that spoke of this subject, but if it were an Eagle I should willingly hear him.</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, methinks, in the Writing of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that he who speaks what he thinks, strikes much more home than he that only dissembles. Hear but <hi>Cicero</hi> speak of the love of Liberty: Hear <hi>Brutus</hi> speak of it, his very writings sound that this man would purchace it at the price of his Life. Let <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Father of Eloquence, treat of the contempt of Death, and let <hi>Seneca</hi> do the same; the first does languishingly drawl it out, so that you perceive he would make you resolve upon a thing on which he is not resolv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He inspires you not with Courage,<note place="margin">Censure of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
                        </note> for he himself has none; the other animates and enflames you. I never read Author, even of those who treat of Virtue, and of Actions, that I do not curiously examine what a kind of man he was himself. For the <hi>Ephori</hi> at <hi>Sparta,</hi> seeing a
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:53645:657" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dissolute Fellow propose a wholesome advice to the People, commanded him to hold his peace, and intreated a virtuous man to attribute to himself the Invention, and to propose it. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s Writings, if well understood, sufficiently speak their <hi>Author</hi>; and so that I think I know him even into his Soul, and yet I could wish that we had some fuller account of his Life: and am thus far wandred from my Subject, upon the account of the Obligation I have to <hi>Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> for having left us in Writing this Story of his Manners, that brings me back to my Subject of Anger.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plutarch</hi> reproach'd for Anger by a Slave of his.</note> A Slave of his, a vicious, ill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Fellow, but that had had the Precepts of <hi>Philosophy</hi> often ringing in his Ears, having for some Offence of his been stript by <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Command, whilst he was whipping, mutter'd at first, that it was without cause, and that he had done nothing to deserve it; but at last falling in good earnest to exclaim against, and to rail at his Master, he reproach'd him, that he was no <hi>Philosopher,</hi> as he had boasted himself to be: that he had often heard him say it was indecent to be angry, nay, had writ a Book to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; and that the causing him to be so cruelly beaten in the height of his Rage, totally gave the Lye to all his Writings. To which <hi>Plutarch</hi> calmly and coldly answer'd, <hi>How, Ruffian,</hi> said he, <hi>By what dost thou judge that I am now angry, does either my Face, my Colour, or my Voice give any manifestation of my being mov'd? I do not think my Eyes look fierce, that my Countenance appears troubled, or that my Voice is dreadful; am I red,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53645:657" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do I foam, does any Word escape my Lips I ought to repent? Do I start? Do I tremble with Fury? For those I tell thee are the true signs of Anger.</hi> And so turning to the Fellow that was whipping him, <hi>Ply on thy Work,</hi> said he, <hi>whilst this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and I dispute.</hi> This is the Story.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archytas Tarentinus,</hi> returning from a War wherein he had been <hi>Captain General,</hi> found all things in his House in very great disorder, and his Lands quite out of Tillage, through the ill Husbandry of his <hi>Receiver,</hi> whom having caus'd to be call'd to him, <hi>Go,</hi> said he, <hi>if I were not in Anger, I would soundly drubb your sides. Plato</hi> likewise being highly offended with one of his Slaves, gave <hi>Speusippus</hi> order to chastize him,<note place="margin">That Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be given in Anger.</note> excusing himself from doing it because he was in Anger. And <hi>Carillus,</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> to a <hi>Helot,</hi> who carried himself so insolently and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciously towards him; <hi>By the Gods,</hi> said he, <hi>if I was not angry, I would immediately cause thee to be put to Death.</hi> 'Tis a Passion that is pleas'd with, and flatters it self. How oft, being mov'd under a false cause, if the Person offending makes a good Defence, and presents us with a just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, are we vext at Truth and Innocence it self? In proof of which, I remember a marvellous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Antiquity. <hi>Piso,</hi> otherwise a Man of very eminent Virtue, being mov'd against a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of his, for that returning alone from <hi>Forrage,</hi> he could give him no account where he had left a Companion of his, took it for granted, that he had kill'd him, and presently condemn'd him to Death. He was no sooner mounted upon the
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:53645:658" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Gibbet,</hi> but behold his wandring Companion arrives, at which all the Army were exceedingly glad, and after many embraces of the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, the Hangman carried both the one and the other into <hi>Piso</hi>'s Presence, all the Assistants believing it would be a great Pleasure even to him himself; but it prov'd quite contrary; for through shame and spite, his Fury, which was not yet cool, redoubled; and by a subtlety which his Passion suddenly suggested to him, he made three Criminal for having found one innocent, and caus'd them all to be dispatch'd: The first Souldier, because <hi>Sentence</hi> had pass'd upon him; The second, who had lost his way, because he was the Cause of his Companions Death; and the Hangman, for not having obey'd the Order bad been given him. Such as have had to do with testy and obstinate Women, may have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented into what a Rage it puts them, to oppose Silence and Coldness to their Fury, and that a man disdains to nourish their Anger. The Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Celius</hi> was wonderfully cholerick by Nature, and to one who sup't in his Company, a man of a gentle and sweet Conversation, and who, that he might not move him, approv'd and consented to all he said; he, impatient that his ill Humour should thus spend it self without aliment; <hi>For the love of the Gods deny me something,</hi> said he, <hi>that we may be two.</hi> Women in like manner are only angry, that others may be angry again, in imitation of the Laws of Love. <hi>Phocion,</hi> to one that interrupted his speaking by injurious and very opprobrious Words, made no other return
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53645:658" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than silence, and to give him full liberty and leisure to vent his spleen; which he having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and the storm blown over, without any mention of this disturbance, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Discourse where he had left off before. No answer can nettle a man like such a Contempt. Of the most cholerick man in <hi>France,</hi> (anger is always an imperfection, but more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable in a Souldier, for in that trade it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sometimes be avoided) I must needs say, that he is often the most patient man that I know, and the most discreet in bridling his Passions; which rises in him with so great Violence and Fury,

that he must of necessity cruelly constrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to moderate it; and for my part, I know no Passion which I could with so much Violence to my self attempt to cover and conceal. I would not set Wisdom at so high a price; and do not so much consider what he does, as how much it costs him to do no worse. Another boasted
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:53645:659" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself to me of the regularity and sweetness of his Manners, which is in truth very singular; to whom I replyed, that it was indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, especially in Persons of so eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as himself, upon whom every one had their Eyes, to present himself always well-temper'd to the World; but that the principal thing was to make Provision for within, and for himself; and that it was not, in my Opinion, very well to order his Business inwardly to grate himself, which I was affraid he did, in putting on and outwardly maintaining the visor and regular Appearance. A man incorporates Anger by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> told <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who, for fear of being seen in a <hi>Tavern,</hi> withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into it. The more you retire, the farther you enter in. I would rather advise that a man should give his Servant a box of the Ear a little unseasonably, than wrack his Fancy to represent this grave and compos'd Countenance; and had rather discover my Passions than brood over them at my own expence; they grow less in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and manifesting themselves; and 'tis much better their point should wound others without than be turn'd towards our selves within. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia vitia in aperto leviora sunt:</hi>

and hinders the Effect.

Secondly, that they are not angry to no purpose, but make sure that their Reprehension reach him at whom they are offended; for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they rail and bawl before he comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Presence, and continue scolding an Age after he is gone;

When I am angry, my Anger is very sharp, but withall very short,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in great and little Occasions.</note> and as private as I can; I lose my self indeed in Promptness and Violence, but not in Trouble, so that I throw out all sorts of injurious words at random, and without choice, and never consider pertinently to dart my Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage where I think it will deepest wound, for I commonly make use of no other Weapon in my Anger than my Tongue. My Servants have a better bargain of me in great Occasions than in little, the little ones surprize me; and the mischief on't is, that when you are once upon the Precipice, 'tis no matter who gave you the push, for you always go to the bottom; the fall urges, moves, and makes haste of it self. In great Occasions this satisfies me, that they are so just every one expects a warrantable Indignation, and then I glorifie my self in deceiving their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; against these, I fortifie and prepare my self, they disturb my Head, and threaten to transport me very far, should I follow them. I can easily contain my self from entring into one of these Passions, and am strong enough when I expect them, to repell their Violence, be the Cause never so great; but if a Passion once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess and seize me, it carries me away, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so small: which makes me indent with those who may contend me, when you see me first moved, let me alone, right or wrong, I'll do the same for you. The storm is only begot by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence

of Angers, which easily spring from one another, and are not born together. Let every one have his own way, and we shall be always at Peace. A profitable Advice, but hard to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. Sometimes also it falls out, that I put on a seeming Anger, for the better governing of my House, without any real Emotion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> As Age ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders my Humours more sharp, I study to oppose them, and will, if I can, order it so, that for the Future I may be so much the less peevish and hard to please, as I have more excuse and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be so, although I have heretofore been reckoned amongst those that have the greatest Patience.

Pamphlets that those of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> disperse abroad for the defence of their <hi>Cause</hi>; (and which sometimes proceeds from so good a Hand, that 'tis pitty his Pen is not employ'd in a better Subject) I have formerly seen one, that to make up the Parallel he would fain find out betwixt the Government of our late poor King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and that of <hi>Nero,</hi> compares the late <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with <hi>Seneca,</hi> their Fortunes to have both of them been the prime <hi>Ministers</hi> in the Goverment of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and their Manners, Conditions, and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to have been very near alike: Wherein, in my Opinion, he does the said <hi>Cardinal</hi> a very great Honour; for though I am one of those who have a very great esteem for his <hi>Wit, Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Service of his King, and think it was a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in an Age wherein he was so <hi>new,</hi> so <hi>rare,</hi> and also so necessary for the Publick, to have an Ecclesiastical Person, of so high Birth and Dignity, and so sufficient and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his Place; yet to confess the Truth, I do not think his Capacity by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees near to the other, nor his Virtue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so clean, entire, or steady, as that of <hi>Seneca.</hi> Now the Book whereof I speak, to bring about his design, gives a very injurious Description of <hi>Seneca,</hi> having borrowed his Reproaches from <hi>Dion</hi> the Historian, whose Testimony I do not at all believe.

a mortal enemy to <hi>Nero</hi>'s Vices, makes him elsewhere Avaricious, an Usurer, Ambitious, Effeminate, Voluptuous, and a false Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Philosophy</hi>; his own Virtue does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so lively and vigorous in his Writings, and his Vindication is so clear from any of these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of <hi>Riches,</hi> and any extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive way of living, that I cannot believe any Testimony to the contrary. And besides, it is much more reasonable to believe the <hi>Roman Historians</hi> in such things, than <hi>Greeks</hi> and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Now <hi>Tacitus</hi> and the rest speak very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably both of his Life and Death; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him to us a very excellent and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person in all things; and I will alledge no other Reproach against <hi>Dion</hi>'s Report but this, which I cannot avoid, namely, that he has so sickly a Judgment in the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs, that he dares to maintain <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> Cause against <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that of <hi>Anthony</hi> against <hi>Cicero.</hi> Let us now come to <hi>Plutarch;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bodinus</hi> a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> 
                        <hi>John Bodinus</hi> is a good Author of our times, and a <hi>Writer</hi> of much greater Judgment than the rout of <hi>Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of his Age, and that deserves to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read and consider'd. I find him though a little bold in this passage of his <hi>Method of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> where he accuses <hi>Plutarch</hi> not only of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance (wherein I would have let him alone: for that is above my reprehension) but that he oft writes things incredible, and absolutely fabulous, which are his own Words. If he had simply said, that he had deliver'd things otherwise than they really are, it had been no great reproach; for
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:53645:662" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what we have not seen, we are forc'd to receive from other hands, and take upon trust, and I see he purposely sometimes variously relates the same Story, as the Judgment of the three best Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that ever were, given by <hi>Hannibal</hi>; 'tis one way in the Life of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> and another in that of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> But to charge him with having taken incredible and impossible things for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent pay, is to accuse the most judicious <hi>Author</hi> in the World of want of Judgment. And this is his Example; as, says he, when he relates that a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Boy suffer'd his Bowels to be torn out by a Fox-cub he had stoln,<note place="margin">The Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> Boy torn out by a Fox-cub.</note> and kept it still conceal'd under his Coat till he fell down dead, rather than he would discover his theft. I find in this first place this Example ill chosen, forasmuch as it is very hard to limit the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Faculties of the Soul, whereas we have better. Authority to limit, and know the force of the bodily Limbs; and therefore, if I had been as he, I should rather have chosen an Example of this second sort; and there are that are less credible: and amongst others, that which he relates of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that all wounded as he was, he struck one of his Enemies who was arm'd from Head to Foot, so great a blow with his Sword, that he clave him down from his Crown to his seat, so that the Body was divided into two parts. In this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I find no great Miracle, nor do not admit of the <hi>Salvo</hi> with which he excuses <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to have added this Word (<hi>as 'tis said</hi>) to suspend our Belief; for unless it be in things received
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:53645:662" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Authority, and the reverence to <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> he would never have himself admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or enjoyned us things incredible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to believe; and that this Word (<hi>as 'tis said</hi>) is not put in this place to that effect, is easie to be seen, because he elsewhere relates to us, upon this Subject, of the Patience of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Children,<note place="margin">The Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> Examples happening in his Time, more unlikely to prevail upon our Faith; as what <hi>Cicero</hi> also has testified before him, as having, as he says, been upon the Place: that even to their Times there were Children found, who, in the tryal of Patience they were put to before the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be there whip'd till the Blood run down all over their Bodies, not only without crying out, but without so much as a Groan, and some till they there voluntarily lost their Lives: and that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> also, amongst an hundred other Witnesses, relates, that at a Sacrifice, a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Coal being fall'n into the sleeve of a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonian</hi> Boy, as he was <hi>censing,</hi> he suffered his whole Arm to be burn'd, till the smell of the broyling flesh was perceiv'd by the <hi>Assistants.</hi> There was nothing, according to their <hi>Custom,</hi> wherein their Reputation was more concerned, nor for which they were to undergo more blame and disgrace, than in being taken in Theft.<note place="margin">Thievery odious to the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>

And whoever will enquire

I know there have been simple Peasants amongst us, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd the Soles of their Feet to be broil'd upon a <hi>Grid-iron,</hi> their Fingers-ends to be writhen off with the Cock of a Pistol, and their bloody Eyes squeez'd out of their Heads by force of a Cord twisted about their Brows, before they would so much as consent to ransom. I have seen one left stark naked for dead in a Ditch, his Neck black and swell'd, with a Halter yet about it, with which they had drag'd him all Night at a Horses Tail, his Body wounded in a hundred Places, with stabs of Daggers had been given him, not to kill him, but to put him to Pain, and to affright him: who had endur'd all this, and even to being speechless and insensible, resolv'd, as he himself told me, rather to dye a thousand deaths (as indeed, as to matter of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, he already had) before he would pay a penny; and yet he was one of the richest Husbandmen of all the Country. How many have been seen patiently to suffer themselves to be burnt and roasted for Opinions taken upon trust from others, and by them not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood?<note place="margin">Women obstinate.</note> I have known a hundred and a hundred Women (for <hi>Gascony</hi> has a certain Prerogative for Obstinacy) whom you might sooner have made eat Fire, than forsake an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

they had conceiv'd in Anger. They are more exasperated by blows and constraint. And he that made the Story of the Woman, who in defiance of all Correction, Threats and Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, ceast not to call her Husband lowzy Knave; and that being plung'd over Head and Ears in Water, could yet lift her Hands above her Head, and make a sign of cracking Lice, fein'd a Tale, of which in truth we every day see a manifest image in the Obstinacy of Women. And <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> is the Sister of <hi>Constancy,</hi> at least in Vigour and Stability. We are not to judge what is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and what is not, according to what is credible and incredible to our Apprehension, as I have said elsewhere: and it is a great Fault, and yet that most men are guilty of (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless I do not mention with any Reflection upon <hi>Bodinus</hi>) to make a difficulty of believing that in another, which they could not, or would not do themselves. Every one thinks that the sovereign stamp of humane Nature is imprinted in him, and that from it all others must take their Rule; and that all proceedings which are not like his, are feign'd and false. Is any thing of anothers Actions or Faculties propos'd to him? The first thing he calls to the Consultation of his Judgment is his own Example; and as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go with him, so they must of Necessity do with all the World besides. O dangerous and intollerable Folly! For my part I consider some men as infinitely beyond me, especially amongst the <hi>Antients</hi>; and yet, though I clearly discern my inability to come near them by a thousand
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:53645:664" rendition="simple:additions"/>
paces, I do not forbear to keep them in sight, and to judge of what does elevate them so, of which I also perceive some seeds in my self; as I also do of the extream meanness of some other Minds, which I neither am astonish'd at, nor yet do misbelieve. I very well perceive the turns those great Souls take to raise themselves to such a pitch, and admire their Grandeur; and those flights that I think the bravest, I could be glad to imitate, where, though I want wing, yet my Judgment goes along with them.</p>
                     <p>The other Example he introduces of things incredible, and wholly fabulous, deliver'd by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is, that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was <hi>fin'd</hi> by the <hi>Ephori</hi> for having wholly engross'd the Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his <hi>Citizens</hi> to himself alone.<note place="margin">

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:53645:665"/>
what in <hi>Plutarch</hi> is most excellent, and most to be commended. For in his <hi>Parallels</hi> (which is the most admirable part of all his Works, and with which, in my Opinion, he is himself the most pleas'd) the fidelity and sincerity of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments equal their depth and weight. He is a <hi>Philosopher</hi> that teaches us Virtue. Let us see whether we cannot defend him from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Falsity and Prevarication. All that I can imagine could give occasion to this Censure, is, the great and shining lustre of the <hi>Roman</hi> Names which we have still before us; it does not seem likely to us that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> could rival the Glory of a <hi>Consul, Proconsul,</hi> and <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> of that great <hi>Republick</hi>: but if a man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the truth of the thing, and the men in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which is <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s chiefest aim, and more to balance their Manners, their Natures, and Parts, than their Fortunes; I think contrary to <hi>Bodinus,</hi> that <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the elder <hi>Cato</hi> come ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far short of the men with whom they are compar'd. I should sooner for his purpose have chosen the example of the younger <hi>Cato</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>Phocian,</hi> for in this <hi>couple</hi> there would have been a more likely disparity to the <hi>Romans</hi> Advantage. As to <hi>Marcellus, Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> I very well discern that their Exploits of War are greater and more full of Pomp and Glory than those of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> compares with them: but the bravest and most virtuous Actions, no more in War than elsewhere, are not always the most renown'd. I often see the Names of Captains obscur'd by the Splendor of
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:53645:665"/>
other Names of less desert; witness <hi>Labienus, Ventidius, Telesinus,</hi> and several others. And to take it by that, were I to complain on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> could I not say, that <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was much less comparable to <hi>Themistocles,</hi> the <hi>Gracchi</hi> to <hi>Agis,</hi> and <hi>Cleones</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>? But 'tis folly to judge of things that have so many Aspects at own view. When <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> compares them, he does not for all that make them equal. Who could more learnedly and sincerely have mark'd their distinctions? Does he parallel the Victories, Feats of Arms, the force of their Armies conducted by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and his Triumphs, with those of <hi>Agesilaus? I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> says he, <hi>that</hi> Xenophon <hi>himself, if he were now living, though he was allowed to write what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleased him to the advantage of</hi> Agesilaus, <hi>would dare to bring them into Comparison.</hi> Does he speak of parallelling <hi>Lysander</hi> to <hi>Sylla</hi>? There is, says he, no Comparison, either in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Victories, or in the hazard of Naval En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not to derogate from the <hi>Romans</hi>; for having only simply nam'd them with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he can have done them no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, what disparity soever there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them: and <hi>Plutarch</hi> does not entirely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to one another, there is no preference in general, he only compares the pieces and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances one after another, and gives of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a particular and separate Judgement; wherefore, if any one would convince him of Partiality, he ought to pick out some one of those particular Judgements, or say in general
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:53645:666" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he was mistaken in comparing such a <hi>Greek</hi> to such a <hi>Roman,</hi> when there were others more fit and better resembling to parallel him to.</p>

Others have subdued their force and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour by the frequent application of cold things, as Snow, and Vinegar. The Sack-cloths of our Ancestors were for this purpose, which is a Cloth woven of Horses Hair, of which some of them made Shirts, and others Girdles to torture and correct their Reins. A <hi>Prince</hi> not long ago
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:53645:666" rendition="simple:additions"/>
told me, that in his Youth, upon a solemn Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in the Court of King <hi>Francis</hi> the First, where every Body was very finely dress'd, he would needs put on his Father's Hair Shirt, which was still kept in the House; but how great soever his Devotion was, he had not patience to wear it till Night, and was sick a long time after, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, that he did not think there could be any youthful heat so fierce that the use of this Receipt would not mortifie, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he never essay'd the most violent; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shews us, that such Emotions are often seen under rude and slovenly Cloths, and that a Hair Shirt does not always render those Chaste that wear it. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> proceeded with greater severity in this Affair, for his Disciples, to make tryal of his Continency, having slipt <hi>Lais,</hi> that beautiful and famous <hi>Curtezan</hi> into his Bed quite naked, excepting the arms of her Beauty and her wanton Allurements her <hi>Philters,</hi> finding, that in the despite of his Reason and philosophical Rules, his unruly flesh began to mutiny, he caus'd those Members of his to be burn'd that he found consenting to this Rebellion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Passions which wholly reside in the Soul, as Ambition, Avarice, and the rest, find the Reason much more to do, because it cannot there be relieved but by its own means; neither are those Appetites capable of Saciety, but grow sharper, and encrease by Fruition. The sole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> may suffize to demonstrate to us the disparity of these Appetites; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Man more addicted to amorous Delights
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:53645:667"/>
than he: Of which, the delicate Care he had of his Person, to that degree of Effeminacy, as to serve himself with the most lascivious means to that end, as to have the Hairs of his Body twitch'd off bye places, and farded all over with Perfumes with the extreamest curiosity, is one Testimony, and he was a Beautiful Person in himself, of a fair Complexion, tall, and spritely, full fac'd, with quick hazel Eyes, if we may believe <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>; for the <hi>Statues</hi> that we see at <hi>Rome</hi> do not in all points answer this Discription. Besides his Wives, which he four times changed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reckoning the <hi>Amours</hi> of his Child-hood with <hi>Nicomedes</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi>; he had the Maidenhead of the Renowned <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queen of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; witness the little <hi>Caesario</hi> that he had by her. He also made Love to <hi>Eunoe,</hi> Queen of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Posthumia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Servius Sulpitius,</hi> to <hi>Lollia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Gabinius,</hi> to <hi>Tortulla,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Crassus,</hi> and even to <hi>Mutia,</hi> Wife to the Great <hi>Pompey</hi>: which was the Reason the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians say, that she was repudiated by her Husband, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> confesses to be more than he knew. And the <hi>Curios,</hi> both Father and Son, afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he married <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Daughter, that he had made himself Son-in-law to a man who had made him Cuckold, and one that he himself was wont to call <hi>Aegystus.</hi> Besides all these, he entertain'd <hi>Servilia, Cato</hi>'s Sister, and Mother to <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> from whence every one believes the great affection he had to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> did proceed, by reason that he was born in
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:53645:667" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a time when it was likely he might be his. So that I have reason, methinks, to take him for a man extreamly given to this Debauch, and of a very amorous Constitution. But the other Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ambition,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Caesar</hi> very ambitious.</note> with which he was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected, arising in him to contend with the former, it was soon compell'd to give way. And here calling to mind <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who won <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and totally exterminated the <hi>Grecian</hi> Name; I do not know where these two Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were so evenly balanc'd, equally an indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Lecher and Souldier, but where they both meet in his Life, and justle one another, the quarrelling Ardour always gets the better of the amorous Passion. And this, though it was out of its natural Season, never regained an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Sovereignty over the other, till he was arriv'd at an extream old Age, and unable to undergo the Fatigues of War. What is related for a contrary Example, of <hi>Ladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> is very remarkable; that being a great Captain, Valiant, and Ambitious, he propos'd to himself for the principal end of his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the execution of his Pleasure, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of some rare and excellent <hi>Beauty.</hi> His death seal'd up all the rest: for having by a close and tedious Seige reduc'd the City of <hi>Florence</hi> to so great distress, that the Inhabitants were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to Capitulate about <hi>surrender</hi>; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to let them alone, provided they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up to him a beautiful Maid he had heard of in their City. They were forc'd to yield to it, and by a private Injury to divert the publick
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:53645:668" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ruin. She was the Daughter of a famous Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician of his time, who finding himself involv'd in so foul a Necessity, resolv'd upon a high At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; for as every one was laying to a hand to trick up his Daughter, and to adorn her with Ornaments and Jewels, to render her more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this new Lover, he also gave her a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief most richly wrought, and of an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site perfume, (an Implement they never go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in those Parts) which she was to make use of at their first approaches. This Handkerchief, empoisoned with his chiefest Art, comming to be rub'd between the chaf'd Flesh and open Pores, both of the one and the other, so suddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Poyson, that immediately converting their warm into a cold Sweat, they presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one anothers Arms. But I return to <hi>Caesar.</hi> His Pleasures never made him steal one minute of an hour, nor step one step aside from Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that might any way conduce to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. That Passion was so sovereign in him over all the rest, and with so absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority possest his Soul, that it guided him at pleasure: In earnest, it troubles me when (as to every thing else) I consider the greatness of this Man, and the wonderful Parts wherewith he was endued, learn'd to that degree in all sorts of Knowledge, that there is hardly any one Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which he has not written: He was so great an <hi>Orator,</hi> that many have prefer'd his Eloquence to that of <hi>Cicero</hi>; and he, I conceive, did not think himself inferiour to him in that particular: for his two <hi>Anti-Catos</hi> were chiefly
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:53645:668" rendition="simple:additions"/>
writ to counterbalance the Elocution that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> had expended in his <hi>Cato.</hi> As to the rest, was ever Soul so vigilant, so active, and so pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Labour as his? and doubtless it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish'd with many rare seeds of Virtue, I mean innate, and natural, and not put on. He was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Sober, so far from being delicate in his Diet, that <hi>Opius</hi> relates, how that having one day at Table Physical, instead of common Oyl, in some Sawce set before him, he did eat hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, that he might not put his Entertainer out of Countenance. Another time he caus'd his <hi>Baker</hi> to be whip'd for serving him with a finer than ordinary sort of Bread. <hi>Cato</hi> himself was wont to say of him, <hi>that he was the first sober man that ever made it his Business to ruin his Country.</hi> And as to the same <hi>Cato</hi>'s calling him one day <hi>Drunkard,</hi> it fell out thus. Being both of them in the <hi>Senate,</hi> at a time when <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was in Question, of which <hi>Caesar</hi> was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, one came and brought him a Ticket seal'd up: <hi>Cato</hi> believing that it was something the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators gave him notice of, call'd to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it into his hand, which <hi>Caesar</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to do to avoid farther suspicion. It was by fortune a Love-letter that <hi>Servilia, Cato</hi>'s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had written to him; which <hi>Cato</hi> having read, he threw it back to him, saying, there <hi>Drunkard.</hi> This, I say,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Caesar</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard.</note> was rather a word of disdain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than an express reproach of this Vice, as we often rate those that anger us with the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious words comes into our Mouths, though nothing due to those we are offended at. To
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:53645:669" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which may be added, that the Vice which <hi>Cato</hi> cast in his dish is wonderfully near a-kin to that wherein he had trap'd <hi>Caesar</hi>; for <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Venus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies <hi>Bacchus.</hi>

The Examples of his Sweetness and Clemency to those by whom he had been offended are infinite;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Clemency towards his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> I mean, besides those he gave during the time of the <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> which, as plainly enough appears by his Writings, he practised to cajole his Enemies, and to make them less affraid of his future Dominion and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. But I must also say, that if these Examples are not sufficient Proofs of his natural Sweetness, they at least manifest a marvellous Confidence and Grandeur of Courage in this Person.. He has often been known to dismiss whole Armies, after having overcome them, to his Enemies, without Ransome, or deigning so much as to bind them by Oath, if not to favour him, at least no more to bear Arms against him. He has three or four times taken some of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Prisoners, and as oft set them at Liberty. <hi>Pompey</hi> declar'd all those to be <hi>Enemies</hi> who did not follow him to the War, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd all those to be his <hi>Friends</hi> who sate still and did not actually take Arms against him. To such Captains of his as run away from him to go over to the other side, he sent moreover their Arms, Horses, and Equipage. The <hi>Cities</hi> he had taken by force, he left at full liberty to take which side they pleas'd, imposing no other <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> upon them but the memory of his Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:53645:669" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Clemency. He gave strict and express Charge the day of his great Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> that without the utmost necessity no one should lay a hand upon the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> These, in my Opinion, were very hazardous Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and 'tis no wonder if those in our <hi>Civil War,</hi> who, like him, fight against the ancient estate of their Country, do not follow his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they are extraordinary means, and that only appertain to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fortune, and to his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fore-sight in the conduct of Affairs. When I consider the incomparable Grandeur of his Soul, I excuse Victory that it could not disengage it self from him, even in so unjust and so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Cause.</p>
                     <p>To return to his Clemency; we have many natural Examples in the time of his Government; when all things being reduc'd to his Power, he had no more need to dissemble. <hi>Caius Memmius</hi> had writ very severe Orations against him, which he had as sharply answer'd: yet did not soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbear to use his interest to make him <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul. Caius Calvus,</hi> who had compos'd several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Epigrams against him, having employ'd many of his Friends to mediate a Reconciliation with him, <hi>Caesar</hi> voluntarily perswaded himself to write first to him. And our good <hi>Catullus,</hi> who had so rudely ruffled him under the name of <hi>Mamurra,</hi> coming to make his excuses to him, he made him the same day sit at his Table. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intelligence of some who spoke ill of him, he did no more, but only in a publick Oration declare that he had notice of it. He also less
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:53645:670" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear'd his Enemies than he hated them. Some Conspiracies and Cabals that were made against his Life, being discover'd to him, he satisfied himself in publishing by Proclamation that they were known to him, without further prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Conspirators.</p>
                     <p>As to the respect he had to his Friends; <hi>Caius Oppius,</hi> being with him upon a Journey, and finding himself ill, he left him the only Lodging he had for himself, and lay all Night upon the hard Ground in the open Air. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his Justice; he put a beloved Servant of his to Death for lying with a noble <hi>Roman</hi>'s Wife, though there was no complaint made. Never had man more Moderation in his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor more Resolution in his adverse Fortune. But all these good Inclinations were stifled and spoil'd by his furious Ambition,<note place="margin">Ambition the only ruine of <hi>Caesars</hi> Actions.</note> by which he suffer'd himself to be so transported and misled, that a man may easily maintain, that that Passion guided the Rudder of all his Actions. Of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral man, it made him a publick Thief to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Bounty and Profusion, and made him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this vile and unjust saying, <hi>That if the most wicked and profligate Persons in the World had been faithful in serving him towards his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would cherish and prefer them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his Power, as much as the best of men</hi>: It intoxicated him with so excessive a Vanity, as to dare to boast in the Presence of his Fellow <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</hi> that he had made the great <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> a Name without Form, and without Body; and to say that his answer for the future
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:53645:670" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should stand for Laws, and also to receive the Body of the Senate comming towards him sitting; to suffer himself to be ador'd, and to to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honours paid to him in his own Presence. To conclude, this sole Vice, in my Opinion, spoil'd in him the most rich and beautiful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever was, and has render'd his Name abominable to all good Men, in that he would erect his Glory upon the Ruines of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the Subversion of the greatest and most flourishing Republick the World shall ever see.</p>
                     <p>There might on the contrary many examples be produc'd of great men whom Pleasures have made to neglect the conduct of their Affairs, as <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and others; but where <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> should be in equal Balance, and come to justle with equal Forces, I make no doubt but the last would win the prize.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my Subject; 'Tis much to bridle our Appetites by the Discourse of Reason, or by Violence to contain our Members within their Duty: but to lash our selves for our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Interest, and not only to divest our selves of the charming Passion that tickles us with the Pleasure we feel of being agreeable to others, and courted and beloved of every one; but also to conceive a hatred against the Graces that produce that effect, and to condemn our Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty because it enflames others; of this I confess I have met with few Examples: this indeed is one. <hi>Spurina,</hi> a young man of <hi>Tuscany,</hi>

being endow'd with a singular Beauty, and so excessive, that the chastest Eyes could not chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold its Raies; not contenting himself with leaving so much flame and feaver as he every where kindled, without relief, enter'd into a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious spite against himself, and those great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments Nature had so liberally conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; as if a man were responsible to himself for the Faults of others: and purposely slash'd and disfigur'd, with many Wounds and Scars, the perfect Simmetry and Proportion that Nature had so curiously imprinted in his Face. To give my free Opinion, I more admire than honour such Actions. Such Excesses are enemies to my Rules. The design was Conscientious and Good, but certainly a little defective in Prudence. What! if his Deformity serv'd afterwards to make others guilty of the Sin of Hatred, or Contempt, or of Envy, at the Glory of so commendable an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of Calumny, interpreting this Humour a mad Ambition! Is there any Form from whence Vice cannot, if it will, extract occasion to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it self one way or another? It had been
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:53645:671" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more just, and also more noble, to have made of these Gifts of God a Subject of regularity and exemplary Virtue. They who retire themselves from the common Offices, from that infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Vice, and manifest Rules that fetter a man of exact honesty in the Civil Life, are in my opinion very discreet; what peculiar sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Constraint soever they impose upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in so doing. 'Tis in some sort a kind of dying to avoid the Pain of living well. They may have another reward, but the reward of the difficulty I fancy they can never have, nor that in uneasiness there can be any thing beyond keeping himself upright in the waves of the World, truly and exactly performing all parts of his Duty. 'Tis peradventure more easie to live clean from the whole Sex, than to maintain a man's self exactly in all points in the Society of a Wife. And a man may more incuriously slip into want than abundance duly dispenc'd. Custom, carried on according to Reason, has in it more of sharpness than abstinence. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is a Virtue that has more work than Sufferance. The well living of <hi>Scipio</hi> has a thousand fashions, that of <hi>Diogenes</hi> but one.

                     </head>
                     <p>'TIS said of many great Leaders, that they have had certain Books in particular esteem, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Homer, Scipio Affricanus, Xenophon, Marcus Brutus, Polibius, Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Philip de Commines,</hi> and 'tis said, that in our times <hi>Machiavel</hi> is elsewhere in Repute; but the late <hi>Mareschal Strossy,</hi> who took <hi>Caesar</hi> for his Man, doubtless made the best choice, being that that Book in truth ought to be the Breviary of every great Souldier, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true and most excellent Pattern of all Military Art. And moreover, God knows with what Grace and Beauty he has embellish'd that rich Matter, with so pure, delicate, and perfect Expression, that, in my Opinion, there are no Writings in the World comparable to his, as to that. I will set down some rare and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Passages of his Wars that remain in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>His Army, being in some Consternation upon the Rumour that was spread of the great <hi>Forces</hi> that King <hi>Juba</hi> was leading against him; instead of abating the Apprehension which his Souldiers had conceived at the News, and of lessening the Forces of the Enemy, having call'd them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to encourage and reassure them, he took a quite contrary way to what we are us'd to do,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:53645:672" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for he told them that they needed no more to trouble themselves with enquiring after the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>Forces,</hi> for that he was certainly inform'd thereof, and then told them of a number much surpassing both the truth and the report that was rumour'd in his Army; following the advice of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi>; forasmuch as the imposture is not of so great importance to find an Enemy weaker than we expected, than to find him real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very strong, after having been made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was weak. It was always his use to accustom his Souldiers simply to obey,<note place="margin">The Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Souldiers.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking upon them to controul, or so much as to speak of their Captains designs; which he never communicated to them but upon the point of Execution, and took a delight, if they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd any thing of what he intended, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to change his <hi>Orders</hi> to deceive them; and to that purpose would often, when he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd his Quarters in a place, pass forward and lengthen his days <hi>march,</hi> especially if it was foul Weather. The <hi>Swisse,</hi> in the beginning of his Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> having sent to him to demand a free passage over the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories; though resolv'd to hinder them by force, he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less spoke kindly to the Messengers, and took some respite to return an Answer, to make use of that time for the calling his Army together. These silly People did not know how good a Husband he was of his time: for he does often repeat, that it is the best part of a Captain to know how to make use of Occasions, and his diligence in his Exploits are in truth unheard of
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:53645:673" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and incredible. If he was not very conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in taking advantage of an Enemy under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Treaty of Agreement, he was as little in this, that he requir'd no other Virtue in a Souldier, but Valour only, and seldom punish'd any other Faults but Mutiny and Disobedience. He would oft after his Victories turn them loose to all sorts of Licence, dispensing them for some time from the Rules of Military Discipline, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, that he had Souldiers so well train'd up, that powder'd and perfum'd, they would run furiously to the fight. In truth he lov'd to have them richly arm'd, and made them wear engraved, gilded, and damask'd Arms, to the end that the care of saving their Arms might engage them to a more obstinate defence. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, he call'd them by the name of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Souldiers, which we yet use; which his Successor <hi>Augustus</hi> reform'd, supposing he had only done it upon Necessity, and to cajole those who only follow'd him as Volunters;

<pb n="645" facs="tcp:53645:673"/>
                        <hi>Caesar</hi> mixt great Severity to keep them in awe. The ninth <hi>Legion</hi> having mutin'd near to <hi>Placentia,</hi> he ignominiously casheer'd them, though <hi>Pompey</hi> was then yet on foot, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them not again to Grace till after many Supplications. He quieted them more by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Boldness than by gentle ways. In that place where he speaks of his Passage over the <hi>Rhine</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> he says, that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unworthy of the Honour of <hi>Roman</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to waft over his Army in Vessels, he built a <hi>Bridge</hi> that they might pass over dry foot.

I have also observ'd this, that he set a great value upon his Exhortations to the Souldiers before the fight; for where he would shew that he was either surpriz'd, or reduc'd to a Necessity of fighting, he always brings in this, that he had not so much as liesure to Harangue his Army. Before that great Battel with those of <hi>Tournay, Caesar,</hi> says he, having given order for every thing else, presently ran where Fortune carried him to encourage his People, and meeting with the tenth <hi>Legion,</hi> had no more time to say any thing to them but this, that they should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their wonted Valour, not be astonish'd, but bravely sustain the Enemies encounter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy was already approach'd within a Darts cast, he gave the signal of Battel; and
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:53645:674" rendition="simple:additions"/>
going suddenly thence elsewhere to encourage others, he found that they were already engag'd. His Tongue has indeed done him notable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice upon several Occasions, and his Military Eloquence was in his own time so highly repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that many of his Army writ down his <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues</hi> as he spoke them, by which means there were Volumes of them collected that continued a long time after him. He had so particular a Grace in speaking, that they who were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly acquainted with him, and <hi>Augustus,</hi> amongst others, hearing those Orations read, could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish even to the Phrases and Words that were none of his. The first time that he went out of <hi>Rome</hi> with any publick Command, he arriv'd in eight days at the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> having with him in his Coach a Secretary or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him who were continually writing, and him that carried his Sword behind him. And certainly, though a man did nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his way, he could hardly have perform'd that Journey so soon.

                     <p>And indeed he was a General in the flower and first heat of his Youth, whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> took up the Trade at a ripe and well advanc'd Age. To which may moreover be added, that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was of a more sanguine, hot, and cholerick Constitution, apt to push him on to such Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, which he also inflam'd with Wine, from which <hi>Caesar</hi> was very abstinent: but where necessary occasion requir'd, never did any man venture his Person more than he: so much that for my part, methinks, I read in many of his Exploits a determinate Resolution to throw himself away,<note place="margin">The great Resolution of <hi>Caesar</hi> in several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</note> to avoid the shame of being overcome. In his great Battel with those of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> he charg'd up to the head of the Enemies without his Shield, as he was surpriz'd, seeing the Van of his own <hi>Army</hi> to begin to give ground, which has also several times befall'n him. Hearing that his People where besieg'd, he pass'd through the Enemies Army in disguise to go encourage them with his Presence. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cross'd over to <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> with very slender Forces, and seeing the remainder of his <hi>Army,</hi> which he left to <hi>Antonius</hi> his Conduct, slow in following him, he attempted alone to repass the Sea in a very great Storm; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately stole away to fetch the rest of his Forces, the Ports on the other side being seiz'd by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> and the whole Sea being in his Possession.
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:53645:676" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And as to what he perform'd by force of hand, there are very many Exploits that in hazard exceed all the Rules of War: for with how small means did he undertake to subdue the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterwards to attaque the Forces of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Juba,</hi> ten times greater than his? These People have had I know not what of more than humane Confidence in their Fortune, and he was wont to say, that men must execute, and not deliberate upon Enterprizes. After the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> when he had sent his Army away before him into <hi>Asia,</hi> and was passing in one single Vessel the Streight of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> he met <hi>Lucius Cassius</hi> at Sea with ten tall men of War, where he had the Courage not only to stay his coming, but to stand up with him, and summon him to yield, and did his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. Having undertaken that furious siege of <hi>Alexia,</hi> where there were fourscore thousand men in Garrison, and that all <hi>Gaul</hi> was in arms to raise the siege, having set an Army on foot of a hundred and nine thousand <hi>Horse,</hi> and of two hundred and forty thousand <hi>Foot,</hi> what a Boldness and mad Confidence was it in him, that he would not give over his Attempt, and retire in two so invincible Difficulties? which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he underwent: and after having won that great Battel against those without, soon reduc'd those within to his Mercy. The same hapned to <hi>Lucullus</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> against King <hi>Tigranes,</hi> but the Condition of the <hi>Enemy</hi> was not the same, considering the Effeminacy of those with whom <hi>Lucullus</hi> had to deal. I will
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:53645:676" rendition="simple:additions"/>
here set down two rare and extraordinary Events concerning this Siege of <hi>Alexia</hi>; one, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> having drawn their Powers together to encounter <hi>Caesar,</hi> after they had made a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral muster of all their Forces, resolv'd in their <hi>Councel of War</hi> to dismiss a good part of this great multitude, that they might not fall into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This Example of fearing being too many is new; but to take it right, it stands to reason that the Body of an Army should be of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate greatness, and regulated to certain bounds, both out of respect to the difficulty of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for them, and the difficulty of Governing and keeping them in Order. At least it is very easie to make it appear by Example,<note place="margin">Monstrous Armies of no great Effect.</note> that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies so monstrous in number have seldom done any thing to purpose. According to the saying of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon, 'Tis not the number of men, but the number of good men that gives the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>: the remainder serving rather to trouble than assist. And <hi>Bajazet</hi> principally grounded his Resolution of giving <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> Battel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Opinion of all his Captains, upon this, that his Enemies numberless number of men gave him assured hopes of Confusion. <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">That great numbers of Men cause Confusion.</note> a very good and expert Judge in such matters, was wont to say, that ten or twelve thousand faithful fighting men were sufficient to a good Leader to secure his Reputation in all sorts of Military Occasions. The other thing I will here record, which seems to be contrary both to Custom and Rules of War, is, that <hi>Vercingentorix,</hi> who was made General of all the parts of the
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:53645:677" rendition="simple:additions"/>
revolted <hi>Gaule,</hi> should go shut up himself in <hi>Alexia</hi>: for he who has the command of a whole Country, ought never to engage his Person but in case of the last Extremity, that the only place he had left is in concern, and that the only hope he had left was in the defence of that City; Otherwise he ought to keep himself always at Liberty, that he may have means to provide in general for all parts of his Government.</p>
                     <p>To return to <hi>Caesar.</hi> He grew in time more slow, and more considerate, as his Friend <hi>Oppius</hi> does witness: conceiving that he ought not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to hazard the Glory of so many Victories, which one blow of Fortune might deprive him of. 'Tis what the <hi>Italians</hi> say, when they would reproach the rashness and fool hardiness of young People, calling them <hi>Bisognosi d'honore, necessitous of Honour,</hi> and that being in so great a want and dearth of Reputation, they have reason to seek it at what price soever, which they ought not to do, who have acquir'd enough already. There might reasonably there be some Moderation, and some Saciety in this Thirst and Appetite of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well as in other things: and there are enow who practice it. He was far remote from the religious Observation of the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> who would never prevail in their Wars, but by dint of Truce, and simple Valour; and yet he was more conscientious than we should be in these days, and did not approve all sorts of means to obtain a Victory. In the War against <hi>Ariovistus,</hi> whilst he was parlying with him, there hapned a great tumult, which was occasioned by
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:53645:677" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fault of <hi>Ariovistus</hi> his <hi>Light-Horse,</hi> wherein, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>hough <hi>Caesar</hi> saw he had a very great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Enemy, he would make no use on't, lest he should have been reproach'd with a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous proceeding. He was always wont to wear a rich Garment, and of a shining Colour in Battel, that he might be the more remarkable, and better observ'd. He always carried a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand over his Souldiers, and kept them clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser together when near an Enemy. When the antient <hi>Greeks</hi> would accuse any one of extream insufficiency, they would say in common <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,</hi> that he could neither read nor swim; he was of the same Opinion, that swimming was of great use in War, and himself found it so, for being to use Diligence, he commonly swam over the Rivers in his way; for he lov'd to march on foot, as also did <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. Being in <hi>Egypt</hi> forc'd, to save himself to go into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Boat, and so many People leaping in with him, that it was in danger of sinking, he chose rather to commit himself to the <hi>Sea,</hi> and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his Fleet, which lay two hundred paces off, holding in his left hand his Tablets, and drawing his Coat-Armour in his Teeth, that it might not fall into the Enemies hand, by swimming at a pretty advanc'd Age. Never had any <hi>General</hi> so much Credit with his Souldiers: In the beginning of the <hi>Civil-Wars,</hi> his <hi>Centurions</hi> offer'd him to find every one a man at <hi>Arms</hi> at his own charge, and the Foot Souldiers to serve him at their own expence; those who were most at their ease more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over undertaking to defray the most necessitous.
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:53645:678" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The late <hi>Admiral Chastillion</hi> shewed us the like Example in our Civil War;<note place="margin">Souldiers Mercenary.</note> for the <hi>French</hi> of his Army laid out Money out of their own Purses to pay the Strangers that were with them. There are but rarely found Examples of so ardent and so ready an Affection amongst the Souldiers of elder times, who kept themselves strictly to their Rules of War.

                     <head>CHAP. XXXV. Of three good Women.</head>
                     <p>THey are not by the dozen, as every one knows, and especially in the Duties of Marriage; for that is a bargain full of so many nice Circumstances, that 'tis hard a Womans Will should long endure such a restraint. Men, tho' their condition be something better under that tye, have yet enough to do. The true touch and test of a happy Marriage respects the time of their Cohabitation only, if it has been constantly mild, loyal, and commodious. In our Age Women commonly reserve the publication of their good Offices, and their vehement affection towards their Husbands untill they have lost them, or at least, till then defer the Testimonies of their good Will. A too slow Testimony, and that comes too late; by which they rather manifest that they never lov'd them till dead. Their Life is nothing but Trouble, their Death full of Love and Courtesie. As Fathers conceal their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their Children, Women likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal theirs from their Husbands to maintain a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Respect. This mystery is not for my pallat; 'tis to much purpose that they scratch themselves and tear their Hair. I whisper in a Wayting-woman or a Secretaries Ear, <hi>how were they? how did they live together?</hi> I always have that good Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my head, <hi>jactantius maerent, quae minus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. They make the most ado who are least concern'd.</hi>
                        <pb n="657" facs="tcp:53645:679" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Their whimpering is offensive to the living, and vain to the dead: we should willingly give them leave to laugh after we are dead, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they will smile upon us whilst we are alive. Is it not to make a man revive in spite, that she who spit in my face whilst I was, shall come to kiss my feet when I am no more? If there be any Honour in lamenting a Husband, it only appertains to those who smil'd upon them whilst they had them, let those who wept during their Lives laugh at their Deaths, as well outwardly as within. Moreover, never regard those blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd Eyes, and that pittiful Voice; but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Deportments, her Complexion, and the plumpness of her Cheecks under all those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Veils; 'tis there the discovery is to be made. There are few who do not mend upon't, and Health is a quality that cannot lye: that starch'd and ceremonious Countenance looks not so much back as forward, and is rather intended to get a new one than to lament the old. When I was a Boy, a very beautiful and virtuous <hi>Lady,</hi> who is yet living, and the Widow of a <hi>Prince,</hi> had I know not what more Ornament in her Dress than our Laws of Widow-hood will well allow, which being reproach'd withall as a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, she made Answer, <hi>That it was because she was resolv'd to have no more Friendships, and would never marry again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have here, not at all dissenting from our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, made choice of three Women, who have also express'd the utmost of their Goodness and Affections about their Husbands deaths; yet are
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:53645:680" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they Examples of another kind than are now in Use, and so severe, as will hardly be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Imitation.</p>
                     <p>The younger <hi>Pliny</hi> had near unto a House of his in <hi>Italy</hi> a Neighbour who was exceedingly tormented with certain Ulcers in his private Parts. His Wife seeing him so long to languish, intreated that he would give her leave to see, and at leisure to consider of the condition of his Disease, and that she would freely tell him what she Thought: This Permission being obtain'd, and she having curiously examin'd the Business, found it impossible he could ever be cur'd, and that all he was to hope for or expect, was a great while to linger out a painful and miserable Life, and therefore, as the most sure and sovereign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, resolutely advis'd him to kill himself. But finding him a little tender and backward in so rude an Attempt: <hi>Do not think my Friend,</hi> said she, <hi>that the Torments I see thee endure are not as sensible to me as to thy self, and that to deliver my self from them, I will not my self make use of the same Remedy I have prescrib'd to thee. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company thee in the Cure as I have done in the Disease; fear nothing, but believe that we shall have pleasure in this Passage, that is, to free us from so many Miseries, and we will go happily together.</hi> Which having said, and rous'd up her Husband's Courage, she resolv'd that they should throw themselves headlong into the Sea out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that lean'd over it; and that she might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the last the loyal and vehement Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith she had embrac'd him during his
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:53645:680" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Life, she would yet have him dye in her Arms; but for fear they should fail, and lest they should leave their hold in the fall, and through fear, she tyed herself fast to him by the waste, and so gave up her own Life to procure her Husband's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. This was a mean Woman, and even amongst that condition of People, 'tis no very new thing to see some rare Examples of Virtue.

The other two were noble and rich, where Examples of Vertue are rarely lodg'd. <hi>Arria,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Cecinna Petus,</hi> a Consular Person, was the Mother of another <hi>Arria,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Tharsea Petus,</hi> he whose Vertue was so renown'd in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> and by means of this Son-in-Law, the Grand-mother of <hi>Fannia</hi>: for the resemblance of the names of these Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and their fortunes, have made many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.

                        </note> having been taken prisoner by some of the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> his People, after <hi>Scribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus</hi> his Defeat, whose Party he had embrac'd in the War, begg'd of those who were to carry him prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they would take her into their Ship, where she should be of much less charge and trouble to them than a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons they must otherwise have to attend her Husband, and that she alone would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:53645:681"/>
to serve him in his Chamber, his Kitchen, and all other Offices. But they refus'd her, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she put her self into a Fisher boat she hir'd on a sudden, and in that manner from <hi>Slavonia</hi> followed him. Being come to <hi>Rome, Junia,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Scribonianus,</hi> one day, for the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of their Fortune, accosting her in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's presence; she rudely repuls'd her with these words, <hi>I,</hi> said she, <hi>speak to thee, or give ear to any thing thou sayst; to thee in whose lap</hi> Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonianus <hi>was slain, and thou art yet alive?</hi> These words, with several other signs, gave her Friends to understand that she would undoubtedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch herself, impatient of supporting her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Fortune. And <hi>Thrasea,</hi> her Son-in-Law, beseeching her not to throw away herself, and saying to her, What? If I should run the same Fortune that <hi>Cecinna</hi> has done, would you that your Daughter, my Wife, should do the same: <hi>Would I?</hi> reply'd she, <hi>Yes, yes, I would, if she had liv'd as long, and in as good intelligence with thee as I have done with my Husband.</hi> These Answers made them more careful of her, and to have a more watchful Eye to her Deportments. One day, having said to those that look'd to her; <hi>'Tis to much purpose that you take all this pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me; you may indeed make me to dye an ill death, but to keep me from dying is not in your power</hi>; she suddenly furious started from a Chair wherein she sate, and with all her force ran her head against the wall, by which blow being laid flat in a swoon, and very much woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, after they had again with much ado brought
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:53645:681"/>
her to her self: <hi>I told you,</hi> said she, <hi>that if you refused me some easie way of dying, I should find out another how painful soever.</hi> The conclusion of so admirable a Virtue was thus: Her Husband <hi>Petus,</hi> not having Resolution enough of his own to dispatch himself, as he was by the Emperour's cruelty enjoyn'd, one day amongst others, after having first employ'd all the Reasons and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations which she thought most prevalent to perswade him to it, she snatch'd the Poignard he wore from his side, and holding it ready in her hand, for the conclusion of her Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Do thus <hi>Petus,</hi> said she, and in the same instant giving herself a mortal stab in the Breast, and then drawing it out of the wound, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to him, ending her Life with this noble, generous, and immortal Saying, <hi>Paete non dolet. Petus,</hi> it hurts not; having strength to pronounce no more but those three never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten words.

The Action was much more noble in it self, and of a braver sence than the <hi>Poet</hi> could express it; for she was so far from being deterr'd by the
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:53645:682" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Cruelty of her Husbands Wound and Death, and her own, that she had been the Promotress, and had given the Advice: but having perform'd this high and courageous Enterprize for her Husbands only Convenience, she had even in the last gasp of her Life no other concern but for him, and of dispossessing him of the fear of dying with her. <hi>Petus</hi> presently struck himself to the Heart with the same Weapon, asham'd, I believe, to have stood in need of so dear and pretious an Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompeia Paulina,</hi> a young and very noble <hi>Roman Lady,</hi> had married <hi>Seneca</hi> in his extream old Age. <hi>Nero,</hi> his fine <hi>Pupil,</hi> sent his Guards to him to denounce the Sentence of Death, which was perform'd after this manner. When the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours of those times had condemn'd any man of Quality, they sent to him by their Officers to choose what Death he would, and to execute it within such or such a time, which was limited according to the mettle of their Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to a shorter, or a longer respite, that they might therein have better leisure to dispose their Affairs, and sometimes depriving them of the means of doing it by the shortness of the time; and if the condemn'd seem'd unwilling to submit to the Order, they had People ready at hand to execute it either by cutting the Veins of the Arms and Legs, or by compelling them by force to swallow a draught of Poison. But Persons of Honour would not stay this Necessity, but made use of their own Physicians and Chirurgeons for this purpose. <hi>Seneca,</hi> with a calm and steady
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:53645:682"/>
Countenance heard their charge, and presently call'd for Paper to write his <hi>Will,</hi> which being by the Captain deny'd, he turn'd himself towards his Friends, saying to them, <hi>Since I cannot leave you any other Acknowledgment of the Obligation I have to you, I leave you at least the best thing I have, namely<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Image of my Life and Manners, which I intreat you to keep in Memory of me; that so doing you may acquire the Glory of sincere and real Friends.</hi> And therewithall, one while ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing the Sorrow he saw them in with gentle Words, and presently raising his Voice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; <hi>What,</hi> said he, <hi>are become of all our brave Philosophical Precepts? What are become of all the Provisions we have so many years laid up against the Accidents of Fortune? Is</hi> Nero's <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty unknown to us? What could we expect from him who had murther'd his Mother, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that he should put his Governour to Death who had nourish'd and bred him?</hi> After having spoke these Words in general, he turn'd himself towards his Wife, and embracing her fast in his Arms, as her Heart and Strength failing her, she was ready to sink down with Grief, he beg'd of her, for his sake, to bear this Accident with a little more Patience, telling her, that now the hour was come wherein he was to shew, not by Argument and Discourse, but by effect, the Fruit he had acquir'd by his Studies, and that he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrac'd his Death, not only without Grief, but moreover with exceeding Joy. <hi>Wherefore my dearest,</hi> said he, <hi>do not dishonour it with thy Tears, that it may not seem as if thou lov'st thy
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:53645:683"/>
self more than my Reputation. Moderate thy Grief, and comfort thy self in the knowledge thou hast had of me and my Actions, leading the remainder of thy Life in the same virtuous manner thou hast hitherto done.</hi> To which <hi>Paulina,</hi> having a little recover'd her Spirits, and warm'd her Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the heat of a most generous Affection, reply'd, <hi>No Seneca,</hi> said she, <hi>I am not a Woman to suffer you to go alone in such a Necessity: I will not have you think that the virtuous Examples of your Life have not yet taught me how to dye, and when can I ever better, or more decently do it, or more to my own desire, than with you? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assure your self I will go along with you. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> then taking this noble and generous Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his Wife exceeding kindly at her hands, and also willing to free himself from the fear of leaving her expos'd to the Mercy and Cruelty of his Enemies after his Death: <hi>I have Paulina,</hi> said he, <hi>sufficiently instructed thee in what would serve thee happily to live; but thou more covet'st I see the Honour of dying: in truth I will not grudge it thee, the Constancy and Resolution in our common end are the same, but the Beauty and Glory of thy part is much greater.</hi> Which being said, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons at the same time open the Veins of both their Arms, but being those of <hi>Seneca</hi> were more shrunk up, as well with Age as Abstinence, made his Blood to flow too slowly, he moreover commanded them to open the Veins of his Thighs; and lest the Torments he endur'd might ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate his Wives Heart, and also to free himself from the Affliction of seeing her in so sad a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:53645:683"/>
after having taken a very affectionate leave of her, he intreated she would suffer them to carry her into her Chamber, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did; but all these Incisions being not yet enough to make him dye, he commanded <hi>Statius Anneus,</hi> his Physician, to give him a draught of Poison, which had not much better Effect; for by Reason of the weakness and coldness of his Limbs, it could not arrive at his Heart. Wherefore they were forc'd to superadd a very hot Bath, and then feeling his end approach, whilst he had Breath, he continued excellent Discourses upon the Subject of his present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which the Secretaries writ down so long as they could hear his Voice, and his last Words were long after in high Honour and Esteem amongst Men, and it was a great loss to us that they were not reserv'd down to our times. Then feeling the last pangs of Death, with the bloody Water of the Bath he bath'd his Head, saying, <hi>This Water I dedicate to</hi> Jupiter <hi>the Deliverer. Nero,</hi> being presently advertis'd of all this, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest the Death of <hi>Paulina,</hi> who was one of the best descended <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and against whom he had no particular unkindness, should turn to his reproach, he sent back Orders in all haste to bind up her Wounds, which her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants without his knowledge had done before; she being already half dead, and without all manner of Sence. Thus, though she liv'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her own design, it was very honourably, and according to her own Virtue, her pale Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion ever after manifesting how much Life was run from her Veins.</p>

                        <pb n="666" facs="tcp:53645:684"/>These are my three very true Stories, which I find as diverting, and as Tragick as any of those we make of our own Heads wherewith to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the common People; and I wonder that they who are addicted to such Relations, do not rather cull out ten thousand very fine Stories, which are to be found in very good Authours, that would save them the trouble of Invention, and be more useful and diverting. And who would make a Collection of them, would need to add nothing of his own, but the Connexion only, as it were the soder of another Metal; and might by this means embody a great many true Events of all sorts, disposing and diversifying of them according as the Beauty of the Work should require, after the same manner almost as <hi>Ovid</hi> has made up his <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> of the infinite number of various <hi>Fables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these last couple this is moreover worthy of Consideration, that <hi>Paulina</hi> voluntarily offer'd to lose her Life for the love of her Husband,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Seneca</hi>'s great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Wife.</note> and that her Husband had formerly also forbore dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the love of her. There is no just coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise in this exchange as to us; but according to his Stoical Humour, I presume he thought he had done as much for her, in prolonging his Life upon her account, as if he had died for her. In one of his Letters to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> after he has given him to understand, that being seiz'd with an <hi>Ague</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> he presently took Coach to go to a House he had in the Country, contrary to his Wives Opinion, who would by all means persuade him to stay: and that he had told her,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:53645:684" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the <hi>Ague</hi> he was seis'd with, was not a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Body, but the Place; it follows thus. <hi>She let me go,</hi> says he, <hi>with giving me a strict charge of my Health. Now I, who know that her Life is involv'd in mine, begin to make much of my self, that I may preserve her. And I lose the priviledge my Age has given me of being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and resolute in many things; when I call to mind, that in this old Fellow there is a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who is interested in his Health. And since I cannot persuade her to love me more courageously, she makes me more sollicitously love my self: for we must allow something to honest Affections, and sometimes, though occasions importune us to the contrary, we must call back Life, even though it be with Torment: we must hold the Soul fast in our Teeth, since the Rule of Living amongst good men is not so long as they please, but as long as they ought: He that loves not his Wife and his Friend so well as to prolong his Life for them, but will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately dye, is too delicate and too effeminate: the Soul must impose this upon it self, when the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Friends does so require: we must some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lend our selves to our Friends, and when we would dye for our selves, must break that Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them. 'Tis a Testimony of Grandeur of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to return to Life for the Consideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as many excellent Persons have done: and 'tis a mark of singular good nature to preserve old Age (of which the greatest convenience is the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of its duration, and a more stout and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful use of Life) when a man perceives that this Office is pleasing, agreeable, and useful to some
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:53645:685" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Person by whom we are very much belov'd. And a man reaps by it a very pleasing Reward; for what can be more delightful than to be so dear to his Wife, as upon her account he shall become dearer to himself? Thus has my</hi> Paulina <hi>loaded me not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her Fears, but my own; it has not been sufficient to consider how resolutely I could dye, but I have also consider'd how irresolutely she would bear my Death. I am enforc'd to live, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to live is Magnanimity.</hi> These are his own Words, as excellent as they every where use to be.</p>

                     <p>IF I should be ask'd my Opinion and choice of all the men who have come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I should make answer, That methinks I find three more excellent than all the rest.

                     <p>'Tis contrary to the order of <hi>Nature</hi> that he has made the most excellent Production that can possibly be, for the ordinary birth of things is imperfect; they usually thrive, and gather strength by growing: whereas he has rendred the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Poesie</hi> and other Sciences mature, perfect,

and accomplish'd at first. And for this Reason he may be call'd the first and the last of <hi>Poets,</hi> according to the fair Testimony Antiquity has left us of him, <hi>That as there was none before him whom he could imitate, so there has been none since that could imitate him.</hi> His words, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are the only words that have Motion and Action, and are the only substantial words. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, having found a rich <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> amongst <hi>Darius</hi> his Spoils, gave order it should be reserv'd for him to keep his <hi>Homer</hi> in: saying, that he was the best and most faithful <hi>Counsellor</hi> he had in his Military Affairs. For the same reason it was, that <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Anaxandridas</hi> said, that the <hi>Lacedaemonian Poet</hi> was the best Master for the Discipline of War. This singular and particular Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is also left of him in the Judgment of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> that he is the only <hi>Author</hi> in the World, that never glutted nor disgusted his <hi>Readers,</hi> presenting himself always another thing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways flourishing in some new Grace. That wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> having ask'd one who pretended to Learning for a Book of <hi>Homer,</hi> gave him a box of the Ear because he had none, which he thought as scandalous, as to take one of our Priests without a <hi>Breviary.

                        <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Homer</hi> of <hi>Philosophers?</hi> Besides, what Glory can be compar'd to his?

Our Children are call'd by names that he feign'd above three thousand years ago. Who is ignorant of the Story of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> and <hi>Achilles?</hi> Not only some particular <hi>Families,</hi> but most <hi>Nations</hi> also seek original in his Inventions. <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the second of that Name, <hi>Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> writing to our <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the second; <hi>I am astonish'd,</hi> says he, <hi>that the</hi> Italians <hi>should appear against me, considering that we have our common descent from the</hi> Trojans, <hi>and that it concerns me as well as it does them to revenge the blood of</hi> Hector <hi>upon the</hi> Greeks, <hi>whom they countenance against me.</hi> Is it not a noble <hi>Farce</hi> wherein <hi>Kings, Republicks,</hi> and <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> have so many Ages play'd their parts, and to which the vast <hi>Vniverse</hi> serves for a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?

Actions of his may peradventure fall under censure.

                     <p>The third, in my opinion, and the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all, is <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> Of glory he has not near so much as the other two, (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is but a part of the substance of the thing) of Valour and Resolution, not of that sort which is push'd on by Ambition, but of that which Wisdom and Reason can raise in a regular Soul, he had all that could be imagin'd. Of this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his, he has, in my thoughts, given as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proof, as either <hi>Alexander</hi> himself or <hi>Caesar</hi>:
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:53645:689" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for although his Expeditions were neither so frequent and so renown'd, they were yet, if duely consider'd in all their circumstances, as important, as bravely fought, and carry'd with them as manifest testimony of Valour and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Conduct, as those of any whatever. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have done him the honour, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to pronounce him the greatest man of their Nation; and to be the first of <hi>Greece,</hi> is easily to be the first of the World. As to his Knowledge, we have this ancient judgment of him, <hi>That never any man knew so much, and spake so little as he.</hi> For he was of the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Sect. But when he did speak, never any man spake better; an excellent Orator, and of powerful insinuation. But as to his Manners and Conscience, he has infinitely surpass'd all men that ever undertook the management of Affairs; for in this one thing, which ought chiefly to be consider'd, that alone truly denotes us for what we are, and that alone I counter-balance with all the rest put together, he comes not short of any Philosopher whatever, not even of <hi>Socrates</hi> himself. Innocency in this man is a quality, peculiar, sovereign, constant, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and incorruptible, compar'd to which, it appears in <hi>Alexander</hi> subject to something else above it, uncertain, variable, effeminate, and accidental. <hi>Antiquity</hi> has judg'd, that in thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sifting all the other great <hi>Captains,</hi> there is found in every one some peculiar quality that illustrates his Name. In this man only there is a full and equal vertue throughout, that leaves
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:53645:690" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing to be wish'd for in him, whether in private or publick Employment, whether in Peace or War, whether gloriously to live or dye. I do not know any Form or Fortune of Man that I so much honour and love. 'Tis true, that I look upon his obstinate Poverty, as it is set out by his best Friends, a little too scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and nice. And this is the only action, tho high in it self, and well worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I find so severe as not to desire to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate my self to the degree it was in him.

Oh! what an injury has Time done me, to deprive me of the sight of two of the most noble Lives, which, by the common consent of all the World, one the greatest of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Romans,</hi> were in all <hi>Plutarch.</hi> What a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! what a Workman! For a man that was no Saint, but, as we say, a gallant man, of civil and ordinary Manners, and of a moderate Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, the richest Life that I know, and full of the richest, and most to be desir'd Parts, all things consider'd, is, in my opinion, that of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades.</hi> But as to what concerns <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> I will here, for the example of an excessive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, add some of his Opinions. He declar'd, that the greatest satisfaction he ever had in his whole Life was, the contentment he gave his Father and Mother in his Victory of <hi>Leuctra</hi>; wherein his deference is great, preferring their

                        </note> so just and so full of so glorious an Action. He did not think it lawful, even to restore the Liberty of his Country, to kill a man without knowing a cause: which made him so cold in the enterprize of his Companion <hi>Pelopidas</hi> for the relief of <hi>Thebes.</hi> He was also of Opinion, that men in Battel ought to avoid the encounter of a Friend that was on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side, and to spare him. And his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty even towards his Enemies themselves, having render'd him suspected to the <hi>Beotians</hi>; for that after he had miraculously forc'd the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to open him the Pass, which they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to defend at the entry into <hi>Morca,</hi> near unto <hi>Corinth,</hi> he contented himself with having charg'd thorough them, without pursuing them to the utmost, he had his Commission of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> taken from him. Very honourably upon such an account, and for the shame it was to them upon necessity afterwards to restore him to his command, and then to see how much upon him depended their Safety and Honour: Victory like a shadow attending him wherever he went; and indeed the Prosperity of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as being from him deriv'd, died with him.</p>

                     <p>THis fagotting up of divers pieces, is so od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compos'd, that I never set Pen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but when I have too much idle time, and never any where but at home; so that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd at several Interruptions and Intervals, as Occasions keep me sometimes many Months abroad. As to the rest, I never correct my first by any second Conceptions; I peradventure may alter a Word or so: but 'tis only to vary the Phrase, and not to destroy my former meaning. I have a mind to represent the progress of my Humour, that every one may see every piece as it came from the <hi>Forge.</hi> I could wish I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun sooner, and had taken more notice of the course of my Mutations. A Servant of mine, that I employ'd to transcribe for me, thought he had got a prize by stealing several pieces from me, wherewith he was best pleas'd; but it is my comfort, that he will be no greater a gainer, than I shall be a loser by the Theft. I am grown old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by seven or eight years since I begun; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has it been without some new Acquisition: I have in that time, by the Liberty of years, been acquainted with the Stone, a long Conversation, which time hardly wears off without some such Inconvenience. I could have been glad, that of other Infirmities Age has to present long liv'd

men, it had chosen some one that would have been more welcome to me, for it could not possibly have laid upon me a Disease, for which, even from my Infancy, I have had so great a Horror; and it is in truth of all the accidents of old Age, that of which I have ever been most afraid. I have often thought with my self, that I went on too far, and that in so long a Voyage, I should at last run my self into some misadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; I perceiv'd, and have oft enough declar'd, that it was time to knock off, and that Death was to be cut off in the sound and living part, according to the <hi>Chirurgions</hi> Rule in Amputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And that <hi>Nature</hi> made him pay very strict Usury, who did not in due time pay the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal. And yet I was so far from being ready, that in eighteen Months time, or thereabout, that I have been in this uneasie Condition, I have so inur'd my self to it, as to be content to live on in it; and have found wherein to comfort my self, and to hope: so much are men enslav'd to their miserable Being, that there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition so wretched they will not accept, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they may live: according to that of <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenas.</hi>

And <hi>Tamberlain</hi> with his foolish humanity pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated the fantastick cruelty he exercis'd upon <hi>Lepers,</hi> when he put all he could hear of to death, to deliver them, as he pretended, from the painful Life they liv'd. For there was not one of them who would not rather have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a triple Leprosie, than to be depriv'd of their Being. And <hi>Antisthenes</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> being very sick, and crying out, who will deliver me from these Evils? <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who was come to visit him, <hi>This,</hi> said he, presenting him a Knife, <hi>presently if thou wilt: I do not mean from my Life,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>but from my Disease.</hi> The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that only attaque the Mind, I am not so sensible of, as most other Men; and that partly out of Judgment: for the World looks upon several things as dreadful, or to be avoided at the expence of Life, that are almost indifferent to me: partly thorough a stupid and insensible Complexion I have in Accidents which do not point-blanck hit me; and that insensibility I look upon as one of the best parts of my natural Condition: but essential and corporeal pains I am very sensible of. And yet having long since foreseen them, though with a sight weak and delicate, and softned with the long and happy Health and Quiet that God has been pleas'd to give me the greatest part of my time, I had in my Imagination fancied them so insupportable, that in truth I was more afraid than I have since found I had cause: by which I am still more fortified in this belief, that most of the Faculties of the Soul, as we employ them, more trouble the
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:53645:692" rendition="simple:additions"/>
repose of Life, than they are any way useful to it. I am in conflict with the worst,<note place="margin">The Stone the most painful of all Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</note> the most sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the most painful, the most mortal, and the most irremediable of all Diseases. I have already had the tryal of five or six very long, and very painful fits, and yet I either flatter my self, or there is even in this estate what is very well to be endur'd by a man who has his Soul free from the fear of Death, and the Menaces, Conclusions and Consequences, which Physick is ever thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in our Ears. But the effect even of pain it self is not so sharp and intollerable as to put a man of understanding into impatience and despair. I have at least this advantage by my Stone, that what I could not hitherto wholly prevail upon my self to resolve upon, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling and acquainting my self with Death, it will perfect; for the more it presses upon and importunes me, I shall be so much the less afraid to dye. I had already gone so far as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love Life for Life's sake, but my pain will dissolve this Intelligence: and God grant that in the end, should the sharpness of it be once greater then I shall be able to bear, it does not throw me into the other no less vicious extream, to desire and wish to dye.</p>

                     <p>They are two Passions to be fear'd, but the one has its remedy much nearer at hand than the other. As to the rest, I have always found
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:53645:693" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Precept, that so exactly enjoyns a constant Countenance, and so disdainful and indifferent a Comportment in the toleration of Infirmities to be meerly Ceremonial. Why should <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> which only has respect to Life and its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, trouble it self about these external Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences? Let us leave that Care to <hi>Histrios</hi> and Masters of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> that set so great a value upon our Gestures. Let her, in God's name, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this vocal Frailty, if it be neither cordial nor stomachal to the Disease; and permit the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ways of expressing Grief by sighs, sobs, palpitations, and turning pale, that Nature has put out of our power. And provided the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage be undaunted, and the Expressions not soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of despair, let her be satisfied. What makes matter for the wringing of our hands, if we do not wring our Thoughts? She forms us for our selves, not for others, to be, not to seem: let her be satisfied with governing our Understandings, which she has taken upon her the care of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing; that in the fury of the Cholick she maintains the Soul in a condition to know it self, and to follow its accustom'd way: contending with, and enduring, not meanly truckling under Pain; mov'd and heated, not subdu'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd in the Contention; but capable of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and other things to a certain degree. In so extream Accidents, 'tis Cruelty to require so exact a Composedness. 'Tis no great matter what Faces we cut, if we find any ease by it: if the Body find it self reliev'd by complaining, let him go too: if Agitation eases him, let him tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

and toss at pleasure; if he finds the Disease evaporate (as some <hi>Physicians</hi> hold that it helps Women in delivery) extreamly to cry out, or if it do but amuse his Torments, let him roar aloud.

I relish my self in the midst of my Dolor, and have always found that I was in a Capacity to speak, think, and give a rational Answer as well as at any other time, but not so coldly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, being troubled and interrupted by the Pain. When I am look'd upon by my Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be in the greatest Torment, and that they therefore forbear to trouble me, I oft try my own strength, and my self set some Discourse on foot, the most remote I can contrive from my present condition.

I am a little roughly handled for a Learner, and with a sudden and sharp alteration, being fall'n in an instant from a very easie and happy condition of Life into the most uneasie and painful that can be imagin'd. For besides that it is a Disease very much to be fear'd in it self, it begins with me after a more sharp and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere manner than it uses to do with other men. My Fits come so thick upon me, that I am scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever at ease; and yet I have hitherto kept my mind so upright, that provided I can still continue it, I find my self in a much better condition of Life than a thousand others, who have no Fever, nor other Disease but what they create to themselves for want of meditation. There is a certain sort of crafty Humility that springs from Presumption: as this for Example, that we confess our Ignorance in many things, and are so courteous as to acknowledge, that there are in the works of Nature some Qualities and Conditions that are imperceptible to us, and of which our understanding cannot discover the means and causes; by this honest Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we hope to obtain that People shall also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us of those that we say we do understand. We need not trouble our selves to seek out Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and strange Difficulties; methinks there are so incomprehensible Wonders amongst the things that we ordinarily see, as surpass all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Miracles. What a wonderful thing it
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:53645:695" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is, that the drop of Seed from which we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, should carry in it self the impression not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the bodily Form, but even of the Thoughts and Inclinations of our Fathers? Where can that drop of Fluid matter contain that infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Forms? And how can they carry on these Resemblances with so temerarious and irregular a Progress, that the Son shall be like his Great Grand-father, the Nephew like his Uncle? In the Family of <hi>Lepidus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> there were three, not successively, but by intervals, that were born with the same Eye cover'd with a <hi>Cartilage.</hi> At <hi>Thebes,</hi> there was a <hi>Race</hi> that carried from their Mothers Womb the form of the head of a Launce, and who was not born so, was look'd upon as illegitimate. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, that in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Nation, where the Women were in common, they assign'd the Children to their Fathers by their resemblance. 'Tis to be believ'd that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive this Infirmity from my Father;<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Stone.</note> for he died wonderfully tormented with a great Stone in his Bladder; he was never sensible of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease till the sixty seventh year of his Age, and before that had never felt any grudging or symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of it either in his Reins, Sides, or any other part; and had liv'd till then in a happy vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous state of Health, little subject to Infirmities, and continued seven years after in this Disease, and died a very painful Death. I was born above five and twenty years before his Disease seiz'd him, and in the time of his most flourishing and healthful state of Body, his third Child in order of Birth: where could his propension to this
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:53645:695" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Malady lye lurking all that while? And he being so far from the Infirmity, how could that small part of his Substance, carry away so great an impression of its share? And how so conceal'd, that till five and forty years after I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be sensible of it? being the only one to this hour, amongst so many Brothers and Sisters, and all of one Mother, that was ever troubled with it. He that can satisfie me in this point, I will believe him in as many other Miracles as he pleases, always provided, that as their manner is, he does not give me a <hi>Doctrine</hi> much more intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and fantastick than the thing it self for current pay. Let the <hi>Physicians</hi> a little excuse the Liberty I take, for by this same infusion, and fatal insinuation it is that I have receiv'd a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt of their Doctrine. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy I have against their Art is hereditary. My <hi>Father</hi> liv'd threescore and fourteen years, my <hi>Grandfather</hi> sixty nine, my <hi>Great-Grandfather</hi> almost fourscore years, without ever tasting any sort of Physick: and with them whatever was not ordinary Diet, was instead of a Drugg. <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> is grounded upon Experience and Examples, so is my Opinion. And is not this an express and very advantageous Experience? I do not know that they can find me in all their <hi>Records</hi> three that were born, bred, and dyed under the same Roof, who have liv'd so long by their own Conduct. They must here of Necessity confess, that if <hi>Reason</hi> be not, <hi>Fortune</hi> at least is on my side, and with <hi>Physicians, Fortune</hi> goes a great deal further than <hi>Reason</hi>; let them not
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:53645:696" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take me now at a disadvantage; let them not threaten me in the subdu'd condition I now am, for that were treachery. And to say truth, I have got enough the better of them by these dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Examples, that they should rest satisfied. Humane things are not usually so constant, it has been two hundred years save eighteen that this Tryal has lasted, for the first of them was born in the Year 1402. 'Tis now indeed very good reason that this Experience should begin to fail us: let them not therefore reproach me with the Infirmities under which I now suffer; is it not enough for my part, that I have lived seven and forty years in perfect Health? Though it should be the end of my <hi>career,</hi> 'tis of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort. My <hi>Ancestors</hi> had an aversion to <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> by some secret and natural instinct; for the very sight of a Potion was loathsom to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Seigneur de Gaviac,</hi> my Uncle by the Father's side, a Churchman, and a Valetudinary from his Birth, and yet that made that crazy Life to hold out to sixty seven years; being once fall'n into a furious Fever, it was order'd by the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,</hi> he should be plainly told that if he would not make use of help (for so they call that which is very often quite contrary) he would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a dead man. The good man, though ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with this dreadful Sentence, yet reply'd, <hi>I am then a dead man.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> soon after made the Prognostick false. The youngest of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were four, and by many years the youngest, the <hi>Sieur de Bussaget,</hi> was the only man of the Family that made use of Medicine,

by reason, I suppose, of the commerce he had with the other Arts, for he was a Counsellour in the Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and it succeeded so ill with him, that being in outward appearance of the strongest constitution, he yet died before any of the rest, the <hi>Sieur</hi> Saint <hi>Michel</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 'Tis possible I may have deriv'd this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Antipathy</hi> to Physick from them; but had there been no other consideration in the case, I would have endeavour'd to have overcome it. For all conditions that spring in us without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, are vicious; and is a kind of Disease that we are to wrestle with: It may be I had natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally this Propension, but I have supported and fortified it by Arguments and Reasons, which have establish'd in me the Opinion I am of. For I also hate the consideration of refusing <hi>Physick</hi> for the nauseous taste: I should hardly be of that humour, who find Health worth purchasing by all the most painful <hi>Cauteries</hi> and <hi>Incisions</hi> that can be apply'd. And, according to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> I conceive, that Pleasures are to be avoided, if greater Pains be the consequence; and Pains to be coveted, that will terminate in greater Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <hi>Health</hi> is a pretious thing, and the only one in truth meriting that a man should lay out, not only his time, sweat, labour, and goods, but also his Life it self to obtain it, forasmuch as without it Life is injurious to us. Pleasure, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Learning, and Virtue without it wither away and vanish; and in the most queint and solid Discourses that <hi>Philosophy</hi> would imprint in us to the contrary, we need no more but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

All means that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Health, can neither be too painful nor too dear to me. But I have some other Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that makes me strangely suspect all this merchandize. I do not deny but that there may be some Art, and that there are not amongst so many works of <hi>Nature,</hi> things proper for the conservation of Health; that is most certain; I very well know there are some Simples that moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, and others that dry; I experimentally know that <hi>Radishes</hi> are windy, and <hi>Senna</hi> leaves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; and several other such Experiences I have, which I am as sure of as I am that <hi>Mutton</hi> nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, and <hi>Wine</hi> warms me: and <hi>Solon</hi> would say, <hi>That eating was Physick against Hunger.</hi> I do not disapprove the use we make of things the Earth produces, nor doubt in the least of the power and fertility of Nature, and disapprove not application of what she affords to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities: I very well see that <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> live by her <hi>Laws</hi>; but I mistrust the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wit, Knowledge, and Art; to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which, we have abandon'd <hi>Nature</hi> and her <hi>Rules,</hi> and wherein we keep no bounds nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

of that sacred <hi>Title</hi>; so in <hi>Physick,</hi> I very much honour that glorious <hi>Name,</hi> and the end it is studied for, and what it promises to the service of Mankind; but what it foists upon us, I neither honour nor esteem. In the first place, Experience makes me dread it; for amongst all of my Acquaintance, I see no Race of People so soon sick, and so long before they are well, as those who take much <hi>Physick.</hi> Their very Health is alter'd and corrupted by their frequent Prescriptions. <hi>Physicians</hi> are not content to deal only with the Sick, but they will moreover cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Health it self, for fear men should at any time escape their Authority. Do they not from a continual and perfect Health, extract suspicion of some great Sickness to ensue? I have been sick often enough, and have always found my sicknesses easie enough to be supported (though I have made tryal of almost all sorts) and as short as those of any other without their help, or without swallowing their ill tasted <hi>doses.</hi> The Health I have is full and free, without other <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Discipline</hi> than my own Custom and Pleasure. Every place serves me well enough to stay in, for I need no other conveniencies when I am sick than what I must have when I am well. I never disturb my self that I have no <hi>Physician,</hi> no <hi>Apothecary,</hi> nor any other Assistance, which I see most other sick men more afflicted at than they are with their Disease, What!

The <hi>Romans</hi> were six hundred years before they receiv'd it; and after having made tryal of it, banish'd it from their City at the instance of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Censor,</hi> who made it appear how easie it was to live without it, having himself liv'd fourscore and five years, and kept his Wife alive to an extream old Age, not without <hi>Physick</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but without a <hi>Physician</hi>: for every thing that we find to be healthful to Life, may be call'd <hi>Physick.</hi> He kept his Family in health, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> says, if I mistake not, with Hares milk, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> cur'd all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diseases with that of a Cow; and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> says, the <hi>Lybians</hi> generally enjoy a rare Health, by a Custom they have after their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are arriv'd to four years of age, to burn and cauterize the Veins of their Head and Temples, by which means they cut off all defluxions of <hi>Rheumes</hi> for their whole lives. And the Country People of our <hi>Province</hi> make use of nothing in all sorts of Distempers but the strongest Wine they can get, mixt with a great deal of Saffron and Spice, and all with the same success.

after all, but to purge the Belly? which a thousand ordinary Simples will do as well; and I do not know whether such evacuations be so much to our advantage as they pretend, and whether <hi>Nature</hi> do not require a Residence of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements to a certain proportion, as Wine does of its Lees to keep it alive. You oft see health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men fall into Vomitings and Fluxes of the Belly by unknown Accidents, and make a great evacuation of Excrements, without any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding need, or any following benefit, but rather with hurt to their Constitution. 'Tis from the great <hi>Plato</hi> that I lately learn'd, that of three sorts of motions which are natural to us, purging is the worst, and that no man, unless he be a Fool, ought to take any thing to that purpose, but in the extreamest Necessity: Men disturb and irritate the Disease by contrary Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It must be the way of living that must gently dissolve, and bring it to its maturity. The violent gripings and contest betwixt the <hi>Drug</hi> and the <hi>Disease,</hi> is ever to our loss, since the Combat is fought within our selves, and that the <hi>Drug</hi> is an Assistant not to be trusted, being in its own nature an Enemy to our Health; and but by trouble has no access into our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Fears, our Despair, displeases and stops it from, instead of inviting it to our relief. It owes as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to the Disease, as well as to Health; and will not suffer it self to be corrupted in favour of the one, to the prejudice of the others right, for it would then fall into Disorder. Let us in Gods Name follow it. It leads those that follow, and those who will not follow, it drags along both their Fury and Physick together. Order a Purge for your Brain, it will there be much better employ'd, than upon your Stomack.

But they have, as I said, fail'd, in that they have not added to this fine beginning, the making their Meetings and Consultations more religious and secret, where no profane Person ought to have been admitted, no more than in the secret Ceremonies of <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius.</hi> For by Reason of this it falls out, that their irresolution, the weakness of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Divination, and Foundations, the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Disputes, full of hatred, jealousie, and particular interest, coming to be discover'd by every one, a man must be very blind not to discern that he runs a very great hazard in their Hands. Who ever saw one Physician approve of anothers Prescription, without taking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:53645:701" rendition="simple:additions"/>
away, or adding something to it? By which they sufficiently betray their <hi>Art,</hi> and make it manifest to us, that they therein more consider their own Reputation, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Profit, than their Patients interest. He was a much wiser man of their <hi>Tribe,</hi> who of old gave it for a <hi>Rule,</hi> that only one Physician should undertake a sick Person; for if he do nothing to purpose, one single man's default can bring no great scandal upon the Profession; and on the contrary, the glory will be great, if he happen to have good Success, whereas when there are many, they at every turn bring a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repute upon their Calling, forasmuch as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener do hurt than good. They ought to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the perpetual disagreement which is found in the Opinions of the principal Masters, and antient Authors of this <hi>Science,</hi> which is only known to men well read, without disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to the vulgar the Controversies and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Judgments which they still nourish and continue amongst themselves; shall we have one Example of the antient Controversie in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick? <hi>Hierophilus</hi> lodges the original cause of all Diseases in the <hi>Humours; Erasistratus,</hi> in the Blood of the <hi>Arteries; Asclepiades,</hi> in the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Atoms</hi> of the Pores; <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> in the Exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy, or Defect of our bodily strength; <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> in the Inequality of the Elements of which the Body is compos'd, and in the quality of the Air we suck in; <hi>Strato,</hi> in the Abundance, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and Corruption of the Nourishment we take; and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lodges them in the Spirits.

There is a certain Friend of theirs, whom they know better than I, who declares upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the most important Science in Practice amongst us, as that which is intrusted with our Health and Conversation, is by ill luck the greatest misfortune, the most incertain, the most perplext, and agitated with the greatest Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is no great danger in mistaking the height of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or in the fraction of some <hi>Astronomical</hi> Supputation: but here, where our whole Being is concern'd, 'tis not Wisdom to abandon our selves to the mercy of the Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so many contrary Winds. Before the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesian</hi> War, there was no great talk of this Science: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> brought it into Repute; and whatever he establish'd, <hi>Chrysippus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw; after that, <hi>Erascistratus, Aristotle</hi>'s Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, overthrew what <hi>Chrysippus</hi> had writ. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these, the <hi>Empiricks</hi> started up, who took a quite contrary way to the Ancients in the management of this <hi>Art.</hi> When the credit of these began a little to decay, <hi>Herophilus</hi> set another sort of Practice on foot, which <hi>Ascle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades</hi> in turn stood up against, and overthrew. The Opinions first of <hi>Themison,</hi> and then of <hi>Musa,</hi> and after that, those of <hi>Vexius valens,</hi> a Physician famous through the Intelligence he had with <hi>Messalina,</hi> came in Vogue. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Physick in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time was establish'd in <hi>Thessalus,</hi> who abolish'd and condemn'd all that had been held till his time. This man's Doctrine was refuted by <hi>Crinus</hi> of <hi>Marselles,</hi> who first brought all Medicinal Operations under the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:53645:702" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> and motions of the Stars, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd eating, sleeping, and drinking to hours that were most pleasing to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi> His Authority was soon after supplanted by <hi>Charinus,</hi> a Physician of the same City of <hi>Marselles</hi>; a Man that not only controverted all the ancient methods of Physick, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the usage of hot Baths, that had been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and so many Ages before in common Use. He made men bath in cold Water even in Winter, and plung'd his sick Patients in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Waters of every stream. No <hi>Roman</hi> till <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time had ever vouchsaf'd to practise Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, that office was only perform'd by <hi>Greeks</hi> and Foreigners, as 'tis now amongst us <hi>French,</hi> by those that sputter <hi>Latin</hi>; for, as a great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician says, we do not easily receive the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine we understand no more than we do the Drugs we our selves gether. If the Nations from whence we fetch our <hi>Guaiacum, Sarsaparilla,</hi> and <hi>China</hi> wood, converse with Medicine, how great a value must we imagine by the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of strangeness, rarity, and dear purchace, do they set upon our Cabbidge and Parsly? For who would dare to contemn things so far fetch'd, and sought out at the hazard of so long and dangerous a Voyage?</p>
                     <p>Since the ancient mutations in Physick, there have been infinite others down to our own times, and for the most part such as have been infinite, entire, and universal, as those for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, produc'd by <hi>Paracelsus, Fioravanti,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genterius</hi>; for they, as I am told, do not only
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:53645:703" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alter one <hi>Receipt,</hi> but the whole Contexture and Rules of the body of Physick, accusing all others of ignorance and imposition that have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd before them. At this rate, in what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the poor Patient must be, I leave you to judge. But if we were yet assur'd, that when they mistake themselves, that mistake of theirs would do us no harm, though it do us no good, it were a reasonable bargain to venture making our selves better without any danger of being made worse. <hi>Aesop</hi> tells a Story, that one who had bought a <hi>Morisco</hi> Slave,<note place="margin">A <hi>Moor</hi> bath'd and purg'd to clear his Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.</note> believing that his black Complexion was accidental in him, and occasion'd by the ill usage of his former Master, caus'd him to enter into a course of Physick, and with great care to be often bath'd and purg'd: it hapned that the <hi>Moor</hi> was nothing amended in his tawny Complexion, but he wholly lost his former Health. How oft do we see Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans impute the death of their Patients to one another? I remember that some years ago, there was an <hi>Epidemical</hi> Disease, very dangerous, and for the most part mortal, that rag'd in the <hi>Towns</hi> about us: the storm being over, which had swept away an infinite number of men, one of the most Famous Physicians of all the Country presently after publish'd a <hi>Book</hi> upon that Subject, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, upon better Thoughts, he confesses, that the letting blood in that Disease was the principal cause of so many miscarriages. Moreover, their Author's hold, that there is no Physick that has not something hurful in it. And if even those of the best Operation do in some measure offend
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:53645:703" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us, what must those do that are totally misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? For my own part, though there were nothing else in the Case, I am of Opinion, that to those that loath the taste of Physick, it must needs be a dangerous and prejudicial Endeavour to force it down at so incommodious a time, and with so much aversion, and believe that it marvellously distempers a sick Person at a time when he has so much need of Repose. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, if we but consider the occasions upon which they usually ground the cause of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, they are so light and nice, that I thence conclude a very little Errour in the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>Drugs</hi> may do a great deal of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Now, if the mistake of a Physician be so dangerous, we are in but a scurvy Condition; for it is almost impossible but he must often fall into those mistakes: he had need of too many parts, considerations, and circumstances, rightly to level his Design: he must know the sick Person's complexion, his temperature, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, inclinations, actions, nay, his very thoughts and imaginations. He must be assur'd of the external circumstances, of the nature of the Place, the quality of the Air and Season, the scituation of the Planets, and their influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: he must know in the Disease the <hi>Causes, Prognosticks, Affections,</hi> and <hi>Critical dayes</hi>; in the Druggs, the weight, the power of working, the Countrey, figures, age, and dispensations, and he must know how rightly to proportion and mix them together, to beget a just and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect proportion; wherein if there be the least
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:53645:704" rendition="simple:additions"/>
error, if amongst so many Springs there be but any one out of order, 'tis enough to destroy us. <hi>God</hi> knows of how great difficulty most of these things are to be understood. For (for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) how shall a Physician find out the true sign of the Disease, every Disease being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an infinite number of Indications? How many Doubts and Controversies have they amongst themselves upon the Interpretation of <hi>Vrines</hi>? Otherwise, from whence should the continual Debates we see amongst them about the knowledge of the Disease proceed? How would we excuse the error they so oft fall into, of taking one thing for another? In the Disease I have had, were there never so little difficulty in the case, I never found three of one Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which I instance, because I love to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Examples wherein I am my self concern'd.</p>
                     <p>A Gentleman was at <hi>Paris</hi> lately <hi>cut</hi> for the Stone by order of the Physicians, in whose Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being accordingly so cut, there was found no more Stone than in the palm of his Hand; and in the same place, a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who was my particular good Friend, having been earnestly prest by the major part of the Physicians in Town, whom he consulted, to suffer himself to be cut, to which also, upon their words, I us'd my interest to persuade him: when he was dead, and open'd, it appear'd that he had no Stone but in the Reins. They are least excusable for any error in this Disease, by reason that it is in some sort palpable; and 'tis by that, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Chirurgery to be much more certain, by
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:53645:704" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reason that it sees and feels what it does, and so goes less upon conjecture; whereas the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have no <hi>speculum Matricis,</hi> by which to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our <hi>Brains, Lungs,</hi> and <hi>Liver.</hi> Even the very promises of Physick are incredible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for, being to provide against divers and contrary Accidents, that often afflict us at one and the same time, and that have almost a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary relation, as the heat of the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the coldness of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> they will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us, that of their Ingredients one will heat the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and the other will cool the <hi>Liver</hi>: one has its commission to go directly to the <hi>Reins,</hi> nay, even to the <hi>Bladder,</hi> without scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Operations by the way, and is to retain its Power and Virtue thorough all those stops and meanders, even to the place to the service of which it is design'd, by its own occult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: the other will dry the <hi>Brain,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will moisten the <hi>Lungs.</hi> All these things being mix'd in one Potion, is it not a kind of madness to imagine or to hope that these differing Virtues should separate themselves from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this mixture and confusion, to perform so many various errands? I should very much fear that they would either lose or change their Tickets, and trouble one anothers quarters: And who can imagine but that in this liquid confusion these Faculties must corrupt, confound, and spoil one another? And is not the danger still more, when the making up of this Medicine is intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to the Skill and Fidelity of another, to whose mercy we again abandon our Lives? As we have
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:53645:705" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Doublet and Breeches-makers, distinct Trades to Clothe us, and are so much the better fitted, being that each of them meddles only with his own Business, and has less to trouble his head withall than a <hi>Taylor</hi> that undertakes all; and as in matter of Diet, great Persons, for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convenience, and to the end they may be better serv'd, have <hi>Cooks</hi> of distinct Offices, some for <hi>Soops</hi> and <hi>Pottages,</hi> and others for Roasting, which one <hi>Cook</hi> that should undertake the whole Service, could not so well perform, so must we be treated in our <hi>Cures.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had reason to reject this general Trade of a <hi>Physician,</hi> and to divide the Profession to several peculiar Diseases, to every part of the Body a particular <hi>Operator.</hi> For that part was more properly, and with less confusion provided for, being they especially regarded nothing else: Ours are not aware that he who provides for all, provides for nothing, and that the entire government of this <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosme</hi> is more than they are able to undertake. Whilst they were afraid of stopping a Loosness, lest they should put him into a Fever, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me a Friend that was worth more than the whole pack of them put altogether. They coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise their own Divinations with the present Evils, and because they will not cure the <hi>Brain</hi> to the prejudice of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> they offend both with their mutinous and tumultuary <hi>Drugs.</hi> As to the variety and weakness of Reasons, it is more manifest in this than in any other <hi>Art.</hi> Aperitive Medicines are proper for a man subject to the Stone, by reason that opening and
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:53645:705" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dilating the Passages, they help forward the sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Matter whereof Gravel and the Stone is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender'd, and convey that downward which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to harden and gather in the Reins. Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive things are dangerous for a man subject to the Stone, by reason that opening and dilating the Passage, they help forward toward the Reins the matter proper to create the Stone, which, by their own propension that way, being apt to seize it, 'tis not to be imagin'd but that a great deal of what has been so convey'd thither must remain behind. Moreover, if the Medicine hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with any thing too gross to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thorough all those narrow Passages it must pass to be expell'd, that obstruction whatever it is, being stirr'd by these aperitive things, and thrown into those narrow Passages, coming to stop them, will occasion a certain and most painful Death. They have the like constancy in the advices they give us for the regiment of Life. It is good to make water often, for we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally see, that in letting it lye long in the Bladder, we give it time to settle the Sedement which will concreate into a Stone: It is good not to make water often, for the heavy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it carried along with it will not be voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without violence, as we see by experience, that a Torrent that runs with force, washes the ground it rowls over much clearer than the course of a slow and tardy Stream. Likewise it is good to have often to do with Women, for that opens the Passages and helps to evacuate Gravel: It is also very ill to have often to do
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:53645:706" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with Women, because it heats, tires, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Reins. It is good to bath frequently in hot waters, forasmuch as that refreshes and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies the place where the Gravel and Stone lye; and it is also ill, by reason that this application of external heat helps the Reins to bake, harden, and petrifie the Matter so dispos'd. For those who are at the Bath, it is most healthful to eat little at Night, to the end that the Waters they are to drink the next Morning may have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Operation upon an empty Stomach; on the contrary, it is better to eat little at Dinner, that it hinder not the Operation of the Waters, which is not yet perfect, and not to oppress the Stomach so soon after the other labour, but leave the office of digestion to the Night, which will much better perform it than the Day, where the Body and Soul are in perpetual moving and action; thus do they <hi>juggle</hi> and <hi>cant</hi> in all their Discourses at our expence, and cannot give me one Proposition against which I cannot erect a contrary of equal force. Let them then no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger exclaim against those, who in this trouble of Sickness suffer themselves to be gently guided by their own Appetite, and the advice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and commit themselves to the common For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I have seen in my Travels almost all the famous <hi>Baths</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and for some years past have begun to make use of them my self, for I look upon bathing as generally wholsom, and believe that we suffer no little inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our Health, by having left off the <hi>Custom</hi> that was generally observ'd in former times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:53645:706" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by all Nations, and is yet in many, of bathing every day; and I cannot imagine but that we are much the worse by having our Limbs crust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our Pores stopt with dirt and filth. And as to the drinking of them, <hi>Fortune</hi> has in the first place render'd them not at all unacceptable to my taste; and secondly, they are natural and simple, which at least carry no danger with them though they do us no good. Of which, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite croud of People of all sorts of Complexions that repair thither, I take to be a sufficient <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty</hi>: And although I have not there observ'd any extraordinary and miraculous Effects; but that on the contrary, having more narrowly than ordinary enquir'd into it, I have found all the reports of such operations that have been spread abroad in those Places, ill grounded and false, and those that believe them (as People are willing to be gull'd in what they desire) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in them; yet I have seldom known any that have been made worse by those Waters, and a man cannot honestly deny but that they beget a better Appetite, help Digestion, and do in some sort revive us, if we do not go too late and in too weak a Condition, which I would dissuade every one from doing. They have not the virtue to raise men from desperate and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Diseases, but they may help some light In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, or prevent some threatning Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Who does not bring along with him so much cheerfulness as to enjoy the pleasure of the Company he will there meet, and of the Walks and Exercises, to which the amenity of
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:53645:707"/>
those Places invite us, will doubtless lose the best and surest part of their Effect. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I have hitherto chosen to go to those of the most pleasant Scituation, where there was the best conveniency of Lodging, Provision, and Company, as the Baths of <hi>Bavieres</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> those of <hi>Plombieres</hi> in the Frontiers of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> those of <hi>Baden</hi> in <hi>Swizerland,</hi> those of <hi>Lucque</hi> in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and especially those <hi>Della-Villa,</hi> which I have the most, and at several Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons frequented. Every Nation has particular Opinions touching their Use, and several <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> in using them, and all of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I have seen almost of like Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Drinking of them is not at all receiv'd in <hi>Germany</hi>; they bath for all Diseases only, and will lye dabling in the Water almost from <hi>Sun</hi> to <hi>Sun.</hi> In <hi>Italy,</hi> when they drink nine days, they bath at least thirty, and commonly drink the Water mixt with some other <hi>Drugs</hi> to make it work the better. We are here order'd to walk to digest it, there they are kept in bed after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it till it be wrought off, their Stomachs and Feet having continually hot cloths apply'd to them all the while: and as the <hi>Germans</hi> have a particular practise generally to use Cupping and Scarification in the <hi>Bath</hi>: So the <hi>Italians</hi> have their <hi>Doccie,</hi> which are certain little Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of this hot Water brought thorough Pipes, and with them bath an hour in the Morning, and as much in the Afternoon for a Month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, either the Head, Stomach, or any other part where the Grief lies. There are infinite
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:53645:707"/>
other varieties of Customs in every Country, or rather, there is no manner of resemblance to one another. By which you may see, that this little part of <hi>Physick,</hi> to which I have only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, though the least depending upon Art of all others, has yet a great share of the confusion and incertainty every where else manifest in their Profession. The <hi>Poets</hi> say whatever they please with greater <hi>Emphasis</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi>; witness these two <hi>Epigrams.</hi>

Upon which I will relate two Stories: The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Caupene</hi> in <hi>Chalosse,</hi> and I, have betwixt us the <hi>Advouzon</hi> of a <hi>Benefice</hi> of great extent, at the foot of our Mountains call'd <hi>Lahontan.</hi> It is with the Inhabitants of this <hi>Angle,</hi> as 'tis said of those of the Vale of <hi>Angrougne</hi>; they liv'd a peculiar sort of Life, their <hi>Fashions, Cloths,</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> distinct from other People, rul'd and govern'd by certain particular <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Vsances,</hi> receiv'd from Father to Son, to which they submitted, without other constraint than the Reverence to <hi>Custom.</hi> This little <hi>State</hi> had continued from all Antiquity in so happy a Condition, that no neighbouring <hi>Judge</hi> was ever put to the trouble of enquiring into their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no <hi>Advocate</hi> ever retain'd to give them Counsel, nor Stranger ever call'd in to compose their Differences; nor was ever any of them seen to go a begging. They avoided all <hi>Alliances</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> with the other World, that they might not corrupt the Purity of their own <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; till, as they say, one of them, in the memory of man, having a mind spurr'd on with a noble Ambition, contriv'd to bring his Name into Credit and Reputation, to make one of his Sons something more than ordinary, and having put him to learn to write, made him at last a brave Town <hi>Clerk</hi>: This Fellow being grown up, began to disdain their ancient <hi>Customs,</hi> and
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:53645:708" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to buz into the Peoples Ears the pomp of the other parts of the Nation. The first prank he plaid, was, to advise a Friend of his, that some body had offended by sawing off the Horns of one of his <hi>Goats,</hi> to make his Complaint to the Kings <hi>Judges</hi> thereabout, and so he went on in this Practice, till he spoil'd and confounded all. In the tail of this Corruption, they say, there happened another, and of worse consequence, by means of a <hi>Physician,</hi> who fell in love with one of their Daughters, had a mind to marry her, and to live amongst them. This man first of all began to teach them the names of <hi>Fevers, Rheums</hi> and <hi>Imposthumes,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Heart, Liver,</hi> and <hi>Intestines,</hi> a <hi>Science</hi> till then utterly unknown to them; and instead of <hi>Garlick,</hi> with which they were wont to cure all manner of Diseases, how painful or extream soever, he taught them, though it were but for a <hi>Cough,</hi> or any little <hi>Cold,</hi> to take strange mixtures, and began to make a <hi>Trade,</hi> not only of their Healths, but of their Lives. They swear that till then they never perceiv'd the Evening Air to be offensive to the Head, that to drink when they were hot was hurtful, and that the Winds of <hi>Autumn</hi> were more unwholesome than those of the <hi>Spring</hi>; that since this use of <hi>Physick,</hi> they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves opprest with a <hi>Legion</hi> of unaccustom'd <hi>Diseases,</hi> and that they perceive a general decay in their wonted Vigour, and their Lives are cut shorter by the half. This is the first of my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>

                        <pb n="714" facs="tcp:53645:709"/>The other is, that before I was afflicted with the Stone, hearing that the Blood of a He-Goat was with many in very great esteem, and look'd upon as a Coelestial <hi>Manna</hi> rain'd down upon these latter Ages for the good and Preservation of the Lives of Men, and having heard it spoken of by men of Understanding for an admirable <hi>Drug,</hi> and of infallible Operation: I, who have ever thought my self subject to all the accidents that can befall other men, had a mind in my perfect health to furnish my self with this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Medicine, and therefore gave order to have a Goat fed at home according to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt</hi>: for he must be taken in the hottest Month of all <hi>Summer,</hi> and must only have aperitive Herbs given him to eat, and White-wine to drink. I came home by chance the very day he was to be kill'd; and one came and told me, that the <hi>Cook</hi> had found two or three great Balls in his Paunch, that rattled against one another amongst what he had eaten: I was curious to have all his Entrals brought before me, where, having caus'd the Skin that inclos'd them to be cut, there tumbled out three great lumps, as light as Spunges, so that they appear'd to be hollow; but as to the rest, hard and firm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and spotted and mixt all over with various dead colours. One was perfectly round, and of the bigness of an ordinary Bowl, the other two something less, of an imperfect roundness, as seeming not to be arriv'd at their full growth. I find by inquiry of People accustom'd to open these Animals, that it is a rare and unusual acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

'Tis likely these are Stones of the same Nature with ours; and if so, it must needs be a very vain hope in those who have the Stone, to extract their Cure from the Blood of a Beast who was himself about to dye of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease. For to say that the Blood does not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of this Contagion, and does not alter its wonted Virtue, it is rather to be believ'd, that nothing is ingendred in a Body but by the Conspiracy and Communication of all the Parts: the whole mass works together, though one part contributes more to the work than another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of Operations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very likely that there was some petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying quality in all the parts of this <hi>Goat.</hi> It was not so much for fear of the future, and for my self, that I was curious of this Experiment, but because it falls out in mine, as it does in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Families, that the Women store up such little Trumperies for the service of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, using the same <hi>Receipt</hi> in fifty several Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, and such a Receipt as they will not take themselves, and yet triumph in their good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses. As to what remains, I honour <hi>Physicians,</hi> not according to the common rule, for Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (for to this Passage may be added another of the Prophet, reproving King <hi>Asa</hi> for having recourse to a <hi>Physician</hi>) but for themselves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving known many very good men of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and most worthy to be believ'd. I do not attaque them, 'tis their <hi>Art</hi> I inveigh against, and do not much blame them for making their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Folly, for most men do the same.

Many <hi>Callings,</hi> both of greater and less Dignity than theirs, have no other Foundation or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port than publick abuse. When I am sick I send for them, if they be near, only to have their Company, and fee them as others do. I give them leave to command me to keep my self warm, because I naturally love to do it, and to appoint <hi>Leeks</hi> or <hi>Lettuce</hi> for my Broth, to order me White-wine or Claret, and so all other things at their own Pleasure, which are indifferent to my Palat and Custom. I know very well that I do nothing for them in so doing, because sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and ill pleasing tastes are accidents of the very Essence of <hi>Physick.</hi>

How many do we see amongst them of my Humour, that despise taking <hi>Physick</hi> themselves, are men of a liberal Diet, and live a quite contrary sort of Life to what they prescribe others? What is this but flatly to abuse our Simplicity. For their own Lives and Healths are no less dear to them than ours are to us, and consequently they would accomodate their Effects to their own <hi>Rules,</hi> if they did not themselves know how false they are. 'Tis the fear of Death, and of Pain, an impatience of the Disease, and a violent and indiscreet desire of a present Cure that so blinds us: and pure Cowardize that makes our belief so plyable and easie to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

upon: and yet most men do not so much believe as they acquiesce and permit, for I hear them find fault and complain as well as we: But they resolve at last; What should I do then? As if Impatience were of it self a better Remedy than Patience. Is there any one of those who have suffer'd themselves to be perswaded into this miserable Subjection, that does not equally surrender himself to all sorts of Impostures? Who does not give up himself to the mercy of whoever has the impudence to promise him a Cure?<note place="margin">The sick Persons of <hi>Babylon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the market place.</note> The <hi>Babylonians</hi> carried their sick into the publick Place, the <hi>Physician</hi> was the People, where every one that pass'd by, being in huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and civility oblig'd to enquire of their Condition, gave some advice according to his own Experience. We do little better, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not so silly a Woman whose <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Drenches</hi> we do not make use of, and according to my Humour, if I were to take <hi>Physick,</hi> I would sooner choose to take theirs than any other, because, at least, if they do no good they will do no harm. What <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> said of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that they were all <hi>Physicians,</hi> may be said of all People; there is no one that does not boast of some rare <hi>Receipt,</hi> and who will not venture it upon his Neighbour if he will permit him. I was the other day in <hi>Company</hi> where some one of my <note n="*" place="margin">Meaning that was troubled vvith the Stone.</note> fraternity told us of a new sort of Pills made up of a hundred and odd Ingredients: it made us very merry, and was a singular Consolation, for what Rock could withstand so great a battery? And yet I hear
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:53645:711" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by those who have made tryal of it, that the least atom of Gravel will not stir for't. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take my hand from the Paper before I have added a word or two more concerning the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance they give us of the infallibility of their <hi>Drugs,</hi> and the Experiments they have made.</p>
                     <p>The greatest part, and I think above two thirds of the medicinal Virtues consist in the <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> or occult propriety of <hi>Simples,</hi> of which we can have no other instruction than Use and Custom. For <hi>Quintessence</hi> is no other than a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of which we cannot by our Reason find out the cause. In such Proofs, those they pretend to have acquir'd by the inspiration of some <hi>Daemon,</hi> I am content to receive (for I meddle not with Miracles) as also the Proofs which are drawn from things that upon some other account oft fall into use amongst us; as if in Wool, wherewith we are wont to clothe our selves, there have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally some occult desiccative Propriety been found out of curing <hi>kib'd Heels,</hi> or as if in the Radish we eat for Food, there have been found out some aperitive Operation. <hi>Galen</hi> reports, that a Man hapned to be cur'd of a Leprosie by drinking Wine out of a Vessel into which a Viper had crept by chance. In which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we find the means, and a very likely guide and conduct to this Experience; as we also do in those Physicians pretend to have been directed to by the Example of some Beasts. But in most of their other Experiments, wherein they declare to have been conducted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to have had no other guide than
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:53645:711" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chance, I find the Progress of this Information incredible. Suppose <hi>man</hi> looking round about him upon the infinite number of things, <hi>Plants, Animals,</hi> and <hi>Metals,</hi> I do not know where he would begin his tryal; and though his first fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy should fix him upon an <hi>Elk</hi>'s <hi>horn,</hi> wherein there must be a very gentle and easie belief, he will yet find himself perplex'd in his second Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There are so many Maladies, and so many Circumstances laid before him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can arrive at the certainty of the point, to which the perfection of his Experience should arrive, humane sence will be at the end of its lesson: and before he can, amongst this infinity of things, find out what this <hi>Horn</hi> is amongst so many Diseases, what the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> the many Complexions in a melancholick Person, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Seasons in Winter, the many Nations in the <hi>French,</hi> the many Ages in Age, the many Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Mutations in the Conjunction of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the many Parts in mans Body, nay, in a Finger: and being in all this directed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Argument, Conjectures, Example, nor Divine Inspirations, but meerly by the sole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fortune; it should be by a perfectly artificial, regular, and methodical Fortune. And after the Cure is perform'd, how can he assure himself that it was not because the Disease was arriv'd at its period, or an effect of Chance? or the Operation of something else that he had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, drunk, or touch'd that day? or by Virtue of his Grand-mothers Prayers? And moreover, had this Experiment been perfect, how many
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:53645:712"/>
times was it reiterated, and this long beadrole of Fortunes and Encounters strung anew from Chance to conclude a certain Rule? And when the Rule is concluded, by whom I pray you? Of so many millions, there are but three Men who take upon them to record their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And must Chance needs just meet one of these? What if another, and a hundred others have made contrary Experiments? We might, peradventure, have some light in this, were all the Judgments and Arguments of men known to us. But that three witnesses, three Doctors, should Lord it over all Mankind is against all reason. It were fit that humane <hi>Nature</hi> should have deputed and cull'd them out, and that they were declar'd our <hi>Comptrollers</hi> by express Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Attorney.</hi>

You will there find the same air and behaviour you have observ'd in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and though I could have borrow'd some better or more favourable garb than my own, I would not have done it, for I require nothing more of these Writings, but to present me to
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:53645:712" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your Memory, such as I naturally am. The same Conditions and Faculties your <hi>Ladiship</hi> has been pleas'd to frequent and receive with much more Honour and Courtesie than they deserve, I will put together. (but without alteration) in one solid Body, that may peradventure continue some years, or some days after I am gone; where you may find them again when your Ladiship shall please to refresh your Memory, without putting you to any greater trouble, neither are they worth it. I desire you should continue the favour of your Friendship to me, by the same Qualities by which it was acquir'd; and am not ambitious that any one should love and esteem me more dead than living. The Humour of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> is ridiculous, but yet common, who was more sollicitous to extend his Renown to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity than to render himself acceptable to men of his own time. If I was one of those to whom the World could owe commendation, I would acquit the one half to have the other in hand, that their praises might come quick and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about me, more thick than long, more full than durable; and let them cease on God's Name with my knowledge, and when the sweet sound can no longer pierce my Ears. It were an idle Humour to go about, now that I am going to forsake the commerce of Men, to offer my self to them by a new Recommendation. I make no account of the Goods I could not employ in the Service of my Life. And such as I am, I will be elsewhere than in Paper: My Art and Industry have been ever directed to render me good for
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:53645:713" rendition="simple:additions"/>
something; and my Studies, to teach me to do, and not to write. I have made it my whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to frame my Life. This has been my Trade and my Work. I am less a writer of <hi>Books</hi> than any thing else. I have coveted so much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for the Service of my present and real Conveniences, and not to lay up a stock for my Posterity. Who has any thing of Value in him, let him make it appear in his Manners, in his ordinary Discourses, in his Courtships, and his Quarrels, in Play, in Bed, at Table, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Affairs, in his Oeconomy. Those that I see make good <hi>Books</hi> in ill Breeches, should first have mended their <hi>Breeches,</hi> if they would have been rul'd by me. Ask a <hi>Spartan,</hi> whether he had rather be a good <hi>Orator</hi> or a good <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>; and if I was ask'd the same Question, I would rather chuse to be a good <hi>Cook,</hi> had I not one already to serve me. Good God! <hi>Madam,</hi> how should I hate the Reputation of being a pretty Fellow at Writing, and an Ass and a Sot in every thing else. Yet I had rather be a Fool in any thing than to have made so ill a Choice wherein to employ my Talent. And I am so far from expecting to gain any new Reputation by these Follies, that I shall think I come off pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well if I lose nothing by it of that little I had before. For besides that this dead painting will take from my natural Being, it has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to my better Condition, but also much laps'd from my former Vigour and Chearfulness, and looks faded, and wither'd. I am towards the bottom of the Barrel, which begins to taste
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:53645:713" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the <hi>Lees.</hi> And to the rest, <hi>Madam,</hi> I should not have dar'd to make so bold with the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Physick, considering the esteem that your <hi>Ladiship,</hi> and so many others have of it, had I not had encouragement from their own <hi>Authors, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Celsus.</hi> If these ever fall into your hands, you will find that they speak much more rudely of their Art than I do; I but pinch it, they cut the Throat on't. <hi>Pliny,</hi> amongst other things, twits them with this, That when they are at the end of the Rope, that is, when they have done the utmost of what they are able to do, they have a pretty device to save themselves, of recommending their <hi>Patients,</hi> whom they have teaz'd and tormented with their Drugs and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to no purpose, some to Vows and Miracles, and others to the hot Baths and Waters. (Be not angry, <hi>Madam,</hi> he speaks not of those in our Parts, who are under the Protection of your House, and all <hi>Gramontins.</hi>) They have besides another way of saving their own Credit, of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their hands of us, and securing themselves from the reproaches we might cast in their Teeth of the little amendment, when they have had us so long in their hands, that they have not one more Invention left wherewith to amuse us; which is, to send us to the better Air of some other Country. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is enough; I hope you will give me leave to return to my former Discourse, from which I have so far digrest, the better to divert you.</p>
                                 <p>It was, I think, <hi>Pericles,</hi> who being ask'd how he did, you may judge, says he, by these, showing
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:53645:714" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some little Scrowls of Parchment he had tyed about his Neck and Arms. By which he would inferr, that he must needs be very sick when he was reduc'd to a Necessity of having recourse to such idle and vain Fopperies, and of suffering himself to be so equip'd. I dare not promise but that I may one day be so much a Fool as to commit my Life and Death to the Mercy and Government of <hi>Physicians</hi>; I may fall into such a <hi>Frenzy</hi>: I dare not be responsible for my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Constancy: but then, if any one ask me how I do, I may also answer, as <hi>Pericles</hi> did, <hi>You may judge by this,</hi> showing my hand clutch'd up with six drams of Opium: it will be a very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sign of a violent sickness: and my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be very much out of Order. If once fear and impatience get such an Advantage over me, it may very well be concluded that there is a dreadful Fever in my Mind. I have taken the pains to plead this <hi>Cause,</hi> which I little enough understand, a little to back and support the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural aversion to <hi>Drugs</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> I have deriv'd from my <hi>Ancestors</hi>: to the end it may not be a meer stupid and temerarious aversion, but have a little more Form; and also, that they who shall see me so obstinate in my Resolution against all Exhortations and Menaces that shall be given me, when my Infirmity shall press hardest upon me, may not think 'tis meer Obstinacy in me; or any one so ill natur'd, as yet to judge it to be any motive of Glory: For it would be a strange ambition to seek to gain Honour by an Action my <hi>Gardiner</hi> or my <hi>Groom</hi>
                                    <pb n="725" facs="tcp:53645:714" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can perform as well as I. Certainly, I have not a Heart so tumorous and windy, that I should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change so solid a Pleasure as Health, for an airy and imaginary Pleasure. <hi>Glory,</hi> even that of the four Sons of <hi>Aymon,</hi> is too dear bought to a man of my Humour, if it cost him three swinging fits of the <hi>Stone.</hi> Give me Health in Gods Name! Such as love <hi>Physick,</hi> may also have good, great, and convincing Considerations; I do not hate Opinions contrary to my own. I am so far from being angry to see a discrepancy betwixt mine and other mens Judgments, and from rendring my self unfit for the Society of Men, for being of another Sence and Party than mine; that on the contrary, (the most general way that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has follow'd being Variety, and more in Souls than Bodies, forasmuch as they are of a more supple substance, and more susceptible of Forms) I find it much more rare to see our Humours and Designs jump and agree. And there never was in the World two Opinions alike, no more than two Hairs, or two Grains. The most Universal Quality, is Diversity.</p>

weigh. I speak in Paper, as I do to the first I meet, and that this is true, observe what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. To whom ought not Treachery to be hateful, when <hi>Tyberius</hi> refus'd it in a thing of so great Importance to him?<note place="margin">Treachery rejected by <hi>Tyberius.</hi>
                        </note> He had word sent him from <hi>Germany,</hi> that if he thought fit, they would rid him of <hi>Ariminius,</hi> the most potent Enemy the <hi>Romans</hi> had, by Poyson. He return'd answer, <hi>That the People of</hi> Rome <hi>were wont to revenge themselves of their Enemies by open ways, and with their Swords in their hands, and not clandestinely, and by Fraud.</hi> Wherein he quitted the utile for the honest. You will tell me that he was a Deceiver, and did not speak as he thought; I believe so too: and 'tis no great Miracle in Men of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But the acknowledgement of Virtue, is not less valid in the Mouth of him that hates it, for as much as truth forces it from him, and if he will not inwardly receive it, he at least puts it on, and with it makes himself outwardly fine. Our outward and inward Structure is full of imperfection, but there is nothing use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in <hi>Nature,</hi> not so much as Inutility it self; nothing has insinuated it self into this <hi>Vniverse,</hi> that has not therein some fit and proper place. Our <hi>Being</hi> is cemented with sickly Qualities, <hi>Ambition, Jealousie, Envy, Revenge, Superstition</hi> and <hi>Despair,</hi> have so natural a Possession in us, that the Image is discern'd in Beasts: Nay, and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> so unnatural a Vice, for even in the midst of Compassion, we feel within I know not what tart-sweet titillation of ill-natur'd

of the Seeds of which Qualities, whoever should divest man, would destroy the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conditions of human Life: Likewise in all Governments there are necessary Offices,<note place="margin">Vices Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> not only abject, but vicious also. Vices have there a help to make up the seam in our pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; as Poysons are useful for the Conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Health. If they become excusable because they are of use to us, and that the common Necessity covers their true Qualities: we are to resign this part to the strongest and boldest <hi>Citizens,</hi> who sacrifice their Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as others of old sacrific'd their Lives for the good of their Country: We who are weaker, take upon us the parts of Actions, both that are more easie, and less hazardous: the publick <hi>Weal</hi> requires that a Man should betray, and lye, and massacre; let us leave this <hi>Commission</hi> to Men that are more obedient, and more supple. In earnest, I have often been troubled to see <hi>Judges</hi> by Fraud, and false hopes of Favour or Pardon, allure a <hi>Criminal</hi> to confess his Fact, and therein to make use of Cozenage and Impudence. It would become
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53645:719" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Justice, and <hi>Plato</hi> himself, who countenances this manner of proceeding, to furnish me with other means more suitable to my own liking. This is a malicious kind of Justice, and I look upon it as no less violated by it self than by others. I said not long since to some company in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>that I should hardly be drawn to betray my Prince for a particular Man, who should be very much asham'd to betray any particular Man for my Prince</hi>; and do not only hate deceiving my self, but that any one should deceive through me; I will neither afford matter nor occasion to any such thing. In the little I have had to mediate betwixt our Princes in the Divisions and Subdivisions, by which we are at this time torn to pieces, I have been very careful that they should neither be deceiv'd in me, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others by me: People of that kind of trading are very reserv'd, and pretend to be the most moderate imaginable, and nearest to the Opinions of those with whom they have to do; I expose my self in my true Opinion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a method the most my own; a young and tender <hi>Negotiator,</hi> and one who had rather fail in the Affair than be wanting to my Self: And yet it has been hitherto with so good luck, (for Fortune has doubtless the best share in it) that little has past from hand to hand with less su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition, or more favour and privacy. I have a free and open way that easily insinuates it self, and obtains belief with those with whom I am to deal at the first meeting. Sincerity and pure Truth, in what Age sover pass for current;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53645:719" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and besides, the liberty and freedom of a Man who treats without any Interest of his own, is never hateful or suspected, and he may very well make use of the Answer of <hi>Hipperides</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who complain'd of his blunt way of speaking. <hi>My Masters, do not consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no I am free, but whether I am so without a Bribe, or without any advantage to my own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi> My liberty of Speaking has also easily clear'd me from all suspition of dissembling by its vehemency, (leaving nothing unsaid how home and bitter soever, so that I could have said no worse behind their backs) and in that it carried along with it a manifest shew of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and negligence. I pretend to no other fruit by acting than to Act, and add to it no long pursuit nor proposals; every action plays its own Game, win if it can. As to the rest, I am not sway'd by any Passion either of love or hatred towards the great ones, nor have my Will captivated either by particular injury or obligation. I look upon our <hi>King</hi> with an affection simply loyal and respective, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prompted on nor restrain'd by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest, and I love my self for it. Neither does the general and just <hi>Cause</hi> attract me other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than with moderation, and without Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity. I am not subject to these penetrating and entirely affected Engagements. Anger and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred are beyond the duty of Justice, and are Passions only useful to those who do not keep themselves strictly to their duty by meer <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

He only employs his Passion that can make no use of his Reason.</hi> All just intentions are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate of themselves; if otherwise, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Seditious and unlawful. This is it which makes me walk every where with my Head erect, my Face and my Heart open. To confess the Truth, and I am not afraid to confess it; I should easily for need hold up one Candle to St. <hi>Michael</hi> and another to his <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> like the old Woman; I will follow the right side even to the fire, but exclusively if I can: Let <hi>Montaigne</hi> be over-whelm'd in the publick Ruin, if need be; but if there be no need, I should think my self oblig'd to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> to save me, and I will make use of all the length of line my duty allows for his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Was it not <hi>Atticus,</hi> who being of the just, but losing side, preserved himself by his moderation, in that universal shipwrack of the World amongst so many mutations and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities? For private men, as he was, it is more easie;<note place="margin">That 'tis neither Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor Honest, to stand Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War.</note> and in such kind of work, I find a man may justly not be ambitious to offer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate himself; for a man indeed to be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and irresolute, to keep his affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, and without inclination in the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Country, and a publick Division, I neither think it handsome nor honest.<note place="margin">

and thus <hi>Gelo</hi> the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Syracusa</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended his inclination in the War betwixt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> keeping a <hi>Resident Embassador</hi> with Presents at <hi>Delphos,</hi> to lye and watch to see which way Fortune would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and then take present occasion to fall in with the Victors. It would be a kind of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to proceed after this manner in our own domestick Affairs, wherein a man must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be of the one side or the other; though for a Man who has no <hi>Office</hi> or express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to call him out, to sit still, I hold it more excusable (and yet I do not excuse my self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these terms) except in Foreign Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which also, according to our <hi>Laws,</hi> no man is prest against his will. And yet even those who wholly engage themselves in such a War, may behave themselves with such tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and moderation, that 'tis likely the storm may fly over their heads without doing them any harm. Had we not reason to expect such an issue in the Person of the late <hi>Sieur de Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiers,</hi> late <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi>? And I know amongst those who behave themselves the most bravely and briskly in the present War, some whose Manners are so gentle, obliging, and just, that they will certainly stand firm what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Event Heaven is preparing for us. I am of Opinion, that it properly belongs to <hi>Kings</hi> only to quarrel <hi>Kings,</hi> and laugh at those <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Rocks,</hi> that out of wantonness of Courage, present themselves to so disproportion'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes: for a Man has never the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53645:721" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quarrel to a <hi>Prince,</hi> for marching openly and boldly against him for his own Honour, and according to his Duty: if he does not love such a Person, he does better he has a Reverence and Esteem for him. And the Cause of defending the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the Ancient Government of a Kingdom, has this always especially annext to it, that even those, who for their own private Interest invade them, excuse, if they do not honour the <hi>Defenders.</hi> But we are not, as we now a days do, to call pievishness and inward discontent, that spring from private Interest and passion, Duty, nor a treacherous and malitious conduct, Courage. They call their propension to mischief and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>Zeal</hi>: 'tis not the <hi>Cause,</hi> but their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> that inflames them. They kindle and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a <hi>War,</hi> not because it is just, but because it is War. A Man may very well behave himself commodiously and loyally too, amongst those of the adverse Party; carry your self, if not with the same equal affection (for that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of different measures) at least, with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection moderate, well temper'd, and such as shall not so engage you to one Party, that it may expect all you are able to do for that side, and content your self also with a moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Favour and good Will, and to swim in troubled Waters without fishing in them. The other way of offering a man's self, and the utmost Service he is able to do, both to one Party and the other, has yet in it less of Prudence than Conscience. Does not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53645:721" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he to whom you betray another, to whom you was as welcome as to himself, know that you will at another time do as much for him? He holds you for a Villain; and in the mean time hears what you will say, gathers intelligence from you, and works his own ends out of your disloyalty;<note place="margin">Wherein Double-dealing Men are of Use.</note> for double-dealing men are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in bringing in, but we must have a care they carry out as little as is possible. I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to one Party, that I may not upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion say to the other, with a little alteration of accent, and report nothing but things either indifferent or known, or what is of common Consequence. I cannot permit my self for any consideration to tell them a <hi>Lye.</hi> What is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to my secrecy, I religiously conceal; but I take as few trusts of that nature upon me as I can. The Secrets of <hi>Princes</hi> are a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some burthen to such as are not interested in them. I very willingly indent that they trust me with little, but confidently rely upon what I tell them: I have ever known more than I desir'd. One open way of speaking opens ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open way of speaking, and draws out dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries like <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Love. Phillipides,</hi> in my Opinion, answer'd King <hi>Lysimacus</hi> very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, <hi>who asking him what of his Estate he should bestow upon him? What you will, said he, provided it be none of your Secrets.</hi> I see every one mutters, and is displeased, if the bottom of the Affair be conceal'd from him wherein he is employ'd, or that there be any reservation in the thing; for my part, I am content to know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53645:722" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no more of the business than what they desire I should employ my self in, nor desire that my Knowledge should exceed or strain my word: If I must serve for an Instrument of deceit, let it be at least with a safe Conscience. I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reputed a Servant so affectionate, nor so loyal, as to be fit to betray any one. Who is unfaithful to himself, is excusably so to his Master. But they are <hi>Princes</hi> who do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept men by halves, and despise limited and conditional Services. I cannot help it, I truly tell them how far I can go; for a <hi>Slave</hi> I should not be, but upon very good Reason, and however I could hardly submit to that Condition. And they also are too blame to exact from a Free-man the same Subjection and Obligation to their Service, they do from him they have made, and bought, or whose Fortune does particularly and expresly depend upon theirs. The <hi>Laws</hi> have delivered me from a great Anxiety, they have chosen a Master for me, all other Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and Obligation ought to be relative to him, and cut off from all other. Yet is not this to say, that if my Affection should otherwise sway and incline me, my hand should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently obey it; the Will and Desire are a <hi>Law</hi> to themselves; but Actions must receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the publick appointment. All this proceeding of mine is a little dissonant from the ordinary forms; It would produce no great Effects, nor be of any long duration; Innocence it self could not, in this Age of ours, either Negotiate without Dissimulation, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53645:722"/>
Traffick without Lying. And indeed publick Employments are by no means for my Pallat: what my Profession requires, I perform after the most private manner that I can. Being young, I was engag'd up to the Ears in Business, and it succeeded well, but I disengag'd my self in due time. I have often since avoided med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it, rarely accepted, and never ask'd it, keeping my back still turn'd to Ambition: but if not like Rowers, who so advance backward, yet so nevertheless, that I am less oblig'd to my Resolution than to my good Fortune, that I was not wholly embark'd in it. For there are ways less displeasing to my Taste, and more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my Ability, by which, if she had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly call'd me to the publick Service, and my own Advancement towards the Worlds Opinion, I know I should, in spite of all my own Arguments to the contrary, have pursued them. Such as commonly say, in Opposition to what I profess, that what I call Freedom, Simplicity, and plainness in my Manners, is Art, and Subtilty, and rather Prudence than Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Industry than Nature, good Sence than good Luck, do me more Honour than Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: but doubtless they make my Subtilty too subtle; and whoever has follow'd me close, and pry'd narrowly into me, I will give him the Victory, if he does not confess that there is no <hi>Rule</hi> in their School that could match this natural Motion, and maintain an apparence of Liberty and Licence so equal and inflexible, through so many various and crooked Paths,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53645:723" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that all their Wit and Endeavour could never have led them through.

obtain'd the honour to be of his Council, and one of the chiefest in his Trust; with these Advantages, and taking an opportune occasion of his Masters absence, he betray'd <hi>Visilicia,</hi> a great and rich <hi>City,</hi> to the <hi>Russians,</hi> which was entirely sack'd and burn't, and not only all the Inhabitants of both Sexes, young and old, put to the Sword, but moreover a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Neighbouring Gentry, that he had drawn thither to that wicked end. <hi>Jaropele,</hi> his Revenge being thus satisfied, and his Anger appeas'd, which was not however without pretence (for <hi>Boleslaus</hi> had highly offended him, and after the same manner) and sated with the effect of this Treachery, coming to consider the foulness of it, with a sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and clear from Passion, look'd upon what had been done with so much horror and remorse, that he caus'd the Eyes to be boar'd out, and the Tongue, and shameful Parts to be cut off of him that had perform'd it. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> perswaded <hi>Agaraspides</hi>'s Souldiers to betray <hi>Eumenes</hi> their General, his Adversary, into his hands.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53645:725"/>
the more wickedly he judg'd it to be, and meriting greater Punishment. The Slave that betray'd the place where his Master <hi>P.

After having satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their second, and special faith, they satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the general, and first. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second, being resolv'd to rid himself of his Brother, out of Jealousie of State, according to the Practice of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, he employ'd one of his Officers in the Execution; who pouring a quantity of Water too fast into him, choak'd him. This being done, to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Murther, he deliver'd the Murtherer into the hands of the Mother of him he had so caus'd to be put to Death, (for they were but half Brothers by the Fathers side) who in his Presence ript up the Murtherers Bosom, and with her own revenging hands rifled his Breast for his Heart, tore it out, and threw it to the Dogs. And even to the vilest Dispositions, it is the sweetest thing imaginable, having once got the trick in a vicious Action, to foist, in

To which may be added, that they look upon the Ministers of such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crimes, as upon People that reproach them with them; and think by their Deaths to race out the Memory and Testimony of such Proceedings. Or if perhaps you are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to frustrate the publick Necessity of that extream and desperate Remedy; he that does it, cannot for all that, if he be not such himself, but look upon you as a cursed and execrable fellow; and conclude you a greater Traytor, than he does against whom you are so: for he tries the Lewdness of your Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition by your own hands; where he cannot possibly be deceiv'd, you having no Object of preceding hatred to move you to such an Act.

Though he should with folded arms only call <hi>God</hi> to his Assistance, has he not reason to hope that the Divine bounty will not refuse the Favour of an extraordinary Arm to just and pure hands? These are dangerous Examples, rare, and sickly exceptions to our natural Rules: we must yield to them, but with great Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Circumspection.

This fantastick Conclusion carries along with it some excuse, by reason of the danger of the Example, and the importance of so bifronted an Action: And they did well to discharge their own Judgment of it, and to referr it to others, who were not so much concern'd. But <hi>Timoleon</hi>'s comportment in this <hi>Expedition</hi> soon made his Cause more clear; so worthily and virtuously he demean'd himself upon all occasions. And the good Fortune that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him in the difficulties he had to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in this noble Employment, seem'd to be strew'd in his way by the <hi>Gods,</hi> as favourably conspiring for his Justification.

                     <p>OThers form <hi>Man,</hi> I only report him: and represent a particular one, ill fashion'd enough: and whom, if I had to model a new,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53645:730" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I should certainly make him something else than what he is: but that's past recalling. Now, though the Features of my Picture alter and change, 'tis not however unlike. The World eternally turns round, all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are incessantly moving, the Earth, the Rocks of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and the <hi>Pyramids</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> both by the publick motion, and their own. Even <hi>Constancy</hi> it self is no other but a slower and more languishing Motion. I cannot fix my Object, 'tis always tottering and reeling by a natural Giddiness. I take it as it is at the instant I consider of it. I do not paint its Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I paint its Passage, not a passing from one Age to another, or, as the People say, from seven to seven Years; but from Day to Day, from Minute to Minute. I must accommodate my <hi>History</hi> to the Hour. I may presently change, not only by Fortune, but also by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention? 'Tis a counterpart of various and changeable Accidents, and irresolute Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, as it falls out, sometimes contrary: whether it be that I am then another self; or that I take Subjects by other Circumstances and considerations; so it is that I may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contradict: but, as <hi>Demades</hi> said, I never contradict the Truth. Could my Soul once take footing, I would not Essay, but resolve: but it is always learning and making tryal. I propose a Life mean, and without luster? 'Tis all one. All moral <hi>Philosophy</hi> may as well be apply'd to a private Life, as to one of the greatest Employment: Every man carries
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53645:731" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the entire form of human Condition. <hi>Authors</hi> communicate themselves to the People by some especial Work; I, the first of any, by my uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Being</hi>: as <hi>Michael de Montaigne,</hi> not as a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> a <hi>Poet,</hi> or a <hi>Lawyer.</hi> If the World find fault that I <hi>speak</hi> of my self, I find fault that they do not so much as <hi>think</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But is it reason, that being so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in my way and manner of living, and of so little Use, I should pretend to recommend my self to the publick knowledge? And is it also reason, that I should introduce into the World, where <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Handling</hi> have so much credit and authority, crude, and simple effects of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of a weak Nature to boot? Is it not to build a Wall without Stone or Brick, or some such thing, to write Books without Learning? The fancies of <hi>Musick</hi> are carried on by <hi>Art,</hi> mine by <hi>Chance</hi>: I have this at least according to Discipline, that never any man treated of a Subject he better understood and knew, than what I have undertaken, and that in this I am the most understanding Man alive. Secondly, that never any man penetrated far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his matter, nor better, and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly sifted the Parts and Consequences of it, nor ever more exactly and fully arriv'd at the end he propos'd to himself. To finish it, I need bring nothing but fidelity to the Work; and that is there, and the most pure and sincere that is any where to be found. I speak truth, not so much as I would, but as much as I dare, and I dare a little the more, as I grow older,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53645:731" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for, methinks, Custom allows to Age more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of prating, and more indiscretion of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man's self. That cannot fall out here, which I often see elsewhere, that the Work and the Artificer contradict one another: Has a man of so sober Conversation writ so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish a Treatise? Or do so learned writings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a man of so weak Conversation? Who talks at a very ordinary rate, and writes rarely; is to say that his Capacity is borrow'd, and not his own. A learned man is not learned in all things; but a sufficient man is sufficient throughout, even to Ignorance it self. Here my Book and I go hand in hand together. Elsewhere men may recommend or accuse the Work upon the Work-man's account; here they cannot: Who touches the one invades the other. He that shall censure it without knowing him, will more wrong himself than me; who does understand it, gives me all the satisfaction I desire. I shall be happy beyond my desert, if I can obtain only thus much from the publick Approbation, as to make men of understanding perceive that I was capable of making my advantage of Knowledge, had I had it, and that I deserved to have been assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a better Memory.</p>
                     <p>Be pleas'd here to excuse what I often repeat, that I very rarely repent, and that my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is satisfied with it self, not like the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of an <hi>Angel,</hi> or that of a <hi>Horse,</hi> but like the Conscience of a man; always adding this Clause, not one of Ceremony, but a true and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53645:732" rendition="simple:additions"/>
real Submission; that I speak enquiring and doubtingly, purely and simply referring my self to the common and accepted beliefs for the Resolution. I do not teach, I only repeat. There is no Vice, that is absolutely so, which does not offend, and that a sound Judgment does not accuse; for there is in it so manifest a Deformity and Inconvenience, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they are in the right, who say, that it is chiefly begot by Ignorance: So hard it is to imagine that a man can know without abhorring it. <hi>Malice</hi> sucks up the greatest part of her own venom, and poysons herself. <hi>Vice</hi> leaves repentance in the Soul, like an <hi>Vlcer</hi> in the flesh, which is always scratching and lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it self: For <hi>Reason</hi> effaces all other griefs and sorrows, but it begets that of Repentance, which is so much the more grievous, by reason it springs within, as the cold and hot of Fevers are more sharp than those that only strike upon the outward skin. I hold for Vices, (but every one according to its proportion) not only those which <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> condemn; but those also, the opinion of men, though false and erroneous, have made such, if authoris'd by Law and Custom. There is likewise no <hi>Virtue</hi> which does not rejoyce a well descended Nature. There is a kind of I know not what congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in well doing, that gives us an inward Satisfaction, and a certain generous boldness that accompanies a good Conscience. A Soul da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly vicious, may peradventure arm it self with security, but cannot supply it self with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53645:732" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Complacency and Satisfaction. 'Tis no little Satisfaction to feel a Man's self preserv'd from the contagion of so deprav'd an <hi>Age,</hi> and to say to himself; <hi>Whoever could penetrate into my Soul, would not there find me guilty either of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or the ruin of any one; or of Revenge or Envy, or any offence against the publick Laws, or of Novelty, or Trouble, or failure of my word, and though the licence of the Time permits, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches every one so to do, yet have I not plunder'd any French Man's Goods, or taken his Money, and have liv'd upon what is my own in War as well as Peace; neither have I set any man to work without paying him his Hire.</hi> These Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of a good <hi>Conscience</hi> please, and this natural rejoycing is very beneficial to us, and the only reward that we can never fail of. To ground the recompence of virtuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Approbation of others, is too incertain and unsafe a Foundation, especially in so corrupt and ignorant an Age as this, the good Opinion of the vulgar is injurious. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom do you rely to shew you what is recommendable? God defend me from being an honest Man, according to the Descriptions of Honour I daily see every one make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Quae fuerant Vitia, Mores sunt.</hi>

                        <hi>What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were Vices, are now reputed Manners.</hi> Some of my Friends have sometimes school'd and tutor'd me with great Sincerity and Plainness, either of their own voluntary motion, or by me entreated to it, as to an Office, which to a well compos'd Soul, surpasses not only in Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53645:733" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but in Kindness, all other Offices of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. I have always receiv'd them with the most open Arms, both of Courtesie and Acknowledgment. But to say the truth, I have often found so much false Measure, both in their Reproaches and Praises, that I had not done much amiss, rather to have err'd than to have done well, according to their Method. We chiefly, who live private Lives, not expos'd to any other view than our own, ought to have setled a president within our selves, by which to try our Actions: and according to that, sometimes to incourage, and sometimes to correct our selves. I have my <hi>Laws</hi> and my <hi>Judicature</hi> to judge of my self, and apply my self more to those than any other Rules. I do indeed restrain my Actions according to others; but extend them not by any other Rule than my own. You your self only know if you are cowardly and cruel, loyal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout: others see you not, and only guess at you by incertain Conjectures, and do not so much see your Nature as your Art.

                     <p>'Tis an exact life, that contains it self in due order in private: every one may juggle his part, and represent an honest man upon the Stage: but within, and in his own Bosom, where all things are lawful, all things conceal'd to be regular, there's the point. The next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is to be so in his House, and in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Actions, of which we are accountable to none, and where there is no study, nor Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And therefore <hi>Bias,</hi> setting forth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent estate of a private Family, of which, says he, the Master is the same within, by his own Virtue and Temper, that he is abroad,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53645:734" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for fear of the Laws, and report of Men. And it was a worthy saying of <hi>Julius Drufus,</hi> to the <hi>Masons</hi> who offer'd him for three thousand Crowns to put his House in such a Posture that his Neighbours should no more have the same Inspection into it as before; <hi>I will give you,</hi> said he, <hi>six thousand,</hi> to make it so that every body may see into every Room. 'Tis honourably recorded of <hi>Argesilaus,</hi> that he us'd in his Journeys always to take up his Lodgings in Temples, to the end that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and the <hi>Gods</hi> themselves, might pry into his most private Actions.

In my Country of <hi>Gascony,</hi> they look upon it as a Drollery to see me in print. The further off I am read from my own home, the better I am esteem'd. I am fain to purchase <hi>Printers</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> elsewhere they purchase me. Upon this it is, that they lay their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, who conceal themselves present, and living, to obtain a Name when they are absent, and dead. I had rather have a great deal less in hand, and do not expose my self to the World upon any other account than my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent share; when I leave it, I quit the rest.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53645:734" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The People reconduct such a one with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Wonders and Applause to his very Door, he puts off this pageantry with his Robe, and falls so much the lower by how much he was higher exalted. In himself within, all is in tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and disorder. And though all should be regular there, it will require a quick and well chosen Judgment that can perceive it in these low and private Actions. To which may be added, that <hi>Order</hi> is a heavy, melancholick Virtue: to enter a Breach, carry an Embassy, and govern a People, are Actions of Renown: to reprehend, laugh, sell, pay, love, hate, and gently and justly converse with a man's own Family, and with himself; not to relent, not to give a man's self the lye, is more rare and hard, and less remarkable. By which means retir'd lives, whatever is said to the contrary, undergo Offices of as great, or greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty than the other do. And private men, says <hi>Aristotle,</hi> serve Virtue more painfully and assiduously, than those in Authority do. We prepare our selves for eminent Occasions, more out of Glory than Conscience. The shortest way to arrive at Glory, should be to do that for Conscience which we do for Glory. And the Virtue of <hi>Alexander</hi> appears to me with much less Vigour in his <hi>Theater,</hi> than that of <hi>Socrates</hi> in his mean and obscure Employment. I can easily conceive <hi>Socrates</hi> in the place of <hi>Alexander,</hi> but <hi>Alexander</hi> in that of <hi>Socrates</hi> I cannot. Who shall ask the one what he can do, he will answer, <hi>subdue the World</hi>: And
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53645:735" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who shall put the same question to the other, he will say, carry on humane Life conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its natural Condition; a much more general, weighty, and legitimate Knowledge than the other. The Virtue of the Soul does not consist in flying high, but walking order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; its Grandeur does not exercise it self in Grandeur, but in Mediocrity. As they who judg and try us within, make no great account of the lustre of publick Actions; and see they are only streaks and raies of clear Water springing from a slimy and muddy bottom: So likewise they who judg of us by this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant outward appearance, in like manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of our internal Constitution; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not couple common Faculties, and like their own with the other Faculties, that astonish them, and are so far out of their sights. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that we give such savage forms to <hi>Demons.</hi> And who does not give <hi>Tamberlain</hi> great Eye-browes, wide Nostrils, a dreadful Face, and a prodigious Stature, according to the imagination he has conceiv'd by the report of his Name? Had any one formerly brought me to <hi>Erasmus,</hi> I should hardly have believ'd, but that all was <hi>Adage</hi> and <hi>Apothegme</hi> he spoke to his Man, or his Hostess. We much more aptly imagine an <hi>Artizan</hi> upon his Close-stool, or upon his Wife, than a great <hi>President</hi> vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by his port and sufficiency. We fancy that they will not abase themselves so much from their high <hi>Tribunals,</hi> as to live. As vicious Souls are often incited by some strange
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53645:735" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impulse to do well, so are virtuous Souls to do ill. They are therefore to be judg'd by their settled state when they are near repose, and in their native station. Natural inclinations are much assisted and fortified by Education, but they seldom alter and overcome their Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. A thousand Natures of my time have escap'd towards Virtue or Vice through a quite contrary Discipline.</p>

I have always uttered my first out-cries and ejaculations in <hi>Latine.</hi> Nature starting up, and forcibly expressing it self in spite of so long a Discontinuation; and this Example is said of many others. They who in my time have attempted to correct the Manners of the World by new Opinions, have indeed reform'd seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vices, but the real and essential Vices they leave as they were, if they do not augment them; and augmentation is therein to be fear'd; we defer all other well doing of less cost and greater merit, upon the account of these exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reformations, and thereby expiate good cheap, for the other natural, consubstantial and intestine Vices. Look a little into our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. There is no man, if he listen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who does not in himself discover a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and governing Form of his own that justles his Education, and wrestles with the tempest of Passions that are contrary to him. For my part, I seldom find my self agitated with Surprises; I almost always find my self in my place, as heavy and unweildy Bodies do: If I am not at home, I am always near at hand; my Debauches do not transport me very far, there is nothing strange or extream in the case; and yet I have sound and vigorous Raptures and Delights. The true Condemnation, and which touches the common practice of Men, is, that their very Progress it self is full of Filth and Corruption; the Idea of their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53645:736"/>
blotted, their Repentance sick and faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as much very near as their Sin. Some, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for having been link'd to Vice by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Propension, or long Practice, cannot see the Deformity of it. Others (of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution I am) do indeed weigh Vice, but they counter-balance it with Pleasure, or some other occasion, and suffer, and lend themselves to it for a certain price; but viciously and basely however: yet there might happily be imagin'd so vast a disproportion of measure, where with justice the Pleasure might excuse the Sin, as we say of profit; not only if accidental, and out of Sin, as in Thefts; but in the very exercise of it; as in the injoyment of Women, where the Temptation is violent, and 'tis said, sometimes not to be overcome.</p>
                     <p>Being the other day at <hi>Armaignac,</hi> which appertains to a Kinsman of mine, I there saw a Country Fellow that was by every one nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd the <hi>Thief</hi>; who thus related the story of his own Life: That being born a Beggar, and finding that he should not be able to get his living by his hands, he resolv'd to turn <hi>Thief,</hi> and by means of his strength of Body, had excercis'd this trade all the time of his Youth in great security; for he ever made his Harvest and Vintage in other mens Grounds, but a great way off, and in so great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it was not to be imagin'd one man could have carried away so much in one night upon his Shoulders; and moreover, was so carefull equally to divide and distribute the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53645:737"/>
mischief he did, that the loss was of less Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to every particular man. He is now grown old and rich, for a man of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thanks be to his <hi>Trade,</hi> which he openly confesses to every one: and to make his Peace with <hi>God</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he says, that he is daily ready by good Offices to make satisfaction to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of those he has rob'd, and if he do not finish, (for to do it all at once he is not able) he will then leave it in charge to his Heirs to perform the rest proportionably to wrong he himself only knows he has done to every one. By this Description, whether true or false, this Man looks upon Theft as a dishonest Action, and hates it, but less than Poverty, and does simply repent; but for as much as was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd he repents not. This is not that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that incorporates us into Vice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms even our Understanding it self to it, nor is it that impetuous Whirl-wind that by gusts troubles and blinds our Souls, and for the time, precipitates us, Judgment and all, into the power of Vice.</p>
                     <p>I customarily do what I do thorowly, I make but one step on't; I have rarely any movement that hides it self and steals away from my Reason, and that does not upon the matter proceed by the consent of all my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, without decision, or intestine Sedition; my Judgment is to have all the blame, or all the praise, and the blame it once has it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, for I have from my Infancy almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had the same inclination, the same speed,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53645:737" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the same force. And as to universal Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I fix'd my self from my Child-hood in the place where I resolv'd to stick. There are some Sins that are impetuous, prompt, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, let us set them aside; but in these other Sins so oft repeated, deliberated and contriv'd, whether Sins of Complexion, or Sins of Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Vocation; I cannot conceive that they can have so long been settled in the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, unless the Reason and Conscience of him who has them be constant to have them so, and the Repentance he boasts to be inspir'd with on a sudden, is very hard for me to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. I follow not the Opinion of the <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean Sect,</hi> that men take up a new Soul when they repair to the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi> to receive <hi>Oracles,</hi> unless they mean that it is new, and lent for the time, our own shewing so small sign of Purification and Cleanness, fit for such an Office. They act quite contrary to the <hi>Stoical</hi> Precepts, that do indeed command us to correct the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which we know our selves guilty of, but forbids us to disturb the Repose of our Souls. These make us believe that they have great Grief and Remorse within: but of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Correction, or Demonstration, they make nothing appear. It cannot certainly be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure, if the Humor be not wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd, if <hi>Repentance</hi> were laid upon the Scale of a Ballance, it would weigh down Sin.<note place="margin">Devotion easie to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</note> I find no quality so easie to counterfeit, as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, provided they do not conform their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53645:738" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Manners and Life to the Profession: its Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is abstruce and occult, the apparences easie and majestick. For my own part, I may desire in general to be other than I am; I may condemn and dislike my whole frame, and beg of Almighty <hi>God</hi> for an entire Reformation, and that he will please to pardon my natural Infirmity: but I ought not to call this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, methinks, no more than the being dissatisfied that I am not an <hi>Angel,</hi> or <hi>Cato</hi>: my Actions are conformable to what I am, and to my Condition. I can do no better, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is not properly concern'd in things that are not in our Power; Sorrow is. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine an infinite number of Souls more elevated and regular than mine; and yet I do not for all that improve my Faculties no more than my Arm, or will grow more strong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for conceiving those of another to be so. If to imagine and wish a nobler way of acting than that we have,<note place="margin">Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance whence produc'd.</note> should produce a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our own, we must then repent us of our most innocent Actions, forasmuch as we well suppose, that in a more excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would have been carried on with greater Dignity and Perfection; and would that ours were so. When I reflect upon the Deportments of my Youth, with that of my old age, I find that I have behaved my self equally well in both, according to what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. This is all that my resistance can do. I do not flatter my self; in the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance I should do the same things. It is not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53645:738" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Spot, but rather an universal Tincture, with which I am imbued. I know no mean Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and superficial Repentance. It must sting me all over before I can call it so, and that it prick my Bowels as deep and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>God</hi> sees into me. As to Employment, many good Opportunities have escap'd me for want of good Conduct; and yet my Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were sound enough, according to the occurrences presented to me. 'Tis their way to choose always the easiest and the safest course. I find that in my former Counsels, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with Discretion, according to my own rule, and according to the state of the subject propos'd, and should do the same a thousand years hence in like Occasions. I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is now, but what it was then, when I deliberated on it. The force of all Counsel consists in the Time; Occasions, and things eternally shift and change. I have in my Life committed some great and important Errors, not for want of good Understanding, but for want of good Luck. There are secret, and not to be foreseen parts in matters we have in handling, especially in the Nature of men; mute Conditions, that make no show, unknown sometimes even to the Professors themselves; that spring and start up by accidental Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If my Prudence could not penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor foresee them, I blame it not: 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd no further than its own limits. If the event be too hard for me, and take the side I have refus'd, there is no Remedy, I do not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53645:739" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blame my self, I accuse my Fortune, and not my own handy Work; this cannot be called Repentance. <hi>Phocion,</hi> having given the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> an Advice that was not follow'd, and the Affair nevertheless succeeding contrary to his Opinion, some one said to him; <hi>Well,</hi> Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>art thou content that Matters go so well? I am very well pleas'd</hi> reply'd he, <hi>that this has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so well, but I do not repent that I counsell'd the other.</hi> When any of my Friends address themselves to me for Advice, I give it candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, without sticking, as almost all other men do, at the hazard of the thing, that it may fall out contrary to my Opinion, by which means I may be reproach'd for my Counsel; I am very indifferent as to that: For the Fault will be theirs in having consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; and I could not refuse them my best Advice. I, for my own part, can rarely blame any one but my self, for my oversights and Misfortunes. For indeed I seldom consult the Advice of another, if not by Honour of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, or excepting where I stand in need of Information, as to matter of Fact. But in things wherein I stand in need of nothing but Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, other mens Reasons may serve to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my own, but have little power to dissuade me. I hear them with Civility and Patience all; but to my knowledge, I never made use of any but my own. With me they are but Flies and Atoms, that confound and distract my Will. I lay no great stress upon my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but I lay as little upon those of others,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53645:739" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Fortune rewards me accordingly. If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but little Advice, I also give but little; I seldom consult others, and am seldom believ'd, and know no concern either publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that has been mended or better'd by my Advice. Even they whom Fortune had in some sort ty'd to my Direction, have more willingly suffer'd themselves to be govern'd by any other Counsels than mine; and as a man who is as jealous of my repose as of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I am better pleas'd that it should be so. In leaving me there, they humour what I profess, which is to settle and wholly contain my self within my self: I take a pleasure in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uninteressed from other mens Affairs, and disengag'd from being their warranty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsible for what they do. In all Affairs that are past, be it how it will, I have very little regret; for this Imagination puts me out of my pain, that they ought so to fall out: they are in the great revolution of the World, and in the Chain of Stoical Causes: your Fancy cannot, by wish and Imagination, remove one tittle, but that the great current of things will reverse both the past and the future. As to the rest, I abominate that accidental Repentance which old Age brings along with it: and he, who said of old, that he was oblig'd to his Age for having wean'd him from Pleasure, was of of another Opinion than I am; I can never think my self beholding to Impotency for any good it can ever do me. <hi>Nec tam aversa un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam videbitur ab opere suo Providentia, ut de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53645:740" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inter optima inventa sit. Nor can Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ever be seen so averse to her own Work, that debility should be rank'd amongst the best things.</hi> Our Appetites are rare in old age; a profound Saciety seizes us after the Act; I see nothing of Conscience in this, heaviness and weakness imprint in us a drowsie and rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Virtue. We must not suffer our selves to be so wholly carried away by natural altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to suffer our Judgments to be impos'd upon by them. Youth and Pleasure have not formerly so far prevail'd upon me, that I did not well enough discern the face of Vice in Pleasure, neither does the nausity that years have brought me, so far prevail with me now, that I cannot discern Pleasure in Vice. Now that I am no more in my flourishing Age, I judge as well of these things as if I was. I, who narrowly and strictly examine it, find my Reason the very same it was in my most licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious age, if not perhaps a little weaker, and more decay'd by being grown old; and I find that the Pleasure it refuses me upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my bodily Health, it would no more refuse it now in Consideration of the health of my Soul than at any time heretofore. I do not repute it more valiant for being out of Combat. My temptations are so broken and mortified, that they are not worth its Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, holding but out my hands I repell them. Should one present the old Concupiscence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, I fear it would have less power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it than heretofore. I do not discern that in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53645:740" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it self it judges any thing otherwise now, than it formerly did, nor that it has acquir'd any new light. Wherefore, if there be convales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, 'tis an inchanted one. Miserable kind of Remedy to owe a mans Health to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. 'Tis not for our misfortune to perform this Office, but for the good fortune of our Judgment. I am not to be made to do any thing by Persecutions and Afflictions, but curse them. That is for People that are not to be rous'd but by a Whip; my Reason is much more active in Prosperity, and much more distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put to't to digest Pains than Pleasures. I see best in a clear Sky. Health does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish me, as more chearfully, so to better purpose than Sickness. I did all that in me lay to reform and regulate my self from Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures at all times, when I had Health and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to enjoy them. I should be troubled and ashamed, that the Misery and Misfortune of my Age, should be prefer'd before my good, healthful, spritely, and vigorous Years; and that men should esteem me, not for what I have been, but by that miserable part of my self, where I have, as it were, ceas'd to be. In my Opinion 'tis the happy Living, and not (as said <hi>Antisthenes</hi>) the happy Dying, in which humane Felicity consists. I have not made it my Business to make a monstrous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Philosophers tayl to the Head and Body of a Libertine: nor would I have this wretched remainder give the lye to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, sound, and long part of my Life. I will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53645:741" rendition="simple:additions"/>
present my self uniformly throughout. Were I to live my Life over again, I should live it just as I have done. I neither complain of the past, nor do I fear the future; and If I am not much deceiv'd, I am the same within that I am without. 'Tis one main Obligation I have to Fortune, that the Succession of my bodily Estate has been carried on according to the natural Seasons; I have seen the Grass, the Blossoms, and the Fruit, and now see the Tree wither'd: happily however, because natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I bear the Infirmities I have the better, because they came not till I had Reason to expect them; and because also they make me with greater Pleasure remember that long Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of my past Life. My Wisdom peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may have been the same in both Ages; but it was more active, and of better Grace whilst young and spritely, than now it is when broken, pievish, and uneasie. I renounce then these casual and painful Reformations, God must touch our Hearts, and our Consciences must amend of themselves, by the force of our Reason, and not by the decay of our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. Pleasure is in it self neither pale nor discoloured, to be discern'd by dim and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd Eyes. We ought to love Temperance for it self, and because God has commanded that and Chastity; but what we are reduc'd to by Catarrhs, and that I am oblig'd to the Stone for, is neither Chastity nor Temperance. A Man cannot boast that he despises and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists Pleasure, if he cannot see it; if he knows
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53645:741" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not what it is, cannot discern its graces, forces, and most alluring Beauties; I know both the one and the other, and may therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter say it; but, methinks, our Souls in old Age are subject to more troublesome maladies and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections than in Youth. I said the same when young, and that I was reproach'd with the want of a Beard, and I say so now that my gray Hairs give me some Authority; we call the difficulty of our Humours, and the disrelish of present things, Wisdom, but in truth we do not so much forsake Vices as we change them, and in my opinion, for worse. Besides a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and feeble Pride, an impertinent Prating, froward and insociable Humours, Superstition, and a ridiculous desire of Riches when we have lost the Use; I find more Envy, Injustice and Malice. Age imprints more wrinkles in the Mind than it does in the Face, and Souls are never, or very rarely seen, that in growing old do not smell soure and musty. Man moves all together, both towards his perfection and decay. In observing the Wisdom of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and many Circumstances of his condemnation, I should dare to believe, that he in some sort himself purposely by collusion contributed to it, seeing that at the age of seventy years he suffered the lofty motions of his Wit to be so crampt, and his wonted lustre to be so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd. What strange Metamorphoses do I see Age every day make in many of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? 'tis a potent Malady, and that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and imperceptibly steals into us, and vast
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53645:742" rendition="simple:additions"/>
provision of study, and great precaution are requir'd to evade the imperfections it loads us with, or at least, to obstruct their progress. I find, that notwithstanding all my retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it gets foot by foot upon me; I make the best resistance I can, but I do not know to what at last it will reduce me; but fall out what will, I am content the World may know when I am fall'n, from whence I fell.</p>

Upon the lightest Subject can be offer'd, it makes it infinitely greater, and stretches it to that degree, as therein to employ its utmost power, wherefore its Idleness is to me a very painful Labour, and very prejudicial to my Health.

Books are to it a sort of employment that debauches it from its study. Upon the first Thoughts that possess it, it begins to bustle and make tryal of a Vigour in all Senses, exercises its power of handling, sometimes making tryal of its force, and then fortifying, moderating and ranging it self by the way of Grace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It has of its own wherewith to rouse its Faculties: Nature has given to it, as to all others, matter enough of its own to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, and Subjects proper enough, where

'Tis the business of the <hi>Gods,</hi> says <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and from whence both their beatitude and ours proceed. The principal use of Reading to me, is, that by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objects it rouzes my Reason, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys my Judgment, not my Memory. Few entertainments then detain me without force and violence; it is true, that the beauty and neatness of a Work take as much or more with me than the weight and depth of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And forasmuch as I slumber in all other communication, and give but a negligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it often falls out, that in such mean and pitiful Discourses, I either make strange and ridiculous Answers unbecomming a Child, or more indiscreetly and rudely maintain an obstinate Silence. I have a melancholick and pensive way, that withdraws me into my self, and to that a stupid and childish Ignorance of many very ordinary things, by which two Qualities I have obtain'd, that men may truly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53645:743" rendition="simple:additions"/>
report five or six as ridiculous tales of me as of any other whatever. But to proceed in my Subject; this difficult Complexion of mine ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me very nice in my conversation with men, whom I must cull and pick out for my purpose, and unfit for common Society. We live and negotiate with the People; if their Conversation be troublesome to us, if we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to apply our selves to mean and vulgar Souls, (and the mean and vulgar are oft as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular as those of the finest thred; and all wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is folly that does not accomodate it self to the common Ignorance) we must no more intermeddle either with other mens Affairs or our own; and all business both publick and private must be manag'd apart from the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The less forc'd, and most natural motions of the Soul, are the most beautiful; the best em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, those that are least constrain'd. Good God! how good an Office does <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to those whose desires it limits to their Power? That is the most happy Knowledge. <hi>What a man can,</hi> was the Sentence <hi>Socrates</hi> was so much in love withall, a <hi>Motto</hi> of great substance; we moderate and adapt our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to the nearest and easiest to be acquir'd things. Is it not a foolish Humour of mine, to separate my self from a thousand to whom my Fortune has conjoin'd me, and without whom I cannot live, to cleave to one or two that are out of my Commerce, or rather a fantastick desire of a thing I cannot obtain? My gentle and easie Manners, enemies of all soureness in

Conversation, may easily enough have secur'd me from the Envy and Animosities of men; I do not say so as to be belov'd, but never any man gave less occasions of being hated; but the coldness of my Conversation has reasonably depriv'd me of the good Will of many, who are to be excus'd if they interpret it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and worse sense. I am best at contracting, and maintain rare and exquisite Friendships; for by reason that I so greedily seize upon such Acquaintance as fits my liking, I throw my self with such violence upon them that I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail to stick, and oft make an Impression where I hit, as I have often made happy proof. I am in some sort cold and shy, for my motion is not natural, if not with full sail: Besides, my Fortune having train'd me up from my Youth in, and given me a relish of one sole and perfect Friendship, it has in truth given me a kind of nausity to meaner Conversations, and too much imprinted in my Fancy, that they are Beasts of <hi>Company,</hi> as the Ancient said, but not of the <hi>Herd.</hi> And also I have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural difficulty of communicating my self by halves, and that Reservation, servile, and jealous Prudence requir'd in the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of numerous and imperfect Friendships. And we are principally injoin'd to these in this Age of ours, when we cannot talk of the World, but either with danger or false-hood. Yet do I very well discern, that he who has the Conveniencies (I mean the the essential Conveniencies) of Life for his end, as I have,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53645:744" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought to fly these difficulties and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Humour as much as the Plague. I should commend a Soul of several Stories, that knows both how to bend and to slacken it self, that finds it self at ease in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fortune, that can discourse with a Neighbour, of his Building, Hunting, or any little Contention betwixt him and another: that can chat with a Carpenter or a Gardiner with Pleasure. I envy those who can render themselves familiar with the meanest of their Followers, and divert themselves with their own Attendants: and dislike the Advice of <hi>Plato,</hi> that Men should always speak in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterial tone to their Servants, whether Men or Women; without being sometimes faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and familiar. For besides my reason,<note place="margin">Magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to Servants reprov'd.</note> 'tis inhumane and unjust, to set so great a value upon this pittiful prerogative of Fortune; and the Governments, wherein less disparity is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted betwixt Masters and Servants, seem to me the most equitable. Others study how to raise and elevate their Minds, I, how to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mine, and to bring it low; 'tis only vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in extension.</p>

It is enough that they can without our Instruction govern the Graces of their Eyes to Gayety, Severity, and Sweetness, and season a denial either with Anger, Suspence, or Favour, and that they need not another to interpret what we speak for their Service.

themselves from our Treacheries, to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ardor of their own Desires, to manage their Liberty, lengthen the Pleasure of Life, and mildly to bear the inconstancY of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the rudeness of a Husband, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Years, Wrinckles, and the like. This is the utmost of what I would allow them in the Sciences. There are some particular Natures that are private and retir'd: my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way is proper for Communication, and apt to lay me open; I am all without, and in sight, born for Society and Friendship: the solitude that I love my self, and recommend to others, is chiefly no other, than to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my Thoughts and Affections into my self; to restrain and check, not my steps, but my own Cares and Desires; resigning all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Solitude, and mortally avoiding Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Obligations; and not so much the crowd of men, as the crowd of Business. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Solitude, to say the truth, does rather give me more room, and set me more at large; I more willingly throw my self upon Affairs of State, and the World, when I am alone. At the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and in the bustle of the <hi>Court,</hi> I fold my self within my own Skin. The crowd thrusts me upon my self. And I never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my self so wantonly, so licentiously, nor so particularly, as in places of respect, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious Prudence: Our Follies do not make men laugh, but our Wisdom. I am naturally no Enemy to a Court Life; I have therein past a good part of my own, and am of an Humour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53645:747" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be cheerfull in great Companies, provided it may be by intervals, and at my own time: But this softness of Judgment whereof I speak, ties me by force to solitude, even in my own House, in the middle of a numerous Family, and a House sufficiently frequented; I see People enow, but rarely such with whom I delight to converse. And I there reserve both for my self and others an unusual Liberty: There is in my House no such thing as Ceremonies, ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering or waiting upon them down to the Coach, and such other troublesome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as our courtesie joyns, (O servile and importunate Custom!) every one there governs himself according to his own Method; let who will speak his Thoughts, I sit mute, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating and shut up in my Closet, without any offence to my Guests. The men, whose Society and Familiarity I covet, are those they call sincere and ingenious men, and the Image of these make me disrelish the rest. It is, if rightly taken, the rarest of our Forms, and a Form that we chiefly owe to <hi>Nature.</hi> The end of this Commerce is simply Privacy, Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation and Conference, the exercise of Souls, without other Fruit. In our Discourse all Subjects are alike to me; let there be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weight, nor depth, 'tis all one, there is yet Grace and Pertinency, all there is tincted with a mature and constant Judgment, and mixt with Bounty, Freedom, Gayety and Friendship. 'Tis not only in talking of the Affairs of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that our Wits dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53645:747" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their force and Beauty, but every whit as much in private Conferences. I understand my People even by their Silence and Smiles; and better discover them perhaps at <hi>Table,</hi> than in the <hi>Counsel. Hippomachus</hi> said very well, <hi>that he could know the good Wrestlers by only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them walk in the Street.</hi> If Learning will please to step into our talk, it shall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, not magisterial, imperious, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as it commonly is, but suffragan and docile in it self. We there only seek to divert our selves, and to pass away our time; when we have a mind to be instructed and preach'd to, we will go seek it in its Throne. Let it debase it self to us for once, if it so please; for useful and profitable as it is, I presuppose that even in the greatest need, we may do well enough without it, and do our Business with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Assistance. A well descended Soul, and practic'd in the Conversation of men, will of her self, render her self agreable to all. Art is nothing but the counter-part and register of what such Souls produce. The Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation also of beautiful and well bred Women, is also for me a most sweet commerce:<note place="margin">

'Tis folly to fix all a man's Thoughts upon it, and madness to engage in it with a furious and indiscreet Affection; but on the other side, to engage there without Love and without Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, like <hi>Comedians,</hi> to play a common part, without putting any thing to it of his own but Words, is indeed to provide for his safety; but withall, after as scandalous a manner, as he who should abandon his Honour, Profit, or Pleasure, for fear of danger; for it is most certain, that from such a Practice, they who set it on foot can expect no Fruit that can please or satisfie a noble Soul. A man must of necessity have in good earnest desir'd that which he in good earnest expects to have a pleasure in enjoying; I say, though Fortune should unjustly favour their Dissimulation, which oft falls out, because there is none of the Sex, let her be as ugly as the <hi>Devil,</hi> who does not think her self well worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53645:748" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that does not prefer her self before other Women, either for her Youth, the colour of her Hair, or her gracefull Motion, (for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally there are no more foul than fair;) and the <hi>Brachman</hi> Virgins, who have no other Beauty to recommend them, the People being assembled by the common Crier to that effect, come out into the Market place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their matrimonial Parts to publick view, to try if those at least were not of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sufficient to get them Husbands. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there is not one who does not easily suffer her self to be overcome by the first Vow that is made to serve her. Now from this ordinary treachery of men, that must fall out which we already experimentally see, either that they rally together, and separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by themselves to evade us, or else form their Discipline by the Example we give them, play their Parts of the Farce as we do ours, and give themselves up to the sport, without Passion, Care, or Love: <hi>Neque affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctui suo aut alieno obnoxiae</hi>: believing, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the persuasion of <hi>Lysias</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> that they may with more Utility and Convenience surrender themselves up to us the less we love them.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53645:749" rendition="simple:additions"/>
guilty of it, it does not cost him much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but he also gets little or nothing by it. They who have made <hi>Venus</hi> a <hi>Goddess,</hi> have taken notice that her principal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was incorporeal and spiritual. But the <hi>Venus</hi> which these People hunt after, is not so much as humane, nor indeed brutal; the very Beasts will not accept it so gross and so earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We see that Imagination and Desire oft heats and incites them before the Body does; we see in both the one Sex and the other, they have in the <hi>herd</hi> choice and particular election in their Affections, and that they have amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a long Commerce of old good Will. Even those to whom old Age denies the practice of their desire, do yet tremble, neigh, and twitter for Love. We see them before the Act full of hope and ardour, and when the Body has play'd its Game, yet please themselves with the sweet remembrance of the Pleasure past; some that swell with Pride after they have perform'd, and others, who tir'd and sated, do yet by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferation express a triumphing Joy. Who has nothing to do but only to discharge his Body of a natural necessity, need not to trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with so curious Preparations. It is not Meat for a gross and boysterous Appetite. As one who does not desire that men should think me better than I am, I will here freely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Errors of my Youth, not only for the danger of impairing my Health, (and yet I could not be so carefull, but that I had two light Mischances) but moreover upon the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53645:749" rendition="simple:additions"/>
account of Contempt, I have seldom given my self up to common and mercenary Embraces. I would heighten the Pleasure by the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by Desire, and a certain kind of Glory; and was clearly of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s mind,<note place="margin">Modest and noble Amours of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>

As to the rest, I had a great esteem for Wit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Person was without exception; for, to confess the truth, if the one or the other of these two Perfections must of necessity be wanting, I should rather have quitted that of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that has its Use in better things; but in the subject of Love, a Subject principally relating to the Senses of Seeing and Touching, something may be done without the Graces of the Mind, without the Graces of the Body no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Beauty is the true prerogative of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so peculiarly their own, that ours, though naturally requiring another sort of Feature, is never in its lustre but when pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile and beardless, confus'd and mixt with theirs. 'Tis said, that such as are prefer'd to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> upon the account of Beauty, which are an infinite number, are at the farthest dismiss'd at two and twenty years of Age. Reason, Prudence, and Offices of Friendship are better found amongst men, and therefore it is, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53645:750" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they govern the Affairs of the World. These two Commerces are fortuitous, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon others; the one is troublesome by its rarity, the other wither with Age, so that they could never have been sufficient for the Business of my Life. That of Books, which is the third, is much more certain, and much more our own. It yields all other Advantages to the other two; but has the Constancy and Facility of its Service for its own share: It goes side by side with me in my whole Course, and every where is assisting to me: it comforts me in my Age and Solitude; it eases me of a troublesome weight of idleness, and delivers me at all hours from Company that I dislike: and it blunts the point of Griefs, if they are not extream, and have not got an entire Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of my Soul. To divert my self from a troublesome Fancy, 'tis but to run to my Books, they presently fix me to them, and drive the other out of my Thoughts; and do not mutiny to see that I have only recourse to them for want of other more real, natural, and lively Conveniencies; they always receive me with the same Kindness. <hi>He may well go a foot,</hi> they say, <hi>who leads his Horse in his Hand.</hi> And our <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> who, handsome, young, and healthful, caus'd himself to be carried up and down on a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, extended upon a pittiful mattrice in a poor Robe of gray Cloth, and a Cap of the same; but attended withal with a Royal train of <hi>Litters, led-Horses</hi> of all sorts, Gentlemen
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53645:750" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Officers, did yet herein represent a tender and unsteady austerity. The sick man is not to be lamented, who has his cure in his sleeve. In the experience and practice of this Sentence, which is a very true one, all the benefit I reap from Books consists; and yet I make as little use of it almost as those that know it not: I enjoy it as a <hi>Miser</hi> does his money, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I may enjoy it when I please: my mind is satisfied with this <hi>right</hi> of possession. I never travel without Books, either in Peace or War; and yet sometimes I pass over seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, and sometimes months, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them: I will read by and by, say I to my self, or to morrow, or when I please, and in the interim Time steals away without any inconvenience. For it is not to be imagin'd to what degree I please my self, and rest content in this consideration, that I have them by me, to divert my self with them when I am so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and to call to mind what an ease and refreshment they are to my Life. 'Tis the best <hi>Viaticum</hi> I have yet found out for this humane journey, and very much lament those men of understanding who are unprovided of them. And yet I the rather accept of any other sort of diversion, how light soever, because this can never fail me. When at home, I a little more frequent my Library, from whence I at once survey all the whole concerns of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: 'Tis scituated at the entrance into my House, and I thence under me see my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Court, and base-Court, and into all the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53645:751" rendition="simple:additions"/>
parts of the building. There I turn over now one Book, and then another, of various Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without method or design: one while I meditate, another I record, and dictate as I walk to and fro, such whimsies as these I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you here. 'Tis in the third story of a Tower, of which the Ground-room is my Chappel, the second story an Apartment with a withdrawing Room and Closet, where I often lye to be more retir'd. Above it is a great Wardrobe, which formerly was the most useless part of the House. I there pass away both the most of the days of my Life, and most of the hours of those days. In the Night I am never there. There is within it a Cabinet handsome and neat enough, with a Fire place very commodiously contriv'd, and Light very finely fitted. And was I not more afraid of the Trouble than the Expence, the Trouble that frights me from all Business, I could very easily adjoyn on either side, and on the same Floor, a Gallery of an hundred paces long, and twelve broad, having found Walls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rais'd for some other design, to the requisite height. Every place of retirement requires a walk. My Thoughts sleep if I sit still; my Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy does not go by it self, as when my Legs move it: and all those who study without a Book are in the same Condition. The Figure of my Study is round, and has no more flat Wall than what is taken up by my Table and my Chair; so that the remaining parts of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle present me a view of all my Books at once,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53645:751" rendition="simple:additions"/>
set up upon five degrees of Shelves round about me. It has three noble and free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and is sixteen paces diameter. I am not so continually there in Winter; for my House is built upon an Eminence, as its Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and no part of it is so much expos'd to the Wind and Weather as that, which pleases me the better: for being of a painful access, and a little remote, as well upon the account of Exercise, as being also there more retir'd from the Crowd. 'Tis there that I am in my Kingdom, as we say, and there I endeavour to make my self an absolute <hi>Monarch,</hi> and to sequester this one corner from all Society both Conjugal, Filial, and Civil. Elsewhere I have but verbal Authority only, and of a confus'd Essence. That man in my Opinion is very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, who has not at home where to be by himself, where to entertain himself alone, or to conceal himself from others. Ambition suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently plagues her Proselites, by keeping themselves always in shew, like the Statue of a publick Place.<note place="margin">

If any one shall tell me, that it is to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the <hi>Muses,</hi> to make use of them only for sport, and to pass away the time; I shall tell him, that he does not know the value of Sport and Pleasure so well as I; if I forbear to add further, that all other end is ridiculous. I live from Hand to Mouth, and, with Reverence be it spoken, I only live for my self; to that all my Designs do tend, and in that terminate. I studied when young for Ostentation; since, to make my self a little wiser; and now for my Diversion, but never for any Profit. A vain and prodigal Humour I had after this sort of Furniture, not only for the supplying my own need and defects, but moreover for Ornament and outward show, I have since quite reav'd my self of. Books have many charming Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to such as know how to choose them. But every good has its ill; 'tis a Pleasure that is not pure and clean, no more than others: it has its Inconveniencies, and great ones too. The Mind indeed is exercis'd by it, but the Body, the care of which I must withall never neglect, remains in the mean time without Action, grows heavy and stupid. I know no excess more prejudicial to me, nor more to be avoided in this my declining Age. These are my three beloved, and particular Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I speak not of those I owe to the World by Civil Obligation.</p>

                     <p>A man goes the wrong way to work, when he opposes this Passion; for Opposition does but irritate and make them more obstinate in Sorrow, and the evil is exasperated by being contended with. We see in common Discourse, that what I have negligently let fall from me, if a man takes hold of it, so as to controvert what I have said, I justifie it with the best Arguments I have; and much more a thing wherein I had a real Interest. And besides, in so doing, you enter rudely upon your Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; whereas the first addresses of a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> to his Patient should be gracious, gay, and pleasing. Never did any ill-look'd, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose <hi>Physician</hi> do any thing to purpose. On

the contrary,<note place="margin">How Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation ought to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd.</note> then a Man should at the first approaches favour their Grief, and express some Approbation of their Sorrow: By this intelligence you obtain Credit to proceed further, and after a facile and insensible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fall into Discourses more solid and proper for their Cure. I, whose aim it was principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gull the Assistants who had their Eyes fix'd upon me, design'd only to palliate the Disease. And indeed I have found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I have an unluckey hand in persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. My Arguments are either too sharp, or too flat, and rather press too roughly, or not home enough. After I had some time apply'd my self to her Grief, I did not attempt to cure her by strong and lively Reasons, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I wanted them, or because I thought to do my business better another way; neither did I insist upon a choice of any of those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Consolation which <hi>Philosophy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes; <hi>That what we complain of is no evil,</hi> according to <hi>Cleanthes; that it is a light evil,</hi> according to the <hi>Peripateticks; that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan ones self is an action neither commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor just,</hi> according to <hi>Chrysippus</hi>; Nor this of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> more suitable to my way, <hi>of shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thoughts from afflicting things to those that are pleasing</hi>; nor making a bundle of all these together, to make use of upon occasion, according to <hi>Cicero</hi>; but gently bending my Discourse, and by little and little digressing, sometimes to subjects nearer, and sometimes more remote from the purpose; she was more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53645:753" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intent to what I said, I insensibly depriv'd her of her Sorrow, and kept her calm and in good Humour whilst I continued there. I herein made use of <hi>diversion.</hi> They who succeeded me in the same service, did not for all that find any amendment in her, for I had not gone to the root. I peradventure may elsewhere have glaunc'd upon some sort of publick diversions. And the practice of Military ones, which <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> made use of in the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, with a thousand others in other places to withdraw the adverse Forces from their own Countreys, is too frequent in <hi>History.</hi> It was an ingenious evasion whereby the <hi>Sieur d'Himbercourt</hi> sav'd both himself and others in the City of <hi>Liege,</hi> into which the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who kept it besieg'd had made him enter, to execute the Articles of their promis'd Surrender. These People being assembled by Night to consider of it, begun to mutiny against the past Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to that degree, that several of them resolv'd to fall upon the Commissioners who had labour'd in it, and whom they had in their power. He feeling the gusts of this first storm of these People, who were coming to rush into his Lodgings, suddenly sent out to them two of the Inhabitants of the City (of which he had some with him) with new and milder terms, to be propos'd in their Counsel, which he had suddenly contriv'd at need. These two diverted the first tempest, carrying back the enrag'd Rabble to the <hi>Town-Hall,</hi> to hear and consider of what they had to say. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53645:754" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was short; a second storm arose as full of animosity as the other; whereupon he dispatch'd four new Mediators of the same quality to meet them, protesting that they had now better Conditions to present them with, and such as would give them absolute satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; by which means the Tumult was once more appeas'd, and the People again turn'd back to the Conclave. In fine, by thus order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these amusements one after another, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Fury, and dissipating it in frivolous Consultations, he laid it at last asleep till the day appear'd, which was his principal end. This other story that follows is also of the same predicament. <hi>Atalanta,</hi> a Virgin of excelling Beauty, and of wonderful disposition of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to disengage her self from the crowd of a thousand Suitors who sought her in marriage, made this Proposition, that she would accept of him for her Husband who should equal her in Running, upon condition that they who fail'd should lose their Lives; there were enough who thought the Prize very well worth the hazard, and who suffered the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the bloody Contract. <hi>Hippomenes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make tryal after the rest, makes his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the <hi>Goddess</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> imploring her assistance, who granting his request, gave him three golden Apples, and instructed him how to use them. The ground they run upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an even Plane, as <hi>Hippomenes</hi> perceiv'd his Mistress to press hard up to him, he, as it were by chance, let fall one of these Apples; the

Maid, taken with the beauty of it, fail'd not to step out of her way to take it up:

He did the same, when he saw his time, by the second and the third, till by so diverting her, and making her lose so much ground, he won the Course. When <hi>Physicians</hi> cannot stop a <hi>Catarrh,</hi> they divert, and turn it into some other less dangerous part. And I find also that is the most ordinary practice for the diseases of the Mind.<note place="margin">

The mind is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be diverted to other Studies, Thoughts, Cares, and Business: and lastly, by change of place, as sick Persons that do not recover are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd change of Air.</hi> 'Tis to little effect direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to justle a man's Infirmities, we neither make him sustain, nor repell the attack; we only make him decline and evade it. This other lesson is too high and too difficult. 'Tis for men of the first Form of knowledge purely to insist upon the thing, to consider and judge of it. It appertains to one sole <hi>Socrates</hi> only, to entertain Death with an indifferent Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53645:755" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to grow acquainted with it, and to sport with it; he seeks no consolation out of the thing it self; dying appears to him a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and indifferent accident, 'tis there that he fixes his sight and resolution, without looking elsewhere. The Disciples of <hi>Hegesias,</hi> that pine themselves to death, animated thereunto by his fine Lectures, which were so frequent, that King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> order'd he should be forbidden to entertain his followers with such homicide Doctrines: those People do not consider death it self, neither do they judge of it; it is not there that they fix their Thoughts, they run towards, and aim at a new Being. The poor wretches that we see brought upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, full of ardent devotion, and therein, as much as in them lies, employing all their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, their Ears in hearing the instructions are given them, their Eyes and Hands lifted up towards Heaven, their Voices in loud Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with a vehement and continual emotion, are doubtless things very commendable and proper for such a necessity. We ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for their Devotion, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for their constancy. They shun the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, they divert their thoughts from the consideration of death, as Children are amus'd with some Toy or other, when the Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is going to give them a prick with his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. I have seen some, who casting sometimes their eyes upon the dreadful Instruments of death round about, have fainted, and furiously turn'd their thoughts another way. Such as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53645:755" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are to pass a formidable Precipice, are advis'd either to shut their eyes or to look another way. <hi>Subrius Flavius,</hi> being by <hi>Nero</hi>'s command to be put to death, and by the hand of <hi>Niger,</hi> both of them great Captains; when they led him to the place appointed for his Execution, seeing the hole that <hi>Niger</hi> had caus'd to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to put him into ill-favour'dly contriv'd: <hi>Neither is this,</hi> said he, turning to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who guarded him, <hi>according to Military Discipline.</hi> And to <hi>Niger,</hi> who exhorted him to keep his head firm; <hi>do but thou strike as firmly,</hi> said he. And he very well fore-saw what would follow, when he said so; for <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s arm so trembled, that he had several blows at his head before he could cut it off. This man seems to have had his thoughts rightly fix'd upon the subject: he that dyes in a Battel, with his Sword in his hand, does not then think of death, he feels, nor considers it not; the ardour of the Fight diverts his thoughts another way. An honest Man of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, falling as he was fighting a Duel at sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Rapier, and feeling himself nail'd to the earth by nine or ten thrusts of his Enemy, every one present call'd to him to think of his Conscience; but he has since told me, that though he very well heard what they said, it nothing mov'd him, and that he never thought of any thing but how to disengage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himself. He afterwards kill'd his Man in that very Duel. He who brought <hi>L. Syllanus</hi> the sentence of Death, did him a very great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53645:756" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kindness, in that having receiv'd his answer, <hi>that he was well prepar'd to dye,</hi> but not by base hands, he run upon him with his Souldiers to force him; and as he, naked as he was, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended himself with his fists and feet, he made him lose his Life in the dispute; by that means dissipating and diverting in a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and furious Rage the painful apprehension of the lingring Death to which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd. We always think of something else; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hope of a better Life comforts and supports us, or the hope of our Childrens Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or the future glory of our Name, or the leaving behind the evils of this Life, or the Vengeance that threatens those who are the causers of our death, administers Consolation to us.</p>

Revenge is a sweet Passion, of great and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impression; I discern it well enough, though I have no manner of Experience of it. From which, not long ago, to divert a young Prince; I did not tell him that he must, to him who had struck him upon the one Cheek, turn the other, upon the account of Charity; nor go about to represent to him the tragical Events that <hi>Poetry</hi> attributes to this Passion; I did not touch upon that string; but made it my Business to make him relish the Beauty of a contrary Image: and by representing to him what Honour, Esteem, and good Will he would acquire by Clemency and good Nature, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him to Ambition. Thus a man is to deal in such Cases. If your Passion of Love be too violent, disperse it, say they, and they say true; for I have oft try'd it with Advantage: break it into several Desires, of which let one be regent if you will over the rest; but, lest it should tyrannize and domineer over you, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and protract, in dividing and diverting it;

                     <p>I was once wounded with a vehement Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and withal, more just than vehement; I might peradventure have lost my self in it, if I had merely trusted to my own Strength. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of a powerful Diversion to disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me, by amorous Art and Study, wherein I was assisted by my Youth, I found one out: Love reliev'd and rescu'd me from the evil wherein Friendship had engag'd me. 'Tis in every thing else the same; a violent Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath seiz'd me, I find it a nearer way to change, than to subdue it: I depute, if not one contrary, yet another at least in its place. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation does always relieve, dissolve, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate; if I am not able to contend with it, I escape from it; and in avoiding it slip out of the way, and make my doubles: shifting of Place, Business, and Company, I secure my self in the crowd of other Thoughts and Fancies, where it loses my trace, and I escape. After the same manner does <hi>Nature</hi> proceed, by the benefit of Inconstancy;<note place="margin">Time the Physician of our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> for the time she has given us for the sovereign Physician of our Passions, does chiefly work by that, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our Imaginations with other, and new Affairs, it un-nerves, and dissolves the first apprehension, how strong soever.

did not attribute any alleviation of Afflictions, neither to the foresight of the man, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of the Evils themselves. But so many other thoughts traverse the first, that it lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes and tires at last. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to divert the Inclination of common Rumours, cut off the Ears and Tail of his beautiful Dog, and turn'd him out into the publick place, to the end, that giving the People this occasion to prate, they might let his other Actions alone. I have also seen, for this same end of diverting the Opinions and Conjectures of the People, and to stop their Mouths, some Women con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their real Affections by those that were only counterfeit, and put on to blind mens Eyes; but some of them withall, who in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting have suffer'd themselves to be caught indeed, and who have quitted the true and original Affection, for the feign'd: and by them have found, that they who find their Affections well plac'd are Fools to consent to this disguise. The favourable and publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception being only reserv'd for this pretended Servant, a man may conclude him a Fellow of very little address, and less Wit, if he does not in the end put himself into your place, and you into his; this is properly to cut out, and make up a Shooe for another to draw on. A little thing will turn and divert us; because a little thing holds us.

                        <hi>Hangman</hi>'s Science! Finding my self in this condition, I consider'd by how many light cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and objects Imagination nourish'd in me the regret of Life; and of what Atoms the weight and difficulty of this dislodging was compos'd in my Soul, and to how many idle and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thoughts we give way in so great an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. A Dog, a Horse, a Book, a Glass, and what not? were consider'd in my loss. To others, their ambitious hopes, their money, their knowledge, not less foolish Considerations in my opinion than mine. I look upon Death carelesly, when I look upon it universally as the end of Life. I insult over it in gross; but in retail it domineers over me. The Tears of a Foot-man, the disposing of my Cloaths, the touch of a friendly hand, which is a common Consolation, discourages and entenerates me.

Miracle of <hi>Polemon</hi>; who not so much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his Countenance at the biting of a mad-Dog, who tore away the Calf of his Leg. And no Wisdom proceeds so far, as to conceive so lively and entire a cause of Sorrow by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it does not suffer an increase by presence, where the Eyes and Ears have their share; parts that are not to be moved but by vain accidents. Is it reason, that even the <hi>Arts</hi> themselves should make an advantage of our natural brutality and weakness? An <hi>Orator,</hi> says Rhetorick, in the farce of his pleading, shall be mov'd with the sound of his own Voice and feign'd Emotions, and suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be impos'd upon by the passion he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents; he will imprint in himself a true and real Grief, by means of the part he plays, to transmit it to the Audience, who are yet less concern'd than he: as they do, who are hir'd at Funerals to assist in the ceremony of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, who fell their Tears and Mourning by weight and measure. For although they act in a borrow'd Form, nevertheless by habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves, and settling their Countenances to the occasion, 'tis most certain, they oft are really affected with a true and real Sorrow.

In a Countrey near our Mountains, the Women play Priest <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> that is to say, both the Priest and the Clerk, for as they augment the regret of the deceased Husband, by the remembrance of the good and agreeable Qualities he was master of; they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at the same time make a register of, and publish his imperfections; as if of themselves to enter into some compensation, and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themselves from compassion to disdain; and yet with much better grace, than we, who when we lose an old Acquaintance, strive to give him new and false praises, and to make him quite another thing when we have lost sight of him, than he appear'd to us when we did see him: as if regret was an instructive thing, or that tears, by washing our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, clear'd them. For my part, I hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth renounce all favourable testimonies men would give of me, not because I shall not be worthy of them, but because I shall be dead. Whoever shall ask a man, what Interest have you in this Siege? the interest of Example, he will say, and of the common obedience to my

Prince: I pretend to no profit by it; and for glory, I know how small a part can reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a private man as I: I have here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passion nor quarrel. And yet you shall see him the next day quite another man, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and red with fury, rang'd in Battel for the Assault; 'tis the glittering of so much Steel, the fire and noise of our Canon and Drums, that have infus'd this new Rancour and Fury into his Veins. A frivolous Cause you will say, how a Cause? There needs none to agitate the mind; a meer whimsie without body and without subject will rule and sway it. Let me think of building Castles in <hi>Spain,</hi> my imagination suggests to me Conveniences and Pleasures with which my Soul is really delighted and pleas'd. How oft do we tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our Mind with Anger or Sorrow by such shadows, and engage our selves in fantastick Passions that alter both the Soul and Body? What astonish'd, fleering, and confus'd Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces does this raving put our Faces into! What sallies and agitation both of Members and Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces does it inspire us with? Does it not seem that this individual man has false Visions from the crowd of others with whom he has to do, or, that he is possess'd with some internal <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> that persecutes him? Enquire of your self, where is the object of this Mutation? Is there any thing but us in Nature, but subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nullity, over which it has power? <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> for having dreamt that his Brother should be one day King of <hi>Persia,</hi> put him to death:

Poverty, Diseases, are grave and grievous Subjects. A man must have his Soul instructed in the means to sustain and to contend with Evils, and in the rules of living and believing well; and often rouse it up, and exercise it in this noble study. But in an ordinary Soul, it must be by intervals, and with Moderation; it will otherwise grow besotted if continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent upon it. I found it necessary when I was young, to put my self in mind, and to sollicit my self to keep me to my Duty; Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Health do not, they say, so well agree with those grave and serious Meditations: I am at present in another Condition. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions of Age do but too much put me in mind, and preach to me. From the excess of spriteliness, I am fallen into that of Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which is much more troublesome. And for that reason, I now suffer my self on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, a little to run into disorder; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times busie my Mind in wanton and youthful Thoughts, wherewith it diverts it self. I am of late but too reserv'd, too heavy, and too ripe; my Age does every day read to me new Lectures of Coldness and Temperance. This Body of mine avoids Disorder, and dreads it; 'tis now my Body's turn to guide my Mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Reformation; it governs in turn, and more rudely and imperiously than the other; it lets me not an hour alone, sleeping nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: but is always preaching to me, Death, Patience, and Repentance. I now defend my self from Temperance, as I have formerly done
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53645:762" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from Pleasure; it draws me too much back, and even to Stupidity. Now I will be Master of my self to all intents and purposes. Wisdom has its excess, and has no less need of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Folly.

My Judgment restrains me from kicking against, and murmuring at the inconveniencies that Nature orders me to endure, but it does not take away my Feeling: I, who have no other thing in my prospect but to live and be merry, would run from one end of the World to the other to seek out one good Year of pleasant and jocund Tranquility. A melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and dull Tranquility, is, I confess, enough for me, but it benumns, stupifies, and besots me, I am not contented with it: If there be any Person, any knot of good Company in Countrey or City, in <hi>France,</hi> or elsewhere, Resident, or in Motion, who can like my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and whose Humours I can like, let them but whistle, and I will run to furnish them with <hi>Essays</hi> of Flesh and Bone. Seeing it is the priviledge of the Mind to rescue it self from old Age<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I advise mine to it with all the power I have, let it in the interim continue green, and flourish if it can like Mistletoe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a dead Tree: But I fear 'tis a Traytor, it has contracted so strict a Fraternity with the Body, that it leaves me at every turn to follow that in its need.

it from this Correspondence; to much effect quote to it <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Catullus,</hi> and represent to it beautiful Ladies, and Royal Masques; if its Companion have the Stone, it seems to have it too. Even the Faculties that are most peculiarly and properly its own, cannot then perform their Functions, but manifestly appear stupified and asleep; there is no spriteliness in its Productions, if there be not at the same time an equal Proportion in the Body too. Our Masters are too blame, that in searching out the causes of the extraordinary emotions of the Soul, besides attributing it to a Divine Extasie, Love, Martial Fierceness, Poesie, and Wine, they have not also attributed a part to Health. A boyling, vigorous, full, and lazy Health, such as formerly the verdure of Youth and security by fits supply'd me withall; that Fire of Spriteliness and Gayety darts into the Mind flashes that are lively and bright beyond our natural Light, and with the most working, if not the most desparate <hi>Enthusiasms</hi>: It is then no wonder if a contrary Estate stupifie and clog my Spirit, and produce a contrary Effect.

Virtue is a pleasant and gay Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I know very well that few will quarrel with the liberty of my Writings, who have not more to quarrel with in the Licence of their own Thoughts: I conform my self well enough to their Inclinations, but I offend their Eyes. 'Tis a pretty Humour to strain the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Plato,</hi> to wrest his pretended Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with <hi>Phaedo, Dion, Stella,</hi> and <hi>Archea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassa. Non pudeat dicere, quod non pudeat sentire. Let us not be asham'd to speak, what we are not asham'd to think.</hi> I hate a froward and pensive Spirit, that slips over all the Pleasures of Life,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53645:765" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and seizes and feeds upon Misfortunes; like Flies, that cannot stick to a sleek and polish'd Body, but fix and repose themselves upon craggy and rough Places; and like Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses, that only suck and attract the worst Blood. As to the rest, I have enjoyn'd my self to dare to say all that I dare to do, and even thoughts that are not to be publish'd dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please me; the worst of my Actions and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities do not appear to me so foul, as I find it foul and base not to dare to own them. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is wary and discreet in Confession, but men ought to be so in Action. The boldness of doing ill is in some sort recompenc'd and restrain'd by the boldness of confessing it. Whoever will oblige himself to tell all, should oblige himself to do nothing that he must be forc'd to conceal. I wish that this excessive License of mine may draw men to freedom, above these timorous and mincing pretended vertues sprung from our imperfections; and that at the expence of my immoderation, I may reduce them to reason. A man must see and study his Vice to correct it; they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from others, commonly conceal it from themselves; and do not think they sin close enough, if they themselves see it. They with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and disguise them from their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. <hi>Quare vitia sua nemo confitetur?</hi>

themselves in increasing. We find that to be the <hi>Gout,</hi> which we call'd a <hi>Rheum</hi> or a <hi>Strain.</hi> The diseases of the Soul, the greater they are, keep themselves the more obscure; and the most sick are the least sensible. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that with an unrelenting hand, they must often in the day be taken to task, open'd, and torn from the hollow of the heart. As in doing well, so in doing ill, the meer confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sometimes satisfaction. Is there any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in doing amiss that can excuse us from confessing our selves? It is so great a pain to me to dissemble, that I evade the trust of anothers Secrets, wanting the heart to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow my knowledge. I can conceal it, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it I cannot, without the greatest trouble and violence to my self imaginable. To be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry secret, a man must be so by nature, not by obligation. 'Tis little worth in the service of a Prince to be secret, if a man be not a Lyar to boot. If he who ask'd <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> whether he ought solemnly to deny that he had committed uncleanness, had apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to me, I should have told him, that he ought not to do it;<note place="margin">Lying worse than the sin of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> for I look upon Lying as a worse fault than the other. <hi>Thales</hi> advis'd him quite contrary, bidding him swear to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the greater fault by the less: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less this counsel was not so much an election as a multiplication of Vice. Upon which, let us say this by the bye, that we deal sincerely and well with a man of Conscience, when we propose to him some difficulty in counterpoise
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53645:766" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Vice; but when we shut him up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Vices, he is put to a hard choice: as <hi>Origen</hi> was, either to <hi>Idolatrize,</hi> or to suffer himself to be carnally abus'd by a great <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Slave was brought to him. He submitted to the first condition, and vitiously, says one. And yet those Women of our times are not to be dislik'd, who, according to their errour, protest, they had rather burden their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with ten men than one <hi>Mass.</hi> If it be indiscretion so to publish their Errors, yet there is no great danger that it pass into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Custom. For <hi>Aristo</hi> said, that the winds men most fear'd, were those that laid them open; we must tuck up this ridiculous rag that hides our manners: they send their Consciences to the Stewes, and keep a starch'd Countenance: Even <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Assassins</hi> espouse the Laws of Ceremony, and there fix their Duty; so that neither can Injustice complain of incivility, nor Malice of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. 'Tis pity but an ill man should be a Fool to boot, and that Decency should palliate his Vice. This rough-cast only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to a good and sound Wall, that deserves to be preserv'd and whited. In fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auricular Confession.</note> who condemn our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular and private Confession, I confess my self in publick, religiously and purely. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> have publish'd the Errors of their Opinions; and I moreover of my Manners. I am greedy of making my self known, and I care not to how many, provided it

be truly; or to say better, I hunger for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but I mortally hate to be mistaken by those who come to learn my Name. He that does all things for Honour and Glory, what can he think to gain by shewing himself to the World in a Vizor; and by concealing his true Being from the People? Commend a crooked Fellow for his Stature, he has reason to take it for an affront: If you are a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and that men commend you for your Valour, is it of you that they speak? They take you for another. I should like him as well, who glorifies himself in the <hi>Complements</hi> and <hi>Congees</hi> are made him, as if he were Master of the Company, when he is one of the most inferiour of the Train. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> walking along the Street, some body threw Water on his Head; which they who were with him, said he ought to punish: I, but said he, whoever it was, he did not throw the Water upon me, but upon him who he took me to be. <hi>Socrates</hi> being told that People spoke ill of him, <hi>Not at all,</hi> said he, <hi>there is nothing in me of what they say.</hi> For my part, if any one should commend me for a good <hi>Pilot,</hi> for being very <hi>modest,</hi> or very <hi>chaste,</hi> I should owe him no Thanks.

know what is my due. I am content to be less commended, provided I am better known. I may be reputed a wise man in such a sort of wisdom as I take to be folly. I am vex'd that my <hi>Essays</hi> only serve the <hi>Ladies</hi> for a common moveable, a Book to lye in the Parlour Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; this Chapter shall prefer me to the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; I love to traffick with them a little in private; publick conversation is without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and without favour. In farewels, we above ordinary heat our Affections towards the things we take leave of. I take my last leave of the pleasures of this World, these are our last embraces. But to return to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: What he rendred the act of Generation, an act so natural, so necessary, and so fit for men, a thing not to be spoken of without blushing; and to be excluded from all serious and regular Discourses? We boldly pronounce kill, rob, betray, but the other we dare only to mutter betwixt the Teeth. Is it to say, that the less we say in Words, we may pay it so much the more with thinking? For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Words least in use, most seldom writ, and best kept in, are the best, and most generally known. No Age, no Manners are ignorant of them, nay, more than the Word bread. They imprint themselves in every one, without being express'd, without Voice, and without Figure. And the Sex that most pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices it, is bound to say least of it. 'Tis an act that we have plac'd in the <hi>Free-franchise</hi> of Silence, from whence to take it is a Crime.

We are not to accuse and judge it; neither dare we reprehend it but by Periphrasis, and in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. A great favour to a Criminal, to be so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, that Justice thinks it unjust to touch and see him; free, and safe by the benefit of the severity of his Condemnation. Is it not here as in matter of Books, that sell better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more publick for being suppress'd? For my part, I will take <hi>Aristotle</hi> at his word, who says,<note place="margin">Bashfulness an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in young People.</note> that Bashfulness is an Ornament to Youth, but a Reproach to old Age. These Verses are preach'd in the antient School, a School that I much more adhere to than the Modern; the Virtues of it appear to me to be greater, and the Vices less.</p>

All that I find fault with in considering it, is, that he has represented her a little too Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate for a married <hi>Venus.</hi> In this discreet kind of coupling, the Appetite is not usually so wanton, but more grave and dull. Love hates that People should hold of any but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and goes but faintly to work in Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities derived from any other title, as Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is. The Alliance and Dowry do therein sway by Reason as much or more than <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Beauty.</hi> Men do not marry for themselves, though they deny it, they marry as much or more for their Posterity and Family. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom and Interest of Marriage concerns our Race much more than us; and therefore it is, that I like to have a Match carried on by a third hand, rather than a Man's own, and by another Man's liking than that of the Party himself; and how much is all this opposite to contracts of Love? And also it is a kind of Incest to employ in this venerable and sacred Alliance, the heat and extravagance of amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

Licence, as I think I have said elsewhere. A man, says <hi>Ariosto,</hi> must approach his Wife with Prudence and Modesty, lest in dealing too lasciviously with her, the extream Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure make her exceed the bounds of Reason. What he says upon the account of Conscience, the <hi>Physicians</hi> say upon the account of Health: That a Pleasure excessively lascivious, volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and frequent, makes the Seed too hot, and hinders Conception: 'Tis said on the contrary, that to a languishing Congression, as that naturally is, to supply it with a due and fruitfull Heat, a man must do it but seldom, and by notable Intermissions;

I see no marriages where the conjugal Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence sooner fails, than those that we contract upon the account of Beauty and amorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; there should be more solid and constant foundation, and they should proceed with greater Circumspection; this furious Ardour is worth nothing. They who think they honour marriage by joyning Love to it, do, methinks, like those, who to favour Virtue, hold, that Nobility is nothing else but Virtue; they are indeed things that have some relation to one another, but there is a great deal of difference; we should not so mix their Names and Titles, 'tis a wrong to them both, so to confound them. Nobility is a brave Quality, and with good reason introduc'd; but forasmuch as 'tis
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53645:770" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Quality depending upon others, and may happen in a vicious Person, 'tis in estimate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely below Virtue. 'Tis a Virtue, if it be one, that is artificial and apparent, depending upon Time and Fortune; various in form, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Countreys, Living, and Mortal; without Birth, as the River <hi>Nile</hi>; genealogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and common, drawn by Consequence, and a very weak one. Knowledge, Strength, Bounty, Beauty, Riches, and all other Qualities, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Communication and Commerce, but this is consummated in it self, and of no use to the Service of others. There was propos'd to one of our <hi>Kings</hi> the choice of two Concurrents, who both pretended to the same Command, of which the one was a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the other was not; he order'd, that without respect to Quality, they should chuse him who had the most merit; but where the worth of the Competitors should appear to be intirely equal, they should have respect to Birth: this was justly to give it its due rank. A Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unknown, coming to <hi>Antigonus</hi> to make suit for his Fathers Command, a valiant Man, but lately dead: <hi>Friend,</hi> said he, <hi>in such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments as those, I have not so much regard to the Nobility of my Souldiers as their Prowess:</hi> And indeed it ought not to go as it did with the Officers of the Kings of <hi>Sparta, Trumpeters, Fiddlers, Cooks,</hi> the Children of whom always succeeded in their Places, how ignorant so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and were prefer'd before the most expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented in the Trade. They of <hi>Callicut</hi> make
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53645:771" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a sort of Nobles above humane. They are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted marriage, and all but warlike Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments They may have <hi>Concubines</hi> their fill, and the Women as many <hi>Ruffians,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of one another; but 'tis a capital and irremissible Crime to couple with a Person of meaner Condition than themselves, and they think themselves polluted, if they have but touch'd one in walking along; and supposing their Nobility to be marvellously injur'd and interested in it, kill such as only approach a little too near them: insomuch that the ignoble are oblig'd to cry as they go, like the <hi>Gunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> at the turnings of Streets, for fear of justling, and the Nobles command them to step aside to what part they please: by which means the last avoid what they repute a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Ignominy, and the other a certain Death. No time, no favour of the Prince, no Office, or Virtue, or Riches, can ever prevail to make a Plebean become noble. To which this Custom is assisting, that marriages are interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted betwixt several Trades; neither is the Daughter of a Shoomaker permitted to marry with a Carpenter; and the Parents are oblig'd to train up their Children precisely in their own Callings, and not put them to any other Trade; by which means the distinction and continuation of their Fortune is maintained. A good marriage, if it be really so, rejects the Company and Conditions of Love, and tries to represent those of Friendship. 'Tis a sweet Society of Life, full of Constancy, Trust, and

But 'tis to much purpose to evade it, the common custom and usance of Life will have it so. The most of my Actions are guided by Example, not by Choice. And yet I did not go to it of my own voluntary Motion, I was led and drawn to it by strange and accidental Occasions. For not only things that are incommodious in themselves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so nothing so ugly, vitious, and to be avoided, that may not be rendred acceptable by some Condition or Accident; so unsteady and vain is all humane Resolution.

which is to say, comport thy self towards him with a dessembled inimical, and distrustful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Respect, (a stile of War and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance) is equally injurious and hard.

Marriage happy in good intelligence, wherein nevertheless there is not much Loyalty. Does he mean, that it is not impossible but a Woman may give the reins to her own Passion, and yield to the importunities of Love, and yet reserve some Duty toward Marriage, and that it may be hurt without being totally broken?

have debauch'd her to a Stranger; though not so wholly peradventure, but that she may have some remains of kindness for her Husband. They are two Designs, that have several paths leading to them, without being confounded with one another; and a Woman may yield to such a Man as she would by no means have married, not only for the Condition of his Fortune, but the dislike of his Person.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53645:773" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Considerations are too much different. We love at once two things contrary in themselves without any disturbance. <hi>Isocrates</hi> was wont to say, that the City of <hi>Athens</hi> pleas'd as <hi>Ladies</hi> do that men court for Love; every one lov'd to come thither to take a turn, and pass away his time; but no one lik'd it so well as to espouse it, that is, to inhabit there, and to make it his constant Residence. I have been vex'd to see Husbands hate their Wives only because they do them wrong. We should not however, methinks, love them the less for our Faults; they should, at least upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Compassion, be dearer to us. They are different ends, and yet in some sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible. Marriage has Utility, Justice, Honour, and Constancy for its share; a flat, but more universal Pleasure: Love founds it self wholly upon Pleasure, and indeed has it more full, lively and stinging; a Pleasure inflam'd by difficulty; there must be in it sting and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour: 'Tis no more Love, if without Darts and Fire. The Bounty of Ladies is too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse in marriage, and dulls the point of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Desire: To evade which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, do but observe what pains <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> take in their <hi>Laws.</hi> Women are not to blame at all, when they refuse the Rules of Life that are introduc'd into the World; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Men made them without their Consent. There is naturally Contention and Brawling betwixt them and us; and the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friendship we have with them, is yet mixt

with Tumult and Tempest. In the Opinion of our Author, we deal inconsiderately with them in this.

In another, the Young-men pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly cut through betwixt the Skin and the Flesh of that part in several places, and thrust pieces of Wood into the Overtures as long and thick as they would receive, and of those pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wood afterwards made a fire for an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to their Gods, and were reputed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vigorous nor Chaste, if by the force of that intolerable Pain they seem'd to be any thing dismay'd. Elsewhere, the most Sacred Magistrate was reverenc'd and acknowledg'd by that Member: and in several Ceremonies the Picture of it was carried in pomp to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of several Divinities. The <hi>Aegyptian La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in their <hi>Bacchanals</hi> carried every one one carv'd of Wood about their Necks, exactly made great and heavy as every one was able to bear, besides one which the Statue of their God represented, which in greatness surpass'd all the rest of his Body. The married Women near to the place where I live, make of their Kerchiefs the Figure of one upon their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads to glorifie themselves in the injoyment they have of it; and coming to be Widows, they throw it behind, and cover it with their Head-cloths.

                        <hi>Rome,</hi> thought it an Honour to offer Flowers and Garlands to the God <hi>Priapus.</hi> And they made the Virgins, at the time of their Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, sit upon his shameful Parts.

                     <p>The <hi>Gods,</hi> says <hi>Plato,</hi> have given us one disobedient and unruly Member, that like a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Animal, attempts by the Violence of its Appetite, to subject all things to it. And they have given Women one that has the same Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, like a greedy and ravenous Animal, which if one refuse to give him Food in season, grows wild, impatient of delay, and infusing the rage into their Bodies, stops the passages, and hinders Respiration, causing a thousand Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; till having imbib'd the Fruit of the common thirst, he has plentifully besprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled and bedew'd the bottom of their Womb. Now my Legislator should also have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that peradventure it were a chaster and more fruitful usance to let them know the quick betimes, than permit them to guess ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the liberty and heat of their own Fancy; instead of real parts, they substitute through hope and desire, others that are three times more extravagant. And a certain Friend of mine lost himself by producing his in place not yet fit to admit them to their more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous use. What Mischeif do not those Pictures
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53645:779" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of prodigious dimension do, that the Boys make upon the Stair-cases and Galleries of the Royal Houses? which give them a strange contempt of our natural Furniture. And what do we know but that <hi>Plato,</hi> after other well instituted Republicks, order'd, that the Man and Woman, old and young, should expose themselves naked to the view of one another, in his <hi>Gymnastick,</hi> upon that very account? The <hi>Indians,</hi> who see the men stark naked, have at least cool'd the sense of Seeing. And let the Women of the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> say what they will, (who below the waste have nothing to cover them but a Cloth slit before, and so straight, that what decency and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty soever they pretend by it, at every step all is to be seen) that it is an Invention found out to allure the men to them, and to divert them from the Boys, to which that Nation is generally inclin'd; yet peradventure they lose more by it than they get, and a man may venture to say, that an intire Appetite is more sharp than one already glutted by the eyes. And also <hi>Livia</hi> was wont to say, that to a Virtuous Woman a naked Man was but a Statue. The <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Women, more Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins when Wives, than our Daughters are; saw every day the Young-men of their City strip'd naked in their Exercises; little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to cover their Thighs in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believing themselves, says <hi>Plato,</hi> sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover'd with their Virtue without any other Robe. But those of whom St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53645:779" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have given nudity a wonderful power of Temptation, that have made it a Doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women at the day of Judgment shall rise again in their own Sex, and not rather in ours, for fear of tempting us again in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly estate. In brief, we allure and flesh them by all sorts of ways: We incessantly heat and stir up their Imagination, and yet we find fault. Let us confess the truth; there is scarce one of us that does not more apprehend the shame that accrues to him by the Vices of his Wife, than by his own, and that is not more sollicitous (a wonderful Charity) of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of his virtuous Wife than of his own; who had not rather commit Theft and Sacrilege, and that his Wife was a Murtheress and a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, than that she should not be more chaste than her Husband. An unjust estimate of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Both we and they are capable of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Corruptions more prejudicial and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than Lust: But we weigh Vices not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, but according to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; by which means they take so many unequal forms. The austerity of our Decrees renders the propension of Women to this Vice more violent and vicious than its Condition will bear, and engages it in <hi>Consequences</hi> worse than their <hi>Cause.</hi> They will voluntarily offer to go to the Exchange to seek for Gain, and to the War to get Reputation, rather than in the midst of ease and delights to have to do with so difficult a Guard.

This ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to be obstinate in it, 'tis a brave thing for them to defie us, and to spurn under foot that vain preheminence of Valour and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that we pretend to have over them. They will find, if they do but observe it, that they will not only be much more esteem'd for it, but also much more belov'd. A gallant Man does not give over his pursuit for being refus'd, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it be a refusal of Chastity, and not of choice. We may swear, threaten, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to much purpose; we lye, we love them the better: there is no allurement like Modesty, if it be not rude and uncivil. 'Tis stupidity and meanness, to be obstinate against hatred and disdain; but against a virtuous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Resolution, mixt with an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis the exercise of a noble and generous Soul. They may acknowledge our Services to a certain degree, and give us civilly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that they disdain us not. For that Law that enjoyns them to abominate us, because we adore them, and to hate us because we love them; is certainly very severe, if but for the difficulty of it. Why should they not give ear to our offers and demands, so long as they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53645:781" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are contain'd within the bounds of Modesty? Wherefore should we fancy them to have other thoughts within, and to be worse than they seem? A <hi>Queen</hi> of our time ingeniously said, that to refuse these Courtships is a Testimony of weakness in Women, and a self accusation of Facility; and that a Lady could not boast of her Chastity, who was never tempted. The Limits of Honour are not cut so short, they may give themselves a little rein, and dispence a little without forfeiting themselves; there lies before the <hi>Frontier</hi> some space free, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and neuter: he that has beaten and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd her into her Fort, is a strange fellow if he be not satisfied with his Fortune. The price of the Conquest is consider'd by the difficulty. Would you know what impression your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Merit have made in her Heart? Judge of it by her Behaviour. Some may grant more, who do not grant so much. The Obligation of a Benefit wholly relates to the good will of those who confer it, the other coincident Circumstances are dumb, dead, and casual. It costs her dearer to grant you that little, than it would do her Companion to grant all. If in any thing rarity give the estimation, it ought especially in this. Do not consider how little it is that is given, but how few have it to give. The value of Money alters according to the Coin, and stamp of the Place. Whatever the spite and indiscretion of some may make them say upon the excess of their Discontentment; yet Virtue and Truth will in time recover

all. I have known some, whose Reputation has for a great while suffer'd under slander, who have after been restor'd to the Worlds universal Opinion, meerly by their Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without care or artifice; every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and gives himself the lye for what he has believ'd and said; and from Maids, a little suspected, they have been afterward advanc'd to the first rank amongst the Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Some body told <hi>Plato,</hi> that all the World spoke ill of him. <hi>Let them talk,</hi> said he, <hi>I will live so as to make them change their Note.</hi> Besides the fear of God, and the price of so rare a Renown, which ought to make them look to themselves, the corruption of the Age we live in compells them to it; and if I were as they, there is nothing I would not rather do, than intrust my Reputation in so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hands. In my time, the Pleasure of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (a Pleasure little inferiour to that of doing) was not permitted but to those who had some faithful and only Friend; but now the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Discourse and common Table-talk, is nothing but boasts of Favours receiv'd, and the secret Liberality of <hi>Ladies.</hi> In earnest. 'tis too abject, and too much meanness of Spirit, to suffer such ingrateful, indiscreet, and giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed People, so to persecute, teaze, and rifle those tender and obliging Favours.

This Fever defaces and corrupts all they have of beautiful and good besides.

and a Rage which so much the more frets it self, as it is compell'd to excuse it self by a pretence of good Will. Now the duty of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity is of a vast Extent. Is it their Wills that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53645:784" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we would have them restrain? That is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pliant and active thing, a thing very quick and nimble to be staid. How? if Dreams some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ingage them so far that they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them. It is not in them, nor peradventure in Chastity it self, seeing it is a Female, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it self from Lust and Desire. If we are only interested in their Will, what a case are we in then? Do but imagine what crowding there would be amongst Men in pursuance of these Priviledges, to run full speed, though without Tongue and Eyes, into every Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Arms that would accept them. The <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Women</hi> put out the Eyes of all their Slaves and Prisoners of War, that they might have their Pleasure of them, and they never the wiser. Oh, the furious advantage of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity! Should any one ask me, what was the first part of Love, I should Answer, that it was how to take a man's time, and so the second, and so the third; 'tis a point that can do every thing. I have sometimes wanted For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but I have also sometimes been wanting to my self in matter of Attempt. There is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Temerity requir'd in this Age of ours, which our young People excuse under the name of heat. But should Women examin it more strictly, they would find, that it rather proceeded from Contempt. I was always super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously afraid of giving offence, and have ever had a great respect for her I lov'd: Besides, who in this traffick takes away the <hi>Reverence,</hi> defaces at the same time the <hi>Lustre.</hi> I would
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53645:784" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in this Affair have a Man a little play the Child, the Timorous, and the Servant: If not altogether in this, I have in other things some air of the foolish bashfulness whereof <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes mention; and the course of my Life has been divers ways hurt and blemish'd with it, a Quality very ill suiting my universal Form: And what is there also amongst us but Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Discord? I am as much our of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to be deny'd as I am to deny; and it so much troubles me to be troublesome to others, that in occasions where Duty compells to try the good-will of any one in a thing that is doubtful, and that will be chargeable to him, I do it very faintly, and very much against my will: But if it be for my own particular, (whatever <hi>Homer</hi> truly says, that Modesty is a foolish Virtue in an indigent Person) I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly commit it to a third Person to blush for me, and deny those that employ me with the same difficulty; so that it has sometimes befall'n me to have had a mind to deny when I had not the power to do it. 'Tis folly then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bridle in Women a Desire that is so powerful in them, and so natural to them. And when I hear them brag of having so mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and so temperate a Will, I laugh at them. They retire too far back. If it be an old Toothless Trot, or a young dry Consumptive thing, though it be not altogether to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, at least, they may say it with more simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of truth. But they, who are yet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of love, and still pant with desire, talk at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53645:785" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ridiculous rate to their own prejudice, by reason that inconsiderate excuses are a kind of self Accusation. Like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, suspected to be insufficient;

There have been Husbands who have suffered this accident, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach, or taking offence at their Wives, but with singular Obligation to them, and great commendation of their Virtue. Such a Woman has been, who priz'd her Honour above her Life, and yet has prostituted it to the furious Lust of a mortal Enemy to save her Husband's Life, and who, in so doing, did that for him, she would not have done for her self! It is not here that we are to produce their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, they are too high and rich to be set off with so poor a Foil as I can give them here, let us reserve them for a nobler place; but for Examples of ordinary lustre, Do we not every day see Women amongst us that surrender themselves for their Husbands only benefit, and by their express Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation? and of old <hi>Phaulius</hi> the <hi>Argian,</hi> who offer'd his to King <hi>Philip</hi> out of Ambition, as that <hi>Galba</hi> did out of Civility, who having entertain'd <hi>Moecenas</hi> at <hi>Supper,</hi> and observing that his Wife and he began to cast Sheeps eyes at one another, and to complot Love by signs, let himself sink down upon his Cushion, like one in a profound sleep, to give opportunity

The Vice of the Parents, or the impulse of Nature, which is a rude Councellor, may be the cause. In the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> though Chastity is of singular Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet Custom permitted a married Woman to prostitute her self to any one who presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with an Elephant, and that with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too, to have been valu'd at so high a rate. <hi>Phaedon</hi> the Philosopher, a Man of Birth, after the taking of his Countrey <hi>Elida,</hi> made it his trade to prostitute the beauty of his youth, so long as it lasted, to any one that would, for Money, thereby to gain his Living.

What Conveniency will not serve their turn in so knowing an Age? Curiosity is <hi>vicious</hi> throughout; but 'tis <hi>pernicious</hi> here. 'Tis Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine into a Disease for which there is no Physick that does not inflame and make it worse; of which the shame grows still grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more publick by Jealousie, and of which the Revenge more wounds our <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> than it heals <hi>us.</hi> You wither and dye in the search of so obscure a proof. How mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably have they of my time arriv'd at that knowledge, who have been so unhappy as to have found it out? If the Informer does not at the same time apply a Remedy, and bring relief; 'tis an injurious Information, and that better deserves a stab than the <hi>Lye</hi>: We no less laugh at him who takes pains to prevent it, than he who is a Cuckold, and knows it not.

It is to much purpose to see, to draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to lift up the Quilt to discover our private Misfortunes, thence to expose them on Tragick Scaffolds; and Misfortunes that only hurt us by being known; for a good Wife, or a happy Marriage, is said, not that they are really so, but because no one says to the contrary. Men should be so discreet, as to evade this tormenting and unprofitable knowledge: and the <hi>Romans</hi> had a Custom, when retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from any Expedition, to send home before to acquaint their Wives with their coming, that they might not surprize them; and to this purpose it is, that a certain <hi>Nation</hi> has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a custom, that the <hi>Priest</hi> shall on the Wedding day unlock the Brides Cabinet, to free the Husband from the doubt and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of examaning in the first assault, whether she comes a Virgin to his Bed, or that she has been at the Trade before. But the World will be talking. I know a hundred honest men Cuckolds, that are handsomely, and not very indecently so; a worthy man is lamented, but not disesteem'd for it. Order it so that your Virtue may conquer your Misfortune, that good Men may curse the Occasion, and that he who wrongs you may tremble but to think on't. And moreover, who escapes being talk'd of at the same rate, from the least even to the greatest?

For to what Friend dare you intrust your Griefs; who, if he does not laugh at them, will not make use of the occasion to get a share of the <hi>Quarry</hi>? The sharps<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as well as the sweets of Marriage, are kept secret by the wise; and amongst other troublesome Conditions apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it, this, to a prating Fellow, as I am, is one of the chief, that custom has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it indecent and prejudicial, to commmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to any one all that a man knows, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53645:788" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all that a man feels. To give even Women counsel against Jealousie, would be so much time lost, their very Being is so made up of Suspition, Vanity, and Curiosity, that to cure them by any lawful ways, is not to be hop'd or expected. They often recover of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, by a form of Health much more to be fear'd than the Disease it self. For as there are Enchantments that cannot take away the Evil, but by throwing it upon another, they also willingly transfer this Fever to their Husbands, when they shake it off themselves. And yet I know not, to speak truth, whether a man can suffer worse from them than their Jealousie; 'tis the most dangerous of all their Conditions, as the Head is of all their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>Pittacus</hi> was us'd to say, that every one had his defect, and that his was the jealous Head of his Wife; but for which he should think himself perfectly happy. A mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience sure which could poyson the whole Life of so just, so wise, and so valiant a man; What must we other little Fellows do? The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Marselles</hi> had reason to grant him that begg'd leave to kill himself, that he might be deliver'd from the Clamour of his Wife, his request; for 'tis a mischief that is never remov'd, but that it carries away the piece; and that has no Remedy but Flight or Patience, though both of them very hard. He was doubtless an understanding Fellow that said, there was no happy Marriage but betwixt a blind Wife and a deaf Husband.

Let us also consider whether the great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Severity of Obligation we enjoyn them, does not produce two effects contrary to our design, namely, whether it does not render the Pursuants more eager to attaque, and the Women more easie to yield.

What better Interpretation can we make of <hi>Messalina</hi>'s Behaviour?

This Animal, not to be rous'd with all this, and rendring her Pleasures dull and flat by his too stupid Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which he seem'd to authorize, and make them lawful; what does she? but being the Wife of a living and healthful Emperour, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Theater of the World, in the face of the Sun, and with solemn Ceremony, and to <hi>Silius,</hi> who had long before enjoy'd her, she publickly marries her self one day that her Husband was gone out of the <hi>City.</hi> Does it not seem as if she was going to become Chaste by her Husband's negligence? or that she sought another Husband that might shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen her appetite by his jealousie, and who by watching should incite her?

This painting is not so much carried on by dexterity of hand, as by having the object more lively imprinted in the Soul: <hi>Gallus</hi> speaks simply, because he conceives simply: <hi>Horace</hi> does not content himself with a superficial expression that would betray him; he sees farther and more clearly into things, his Wit breaks into, and rummages all the magazine of words and figures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to express himself, and he must have them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53645:791" rendition="simple:additions"/>
above ordinary, because his Conception is so. <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, that he sees the Latin Tongue by the things. 'Tis here the same: the Sense illuminates, and produces the words: no more words of air, but of flesh and bone; they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more than they express. Moreover, those who are not well skill'd in a Language, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some image of this; for in <hi>Italy,</hi> I said whatever I had a mind to in common discourse, but in more serious subjects, I durst not have trusted my self with an <hi>Idiome</hi> that I could not wind and turn out of its ordinary pace; I would therein have a power of introducing something of my own. The handling and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of fine Wits is that which sets off a Language; not so much by innovating it, as by putting it to more vigorous and various service, and by straining, bending, and adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to them. They do not create words, but they enrich their own, and give them weight and signification by the Uses they put them to, and teach them unwonted motions, but withall, ingeniously and discreetly. And how little this talent is given to all, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the many French Scriblers of this Age. They are bold, and proud enough not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the common road, but want of Invention and discretion ruins them. There is nothing seen in their Writings but a wretched affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a strange new style, with cold and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd disguises, which, instead of elevating, depress the matter. Provided they can but trick up their style with fine new words, they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53645:791" rendition="simple:additions"/>
care not what they signifie; and to bring in a new word by the head and shoulders, they leave the old one, very often more sinewy and significant than the other. There is stuff enough in our Language, but there is a defect in cutting out. For there is nothing that might not be made out of our terms of <hi>Hunting</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> which is a fruitful Soil to borrow from. And the forms of speaking, like Herbs, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and grow stronger by being transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I find it sufficiently abounding, but not sufficiently pliable and vigorous. It quails un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a powerful Conception. If you would maintain the dignity of your style, you will oft perceive it to flag and languish under you, and there <hi>Latin</hi> steps in to its relief, as <hi>Greek</hi> does to other Languages. Of some of the words I have pick'd out for my own use, we do not easily discern the energy, by reason that the frequent use of them have in some sort embas'd their beauty, and rendred it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. As in our ordinary Language there are several excellent Phrases and Metaphors to be met with, of which the beauty is wither'd by age, and the colour is sullied by too common handling; but that takes nothing from the relish to an understanding man: neither does it derogate from the glory of those ancient Authors, who, 'tis likely, first brought those words into that lustre. The <hi>Sciences</hi> treat of things too finely, and after an artificial, very different from the common and natural way. My Page makes love, and understands it, but

It vexes me that he is so expos'd to the spoil of those who are conversant with him. I can no sooner cast an Eye upon him, but I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyn either a Leg or a Wing. And also for

this Design of mine, 'tis convenient for me to write at home, in a wild Country, where I have no body to assist or relieve me; where I hardly see a man that understands the Latine of his <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> and of <hi>French</hi> as little, if not less. I might have made it better elsewhere, but then the work would have been less my own; and its principal end and perfection is to be exactly mine: I should well enough correct an accidental Error, of which I am full, as I run carelesly on: but for any ordinary and constant Imperfections, it were a kind of Treason to put them out. When another tells, or that I say to my self, <hi>Thou art too thick of Figures</hi>; this is a word of the <hi>Gascon</hi> growth, and therefore a dangerous Phrase; (I do not reject any of those that are us'd in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Streets of <hi>France,</hi> they that will fight <hi>Custom</hi> with <hi>Grammar,</hi> are Fools) <hi>this is an ignorant Discourse; this is a Paradoxical say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is a foolish Expression. Thou mak'st thy self merry sometimes; and men will think thou sayest a thing in good earnest, which thou only speak'st in jest.</hi> Yes, say I, but I correct the Faults of Inadvertence, not those of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom. Do I not talk at the same rate through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? Do I not represent my self to the Life? 'Tis enough that I have done what I design'd; all the World knows me in my Book, and my Book in me. Now I have an apish imitating Quality; when I us'd to write Verses, (and I never made any but Latine) they evidently accus'd the Poet I had last read; and some of

my first Essays have a little exotick taste. I speak something another kind of Language at <hi>Paris</hi> than I do at <hi>Montaigne.</hi> Whoever I stedfastly look upon, easily leaves some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his upon me. Whatever I consider, I usurp; whether a foolish Countenance, a disagreeable look, or a ridiculous way of speaking; and Vices most of all, because they seize and stick to me, and will not leave hold without shaking off. I swear more by Imitation than Humour. A murthering imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like that of the Apes, so terrible both in stature and strength, that <hi>Alexander</hi> met with in a certain Country of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he would have had much ado any other way to have subdu'd. But they afforded him the means by that Inclination of theirs to imitate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they saw done. For by that the Hunters were taught to put on Shooes in their sight, and to tye them fast with many knots, and to muffle up their Heads in Caps all compos'd of running nooses, and to seem to anoint their Eyes with Glew; so did those silly Creatures employ their Imitation to their own ruine, they glew'd up their own Eyes, haltred and bound themselves. The other faculty of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mimicks, and ingeniously acting the Words and Gestures of another, purposely to make others merry, and to raise their Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no more in me than in a Stock. When I swear my own Oath, 'tis only by <hi>God,</hi> of all <hi>Oaths</hi> the most direct. They say that <hi>Socrates</hi> swore by the <hi>Dog, Zeno</hi> had for his Oath the

same Interjection, at this time in use amongst the <hi>Italians Cappari: Pythagoras</hi> swore by <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Air.</hi> I am so apt, without thinking of it, to receive these superficial Impressions, that if I have <hi>Majesty</hi> or <hi>Highness</hi> in my Mouth three dayes together, they come out instead of <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Lordship,</hi> eight dayes after; and what I say to day in sport and fooling, I shall seriously say the same to morrow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in writing, I more unwillingly undertake beaten Arguments, lest I should handle them at anothers expence. Every Subject is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fertile to me. A Fly will serve me for a Subject, and 'tis well if this I have in hand has not been undertaken at the Recommendation of as wanton a Will. I may begin with that which pleases me best, for the Subjects are all link'd to one another; but my Soul displeases me, in that it ordinarily produces its deepest and most airy conceits which please me best, when I least expect or study for them; and suddenly vanish, having at the instant nothing to apply them to; on Horse-back, at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in Bed: but most on Horse-back, where I am most given to think. My speaking is a little nicely jealous of Silence and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if I talk my best. Who interrupts me, cuts me off. In travelling, the Necessity of the way will often put a stop to Discourse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, I for the most part travel without Company, fit to entertain long Discourses, by which means I have all the leisure I would to entertain my self. It falls out as it does in my

Dreams, whilst dreaming, I recommend them to my Memory, (for I am apt to dream that I dream) but the next Morning I may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to my self of what Complexion they were, whether gay, or sad, or strange, but what they were, as to the rest, the more I endeavour to retrieve them, the deeper I plunge them in oblivion. So of Thoughts that come acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally into my Head, I have no more but a vain Image remaining in my Memory, only enough to make me torment my self in their quest to no purpose. Well then, laying Books aside, and more simply and materially speaking, I find after all,<note place="margin">Definition of Love.</note> that <hi>Love is nothing else but the thirst of enjoying the subject desir'd</hi>; neither is <hi>Venus</hi> any other thing than the pleasure of discharging the Vessels, as the Pleasure Nature gives us of discharging other Parts, that either by immoderation or indiscretion become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.

In every thing else a man may keep some <hi>Decorum,</hi> all other Operations submit to the Rules of Decency; this cannot so much as in imagination appear other than vicious or ridiculous. Examin if you can therein find one wise and discreet proceeding. <hi>Alexander</hi> said, that he chiefly knew himself to be mortal by this act and sleeping; sleep suffocates and suppresses the Faculties of the Soul; the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with Women does likewise dissipate and exhaust them. Doubtless 'tis a mark, not only of our original corruption, but also of our vanity and deformity. On the one side, <hi>Nature</hi> pushes us on to it, having fixt the most noble, utile, and pleasant of all her functions to this desire: and on the other side, leaves us to accuse and avoid it, as insolent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, to blush at it, and to recommend absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. Are we not sufficiently <hi>Brutes,</hi> to call that work brutish which begets us? People of so many differing Religions have concurr'd in several Ceremonies, as Sacrifices, Lamps, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Incence, Fasts, and Offerings; and amongst other, in the condemning this Act: All Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concenter in this, besides the old custom of Circumcisions.

And we do not get much by the bargain; for as the World is divided, for three beautiful Women we must kiss threescore ugly ones; and to a tender Stomach, like those of my Age, an ill kiss over pays a good one. In <hi>Italy</hi> they passionately court, even their common
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53645:798" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Women, who prostitute themselves for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and justifie the doing so, by saying, that there are degrees of fruition, and that by their Services they will procure themselves that which is best and most intire. They sell nothing but their <hi>Bodies,</hi> the Will is too free, and too much its own to be expos'd to sale; so say these, that 'tis the Will they undertake, and they have reason; 'Tis indeed the Will that we are to serve, and have to do withall. I abhor to imagine mine in a Body without Affection. And this madness is, methinks, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin-German to that of the Boy, who would needs lye with the beautiful Statue of <hi>Venus,</hi> made by <hi>Praxiteles</hi>; or that of the furious <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who violated the dead Carcass of a Woman he was embalming: which was the occasion of the Law afterwards made in <hi>Egypt,</hi>

What? have we not seen one in these days of ours, that made use of this Act upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a most horrid Revenge, by that means to kill, and poison, as he did, a beautiful Woman? Such as know <hi>Italy,</hi> will not think it strange, if for this Subject, I seek not else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for Examples: for that Nation may be call'd the <hi>Regent</hi> of the world in this: They have generally more handsome, and fewer ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly women than we: but for rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Beauties we have as many as they. I think the same of their Wits; of those of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort they have many, and evidently more. Brutality is without comparison much rarer there; but in singular Souls, and those of the highest Form, we are nothing indebted to them. If I should carry on the comparison, I might say, as touching Valour, that, on the contrary it is, to what it is with them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and natural with us: but sometimes we see them possess'd to such a degree as surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the most steady and obstinate Examples we can produce. The Marriages of that Country are defective in this; Their Custom common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imposes so rude, and so slavish a Law upon the Women, that the most remote Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with a Stranger rendred necessarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial; and seeing that all comes to one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they have no hard choice to make. And have they broken down the Fence? We may safely presume they have, <hi>Luxuria ipsis vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis, sicut fera bestia, irritata, deinde emissa.

The desire of Company is allay'd by giving a little Liberty. 'Tis a good Custom we have in <hi>France,</hi> that our Sons are receiv'd into the best Families, there to be entertain'd and bred up Pages, as in a School of <hi>Nobless.</hi> And 'tis look'd upon as a discourtesie, and an affront to refuse a Gentleman. I have taken notice (for so many Families so many differing forms) that the Ladies who have been strictest with their Maids, have had no better luck than those who allow'd them a greater Liberty. There should be Moderation in all things, one must leave a great deal of their Conduct to their own Discretion; for, when all comes to all, no Discipline can curb them throughout. But it is true withall, that she who comes off with flying Colours from a School of Liberty, brings with her whereon to repose more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, than she who comes away sound from a severe and strict Education. Our Fathers dress'd up their Daughters looks in Bashfulness and Fear, we ours in Confidence and Assurance. We understand nothing of the Matter. We must
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53645:800" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leave it to the <hi>Sarmates,</hi> that are not to lye with a Man, till with their own hands they have first kill'd another in Battel. For me, who have no other title left me to these things, but by the cares; 'tis sufficient, if according to the Priviledge of my Age, they retain me for one of their Counsel. I do then advise them, and us men too, to Abstinence; but if the Age we live in will not endure it, at least Modesty and Discretion. For as the Story of <hi>Aristippus</hi> says, speaking to two young men, who blush'd to see him go into a scandalous House; the Vice is in not coming out, not in going in. Let her that has no care of her Conscience, have yet some regard to her Reputation; and tho' she be rotten within, let her carry a fair out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side at least. I commend a Gradation, and the deferring of time in bestowing of their Favours. <hi>Plato</hi> declares, that in all sorts of Love, Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Promptness are forbidden the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. 'Tis a sign of eagerness, so rashly, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and hand over head wholly to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves, which they ought to disguise with all the art they have. In carrying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves modestly and unwillingly in the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their last Favours, they much more allure our desires, and hide their own. Let them still fly before us, even those who have most mind to be overtaken. They better conquer us by flying, as the <hi>Scythians</hi> do. To say the truth, according to the law that <hi>Nature</hi> has impos'd upon them, it is not properly for them either to will, or desire; their part is to suffer, obey,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53645:801" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and consent: and for this it is that Nature has given them a perpetual Capacity, which in us is but sometimes, and incertain; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fit for the encounter, that they may be always ready when we are so.<note place="margin">

I confess the truth when it makes against me, as well as when 'tis on my side.

But 'tis true withall, that 'tis contrary to the nature of Love, if it be not violent, and contrary to the nature of Violence if it be constant. And they who make it a wonder, exclaim, and keep such a clutter to find out the causes of this Frailty of theirs, as unnatural, and not to be believ'd; how comes it to pass they do not discern how often they are themselves guilty of the same, without any Astonishment or Miracle at all?

and done me a most irreparable injury. Every Member I have, as much one as another, is equally my own, and no other does more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly make me a man than this. I universally owe my intire Picture to the publick. The Wisdom of my Instruction wholly consists in Liberty, and naked Truth; disdaining to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce these little, feign'd, common, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Rules, into the Catalogue of its real Duties, all natural, general, and constant; of which <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Ceremony</hi> are Daughters indeed, but illegitimate. We are sure to have the Vices of Apparence when we shall have had those of Essence. When we have done with these, we run full drive upon others, if we find it must be so. For there is danger that we shall fancy new Offices, to excuse our Negligence toward the natural ones, and to confound them.

The
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53645:804" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Application of our selves to light and trivial things, diverts us from those that are necessary and just. O, that these superficial men take an easie and plausible way in comparison of ours! These are shadows wherewith we palliate and pay one another; but we do not pay, but inflame the reckoning towards that great Judge, who tucks up our rags and tatters above our shameful Parts, and is not nice to view us all over, even to our inmost and most secret Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: it were an useful Decency of our maidenly Modesty, could it keep him from this Discovery. In fine, whoever could reclaim man from so scrupulous a verbal Superstition, would do the World no great disservice. Our Life is divided betwixt Folly and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

so that you presently assume the Interest, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Authority of a Husband, be deriv'd? 'Tis a free contract. Why do you not then begin, as you intend to hold on? There is no prescription upon voluntary things. 'Tis against the form; but it is true withall, that I in my time have carried on this intrigue as much as the Nature of it would permit, as conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53645:805" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and with as much colour of Justice, as any other contract whatever; and that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended other Affection than what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had, and have truly acquainted them with the Declination, Vigour, and Birth of the fame, the Fits and Intermissions: a man does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hold on at the same rate. I have been so sparing of my Promises, that I think I have been better than my Word.<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in Love.</note> They have found me faithful to their Inconstancy, even to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, and sometimes a multiplied Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I never broke with them whilst I had any hold at all, and what Occasion soever they have given me, never broke with them to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or Contempt. For such Privacies, though obtain'd upon never so scandalous terms, do yet oblige to some good Will. I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, upon their tricks and evasions, discover'd a little indiscreet Anger and Impatience; for I am naturally subject to rash Emotions, which though light and short, often spoyl my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Would they freely have consulted my Judgment, I should not have stuck to have given them sharp and paternal Counsels, and to have pinch'd them to the quick. If I have left them any cause to complain of me, 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have found in me, in comparison of the modern usance, a Love foolishly conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than any thing else. I have kept my word in things wherein I might easily have been dispenc'd; they then sometimes surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themselves with Reputation, and upon Articles that they were willing enough should
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53645:805" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be broken by the Conquerour. I have more than once made Pleasure in its greatest effort strike to the interest of their humour; and where Reason importun'd me, have arm'd them against my self; so that they order'd their affairs more decently and securely by my <hi>Rules,</hi> when they frankly referr'd themselves to them, than they would have done by their own. I have ever, as much as I could, wholly taken upon my self alone the hazard of our assignations to acquit them, and have alwayes contriv'd our meetings after the hardest and most unusual manner, as less suspected, and moreover, in my opinion, more accessible. They are chiefly more open, where they think they are the most securely shut. Things least fear'd are least interdicted and observ'd. One may more boldly dare what no body thinks you dare, which by the difficulty becomes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Never had any man his approaches more impertinently genital; this way of loving is more according to my discipline: but how ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and ineffectual to our People, who better know than I? yet I shall not repent me of it, I have nothing there more to lose.

On the contrary also, if it were for me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again, in earnest it should be by the same method, and the same progress, how fruitless soever it might prove. Folly and Ignorance are commendable in an incommendable action. The farther I go from their humour in this, I approach so much nearer to my own. As to the rest, in this traffick, I would not suffer my self to be totally carried away, I would please my self in it, but would not forget my self withall: I would keep the little Sence and Discretion that Nature has given me, intire for their service and my own: a little Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but no Dotage. My Conscience should also be engag'd in it, even to Debauch and Dissolution; but so far as to Ingratitude,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53645:806" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Treachery, Malice and Cruelty, never. I would not purchace the pleasure of this Vice at any rate, but content my self with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and simple expence. <hi>Nullum intra se vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium est, Nothing is a Vice in it self.</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most equally hate a stupid and slothful Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as I do a toilsome and painful Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the one pinches, the other layes me asleep. I like wounds as well as bruises, and cuts as well as dry blows. I found in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, when I was the most able for it, a just moderation betwixt these Extreams. Love is a spritely, lively, and gay Agitation, I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubled nor afflicted with it, but heated, and moreover disorder'd; a man must stop there: it hurts no body but fools. A young man ask'd the Philosopher <hi>Panetius,</hi> if it was becomming a wise man to be in Love? <hi>Let the wise man look to that,</hi> answer'd he, <hi>but let not thou and I, who are not so, ingage our selves in so stirring and violent an affair, that will slave us to others, and render us contemptible to our selves.</hi> He said true: that we are not to intrust a thing so precipitous in it self, to a Soul that has not wherewithall to withstand its assaults, and disprove the saying of <hi>Agesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> that Prudence and Love cannot live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 'Tis a vain Employment, 'tis true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, shameful, and unlawful; but to carry it on after this manner, I look upon it as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and proper to enliven a drowsie Soul, and to rouze up a heavy Body. And, as an experienc'd Physician, I would prescribe it to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53645:807" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a man of my form and condition, as soon as any other <hi>Recipe</hi> whatever, to rouze and keep him in vigour till well advanc'd in years, and to defer the approaches of Age, whilst we are but in the Suburbs, and that the Pulse yet beats.

We have need to be trinckled and tickled by some such niping incitation as this. Do but observe what Youth, Vigour, and Gayety it inspir'd <hi>Anacreon</hi> withall. And <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was then older than I, speaking of an amorous Object, <hi>Leaning,</hi> said he, <hi>my Shoulder to her Shoulder, and my Head to hers, as we were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding together in a Book, I felt, without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, a sudden sting in my Shoulder like the biting of a Flea, which I still felt above five days after, and a continual itching crept into my Heart.</hi> What only an accidental touch, and of a Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to heat and alter a Soul mortified and enerved by Age, and the strictest liver of all Mankind? And pray why not? <hi>Socrates</hi> was a Man, and would neither be, nor be like any other thing. <hi>Philosophy</hi> does not contend
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53645:807" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against natural Pleasures,<note place="margin">Natural Pleasures allow'd if moderate.</note> provided they be moderate: and only preaches Moderation, not a total abstinence. The power of resistance is employ'd against those that are adulterate, and introduc'd by Innovation. <hi>Philosophy</hi> says, that the Appetites of the Body ought not to be augmented by the Mind; and ingeniously warns us not to stir up Hunger by Saturity, not to stuff instead of filling the Belly, to avoid all Fruition that may bring us to want, and all Meats and Drinks that procure Thirst and Hunger: As she does in the service of Love, she there prescribes us to take such an object as may only simply satisfie the Bodies real need, and may not stir the Soul, which ought only barely to follow and assist the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without mixing in the affair. But have I not reason to believe, that these Precepts, which nevertheless, in my opinion, are else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where very severe, are only directed to a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in its best, and best performing plight: and that in a Body broken with Age, as in a weak Stomach, 'tis excusable to warm and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it by Art, and by the mediation of the Fancy, to restore the Appetite, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it has lost in it self. May we not say, that there is nothing in us during this earthly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that is purely either corporeal or spiritual; and that we injuriously break up a man alive; and that it seems but reasonable that we should carry our selves as favourably at least against the use of Pleasure, as we do against that of Pain? It was (for example) vehement even to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53645:808" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perfection in the Souls of the Saints by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: the Body had there naturally a share by the right of Union, and yet might have but little part in the Cause; and yet are they not contented that it should barely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and assist the afflicted Soul. They have afflicted it by it self, with grievous and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar torments, to the end, that by emulation of one another, the Soul and Body might plunge man into misery, by so much more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiferous as it is more painful and severe. In like manner, is it not injustice in bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to subdue and keep under the Soul, and say, that it must therein be drag'd along, as to some enforc'd and servile obligation and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity? 'Tis rather her part to botch and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them, there to present her self, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them, the Authority of Ruling belonging to her, as it is also her part, in my opinion, in Pleasures that are proper to her, to inspire and infuse into the Body all the resentment it is capable of, and to study how to make it pleasant and useful to it. For it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as they say, that the Body should not pursue its Appetites to the prejudice of the Mind; but why is it not also reason that the Mind should not pursue hers to the prejudice of the Body? I have no other Passion to keep me in breath. What Avarice, Ambition, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Suits do to others, who, like me, have no particular Vocation, Love would much more commodiously do; it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to me Vigilancy, Sobriety, Grace, and

It would re-assure my countenance, that the sour looks, those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and to be pitied sour looks of old Age, might not step in to disgrace it; would again put me upon sound and wise studies, by which I might render my self more lov'd and esteem'd, clearing my mind of the despair of it self, and of its Use, and redintigrate it to it self; would divert me from a thousand troublesome thoughts, and a thousand melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Humours, that Idleness and the ill posture of our Health loads us withall at such an Age; would warm again, in Dreams at least, the Blood that Nature has given over; would hold up the Chin, and a little stretch out the Nerves, the vigours, and gayety of Life of that poor man who is going full drive toward his ruine. But I very well understand that it is a commodity very hard to recover: by Weakness and long Experience our taste is become more delicate and nice: we ask most, when we bring least; and will have the most choice, when we least deserve to be accepted: and knowing our selves for what we are, we are less confident and more distrustful, nothing can assure us of being belov'd, considering our condition and theirs.

my eyes, that have been just enough, if death be one) so as to be astonish'd and to lose my Judgment. Fear springs sometimes as well from want of Judgment as from want of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. All the dangers I have been in I have look'd upon without winking, with an open, sound, and intire Sight; and besides, a man must have courage to fear: It has formerly served me better than some others, so to order my retreat, that it was, if not without fear, nevertheless without affright and astonishment. It was stirr'd indeed, but not amazed nor stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified. Great Souls go yet much farther, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present flights, not only sound and temperate, but moreover fierce. Let us make a Relation of that which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> reports of <hi>Socrates,</hi> his fellow in Arms: <hi>I found him,</hi> says he, <hi>after the rout of our Army, him and</hi> Lachez <hi>in the rear of those that fled, and considered him at my leisure, and in security, for I was mounted upon a good Horse, and he on foot, and had so fought. I took notice in the first place, how much Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Resolution he shew'd in comparison of</hi> Lachez, <hi>and then the bravery of his march, nothing different from his ordinary gate; his sight firm and regular, considering and judging what pass'd about him, looking one while upon those, and then upon others, Friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, after such a manner as incourag'd the one, and signified to the others, that he would sell his life dear to any one should attempt to take it from him, and so they came off</hi>; for People are not willing to attack such kind of men, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53645:813" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those they see are in a Fright. This is the Testimony of this great Captain, which teaches us what we every day see, that nothing so much throws us into dangers as an inconsiderate eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of getting our selves clear of them. <hi>Quo timoris minus est, eo minus ferme pericula est.</hi>

                        <hi>When there is least fear there is for the most part least danger.</hi> Our People are too blame to say that such a one is afraid of Death, when he expresses that he thinks of it and fore-sees it: Fore-sight is equally convenient in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, whether good or ill. To consider and judge of the danger, is in some sort the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to being astonish'd. I do not find my self strong enough to sustain the force and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuosity of this Passion of Fear, nor of any other vehement Passion whatever: If I was once conquered and beaten down, I should never rise again very sound. Whoever should once make my Soul lose her footing, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver set it upright again: she retasts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches her self too profoundly, and too much to the quick, and therefore would never let the wound she had receiv'd heal and cicatrize: It has been well for me that never any sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness has yet discompos'd it: At every charge made upon me, I make my utmost opposition and best defence; by which means the first that should rout me, would make me for ever rallying again; I have no after game to play. On which side soever the inundation breaks my banks, I lye open, and am drown'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. <hi>Epicurus</hi> says, <hi>that a wise Man can
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53645:814"/>
never become a Fool</hi>; and I have an Opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to this Sentence, which is, that who has once been a very Fool, will never after be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise. God grant me Cold according to my cloth, and Passions proportionable to the means I have to withstand them. <hi>Nature</hi> having laid me open on the one side, has cover'd me on the other; having disarm'd me of strength, she has arm'd me with insensibility, and an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that is either regular or dull. Now I cannot long endure (and when I was young much less endur'd) either Coach, Litter, or Boat, and hate all other riding but on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, both in the City and Countrey. But I can worse endure a Litter than a Coach, and by the same reason, better a rude Agitation upon the Water, from whence fear is produc'd, than the motions of a Calm. At the little jerks of Oars, stealing the Vessel from under us, I find I know not how both my Head and my Stomach disorder'd: neither can I endure to sit upon a tottering Stool. When the Sail, or the Current carries us equally, or that we are tow'd, those equall agitations do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb me at all. 'Tis an interrupted Motion that offends me, and most of all when most slow: I cannot otherwise express it. The <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi> have order'd me to squeeze and gird my self about the bottom of my Belly with a Napkin to remedy this accident; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have not try'd, being accustom'd to wrestle with my own defects, and overcome them by my self.

me, I should not think my time ill spent in setting down here the infinite variety that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story presents us of the use of Coaches in the Service of War: various according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and according to the Ages; in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of great necessity and effect: so that it is a wonder that we have lost all knowledge of them. I will only say this, that very lately, in our Fathers time, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantagous use of them against the <hi>Turks</hi>; having in every one of them a Targetter and a Musket, and a number of Harquebuseers drawn up, ready, and charg'd, and all cover'd with a <note n="*" place="margin">A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Shields rang'd by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                        <hi>Pavesade</hi> like a <hi>Galliot.</hi> They made the Front of their Battel with three thousand such Coaches, and after the Canon had play'd, made them all pour in their shot upon the Enemy, and made them swallow that Volley before they tasted of the rest; which was no little advance; and that done, the said Chariots charg'd into their Squadrons to break them, and make way for the rest: besides the use they might make of them to flank their Bodies in a place of danger marching in the Field, or to cover a <hi>Quarter,</hi> and fortifie it in haste. In my time, a Gentleman in one of our Frontiers, unweildy of Body, and not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Horse able to carry his weight, having a Quarrel, rid up and down in a Chariot of this fashion, and found great Convenience in it. But let us leave these Chariots of War. As if the insignificancy of Coaches had not been sufficiently known by better proofs, the last

                        <hi>Kings</hi> of our first <hi>Race</hi> travell'd in a Chariot drawn by four Oxen. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was the first at <hi>Rome</hi> that caus'd himself to be drawn in a Coach by <hi>Lions,</hi> and a singing Wench with him. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> did since as much, calling himself <hi>Cybele,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gods</hi>; and also by <hi>Tigers,</hi> taking upon him the Person of the <hi>God Bacchus,</hi> he also sometimes harness'd two Stags to his Coach, another time four Dogs, and another, four naked Whores, causing himself to be drawn by them in Pomp, stark naked too. The Emperour <hi>Firmus</hi> caus'd his Chariot to be drawn by <hi>Ostriches</hi> of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous size, so that it seem'd rather to fly, than roul. The strangeness of these Inventions puts this other Fancy in my head; that it is a kind of Pusillanimity in Monarchs,<note place="margin">The exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Monarchs a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity.</note> and a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they do not sufficiently understand themselves what they are, when they study to make themselves honour'd, and to appear great by excessive Expence. It were indeed excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a foreign Country, where they are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but amongst their own Subjects, where they are in Sovereign command, and may do what they please, it derogates from their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the most supream degree of Honour, to which they can arrive. As, methinks, it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous in a private Gentleman to go finely dress'd at home; his House, his Attendents, and his Kitchin, sufficiently answer for him. The advice that <hi>Isocrates</hi> gives his <hi>King,</hi> seems to be grounded upon Reason; that he should be splendid in Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as it is an expence of duration, that devolves to his Successors; and that he should avoid all Magnificences that will in a short time be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got. I lov'd to go fine when I was a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brother, for want of other Ornament, and it became me well: there are some upon whom their rich cloaths weep. We have strange stories of the frugality of our Kings about their own Persons, and in their gifts: Kings that were great both in Reputation, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Fortune. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> mightily stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles against the Law of the City, that assign'd the publick Money for the Pomp of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Playes and Festivals: he would that their Greatness should be seen in the number of Ships well equipt, and good Armies well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. And there is good reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who, in his Book of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> has establish'd a contrary opinion, and maintains that sort of Expence to be the true fruit of Abundance. They are delights, says <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that only please the baser sort of the People, and that vanish from the memory so soon as they are sated with them, and of which no serious and judicious man can have any esteem. This Money would, in my opinion, be much more Royally, as more profitably, justly, and durably, laid out in <hi>Ports, Havens, Walls,</hi> and <hi>Fortifications</hi>; in sumptuous <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Churches, Colledges,</hi> the reforming of <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>High-wayes</hi>; wherein Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the thirteenth will leave a laudable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to future times; and wherein our Queen

Fortune has done me a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite, in interrupting the noble Structure of the <hi>Pont-neuf</hi> of our great City,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pont-neuf</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
                        </note> and depriving me of the hope of seeing it finish'd before I dye. Moreover, it seems to the Subjects, who are daily Spectators of these Triumphs, that their own Riches are expos'd before them, and that they are entertain'd at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. For the People are apt to presume of <hi>Kings,</hi> as we do of our <hi>Servants,</hi> that they are to take care to provide us all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in abundance; but not touch it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And therefore the Emperour <hi>Galba,</hi> being pleas'd with a <hi>Musician</hi> that play'd to him at Supper, call'd for his Cabinet, and gave him a handful of Crowns that he took out of it, with these words, <hi>This is not the Publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but my own.</hi> Yet it so falls out, that the People for the most part have Reason on their side, and that their Princes feed their Eyes with what they once had to fill their Bellies. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality it self is not in its true Lustre in a Sovereign hand: private men have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the most right; for to take it exactly, a King has nothing properly his own; he owes himself to others.

It is too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a thing to imprint Liberality in him who has as much as he will to supply it with at the expence of others; and the estimate of it, not being proportion'd to the value of the Gift, but to the Wealth of him who extends it, it comes to nothing in so mighty Hands. They find themselves Prodigal, before they can be reputed Liberal; And yet it is but of little Recommendation, in comparison of other Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Virtues: and the only one, as the Tyrant <hi>Dionysius</hi> said, that suits well with Tyranny it self.

The Subjects of a Prince profuse in Gifts, grow unreasonable in asking, and accommodate themselves not to

Reason, but Example. We have in earnest very oft reason to blush at our own Impudence: we are over-paid, according to Justice, when the Recompence equals our Service; for do we owe nothing of natural Obligation to our Princes? If he bears our Charges, he does too much; 'tis enough that he contributes to them, the overplus is call'd Benefit, which cannot be exacted: for the very name of Liberality sounds of Liberty: there is no end on't, as we use it. We never reckon what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, we are only for the future Liberality. Wherefore, the more a Prince exhausts himself in giving, the poorer he grows in Friends. How should he satisfie immoderate desires, that still increase the more they are fill'd? He who has his thoughts upon taking, never thinks of what he has taken. Covetousness has nothing so proper, and so much its own as Ingratitude. The Example of <hi>Cyrus</hi> will not do amiss in this place, to serve the <hi>Kings</hi> of these times for a touch-stone, to know whether their gifts are well or ill bestow'd, and to see how much better that Emperour conferr'd them than they do: by which means they are reduc'd to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of their unknown Subjects, and rather of them who they have wrong'd than of them on whom they have conferr'd their benefits, and so receive <hi>Aids,</hi> wherein there is nothing of gratuitous but the Name. <hi>Croesus</hi> reproach'd him with his Bounty, and cast up to how much his Treasure would amount if he had been a little closer handed. He had a mind to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53645:818" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Liberality, and therefore sent Dispatches into all Parts to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom he had particularly advanc'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating every one of them to supply him with as much Money as they could for a pressing occasion, and to send him a particular of what every one could advance. When all these Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets were brought to him, every one of his Friends, not thinking it enough barely to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him only so much as he had receiv'd from his Bounty, adding to it a great deal of his own, it appear'd that the Sum amounted to a great deal more than <hi>Croesus</hi> his reckoning. Whereupon <hi>Cyrus, I am not,</hi> said he, <hi>less in love with Riches,</hi> than other Princes, but rather a better Husband, you see with how small a venture I have acquir'd the inestimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of so many Friends; and how much more faithful Treasure they are to me than Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men without Obligation or Affection would be; and my Mony better laid up than in Chests, putting upon me the Hatred, Envy, and Contempt of other Princes.

If there be any excusable in such excesses as these, it is where the Novelty and Invention create more wonder than expence. Even in these Vanities we discover how fertile those Ages were in other kind of Wits than these of ours. It is with this sort of fertility, as with other products of Nature. Not that she there employ'd her utmost force. We do not go, we rather run up and down, and whirle this way and that; we turn back the way we came. I am afraid our knowledge is weak in all Sences.

I say, this disparity from the Conquerours, and you take away all the occasion of so many Victories. When I look upon that invincible ardour wherewith so many thousands of Men, Women, and Children, have so often present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thrown themselves into inevitable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for the defence of their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>; that generous obstinacy, to suffer all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities and difficulties, and even Death it self, rather than submit to the Dominion of those by whom they had been so shamefully abus'd; and some of them choosing rather to dye of hunger and fasting, than to accept of nourishment from the hands of their so basely victorious Enemies: I foresee, that whoever would have attacqu'd them upon equal terms of Arms, Experience, and Number, would have had a hard, and peradventure a harder game to play, than in any other War we have seen. Why did not so noble a Conquest fall under <hi>Alexander,</hi> or the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; and so great a revolution and mutation of so many Empires and Nations, fall into hands that might have rooted up and gently levell'd, and made plain and smooth whatever was rough and savage amongst them, and that might have cherish'd and propagated the good Seeds that Nature had there produc'd, mixt, not only with the Culture of Land, and the Ornament of Cities, the Arts of this part of the World, in what was necessary, but also the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Virtues, with those that were Originals of the Country?

How easie had it been to have made Advantage of Souls so innocent, and so eager to learn; having for the most part naturally so good Inclinations before? Whereas, on the contrary, we have taken Advantage of their Ignorance and Inexperience, with greater ease to incline them to Treachery, Luxury, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and towards all sorts of Inhumanity and Cruelty, by the Pattern and Example of our Manners. Who ever enhanc'd the price of Merchandize at such a rate? So many Cities levell'd with the Ground, so many Nations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated, so many millions of People fallen by the Edge of the Sword, and the richest and most beautiful part of the World turn'd upside down, for the Traffick of Pearl and Pepper: Mechanick Victories! Never did Ambition, never did Animosities engage men against one another to such a degree of Hostility and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Calamity. Certain <hi>Spaniards</hi> coasting the Sea in quest of their Mines, landed in a fruitful, and pleasant, and very well peopled Country, and there made to the Inhabitants their accustom'd Remonstrances; that they were peaceable men, who were come from a very remote Country, and sent on the behalf of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> the greatest Prince of

To which they receiv'd this Answer: <hi>That as to their being peaceable, they did not seem to be such, if they were so. As to their King, he seem'd to be neccesitous and poor, because he ask'd, and he who had given him that divident, a man that lov'd dissention, to go give away that to another, which was none of his own, to bring it into dispute against the ancient Possessors. As to Victuals, they would supply them, that of Gold they had little; it being a thing they had in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small esteem, as being of no use to the service of Life, whereas their Care was only bent to pass it over happily and pleasantly: but that what they could find, excepting what was employ'd in the Service of their Gods, they might freely take. As to one only God, the Proposition had pleas'd them well, but that they would not change their Religion, both because they had so happily liv'd in it, and that they were not wont to take advice of any but their Friends, and those they knew. As to their Menaces, it was a sign of want of Judgment, to threaten those whose Nature

and Power was to them unknown. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to make haste to avoid their Coast, for they were not us'd to take the Civilities and Remonstrances of arm'd Men and Strangers in good part; otherwise they should do by them as they had done by those others, shewing them the Heads of several executed men round the Walls of their City.</hi> A fair Example of the gibberish, and beginning to speak of this Infancy.

We have these Narratives from themselves: for they do not only own it, but boast of it. Could it be for a testimony of their Justice, or their Zeal to Religion! Doubtless these are ways too dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and contrary to so holy an end. Had they propos'd to themselves to extend our Faith, they would have considered, that it does not amplifie in the possession of Territories, but in the gaining of men, and would have more than satisfied themselves with the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters occasion'd by the necessity of War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indifferently mixing a Massacre, as upon wild Beasts, as universal as Fire and Sword could make it, having only, by their good will, sav'd so many as they intended to make miserable Slaves of for the Work and Service of their <hi>Mines</hi>: So that many of the Captains were put to death upon the place of Conquest, by order of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> justly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the horror of their Deportments, and almost all of them hated and disesteem'd. <hi>God</hi> did meritoriously permit that all this great Plunder should be swallow'd up by the Sea in Transportation, or by Civil Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they devoured one another, and the greatest part was buried upon the Place, with out any fruit of their Victory.

Predecessors of it, and that first abundance of <hi>Riches</hi> which was found at the first Landing in those new discovered Countreys, (for tho' a great deal be fetch'd from thence, yet we see 'tis nothing in comparison of that ought to be expected) it is, that the use of Coin was there utterly unknown, and that consequently their Gold was found all hoarded together, being of no other use but for Ornament and Shew, as a Furniture reserv'd from Father to Son, by many puissant Kings, who always drain'd their Mines to make this vast heap of <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Statues,</hi> for the decoration of their <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Temples</hi>; whereas our Gold is always in motion and Traffick: We cut ours into a thousand small pieces, and cast it into a thousand Forms, and scatter and disperse it a thousand ways. But suppose our Kings should thus hoard up all the Gold they could get in several Ages, and let it lye idle by them. Those of the Kingdom of <hi>Mexico</hi> were in some sort more civiliz'd, and greater <hi>Artists</hi> than the other <hi>Nations</hi> that were beyond them: Therefore did they judge as we do, that the World was near its period, and look'd upon the Desolation we brought amongst them for a certain Sign of it. They believ'd that the Existence of the World was divided into five <hi>Ages,</hi> and the Life of five successive <hi>Suns,</hi> of which <hi>four</hi> had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their time, and that that which gave them Light was the <hi>fifth.</hi> The first perish'd, with all other Creatures, by an universal Inundation of Water.

upon us, which suffocated every living Thing: to which Age they assign the <hi>Giants,</hi> and shew'd bones to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of which, the Stature of men amounted to twenty hands high. The third, by Fire, which burnt and consum'd all. The fourth, by an Emotion of the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Wind,</hi> which came with such violence as to beat down even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mountains; wherein the men dyed not, but were turned into <hi>Baboons</hi>; (what impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will not the weakness of human Belief ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?)

of <hi>Cusco,</hi> (three hundred Leagues) straight, even, five and twenty Paces wide, pav'd, and enclos'd on both sides with high and beautiful Walls; and close by them on the inside, two clear Rivolets, border'd with a beautiful sort of a <hi>Tree</hi> which they call <hi>Molly</hi>: in which Work, where they met with Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they cut them through, and made them even, and fill'd up Pits and Valleys with Lime and Stone to make them level. At the end of every days Journey are beautiful <hi>Palaces,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with Provisions, Vestments, and Arms, as well for Travellers, as for the Armys that are to pass that way. In the estimate of this Work, I have reckon'd the difficulty which is particularly considerable in that Place. They did not build with any Stones less than ten foot square: and had no other conveniency of carriage, but by drawing their load themselves by force of Arms, and knew not so much as the Art of Scaffolding, nor any other way of standing to their Work, but by throwing up Earth against the Building, as it rose high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, taking it away again when they had done. Let us here return to our Coaches, instead of which, and of all other sorts of Carriages, they caus'd themselves to be carried by men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Shoulders. This last King of <hi>Peru,</hi> the day that he was taken, was thus carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two upon staves of Gold, and set in a Chair of Gold in the middle of his Battel.

so many others (and they contended for it) took the place of those that were slain, so that they could never beat him down, what slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter soever they made of those People, till a <hi>Light horse-man</hi> seizing upon him, brought him down.</p>

For a man does not fall from all heights, there are several from which one may descend with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling down. It does indeed appear to me, that we value it at too high a rate, and also over value the resolution of those whom we have either seen, or heard have contemn'd it, or displac'd themselves of their own accord. Its Essence is not so evidently commodious, that a man may not without a miracle refuse it; I find it a very hard thing to undergo Misfortunes, but to be content with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent measure of Fortune, and to avoid Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53645:828" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I think a very easie matter. 'Tis<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, a Virtue to which I, who am none of the nicest, could without any great endeavour arrive. What then is to be expected from them that would yet put into Consideration the glory attending this refusal, wherein there may lurk worse Ambition, than even in the desire it self, and Fruition of Greatness? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as Ambition never comports it self better according to it self, than when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by obscure and unfrequented wayes. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite my Courage to Patience, but I rein it as much as I can towards desire. I have as much to wish for as another, and allow my Wishes as much Liberty and Indiscretion: but yet it never befell me to wish for either Empire or Royalty, for the Eminency of those high and commanding Fortunes. I do not aim that way, I love my self too well. When I think to grow greater, 'tis but very moderately, and by a compell'd and timorous Advancement, such as is proper for me; in Resolution, in Prudence, in Health, in Beauty, and even in Riches too. But this supream Reputation, and this mighty Authority oppress my Imagination. And, quite contrary to some others, I should peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather choose to be the second or third in <hi>Perigourd,</hi> than the first at <hi>Paris</hi>: at least, without lying, the third, than the first at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> I would neither dispute, a miserable <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> with a Noble-man's Porter, nor make Crowds open in Adoration as I pass: I am train'd up to a moderate Condition, as well

by my choice, as Fortune; and have made it appear in the whole Conduct of my Life and Enterprizes, that I have rather avoided than otherwise, the climbing above the degree of Fortune wherein <hi>God</hi> has plac'd me by my Birth: all natural Constitution is equally just and easie. My Soul is so sneaking and mean, that I measure not good Fortune by the height, but by the Facility. But if my Heart be not great enough, 'tis open enough to make amends at any ones request freely to lay open its Weakness. Should any one put me upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Life of <hi>L. Thorius Balbus,</hi> a brave man, handsom, learned, healthful, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abounding in all sorts of Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Pleasures, leading a quiet Life, and all his own, his Mind well prepar'd against Death, Superstition, Pains, and other Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of humane Necessity; dying at last in Battel with his Sword in his Hand, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Country, on the one part; and on the other part, the Life of <hi>M. Regulus,</hi> so great and high as is known to every one, and his end admirable; the one without Name, and without Dignity, the other exemplary, and glorious to wonder: I should doubtless say as <hi>Cicero</hi> did, could I speak as well as he. But if I was to touch it in my own Phrase, I should then also say, that the first is as much according to my Capacity, and Desire, which I conform to my Capacity, as the second is far beyond it; that I could not approach the last but with Veneration, the other I would willingly attain
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53645:829" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by Custom. But let us return to our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Greatness, from which we are digress'd.

'Tis hard to keep measure in so immeasurable a Power. Yet so it is, that it is to those who are not the best natur'd men, a singular incitement to Virtue, to be seated in a place where you cannot do the least good that shall not be put upon Record; and where the least benefit redounds to so many men: and where your Talent of Administration, like that of <hi>Preachers,</hi> does principally address it self to the People, no very exact Judge, easie to deceive, and easily content. There are few things wherein we can give a sincere Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by reason that there are few wherein we have not in some sort a particular Interest.

Superiority and Inferiority, Dominion and Subjection, are bound to a natural Envy and Contest, and must necessarily perpetually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon one another.

'Tis not above a Month ago that I read over two <hi>Scoth Authors</hi> contending upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; of which, he who stands for the People, makes <hi>Kings</hi> to be in a worse Condition than a <hi>Carter</hi>; and he who writes for <hi>Monarchy,</hi> places him some degrees above <hi>God-Almighty</hi> in Power and Sovereignty.<note place="margin">The Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Greatness.</note> Now the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Greatness, that I have made choice of to consider in this place, upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that has lately put it into my head, is this. There is not peradventure any thing more pleasant in the Commerce of men, than the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als that we make against one another, out of Emulation of Honour and Valour, whether in the Exercises of the Body, or in those of the Mind; wherein the Sovereign Greatness can have no true part. And in earnest, I have often thought, that out of force of respect, men have us'd Princes disdainfully and injuriously in that particular. For the thing I was infinitely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at in my Child-hood, that they who exerciz'd with me forbore to do their best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they found me unworthy of their utmost endeavour, is what we see happen to them every day, every one finding himself unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to contend with them. If we discover
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53645:830" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they have the least Passion to have the better, there is no one who will not make it his Business to give it them, and who will not rather betray his own Glory, than offend theirs; and will therein employ so much force only as is necessary to advance their Honour. What share have they then in the Engagement, wherein every one is on their side?

Whilst I publish and accuse my own Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, some one will learn to be afraid of them. The Parts that I most esteem in my self, derive more honour from decrying, than from commending my own Manners: which is the reason why I so often fall into, and so much insist upon that strain. But, when all is summ'd up, a man never speaks of himself without loss. A man's accusations of himself are always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, his praises never. There may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be some of my own Complexion, who bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instruct me by contrariety than similitude. and more by avoiding than by imitation. The elder <hi>Cato</hi> had a regard to this sort of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, when he said, <hi>that the wise may learn more of fools, than fools can of the wise</hi>; and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi> tells us of an ancient player upon the <hi>Harp,</hi> who was wont to make his Scholars go to hear one that played very ill, who liv'd over against him, that they might learn to hate his discords and false measures. The horror of Cruelty more inclines me to Clemency, than any Example of Clemency could possibly do. A good <hi>Rider</hi> does not so much mend my seat, as an aukward Attorney, or a <hi>Venetian</hi> on Horse-back; and a clownish way of Speaking
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53645:833" rendition="simple:additions"/>
does more reform mine, than the quaintest <hi>Dialect.</hi> The ridiculous and simple look of another, does always advertise and advise me; that which pricks, rouzes and incites much better than that which tickles. The time is now proper that we should reform back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, more by dissenting than agreeing, by differing than consent. Profiting little by good Examples, I make use of those that are ill, which also are every where to be found: I endeavour to render my self as agreeable as I see others offensive, as constant, as I see others fickle, as affable, as I see others rough, and as good as I see others evil. But I propose to my self invincible measures. The most fruitful and natural exercise of the Mind, in my opinion, is Conference; I find the use of it more sweet than of any other action of Life. And for that reason it is, that if I were now compell'd to chuse, I should sooner, I think, consent to lose my Sight, than my Hearing and Speech. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> and also the <hi>Romans,</hi> kept this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise in great honour in their <hi>Academies.</hi> The <hi>Italians</hi> retain some foot-steps of it to this day to their great advantage, as is manifest by the comparison of our understandings with theirs. The study of Books is a languishing and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motion,<note place="margin">Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage than the reading of Books.</note> that heats not, whereas Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence teaches and exercises at once. If I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr with an understanding Man, and a rude Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he presses hard upon me, and wounds me on both sides; his imaginations raise up mine to more than ordinary pitch. Jealousie, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53645:833" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Contention, stimulate and raise me up to something above my self; and a consent of Judgment is a quality totally offensive in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But, as our minds fortifie themselves by the communication of vigorous and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Understandings; 'tis not to be express'd how much they lose and degenerate by the continual commerce and frequentation we have with those are mean and low. There is no Contagion that spreads like that: I know sufficiently by Experience what 'tis worth a yard. I love to discourse and dispute, but it is but with few men, and for my self; for to do it as a Spectacle and entertainment to great Persons, and to vaunt of a man's Wit and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is, in my opinion, very unbecoming a man of Honour. Impertinency is a scurvy Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but not to be able to endure it, to fret and vex at it, as I do, is another sort of disease, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inferiour to Impertinence it self; and is the thing that I will now accuse in my self. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Conference, and dispute with great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and facility, forasmuch as Opinion meets in me with a Soile very unfit for Penetration, and wherein to take any deep root: no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions astonish me, no belief offends me, though never so contrary to my own. There is no so frivolous and extravagant Fancy that does not seem to me suitable to the product of human Wit. We, who deprive our Judgments of the right of determining, look indifferently upon various Opinions, and if we incline not our Judgments to them, yet we easily give
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53645:834" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them the hearing. Where one Scale is totally empty, I let the other waver under old Wives dreams. And I think my self excusable, if I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse the odd number, <hi>Thursday,</hi> rather than <hi>Friday</hi>; and if I had rather be the twelfth or fourteenth, than the thirteenth at Table; if I had rather on a Journey see a <hi>Hare</hi> run by me than cross my way; and rather give my Man my left foot than my right, when he comes to dress me. All such whimsies as are in Use amongst us, deserve at least to be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto. For my part, they only with me import inanity, but they import that. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, vulgar and casual Opinions are conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as things of moment, and are indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than nothing in Nature: and who will not suffer himself to proceed so far, falls peradventure into the Vice of Obstinacy, to avoid that of Superstition. The contradictions of Judgments then do neither offend nor alter, they only rouze and exercise me. We evade Correction, whereas we ought to offer and present our selves to it, especially when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the form of Conference, and not of Authority. At every opposition, we do not consider whether or no it be just, but right or wrong, how to disengage our selves: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of extending the Arms, we thrust out our Claws. I could suffer my self to be rudely handled by my Friend, so much as to tell me that I am a Fool, and talk I know not of what. I love stout Expressions amongst brave Men, and to have them speak as they think. We
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53645:834" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must fortifie and harden our hearing against this tenderness of the ceremonious sound of Words. I love a strong and manly Familiarity and Conversation: a Friendship that flatters it self in the sharpness and vigour of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; like love, in biting and scratching. It is not vigorous and generous enough, if it be not quarrelsome; if civiliz'd and artificial, if it treads nicely, and fears the shock.<note place="margin">

The <hi>Cause</hi> of Truth ought to be the common <hi>Cause</hi> both of one and the other: What will he answer? The Passion of Anger has already confounded his Judgment; <hi>amazement</hi> has usurpt the place of Reason. It were not amiss, that the decision of our disputes should pass by wager: that there might be a material mark of our losses, to the end we might the better remember them; and that my Man might tell me, <hi>Your Ignorance and Obstinacy cost you last year, at several times, a hundred Crowns.</hi> I embrace and caress <hi>Truth</hi> in what hand soever I find it, and cheerfully sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render my self, and my conquer'd arms, as far off as I can discover it: and, provided it be not too imperiously, take a pleasure in being reprov'd; and accommodate my self to my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, very often more by reason of civility than amendment, loving to gratifie and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the liberty of Admonition, by my facility
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53645:835" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of submitting to it. Nevertheless, it is hard to bring the men of my time to it. They have not the courage to correct, because they have not the courage to suffer themselves to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; and speak always with dissimulation in the presence of one another. I take so great pleasure in being judg'd and known, that it is upon the matter indifferent to me in which of the two Forms I am so: My Imagination does so often contradict and condemn it self, that 'tis all one to me if another do it, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that I give his reprehension no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority than what I will my self. But I break with him, who carries himself so high, as I know some do, that repents his advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not believ'd, and takes it for an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front if it be not immediately follow'd. In that <hi>Socrates</hi> always receiv'd smiling the Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions oppos'd against his Arguments, a man may say his strength of <hi>Reason</hi> was the cause, and the advantage being certain to fall on his side, he accepted them as matter of new victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nevertheless, we see on the contrary, that nothing in Argument renders our Sentiments so delicate, as the opinion of preeminency and disdain of the Adversary; and that in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 'tis rather for the weaker to take in good part the oppositions that correct him and set him right. In earnest, I rather chuse the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of those that ruffle me than those that fear me. 'Tis a dull and hurtful Pleasure to have to do with People who admire us, and approve of all we say. <hi>Antisthenes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

his Children, never to take it kindly, or for a favour from any man that commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them. I find I am much prouder of the victory I obtain over my self, when even in the ardour of dispute, I make my self submit to my Adversaries force of Reason, than I am pleas'd with the victory I obtain over him through his weakness. In fine, I receive and admit of all manner of attacks that are direct, how weak soever: but I am too impatient of those that are made out of Form. I care not what the Subject is, the Opinions are to me all one, and I am as indifferent whether I get the better or the worse: I can peaceably argue a whole day together, if the Argument be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with order. I do not so much require force and subtilty, as method. I mean the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we every day observe in the wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings of Shepherds and Apprentices, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amongst us. If they start from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, 'tis an incivility, and yet we do it. But their Tumult and Impatience never puts them out of their <hi>Theam.</hi> Their Argument still continues its Course. If they prevent, and do not stay for one another, they at least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another very well. Any one answers too well for me, if he answers what I say. But when the Dispute is irregular and perplex'd, I leave the thing, and insist upon the form with Anger and Indiscretion; and fall into a will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, malicious, and imperious way of Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which I am afterwards asham'd. 'Tis impossible to deal honestly and fairly with a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53645:836" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fool. My Judgment is not only corrupted under the hand of so impetuous a Master, but my Conscience also. Our Disputes ought to be interdicted, and punish'd as well as other verbal Crimes. What Vice do they not raise and heap up, being alwayes govern'd and commanded by Passion? We first quarrel with their Reasons, and then with the men. We only learn to dispute, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, and so every one contradicting, and being contradicted, it falls out, that the fruit of Disputation is to lose and nullifie <hi>Truth</hi>; and therefore it is that <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Republick</hi> prohibits this Exercise to Fools and ill bred People. To what end do you go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him who knows nothing to purpose? A man does no injury to the Subject, when he leaves it to seek how he may defend it. I do not mean by an Artificial and Scolastick way, but by a natural one, with a sound understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. What will it be in the end? One flies to the <hi>East,</hi> the other to the <hi>West,</hi> they lose the principal, and wander in the Crowd of Incidents. After an hour of Tempest they know not what they seek: one is low, the other high, and a third wide. One catches at a word and a <hi>simile</hi>; another is no longer sensible of what is said in Opposition to him, and thinks of going on at his own rate, not of answering you. Another, finding himself too weak to make good his rest, fears all, refuses all, and at the very beginning confounds the Subject; or in the very height of the dispute
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53645:836" rendition="simple:additions"/>
stops short, and grows silent: by a peevish ignorance affecting a proud contempt; or by an unseasonable modesty shuns any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Provided that this strikes, he cares not how much he lays himself open; the other counts his Words, and weighs them for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Another only brawls, and makes use of the Advantage of his Lungs. Here's one that learnedly concludes against himself, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that deafs you with Prefaces, and sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Digressions: another falls into down-right railing, and seeks a ridiculous quarrel, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage himself from a Wit that presses too hard upon him: And a last man sees nothing into the reason of the thing, but draws a line of Circumvallation about you of <hi>Dialectick</hi> Clauses, and the <hi>formulas</hi> of his <hi>Art.</hi> Now who would not enter into distrust of Sciences, and doubt whether he can reap from them any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Fruit for the service of Life; considering the use we put them to? <hi>Nihil sanantibus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris.</hi> Who has got Understanding by his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick?

I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that in <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon, Socrates</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes more in favour of Disputants, than in favour of the Dispute, and more to instruct <hi>Euthydemus</hi> and <hi>Protagoras</hi> in the knowledge of their Impertinence, than in the Impertinence of their Art. He takes hold of the first Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, like one that has a more profitable end than to explain it, namely, to clear the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that he takes upon him to instruct and exercise. To hunt after Truth is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our business, and we are inexcusable if we carry on the Chace impertinently and ill: to fail of seizing it, is another thing. For we are born to inquire after <hi>Truth,</hi> it belongs to a greater power to possess it. It is not, as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> said, hid in the bottom of the Deeps; but rather elevated to an infinite height in the Divine knowledge. The World is but a School of Inquisition. It is not who shall carry the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53645:838" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Ring,</hi> but who shall run the best <hi>Courses.</hi> He may as well play the fool who speaks true, as he that speaks false<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for we are upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not the matter of speaking. 'Tis my humour, as much to regard the <hi>form</hi> as the <hi>substance,</hi> and the <hi>Advocates,</hi> as much as the <hi>Cause</hi>; as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> order'd we should: and every day pass away my time in reading <hi>Authors,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any consideration of their Learning; their Method is what I look after, not their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; how, not what they write: And just so do I hunt after the conversation of any eminent Wit, not that he may teach me, but that I may know him; and that being acquainted, if I think him worthy of imitation, I may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him. Every man may speak truly, but methodically, and prudently, and fully, is a talent that few men have. The <hi>falsity</hi> also that proceeds from Ignorance does not offend me, but the <hi>foppery</hi> of it. I have broken off seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treaties that would have been of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to me, by reason of the impertinence of those with whom I treated. I am not mov'd once in a year at the faults of those over whom I have authority; but upon the account of the ridiculous obstinacy of their Excuses, we are every day going together by the ears: They neither understand what is said, nor why, and answer accordingly, which would make a man mad. I never feel any hurt upon my Head, but when 'tis knock'd against another, and more easily forgive the Vices of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than their boldness, importunity, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53645:838" rendition="simple:additions"/>
folly. Let them do less, provided they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they do. You live in hopes to warm their affection to your Service; but there is nothing to be had, or to be hop'd for from a stock. But what if I take things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than they are? perhaps I do: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I accuse my own impatience; and hold in the first place, that it is equally vicious both in him that is in the right, and him that is in the wrong; for 'tis always a tyrannick soureness, not to endure a form contrary to ones own: and besides, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in truth be a greater, more constant, nor more irregular folly, than to be mov'd and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the follies of the World; for it princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally makes us quarrel with our selves, and the old <hi>Philosopher</hi> never wanted occasion for his tears, whilst he consider'd himself. <hi>Miso,</hi>

I do not say, that no man should accuse who is not clean himself, for then no one would ever accuse, because none is absolutely clean from the same sort of spot; but I mean, that our Judgment, falling upon another whose name is then in question, does not at the same time spare our selves, but sentences us with an inward and severe authority. 'Tis an office of Charity, that he who cannot reclaim himself from a Vice, should nevertheless endeavour to remove it from another, in whom peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it may not have so deep and so malignant a root. Neither do I think it an answer to the purpose, to tell him, who reproves me for my fault, that he himself is guilty of the same. What by that? The reproof is notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, and of very good use. Had we a good Nose, our own ordure would stink worse to us, forasmuch as it is our own. And <hi>Socrates</hi> is of opinion, that whoever should find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his Son, and a stranger guilty of any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and wrong, ought to begin with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53645:840" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to present himself first to the Sentence of Justice, and implore, to purge himself, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the hand of the Executioner; in the next place he should proceed to his Son, and lastly, to the Stranger. If this Precept seem too severe, he ought at least to present himself the first to the Punishment of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The Senses are our proper and first Judges, which perceive not things but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Accidents; and 'tis no wonder, if in all the parts of the Service of our Society, there is so perpetual and universal a mixture of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and superficial Apparences; insomuch that the best and most effectual part of our Policies do therein consist: 'Tis still man with whom we have to do, of whom the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wonderfully Corporal. Let those, who of these late years would erect for us such a contemplative and immaterial an Exercise of Religion, not wonder if there be some who think it had vanish'd and melted through their Fingers, had it not more upheld it self amongst us as a Mark, Title, and Instrument of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Faction, than by it self. As in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Gravity, Robes, and Fortune of him that speaks, oft-times gives Reputation to vain Arguments and idle Words; it is not to be presum'd, but that a man so attended and fear'd, has in him more than ordinary Sufficiency; and that he to whom the <hi>King</hi> has given so many Offices and Commissions, so supercilious and proud, has not a great deal more in him, than another that salutes him at so great a distance,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53645:840" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and who has no Employment at all. Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Words, but the sour looks also of these People are considered and recorded; every one making it his Business to give them some fine and solid Interpretation. If they stoop to common Conference, and that you offer any thing but Approbation and Reverence, they then knock you down with the Authority of their Experience; they have heard, they have seen, they have done so and so, you are crush'd with Examples. I should tell them, that the Fruit of a <hi>Chirurgions</hi> Experience, is not the <hi>History</hi> of his Practices, and his remembring that he has cur'd four People of the <hi>Plague,</hi> and three of the <hi>Gout,</hi> unless he knows how from hence to extract something whereon to form his Judgement, and to make us sensible that he is become more skilful in his Art. As in a Consort of Instruments, we do not hear a <hi>Lute,</hi> a <hi>Harpsical,</hi> or a <hi>Flute</hi> alone, but one intire Harmony of all together. If Travel and Offices have improv'd them, 'tis a product of their Understanding to make it appear. 'Tis not enough to reckon Experiments, they must weigh and sort them, digest and distill them, to extract the Reasons and Conclusions they carry along with them. There were never so many <hi>Historians.</hi> It is indeed good, and of use to read them; for they furnish us every where with excellent and laudable Instructions from the Magazine of their Memory, which doubtless is of great concern to the relief of Life; but 'tis not that we seek for now: we

Peradventure we esteem and look upon them for less than they are, by reason they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more, and more expose themselves; they do not answer the charge they have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. There must be more Vigour and Strength in the Bearer, than the Burthen; he who has not lifted as much as he can, leaves you to ghess, that he has still a Strength beyond that; and that he has not been try'd to the utmost of what he is able to do; He who sinks under his load, makes a discovery of his best, and the weakness of his Shoulders.

The Event does often justifie a very foolish Conduct. Our interposition is nothing more than as it were a running on by rote, and more commonly a Consideration of Custom and Example, than of Reason. Being astonish'd at the Greatness of the Execution, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been acquainted with their Motives and Address, by those who had perform'd it, and have found nothing in it, but very ordinary Counsels; and the most vulgar and useful are also perhaps the most sure and convenient for practice, if not for show.

Let a man but observe who are of greatest Authority in Cities, and who best do their own business, we shall find that they are commonly men of the least Parts: Women, Children, and mad-men have had the fortune to govern great <hi>Kingdoms</hi> equally well with the wisest <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>: and <hi>Thucydides</hi> says, that the stupid more frequently do it than those of better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.

Wherefore I say, that in all sorts of Fortune Events are a very poor testimony of our worth and Parts. Now I was upon this point, that there needs no more, but to see a man promoted to Dignity, though we knew him but three dayes before a man of no regard; yet an image of Grandeur, and some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Parts insensibly steals into our opinion, and we persuade our selves, that being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Reputation and Attendants, he is also increas'd in Merit. We judge of him not according to his value, but as we do by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, according to the prerogative of his Place. If it happen so that he fall again, and be mix'd with the common crowd, every one inquires with admiration into the cause of his having been rais'd so high. <hi>Is it he?</hi> say they, <hi>could he make no better provision for himself when he was in place? Do Princes satisfie themselves with so little? Really we were in good hands.</hi> This is a thing that I have often seen in my time. Nay, so much as the very disguises of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs represented in our <hi>Comedies,</hi> does in some sort move and deceive us. That which I my self adore in Kings, is, the Crowd of their Adorers. All Reverence and Submission is due to them, except that of the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:

my Reason is not oblig'd to bow and bend, my Knees are. <hi>Melanthius</hi> being ask'd, what he thought of the Tragedy of <hi>Dionysius</hi>? I could not see't, said he, it was so clouded with Language: so the most of those who judge of the Discourses of great men, ought to say, I did not understand his words, he was so clouded with Gravity, Majesty, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> one day intreated the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to give order that their Asses might as well be employ'd in tilling the ground as the Horses were: To which it was answer'd, that those Animals were not destin'd for such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>That's all one,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>it only sticks at your command</hi>: for the most ignorant and incapable men you employ in your Commands of War, immediately become worthy enough because you employ them. To which, the Custom of so many People who Canonize the <hi>Kings</hi> they have chosen out of their own Body, and are not content only to honour, but adore them, comes very near.<note place="margin">Deification and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
                        </note> Those of <hi>Mexico,</hi> after the Ceremonies of his Coronation, dare no more presume to look him in the face; but, as if they had <hi>deified</hi> him by his <hi>Royalty,</hi> amongst the Oaths they make him take to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> to be valiant, just, and mild, he moreover swears to make the <hi>Sun</hi> run his Course in his wonted Light, to drain the Clouds at a fit Season, to confine Rivers within their Channels, and to cause all things necessary for his People to be landed upon the Earth. I differ from this common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53645:845" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and am more apt to suspect his Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when I see it accompanied with that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of Fortune and publick Applause. We are to consider, of what advantage it is to speak when he pleases, to chuse the Subject he will speak of, to interrupt or change other mens Arguments with a Magisterial Authority; to protect himself from the oppositions of others by a nod, a smile, or silence, in the presence of an Assembly that trembles with reverence and respect. A man of a prodigious Fortune, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to give his Judgment upon some slight Dispute that was foolishly set on foot at his Table, begun in these words, <hi>It can be no other but a Lyar or a Fool, that will say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than so and so.</hi> Pursue this philosophical Point with a Dagger in your hand. There is another Observation I have made, from which I draw great advantage; which is, that in Conferences and Disputes, every word that seems to be good is not immediately to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Most men are rich in borrow'd Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, without understanding the force of them themselves. That a man does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly understand all he borrows, may perhaps be verified in my self. A man must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways presently yield, what truth or beauty so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may seem to be in the Argument. Either a man must stoutly oppose it, or retire, under colour of not understanding it, to try on all parts how it is lodg'd in the Author. It may happen that we may run upon the point, and meet the truth that we could not otherwise
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53645:845" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reach. I have sometimes, in the necessity and heat of the Combat, made falsifies that have gone through and through, beyond my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and design. I only gave them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they were receiv'd in weight. As when I contend with a vigorous man, I please my self with anticipating his conclusions, I ease him of the trouble of explaining himself; I strive to prevent his Imagination, whilst it is yet spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and imperfect: the Order and Pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Understanding, warns and threatens me afar off: I deal quite contrary with these; I must understand, and presuppose nothing but by them. If they determine in general words, <hi>this is good, that is naught,</hi> and that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be in the right, see if it be not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that hits it off for them. Let them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle circumscribe and limit their Judgment, why, or how it is so. These universal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I see so common, signifie nothing. These are men that salute a whole People in a crowd together; They who have a real ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, take notice of, and salute them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and by name. But 'tis a hazardous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and from which I have more than eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day seen it fall out, that weak Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, having a mind to appear ingenious, in taking notice, as they read a Book, of that is best, and most to be admir'd, fix their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon something so very ill chosen, that instead of making us discern the excellency of the Author, they make us see their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. This exclamation is safe enough, <hi>This
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53645:846" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is fine,</hi> after having heard a whole Page of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>: and by that the cunning sort of Fools save themselves. But to undertake to follow him line by line, and with an expert and approv'd judgement, to observe where a good Author excells himself, weighing the Words, Phrases, Inventions and various Excellencies, one after another;<note place="margin">

Offic. lib.</hi> 1.</note> take heed of that, <hi>Videndum est, non modo, quid quisque loquatur, sed etiam, quid quisque sentiat, atque etiam qua de causa quisque sentiat. A man is not only to examine what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one sayes, but also what every one thinks, and for what reason every one thinks.</hi> I every day hear Coxcombs say things that are not foolish: They say a good thing, let us examine how far they understand it, whence they have it, and what they mean by it. We help them to make use of this fine Expression, of this fine Sentence, which is none of theirs, they only have it in keeping; they have spit it out at a venture, we bring it for them into credit and esteem. You take them by the hand when you see them falling. To what purpose? They do not think themselves oblig'd to you for it, and become more fools still. Never take their part, let them alone; they will handle the matter like People who are afraid of burning their fingers, they neither dare change its seat nor light, nor break into it, shake it never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it slips through their fingers; they give up their cause, be it never so strong, or good however. These are fine Arms, but ill hasted. How many times have I seen the experience?
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53645:846" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now if you come to explain any thing to them, and to confirm them, they presently catch at it, and presently rob you of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of your interpretation; <hi>It was what I was about to say; it was just my conceit, and if I did not express it so, it was for want of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi> Very pretty! Malice it self must be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to correct this proud Ignorance. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias</hi> his Doctrine, that we are neither to hate, nor accuse, but instruct, has reason elsewhere; But here 'tis injustice and inhumanity, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and set him right who stands in no need on't, and is the worse for't. I love to let them step deeper into the dirt; and so deep, that if it be possible, they may at last discern their errour.<note place="margin">Folly not to be cur'd by Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> Folly and absurdity are not to be cur'd by bare Admonition. And what <hi>Cyrus</hi> answer'd to him, who importun'd him to <hi>harangue</hi> his Army, upon the point of Battel, that men do not become valiant and warlike upon a sudden, by a fine Oration, no more than a man becomes a good Musician by hearing a fine Song, may properly be said of such an Admonition as this. These are Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice-ships that are to be serv'd before-hand, by a long and continu'd Education. We owe this care, and this assiduity of Correction and Instruction to our own; but to go preach to the first passer by, and to Lord it over the Ignorance and Folly of the first we meet, is a thing that I abhor. I rarely do it, even in particular conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and rather surrender my cause, than proceed to these supercilious and magisterial instructions.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53645:847" rendition="simple:additions"/>
My humour is unfit either to speak or write for Beginner; but for things that are said in common Discourse, or amongst other things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I never oppose them, either by word or sign, how false or absurd soever. As to the rest, nothing vexes me so ill in Folly, as that it pleases it self more than any Reason can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably please it self. 'Tis ill luck, that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forbids us to satisfie and trust in our selves, and always dismisses us timorous and discontent; whereas Obstinacy and Temerity fill those who are possess'd with them with joy and assurance. 'Tis for the ignorant to look at other men over the shoulder, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways returning from the combat full of Joy and Triumph. And moreover, for the most part, this arrogancy of Speech and gaiety of Countenance gives them the better of it in the opinion of the Audience, which is commonly ignorant, and incapable of well judging and discerning the real advantage. Obstinacy of Opinion,<note place="margin">Obstinacy a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> and heat in Argument are the surest proofs of Folly. Is there any thing so assur'd, resolute, disdainful, contemplative, serious and grave as an Ass? may we not mix with the title of Conference and Communication, the quick and sharp Reparties which Mirth and Familiarity introduces amongst Friends, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly and wittily jesting with one another? An exercise for which my natural gayety ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me fit enough; which, if it be not too long and serious, as the other I spoke of but now, 'tis no less smart and ingenious, nor of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53645:847" rendition="simple:additions"/>
less utility, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> thought. For my part, I contribute to it more Liberty than Wit, and have therein more of Luck than Invention; but I am perfect in suffering, for I endure a Revenge, that is not only tart, but indiscreet to boot, without being mov'd at all. And whoever attaques me, if I have not a brisk answer immediately ready, I do not study to pursue the Point with a tedious and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Contest, bordering upon Obstinacy, but let it pass, and deferr my revenge to another, and some better time. There is no Merchant that always gets. Most men change their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and their Voice where their Wits fail, and by an unseasonable Indignation, instead of revenging themselves, accuse at once their own Folly and Impatience. In this Jollity we sometimes pinch the private strings of our Imperfection, which, at another time, when more temperate, we cannot touch without offence, and profitably give one another a hint of our Defects. There are other Sports of Hand, rude and indiscreet, after the French manner, that I mortally hate; my skin is very tender and sensible: I have in my time seen two Princes of the Blood <hi>Interr'd</hi> upon that very account. 'Tis unhandsome to fall out, and fight in play. As to the rest, when I have a mind to judge of any one, I ask him how much he is contented with himself, to what degree his speaking or his work pleases him. I will none of these fine excuses, <hi>I did it only in sport</hi>:

Is it this part or that? the Grace, or the Matter, the Invention, the Judgment, or the Learning? For I find that men are commonly as wide of the mark in judging of their own Works, as those of others; not only by reason of the kindness they have for them, but for want of capacity to know and distinguish them. The Work, by its own Force and fortune, may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the Workman, and sometimes out-strip him, beyond his Invention and Knowledge. For my part, I do not judge of the value of other mens Works more obscurely than of my own; and prize my Essays now high, now low, with great doubt and inconstancy. There are several Books that are useful upon the account of their Subjects, from which the Author derives no praise; and good Books, as well as good Works, that shame the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53645:849" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not his own, how much we are oblig'd to him for the Choice, Disposition, Ornament, and Language he has there presented us with. What if he has borrow'd the matter, and spoil'd the form? as it oft falls out; we who are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle read in Books are in this straight, that when we meet with a great Fancy in some new <hi>Poet,</hi> or some strong Argument in a Preacher, we dare not nevertheless commend it, till we have first inform'd our selves of some learned man, if it be his own, or borrow'd from some other; untill that, I always stand upon my Guard. I came lately from reading the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Tacitus</hi> quite thorough, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting it with any thing else; (which but seldom happens with me, it being twenty years since I have stuck to any one Book an hour together,) and I did it at the instance of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for whom <hi>France</hi> has a great esteem, as well for his own particular Worth, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of a constant form of Capacity and Virtue, which runs thorough a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brothers of them. I do not know any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that in a publick Narration, mixes so much Consideration of Manners, and particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. And I am of a quite contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to him,<note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
                        </note> which is, that being especially to follow the Lives of the Emperours of his time, so various and extream in all sorts of forms, and so many notable Actions as their Cruelty particularly produc'd in their Subjects, he had a stronger and more attracting matter to treat of, than if he had been to discribe Battels, and universal Commotions: so that I oft find him
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53645:849" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sterile, running over those brave Deaths, as if he fear'd to trouble us with their multitude and length. This form of <hi>Histories</hi> is by much the most useful: publick Commotions depend most upon the Conduct of <hi>Fortune,</hi> private ones upon our own. 'Tis rather a Judgment, than a Deduction of <hi>History</hi>; there are in it more <hi>Precepts</hi> than <hi>Stories</hi>: it is not a Book to read, 'tis a Book to study and learn; 'tis so full of Sentences, that right or wrong, they are there in muster: 'tis a Nursery of <hi>Ethicks</hi> and <hi>politick Discourses,</hi> for the Use and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those who have any place in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World. He always pleads by strong and solid Reasons, after a tart and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle manner, according to the affected style of that Age; and was so in love with a sound style, that where quickness and subtilty was wanting in things, he supplied them with lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and swelling words. It is not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the style of <hi>Seneca.</hi> I look upon <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> as more sinewy, and <hi>Seneca</hi> more sharp. His Pen seems most proper for a troubled and sick Estate, as ours at present is; you would often say, that he deciphers and girds at us. They who doubt of his Fidelity, sufficiently accuse themselves of being his Enemy upon some other account. His Opinions are sound, and lean for the most part towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Affairs: And yet I am angry at him, for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more severely of <hi>Pompey,</hi> than suited with the Opinion of those worthy men that liv'd in the same time, and treated with him; and to have reputed him equal with <hi>Marius</hi> and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53645:850"/>
                        <hi>Sylla,</hi> excepting that he was more close. Other <hi>Writers</hi> have not acquitted his intention in the government of Affairs, from ambition nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and even his Friends were afraid that his Victory would have transported him beyond the bounds of Reason, but not to so immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable a degree: there is nothing in his Life that has threatned us with so express Cruelty and Tyranny. Neither ought we to proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Suspition to Evidence; and that makes me that I do not believe his Narratives to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and true; but that he might add a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this very thing, that they are not always apply'd to the Conclusions of his Judgments, which he follows according to the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he has taken, very often beyond the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he treats of, which he will not design to look upon with so much as one glance of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. He needs no excuse, for having approv'd the Religion of his time, according as the Laws enjoyn'd, and to have been ignorant of the true; this was his Misfortune, not his Fault. I have principally consider'd his Judgment, and am not very well satisfied throughout; as these Words in the Letter,<note place="margin">

What shall I write to you, Sirs, or how should I write to you, or what should I not write to you at this time? May the Gods and the Goddesses lay a worse Punishment upon me, than I am every day tormented with, if I know.</hi> I do not see why he should so posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively apply them to the sharp Remorses that tormented the Conscience of <hi>Tyberius</hi>: at least,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53645:850" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when I was in the same Condition, I perceiv'd no such thing. And this also seem'd to me a little mean in him, that being to say, that he had borne honourable Offices in <hi>Rome,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses himself, that he does not speak it out of Ostentation: this seems a little too mean for such a Soul as his; for, not to speak round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a mans self, implies some want of Courage; a rough and lofty Judgment, and that judges soundly and surely, makes use of his own Example upon all Occasions, as well as those of others, and gives Evidence as freely of himself, as of a third Person: we are to pass by these common Rules of Civility in favour of Truth, and Liberty. I dare not only speak of my self, but speak only of my self. When I write of any thing else, I miss my way, and wander from my Subject; yet am I not so indiscreetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd of my self, that I cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and consider my self apart, as I do a Neighbour, or a Tree. 'Tis equally a Fault, not to discern how far a man's worth extends, and to say more than a man discovers in himself. We owe more love to <hi>God,</hi> than to our <hi>selves,</hi> and know him less; and yet speak of him as much as we will. If the writings of <hi>Tacitus</hi> relate any thing true of his Qualities, he was a great man, upright and bold, not of a superstitious, but a philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and generous Virtue. A man may think him a little too bold in his Relations; as where he tells us, that a Souldier carrying a

I present my self standing, and lying on my face, my back, my right side, and my left, and in all my natural Postures. Wits, though equal in force, are not always equal in taste and application.

                     <p>THere is peradventure no more manifest Vanity, than to write so vainly. That which Divinity has so divinely express'd to us, ought to be carefully and continually medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by understanding men. Who does not see that I have taken a Road, in which, incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without labour I shall proceed, so long as there shall be Ink and Paper in the World? I can give no account of my Life by my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Fortune has plac'd them too low: I must do it by my Fancies. And yet I have seen a Gentleman that only communicated his Life by
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53645:852" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the workings of his Belly: you might see in his House a shew of a row of Basons of seven or eight days Excrements; that was all his Study, all his Discourse; all other talk stunk in his Nostrils. These here, but not so nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are the Excrements of an old Mind, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thick, sometimes thin, and always indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested; and when shall I have done represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the continual agitation and mutation of my Thoughts, as they come into my Head, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Diomedes</hi> writ six thousand Books upon the sole subject of <hi>Grammar</hi>? What then ought prating to produce, since pratling, and the first beginning to speak, stuff'd the World with such a horrible number of Volumes? So many words about words only. O <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> why didst not thou allay the Tempest! They accus'd one <hi>Galba</hi> of old for living idly; he made answer, <hi>That every one ought to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his actions, but not of his leisure.</hi> He was mistaken, for <hi>Justice</hi> takes Cognizance, and will have an account even of those that Glean, which is one of the lasiest Employments. But there should be some restraint of Law against foolish and impertinent Scriblers, as well as against Vagabonds and idle Persons; which, if there was, both I and a hundred others would be banish'd the Kingdom. I do not speak this in jest: Scribling seems to be a sign of a disordered and licencious Age. When did we write so much as since our <hi>Civil Wars</hi>? When the <hi>Romans</hi> so much, as when their <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> was upon the point of Ruin?
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53645:852" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Besides that, the refining of Wits does not make People wiser in a Government: this idle Employment springs from this, that every one applies himself negligently to the duty of his vocation, and is easily debauch'd from it. The Corruption of the Age is made up upon the particular Contribution of every individual man. One contributes Treachery, others Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Irreligion, Tyranny, Avarice and Cruelty, according as they are of Power, the weaker sort contribute Folly, Vanity, and Idleness, of which I am one. It seems as if it were the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for vain things when the hurtful oppress us; and that in a time when doing ill is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to do nothing but what signifies nothing is a kind of Commendation. 'Tis my comfort, that I shall be one of the last that shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question; and whilst the greater Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders are calling to account, I shall have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to amend: for it would, methinks, be against reason to punish little Inconveniencies, whilst we are infected with the greater. As the Physician <hi>Philotimus</hi> said to one who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him his Finger to dress, and who he perceived, both by his Complexion and his Breath, had an Ulcer in his Lungs: <hi>Friend,</hi> said he, <hi>it is not now time to concern your self about your fingers ends.</hi> And yet I saw, some years ago, a Person whose Name and Memory I have in very great Esteem, in the very height of our great Disorders, when there was neither Law nor Justice put in Execution, nor Magistrate that perform'd his Office, no more
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53645:853" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than there is now, publish I know not what pitiful Reformations, about Cloths, Cookery, and long depending Suits in Law. These are amusements wherewith to feed a People that are ill us'd, to shew that they are not totally forgot. These others do the same, who insist upon stoutly defending the Forms of Speaking, Dances, and Games, to a People totally aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to all sort of execrable Vices. 'Tis no time to bathe and cleanse a man's self when he is seiz'd on by a violent Fever. 'Tis for the <hi>Spartiates</hi> only to fall to combing and curling themselves when they are just upon the point of running head-long into some extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Life. For my part, I have yet a worse Custom, that if my Shoe go awry, I let my Shirt and my Cloak do so too, I scorn to mend my self by halves: when I am lean, I feed upon mischief; I abandon my self through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair; let my self go towards the Precipice, and, as the Saying is, <hi>Throw the Helve after the Hatchet.</hi> I am obstinate in growing worse, and think my self no more worth my own care; I am either good or ill throughout. 'Tis a favour to me, that the Desolation of this Kingdom falls out in the Desolation of my Age: I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suffer that my <hi>ills</hi> be multiplied, than if my <hi>goods</hi> had been disturb'd. The words I utter in mishap, are words of spite. My Courage sets up its bristles instead of letting them down; and, contrary to others, I am more devout in good than in evil Fortune<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> according to the Precept of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> if not according to

his Reason, and am more ready to turn up my Eyes to Heaven to return my thanks than to crave; I am more sollicitous to improve my Health when I am well, than to restore it when I am sick. Prosperities are the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Instruction to me, that Adversities and Persecutions are to others: as if good Fortune were a thing inconsistent with good Conscience; men never grow good, but in evil. Good Fortune is to me a singular spur to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and moderation. An intreaty wins, a threat checks me, favour makes me bend, fear stiffens me. Amongst humane Conditions, this is common enough, to be better pleased with strange things than our own, and to love Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Change.<note place="margin">Change pleasing to men.</note>

'Tis not in the value of Possessions, but in our Diet and Clothing that our Riches are truly limited.</hi> My real need does not so wholly take up all I have, that Fortune has not whereon to fasten her teeth without biting to the quick. My Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as contemptible as it is, does me great Service in my domestick Affairs; I employ my self in them, but it goes against the hair, considering that I have this in my House, that though I burn my Candle at one end by my self, the other is not spared. <hi>Journeys</hi> do me no harm but only by their Expence, which is great, and more than I am well able to bear; being always wont to Travel with not only a necessary, but a handsom Equipage. I must make them so much shorter and fewer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I spend but the froth, and what I have reserv'd for such Uses, delaying and deferring my Motion till that be ready. I will not, that the Pleasure of going abroad spoil the Pleasure of being retir'd at home. On the contrary, I intend they shall nourish and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one another. <hi>Fortune</hi> has assisted me in this, that since my principal Profession in this Life, was to live at ease, and rather idly than busily; she has depriv'd me of the necessity of growing Rich, to provide for the multitude of my <hi>Heirs.</hi> If there be not enough for one, of that whereof I had so plentifully enough, at his peril be it.

according to the Example of <hi>Phocion,</hi> provides sufficiently for his Children, who so provides for them, as to leave them as much as was left him. I should by no means like of <hi>Crates</hi> his way. He left his Money in the hands of a <hi>Banker,</hi> with this Condition; that if his Children were Fools, he should then give it to them; if witty, he should then distribute it to the most Fools of the People. As if Fools, for being less capable of living without Riches, were more capable of using them. So it is, that the dammage which is occasion'd by my absence, seems not to deserve, so long as I am able to support it, that I should wave the occasions of diverting my self from that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom assistance. There is always something that goes amiss. The Affairs one while of one House and then of another will tear you to pieces. You pry into every thing too near; your Perspicacity does you hurt here as well as in other things. I steal away from occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vexing my self, and turn from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things that go amiss; and yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so order it, but that every hour I justle against something or other that displeases me. And the Tricks that they most conceal from me, are those that I the soonest come to know. Some there are that a man himself must help to conceal. Vain Vexations, vain sometimes, but always Vexations. The smallest and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Impediments are the most piercing: and as little Letters most tire the Eyes, so do little Affairs the most disturb us. A rout of little

I have a thousand things to desire and to fear. To give them quite over is very easie for me to do: but to look after them without trouble is very hard. 'Tis a miserable thing to be in place where every thing you see employs and concerns you. And I fancy that I more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enjoy the Pleasures of another man's House, and with greater and a purer relish than those of my own. <hi>Diogenes,</hi> according to my Humour, answer'd him who ask'd him what sort of Wine he lik'd the best, <hi>That of anothers,</hi> said he. My Father took a delight in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Montaigne,</hi> where he was born, and in all the Government of domestick Affairs, I love to follow his Example and Rules; and shall engage those who are to succeed me, as much as in me lies, to do the same. Could I do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, I would; and am proud that his Will is still performing and acting by me. <hi>God</hi> forbid, that in my hands I should ever suffer any image of Life, that I am able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to so good a Father, to fail. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

I have taken in hand to finish some old Foundations of Walls, and to repair some rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Buildings, in earnest I have done it more out of respect to his Design, than my own Satisfaction; and am angry at my self, that I have not proceeded further to finish the Foundation he has left in my House; and so much the more, because I am very likely to be the last Possessor of my Race, and to give the last hand to it. For, as to my own particular Application, neither the Pleasure of Building, which they say is so bewitching, nor Hunting, nor Gardens, nor the other Pleasures of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd Life, can much trouble my Head. And 'tis what I am angry at my self for, as I am for all other Opinions that are incommodious to me; which I would not so much care to have vigorous and learned, as I would have them easie and convenient for Life. They are true and sound enough, if they are profitable and pleasing. Such as hear me declare my Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Husbandry, whisper in my Ear, that it is disdain, and that I neglect to know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of Husbandry, its Seasons, and Order; how they order my Vines, how they graft, and to know the names and forms of Herbs and Fruits, and the dressing the Meat by which I live, with the names and prizes of the Stuffs I wear, because I have set my Heart upon some higher Knowledge; they kill me in saying so. This is Folly, and rather Brutishness than Glory; I had rather be a good Horse-man than a good Logician.

I had rather be told at two months end, that I have spent four hundred Crowns, than to have my Ears beaten every night with three, five, and seven: And I have been this way as little robb'd as another. It is true, I am willing enough not to see it; I do in some sort in good earnest harbour a kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, uncertain knowledge of my Money: for to a certain proportion, I am content to doubt. One must leave a little room for the Infidelity or Indiscretion of a Servant, if you have enough in gross to do your business, let the over-plus of Fortunes Liberality run a little more freely at her Mercy; 'tis the Glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Portion.

delight a man's self with handling and telling it! 'Tis by that, that Avarice makes its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Of eighteen years that I have had my Estate in my own hands, I could never prevail with my self, either to read over my Deeds, or examine my principal Affairs, which ought of Necessity to pass thorough my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and Inspection. 'Tis not a Philosophical disdain of worldly and transitory things, my taste is not purified to that degree, and I value them at as great a rate at least as they are worth; but 'tis in truth an inexcusable and childish Laziness and Negligence. What would I not rather do than read an Evidence? and sooner, than as a Slave to my own business, to tumble over a company of old musty Writings? or which is worse, those of another man, as so many do now a days to get Money? I have nothing dear but care and trouble, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nothing so much as to be careless and at ease. I had been much fitter, I believe, could it have been without Obligation and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to have liv'd upon another man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than my own: And also I do not know, when I examine it nearer, whether according to my Humour, what I have to suffer from my Affairs and Servants, have not in it something more abject, troublesom, and tormenting, than there would be in serving a man better born than my self, that would govern me with a gentle rein,<note place="margin">

When absent from home, I strip my self of all these thoughts, and should be less concern'd for the ruin of a Tower, than I am, when present, at the fall of a Tile. My mind is easily compos'd at distance, but suffers as much as that of the meanest Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant when I am in place.

I am at home responsible for what ever goes amiss.

The most ridiculous carriage of a Gentleman in his own House, is to see him bustling about the business of the House, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering one Servant, and looking an angry look at another.

more than abundance, and at home have an exact regard to necessity, little to outward shew.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53645:860" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the laying out my Money; which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of by one single Precept. Too many things are required to the raking it together; in that I understand nothing; in spending it I understand a little, and how to give day to my Expences, which is indeed its principal Use. But I rely too proudly upon it, which renders it unequal and difform, and moreover immoderate, in both the one and the other usage. If it makes a shew, if it serve the turn, I indiscreetly let it run, and as indiscreetly tye up my Purse-strings if it does not shine and please. Whatever it be, whether <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> that imprint in us the condition of Living by the Example of others, it does us much more harm than good. We deprive our selves of our proper Utilities, to accomodate apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the common Opinion. We care not so much what our Being is, as to us, and in reality, as what it is to the publick Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Even the goods of the Mind, and <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> it self, seem fruitless to us, if only enjoy'd by our selves, and if it produce not it self to the view and approbation of others. There is a sort of men whose Gold runs in streams im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly under ground; others expose it all in Plates and Branches, so that to the one a <note n="*" place="margin">A piece of Copper Money worth three Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</note>

In fine, I see by our Example, that the Society of men is maintain'd and held together at what price soever; in what condition soever they are plac'd, they will still close and stick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both moving and in heaps; as uneven Bodies, that shuffled together without order, find of themselves a means to unite and settle, often better than they could have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Art. King <hi>Philip</hi> muster'd up a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the most wicked and incorrigible Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals he could pick out, and put them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a City he had caused to be built for that purpose, which bore their Name. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they, even from Vices themselves, ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Government amongst them, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modius and just Society. I see not one Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or three, or an hundred, but Manners, in common and receiv'd Use, so cruel, especially in Inhumanity and Treachery, which are to me the worst of all Vices, that I have not the heart to think of them without horror; and almost as much admire as I detest them. The exercise of these notorious Villanies carry with them as great signs of vigour and force of Soul, as of errour and disorder. Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reconciles and brings men together; and this accidental Connexion afterwards forms it self into Laws: For there have been as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ones as any Humane Opinion could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, which nevertheless have maintain'd their

a State. Whoever would aim directly at a cure, and would consider of it before he begun, would be very willing to withdraw his hands from medling in it. <hi>Pacuvius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavius</hi> corrected the Vice of this proceeding by a notable Example. His Fellow <hi>Citizens</hi> were in mutiny against their <hi>Magistrates,</hi> he being a man of great Authority in the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> found means one day to shut up the Senators in the Palace, and calling the People together in the Market place, there told them, that the day was now come, wherein at full Liberty they might revenge themselves on the <hi>Tyrants</hi> by whom they had been so long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd; and who he had now all alone, and unarm'd at his Mercy: advising them withall, that they should call them out one by one by Lot; and should particularly determine of every one, causing whatever should be decree'd to be immediately executed; with this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also, that they should at the same time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute some honest man in the place of him that was condemn'd, to the end there might be no vacancy in the <hi>Senate.</hi> They had no sooner heard the name of one <hi>Senator,</hi> but that a great cry of universal dislike was rais'd up against him. I see, says <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> that this must out, he is a wicked Fellow, let us look out a good one in his room; immediately there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found silence, every one being at a stand whom to choose. But one, more impudent than the rest, having nam'd his man, there arose yet a greater consent of Voices against him, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53645:864" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Imperfections being laid to his charge, and as many just reasons being presently given why he should not stand. These contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humours growing hot, it far'd worse with the second Senator and the third, there being as much disagreement in the Election of the new, as consent in the putting out of the old. In the end, growing weary of this bustle to no purpose, they began some one way, and some another, to steal out of the Assembly; every one carrying back this Resolution in his mind, that the oldest and best known Evil was ever more supportable than one that was new and untried. To see how miserably we are torn in pieces: for what have we not done?

we are not however peradventure at the last
gasp. The Conservation of States is a thing that in all likelihood surpasses our Understanding. A Civil Government, is, as <hi>Plato</hi> says, a mighty and puissant thing, and so hard to be dissolv'd, that it continues many times against mortal and intestine Diseases, against the Injury of unjust Laws, against Tyranny, the Corruption and Ignorance of Magistrates, and the Licence and Sedition of the People. We compare our selves in all our Fortunes to what is above us, and still look towards the better: but let us mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our selves with what is below us, there is no Condition so miserable, wherein a man may not find a thousand Examples that will admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Consolation. 'Tis our Vice that we more unwillingly look upon what is above, than willingly what is below: and <hi>Solon</hi> was us'd to say, that whoever would make an heap of all ills together, there is no one who would not rather choose to bear away the ills he has, than to come to an equal Division with all other men from that heap, and take with him from thence so much as would upon the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fall to his particular share.

Who knows but that <hi>God</hi> will have it happen, as it does in humane Bodies, that purge and restore themselves to a better estate by long and grievous Maladies; which restores them a more intire and perfect Health than that they took from them? That which weighs the most with me, is, that in reckoning the symptoms of our ill, I see as many natural ones, and that Heaven sends us, and properly its own, as of those that our disorder and humane imprudence contribute to it.

opportunity to think of what they have to say, to avoid all preparations, for fear of tying my self to some obligation upon which I must be forc'd to insist. To be ty'd and bound to a thing puts me quite out, and to depend upon so weak an Instrument as my Memory.

His astonishment and silence serv'd them for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. For having had so much leisure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himself in Prison, they concluded that it was not his Memory that fail'd him, but that his Conscience ty'd up his Tongue, and stop'd his Mouth. This was very well said. The Place, the Assistants, and the expectation asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him even at the time when it stood him upon to speak the best he could.

it, that it sinks under me, and I suppress it with the burthen. So much as I trust to it, so much do I put my self out of my own power, so much as to find it in my own Countenance; and have been sometimes very much put to't to conceal the slavery wherein I was engag'd; whereas my design is, to manifest in speaking a perfect negligence both of face and accent; and casual and unpremeditated motions, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from present occasions, chusing rather to say nothing to purpose, than to shew that I came prepared to speak well, a thing especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unbecoming a man of my Profession, and of great obligation to him that cannot retain much; the preparation begets a great deal more expectation than it will satisfie.

for as to speaking, when a man reads his Speech, besides that it is very absurd, it is a mighty disadvantage to those who naturally could give it a Grace by action; and to rely upon the mercy of my present Invention, I will much less do it; 'tis heavy and perplext, and such as would never furnish me in sudden and important Necessities. Permit, Reader, this Essay its course also, and this sitting to finish the rest of my Picture. I add, but I correct not; first, because I conceive, that a man having once parted with his Labours to the World, he has no farther right to them; let him do better if he can in some new Undertaking, but not adulterate what he has already sold; of such dealers nothing should be bought till after they are dead: let them well consider what they do, before they produce them to the light. Who hastens them? My Book is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the same, saving that upon every new Edition, (that the Buyer may not go away quite empty) I take the liberty to add (as it were by an ill-jointed in-laying or faneering) some few insignificant things over and above. They are no other but over-weight, that do not disfigure the primitive Form of those Essays, where they, by a little ambitious subtilty, give a kind of particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to every one of those that follow. From thence however there will easily happen some transposition of Chronology; my stories taking place according to their patness, and not always according to their Age. Secondly,

because that for what concerns my self, I fear to lose by the change: my Understanding does not always go forward, it goes backward too. I do not much less suspect my Fancies for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the second or the third, than for being the first, or present, or past; we oft correct our selves as foolishly as we do others. I am grown older by a great many years since my first Publications, which were in the year 1580: but I very much doubt whether I am grown an inch the wiser. I now, and I anon, are two several Persons; but whether the better, now, or anon, I am not able to determine. It were a fine thing to be old, if we only tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd towards improvement; but 'tis a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, stumbling, reeling, ill-favour'd motion, like that of Reeds, which the Air casually waves to and fro at Pleasure.<note place="margin">The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Antiochus</hi> corrected by himself in his more mature Age.</note>

And to promise, that had he had yet another Age to live, he would be always upon terms of altering his Judgement, not so much for the better, as for something else?

Praise is always pleasing, let it come from whom, or upon what account it will; yet ought a man to understand why he is commended, that he may know how to keep up the same Reputation still. The vulgar and common esteem is seldom happy in hitting right; and I am much mistaken, if amongst the Writings of my time, the worst are not those which have most gain'd the popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause. For my part, I confess my self oblig'd, and return my thanks to those good natur'd men, who are pleas'd to take my weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in good part. The Faults of the Workmanship are no where so apparent, as in a matter which of it self has no Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Blame not me, Reader, for those that slip in here, by the fancy or inadvertency of others; every hand, every Artizan contribute their own Materials, I neither concern my self with <hi>Ortography</hi> (and only care to have it after the old way) nor pointing,<note place="margin">Ortogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and pointing despis'd.</note> being very unexpert both in the one and the other.

had rather write as many more Essays, than be ty'd to revise these over again for so childish a Correction. I was saying elsewhere, that being planted in very Center of this new <hi>Religion,</hi> I am not only depriv'd of any great Familiarity with men of other kind of Manners than my own, and of other Opinions, by which they hold together, as by a tye that supersedes all other Obligations; but moreover<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I do not live without danger, amongst men to whom all things are equally lawful, and of whom the most part cannot offend the Laws more than they have already done; from whence the extreamest degree of License does proceed. All the particular Circumstances respecting me being sum'd up together, I do not find one man of my Country, who pays so dear for the defence of our Laws both in cost and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages (as the Lawyers say) as my self. And some there are who vapour and brag of their Zeal and Constancy, that if things were justly weigh'd, do not much less than I. My House, as one that has ever been open and free to all Comers, and civil to all, (for I could never perswade my self to make a Garrison of it, that being to make it the aim of the remotest Enemy) has sufficiently merited a popular kindness, and so that it would be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter justly to insult over me upon my own Dung-Hill; and I look upon it as a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exemplary thing, that it yet continues a Virgin from Blood and Plunder during so long a storm, and so many neighbouring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions

and Tumults. For to confess the truth, it had been possible enough for a man of my Complexion to have shak'd hands with any one constant and continued Form what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But the contrary Invasions and Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Revolutions, and Vicissitudes of Fortune round about me, have hitherto more exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then calm'd and mollified the humour of the Country, and involve me over and over again with invincible Difficulties and Dangers. I scape, 'tis true, but am troubled that it is more by chance, and something of my own Prudence, than by Justice, and am not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be out of the Protection of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and under any other safe-guard than theirs. As matters stand, I live above one half by the Favour of others, which is an untoward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. I do not like to owe my safety either to the Generosity or Affection of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are content to allow me my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to the obliging manners of my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, or my own; for what if I was another kind of man? If my Deportments, and the frankness of my Conversation or Relation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige my Neighbours, 'tis cruel that they should acquit themselves of that Obligation in only permitting me to live, and that they may say, we allow him the free liberty of having Divine Service read in his own private <hi>Chappel,</hi> when it is interdicted in all Churches round about, and allow him the use of his Goods, and the fruition of his Life, as one that protects our Wives and Cattel in time of need.

Now I am clearly of Opinion, that a man should live by Authority, and not either by Recompence or Favour. How many gallant men have rather chosen to lose their Lives than to abandon their Duty? I hate to subject my self to any sort of Obligation, but above all, to that which binds me by the duty of Honour. I think nothing so dear as what is given me, and that because my Will lies at pawn under the title of Ingratitude, and more willingly accept of Offices that are to be sold; being of Opinion, that for the last I give nothing but Money, but for the other I give my self. The knot that binds me by the Laws of Courtesie pinches me more than that of Loyal constraint, and I am much more at ease when bound by a <hi>Scrivener</hi> than by my self.

And though I still continue to pay them all the Offices of publick Reason, I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding find my self very sparing of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that upon the account of Justice, which I did upon the score of Affection, and am a little eas'd of my former Sollicitude by my inward Will. <hi>Est prudentis sustinere ut cursum,</hi>

I am sorry they are not such as I could wish they were, but so it is, that I also go less in my Application and Engagement towards them.

Such as know me, both better and meaner men than my self, are able to say whether they have ever known a man less importuning, sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, entreating, and pressing upon others than I; but if I am, and be a degree beyond all modern Example, 'tis no great wonder so many parts of my Manners contributing to it.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53645:873" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the contradiction of my Desires and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and my most beloved Qualities, Idleness and Freedom; by all these together I have conceiv'd a mortal hatred to being oblig'd to any other, or by any other than my self. I prodigally lay out all I can wrap and wring of my own, rather than employ the bounty of another in any light or important occasion or necessity whatever. My Friends do strangely importune me, when they advise me to call in a third Person, and I think it costs me little less to disengage him who is indebted to me by making use of him, than to engage my self to him that owes me nothing: These Conditions being remov'd, provided they require of me nothing of any great trouble or care, (for I have renounc'd all business that requires great diligence) I am easily intreated, and ready to do every one the best service I can: But yet I have, I confess, more avoided receiving than sought occasions of giving, and also, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it is more easie. My Fortune has allow'd me but little to do others good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the little it can afford is put into a pretty close hand. Had I been born a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I should have been ambitious to have made my self belov'd, not to make my self fear'd or admired; Shall I more plainly express it? I should more have endeavour'd to please than to do good. <hi>Cyrus</hi> very wisely, and by the Mouth of a great <hi>Captain,</hi> and better <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> prefers his Bounty and Benefits much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Valour and Warlike Conquests.

I have a thousand times gone to bed at my own House with an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension that I should be betray'd and murther'd that very night, compounding with Fortune, that it might be without terror, and with quick dispatch; and after my <hi>Pater noster</hi> have cry'd out,

I sometimes extract the means to fortifie my self against these Considerations, from careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sloth, which also in some sort bring us on to resolution. It oft befals me to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and expect mortal dangers with a kind of delight. I stupidly plunge my self head-long into Death, without considering or taking a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53645:875" rendition="simple:additions"/>
view of it, as into a deep and obscure <hi>Abyss,</hi> which swallows me up at one leap, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves me in an instant in a profound sleep without any sense of pain. And in these short and violent Deaths, the Consequence that I fore-see administers more Consolation to me than the Effect does Fear. They say, that as Life is not better for being long, so Death is better for being not long. I do not so much evade being dead, as I enter into confidence with dying. I wrap and shrowd my self in the storm that is to blind and carry me away with the Fury of a sudden and insensible At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. Moreover, what if it should fall out, that as some <hi>Gardiners</hi> say, that <hi>Roses</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> spring more odoriferent near unto <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onions,</hi> by reason that the last suck and imbibe all the ill odour of the Earth; that these deprav'd Natures should also attract all the malignity of my <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Climate,</hi> and so render it so much better and purer by their vicinity, that I should not lose all? That cannot be, but there may be something in this, that Bounty and Goodness is more beautiful and attractive when it is rare, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety and Diversity fortifies and shuts up well-doing within it self, and inflames it by the jealousie of opposition and glory. Thieves and Robbers (of their special favour) have no particular aim at me, no more have I to them. I should have my hands too full. Like Consciences are lodg'd under several sorts of Robes, like Cruelty, Disloyalty, and Rapine;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53645:875" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and so much the worse as they are more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to others, and more secure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in themselves, under the colour of the Laws. I less hate an open profess'd injury than one that is clandestine and treacherous; an Enemy in Arms than an Enemy in a Gown. Our Fever has seiz'd upon a Body that is not much the worse for't. There was <hi>Fire</hi> before, and now 'tis broke out into a <hi>Flame.</hi> The <hi>noise</hi> is greater, the evil much the <hi>same.</hi> I casually answer such as ask me the reason of my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, <hi>that I know very well what I fly from, but not what I seek.</hi> If they tell me that I may be as unhealthy amongst Strangers, and that their Manners are no purer than ours; I first reply, that that is hard to be believ'd.

Secondly, that it is always gain to change an ill Condition for one that is uncertain, and that the ills of others ought not to concern us so much as those of our own. I will not here omit, that I never mutiny so much against <hi>France,</hi> that I am not perfectly friends with <hi>Paris</hi>;<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </note> that City has ever had my Heart from my infancy, and it has fallen out, as of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, that the more beautiful Cities I have seen since, the more the beauty of this does still win upon my affection.

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53645:876" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and blemishes. I am not a <hi>French-man</hi> but by this great City, great in People, great in the felicity of her Scituation; but above all, great and incomparable in variety and diversity of Commodities, the Glory of <hi>France,</hi> and one of the most noble Ornaments of the World. <hi>God</hi> of his Goodness compose our <hi>Differences,</hi> and deliver us from this <hi>Civil War</hi>; I find her sufficiently defended from all other Violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I give her caution, that of all sorts of People, those will be the worst that shall set it in Division; I have no fears of her, but of her self; and certainly I have as much fear for her as for any other <hi>City</hi> in the Kingdom. Whilst she shall continue, I shall never want a <hi>retreat,</hi> where I may live or dye, sufficient to make me amends for parting with any other <hi>home</hi> or <hi>retreat</hi> whatever. Not because <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> has said so, but because it is in truth my own Humour, and peradventure not without some excess. I look upon all men as my Compatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and embrace a <hi>Polander</hi> with as sincere an Affection as a <hi>French-man,</hi> preferring the universal and common tye to all National tyes whatever. I am not much taken with the sweetness of a natural Air: Acquaintance wholly new, and wholly my own, appear to me full as good as the other common and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental ones with our Neighbours: Friendships that are purely of our own acquiring, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily carry it above those to which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the <hi>Clime</hi> or of <hi>Blood</hi> oblige us. <hi>Nature</hi> has plac'd us in the World free

These Celestial Lives have Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges enow, which I embrace more by Esteem, than Affection; and they have some also so elevated and extraordinary, that I cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them so much as by Esteem, for as much as I cannot conceive them. This Humour was very tender in a man that thought the whole World his <hi>City.</hi> It is true, that he disdain'd <hi>Travel,</hi> and had hardly ever set his Foot out of the <hi>Attick</hi> Territories. What though he complain'd of the Money his Friends offer'd to save his Life, and that he refus'd to come out of Prison by the Mediation of others; not to disobey the <hi>Laws</hi> in a time when they were otherwise so corrupted? These Examples are of the first kind for me; of the second there are others that I could find out in the same Person. Many of these rare Examples surpass the force of my Action; but some of them do moreover surpass the force of my Judgement. These Reasons set aside, <hi>Travel</hi> is in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53645:877" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a very improving thing; the Soul is there continually imploy'd in observing new and unknown things: and I do not know, as I have often said, a better School wherein to model Life, than by incessantly exposing to it the diversity of so many other lives, fancies, and usances; and to make it relish so perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a variety of the form of humane Nature. The Body is therein neither idle nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, and that moderate Agitation puts in breath. I can keep on Horse-back, as much tormented with the Stone as I am, without alighting or being weary, eight or ten hours together.

I see, and am asham'd to see, in several Families I know, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> about Dinner time, come home all dirt, and in great disorder, from trotting about amongst his Husbandmen and Labourers, when Madam is perhaps scarce out of her Bed, and afterwards is pouncing and tricking up her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self forsooth in her Closet. This is for <hi>Queens</hi> to do, and that's a question too. 'Tis ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and unjust, that the Laziness of our Wives should be maintain'd with our Sweat and Labour.

Practice. Every strange Woman ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears graceful, and every one finds by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that being continually together is not so pleasing, as to part for a time, and meet again. These interruptions inflame me anew towards my Wife, and render my own House more pleasant to me. Absence, and change of Place, renew my Appetite both to the one and the other. I know that the Arms of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are long enough to reach from the one end of the World to the other, and especially this, where there is a continual communication of Offices that rouse the Obligation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, that there is so great Connexion and Relation amongst wise men, that he who dines in <hi>France,</hi> nourishes his Companion in <hi>Aegypt</hi>; and that whoever does but hold out his Finger, in what part of the World soever, all the wise Men upon the habitable Earth feel themselves assisted by it. Fruition and Possession principally appertain to the Imagination. It more fervently and constantly embraces what it is in quest of, than what we hold in our Arms. Let a man but consider and cast up his daily Thoughts, and he will find, that he is most absent from his Friend when in his Company.

Or may it not be, that of it self Opposition and Contradiction entertains and nourishes them, and that they sufficiently accommodate themselves, provided they incommodate you? In true Friendship, wherein I pretend to be as perfect as another, I more give my self to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53645:880" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Friend, than I endeavour to attract him to me. I am not only better pleas'd in doing him service, than if he conferr'd a Benefit upon me; but moreover, had rather he should do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self good than me, and he most obliges me when he does so.<note place="margin">Of the Utility the absence of a Friend is.</note> And if absence be either more pleasant or convenient for him, 'tis also more acceptable to me than his Presence; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it properly absence, when we can write to one another. I have sometimes made good use of our separation from one another. We better fill'd, and further extended the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life in being parted. He liv'd, rejoyc'd, and saw for me, and I for him, as plainly as if he had himself been there; one part remain'd idle, and we confounded one another when we were together. The distance of <hi>Place</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Conjunction of our <hi>Wills</hi> more rich. This insatiable desire of personal Presence, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle implies weakness in the fruition of Souls. As to what concerns Age, which is alledg'd against me, 'tis quite contrary; 'tis for Youth to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it self to common Opinions, and to curb it self to please others. It has wherewithall to please both the People and its self; we have but too much ado to please our selves alone. As natural Conveniencies fail, let us supply them with those that are artificial. 'Tis Injustice to excuse Youth for pursuing its Pleasures, and to forbid old Men to seek them. When young, I conceal'd my wanton Passions with Prudence; now I am old, I chace away Melancholy by Debauch. And thus do the <hi>Platonick Laws</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:53645:880"/>
forbid Travel till fourty or fifty years old, that mens Travels might be more useful and instructive in so mature an Age. I should soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner subscribe to this second Article of the <hi>Laws,</hi> who forbids it after threescore; but at such an Age you will never return from so long a Journey. What care I for that? I neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it to return nor to finish it. My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is only to keep my self in motion whilst motion pleases me, and only walk for the walks sake. They who hunt after a Benefice, or a Hare, run not; they only run that run at <hi>Base,</hi> and to exercise their running. My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is divisible throughout, it is not grounded upon any great hopes, every day concludes my expectation. And the Journey of my Life is carried on after the same manner; and yet I have seen Places enow a great way off, when I could have wish'd to have been stay'd. And why not, if <hi>Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Diogenes, Zeno, Antipater,</hi> so many <hi>Sages</hi> of the sourest <hi>Sect,</hi> cheerfully abandoned their Countrey, without occasion of complaint, and only for the enjoyment of another Air? In earnest, that which most displeases me in all my Voyages, is, that I cannot resolve to settle my Abode where I should best like, but that I must always propose to my self to return, to accommodate my self to the common Humour. If I fear'd to dye in any other Place than that of my Birth; if I thought I should dye more uneasily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from my own Family, I should hardly go out of <hi>France</hi>; I should not without fear
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53645:881" rendition="simple:additions"/>
step out of my Parish. I feel Death always twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me by the Throat, or by the Back, but I am of another temper, 'tis in all Places alike to me; yet, might I have my choice, I think I should rather chuse to dye on Horse back than in a <hi>Bed,</hi> out of my own House, and far enough from my own People. There is more Heart-breaking than Consolation in taking leave of ones Friends; I am willing to omit that civility, for that of all the Offices of Friendship is the only one that is unpleasant, and could with all my heart dispence with that great and eternal Farewell. If there be any convenience in so many standers by, it brings an hundred inconveniencies along with it. I have seen many miserably dying, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with all his Train: 'tis a crowd that choaks them. 'Tis against Duty, and a testimony of little kindness, and little care, to permit you to dye in Repose, one torments your Eyes, another afflicts your Ears, another tires your faultring Tongue; you have neither Sense nor Member that is not violated by them: Your Heart is wounded with compassion to hear the mourning of those that are your real Friends, and perhaps with spite, to hear the counterfeit condolings of those who only pretend and make a shew of being so. Who ever has been delicate that way, when well, is much more so in his weakness. In such a necessity a tender Hand is required, and accomodated to his Sentiments, to scratch him just in the place where he itches, or not to meddle with him at all. If we stand in need of a <note place="margin">

have much more need of a wiser Man to help us out of it. Such a one, and a Friend to boot, a man ought to purchace at any rate for such an Occasion. I am not yet arriv'd to such a pitch of Bravery as to disdain all assistance in that fatal Hour, nor pretend to be able so to fortifie my self in my own Strength, that nothing can assist or offend me; I have not brought my self to that: I endeavour to hide my self, and to escape from this Passage, not by <hi>Fear</hi> but by <hi>Art.</hi> I do not intend in this act of dying to muster up and make a shew of my constancy. For whom should I do it? All the right and title I have to reputation will then cease. I content my self with a death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd within it self, quiet, solitary, and all my own, suitable to my retir'd and private life. Quite contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Superstition, where a man was look'd upon as unhappy, who dyed without speaking, and that had not his nearest Relations to close his eyes.<note place="margin">The eyes of dying Persons clos'd by their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> I have enough to do to comfort my self, without giving my self the trouble of consolating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; thoughts enough in my head, not to need that Circumstances should possess me with new; and matter enough to entertain my self withall without borrowing. This cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical minute is out of the part of Society, 'tis the act of one single Person. Let us live, and be merry amongst our <hi>Friends,</hi> let us go dye, and be sullen amongst <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> A man may find those for his money that will shift his pillow, and rub his feet,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53645:882" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and will trouble him no more than he would have them, who will present him with an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Countenance, and suffer him to govern himself, and to complain according to his own Method. I wean my self daily by my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from this childish and inhumane Humour, of desiring by our sufferings to move the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and Mourning of our Friends. We stretch our Inconveniencies beyond their just extent when we extract tears from them, and the Constancy which we commend in every one in supporting his own adverse Fortune, we accuse and reproach in our Friends when the case is our own; we are not satisfied that they should be sensible of our Condition only, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they be moreover afflicted. A man should publish and communicate his <hi>joy,</hi> but as much as he can, conceal and smother his <hi>grief</hi>: He that makes himself lamented without Reason, is a man not to be lamented when there shall be real Cause. To be always complaining, is the way never to be lamented; by making himself always in so pitiful a Taking, he is never commiserated by any. He that makes himself dead when he is alive, is subject to be thought likely to live when he is dying; I have seen some, who have taken it ill when they have been told that they look'd well, and that their Pulse was temperate, contain their smiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they betray'd a Recovery, and be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at their Health because it was not to be lamented: And, which is a great deal more, they were not Women neither. I describe my
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53645:882" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Infirmities, but such as they really are at most, and avoid all Expressions of ill Prognostick and compos'd Exclamations. If not Mirth, at least,<note place="margin">Mourning very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper about sick Persons.</note> a temperate Countenance in the standers by, is proper in the Presence of a wise sick Man. He does not quarrel with Health, for seeing himself in a contrary Condition. He is pleas'd to contemplate it found and intire in others, and at least to enjoy it for company. He does not, for feeling himself melt away, abandon all thoughts of Life, nor avoid to discourse of ordinary and indifferent things. I will study sickness whilst I am well; when it has seiz'd me it will make its impression real enough, without the help of my Imagination. We prepare our selves before hand for the Journey we undertake and resolve upon, we leave the appointment of the Hour when to take Horse to the Company, and in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour deferr it. I find this unexpected advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the publication of my Manners, that it in some sort serves me for a Rule. I have sometimes some consideration of not betraying or falsifying the History of my Life. This publick <hi>Declaration</hi> obliges me to keep my way, and not to give the lye to the Image I have drawn of my Qualities, commonly less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd and interdicted than the malignity and infirmity of the Judgements of this Age would have them. The uniformity and simplicity of my Manners produce a Face of easie interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but because the fashion is a little new, and out of Use, it gives great opportunity
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53645:883" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to slander. Yet so it is, that whoever will go about justly do condemn me, I do think I so sufficiently assist his malice in my known and avow'd Imperfections, that he may that way satisfie his ill nature, without fighting with the Wind. If I my self, to prevent his accusation and discovery, confess enough to frustrate his malice, as he conceives, 'tis but reason that he make use of his right of amplification, and to wire-draw my Vices as far as he can; offence has a right beyond Justice; and let him make the roots of those errours I have laid open to him shoot up into Trees and Branches: let him make his Use, not only of those I am really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with, but also of those that only threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me; Injurious Vices both in quality and number. Let him cudgel me that way. I should willingly follow the example of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Dion. Antigonus</hi> being about to reproach him with the meanness of his Birth, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cut him short, with this Declaration<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                        <hi>I am,</hi> said he, <hi>the Son of a Slave, a Butcher, and stigmatiz'd, and of a Whore, my Father married in the lowest of his Fortune, who both of them were whipt for Offences they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

I shall tell them what I am; and a free and generous
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53645:883" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confession enervates Reproach, and disarms Slander. So it is, that, one thing with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I fancy men as oft commend, as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value me beyond reason. As methinks also, from my infancy, in rank and degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they have given me a place rather above than below my right. I should find my self more at ease in a Country where these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees were either regulated or not regarded. Amongst men, when the difference about the precedency either of walking or sitting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds three replies, 'tis reputed uncivil. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stick at giving, or taking place out of Rule, to avoid the trouble of Ceremony. And never any man had a mind to go before me, but I permitted him to do it. Besides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit I make of writing of my self, I have also hop'd for this other advantage, that if it should fall out that my humour should please, or jump with those of some honest man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I dye, he would then desire, and seek to be acquainted with me, and to come up to me. I have given him a great deal of space; for all that he could have in many years ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd by a long familiarity, he has seen in three dayes in this memorial, and more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly set down. A pleasant fancy: many things that I would not confess to any one in particular, I deliver to the Publick; and send my best Friends to a Booksellers shop, there to inform themselves concerning my most secret Thoughts.

And we also conceive our selves oblig'd to retire for natural Actions less unseemely, and less terrible than this. But moreover, such as are reduc'd to spin out a long languishing Life, ought not perhaps to wish to trouble a great Family with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Miseries. Therefore the <hi>Indians,</hi> in a certain Province, thought it just to knock a man o'th' head, when reduc'd to such a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: and in another of their <hi>Provinces,</hi> they all forsook him, to shift for himself as well as he could. To whom do they not at least become tedious and insupportable? You teach your best Friends to be cruel of force; hardning Women and Children by long usance, neither to lament, nor to regard your suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Groans forc'd from me by the pain of the Stone, were grown so familiar to my
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53645:884" rendition="simple:additions"/>
People, that no body took any more notice of them. And though we should extract some Pleasure from their Conversation, (which does not always happen, by reason of the Disparity of Conditions, which easily begets Contempt or Envy toward any one whatever) is it not too much to be troublesom all the days of a mans Life? The more I should see them force themselves out of real Affection to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me, the more I should be sorry for their pains. We have liberty to lean, but not to lay our whole weight upon others, so as to prop our selves by their ruine. Like him who caus'd little Childrens Throats to be cut, to make use of their Blood for the cure of a certain Disease he had: Or that other, who was continually supply'd with tender young Girls, to keep his old Limbs warm in the Night, and to mix the sweetness of theirs with his sour and stinking Breath. Decrepitude is a solitary Quality. I am sociable even to excess; and I think it reasonable that I should now withdraw my Miseries from the sight of the World, and keep them to my self. Let me shrink and draw up my self like a <hi>Tortoise.</hi> I learn to see men without hanging upon them, I should endanger them in so steep a passage. 'Tis now time to turn my back to company. But in these Travels you may be surpris'd with Sickness in some wretched place where nothing can be had to relieve you: I always carry most things necessary about me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we cannot evade Fortune, if she once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53645:885" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to attack us. I need nothing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary when I am sick. I will not be beholding to my <hi>Bolus</hi> to do that for me which Nature cannot. At the very beginning of my Fevers, and Sicknesses that cast me down, whilst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and but a little disorder in my Health, I reconcile my self to <hi>Almighty-God</hi> by the last Christian Offices: and find my self by so doing less oppress'd, and more easie, and have got methinks so much the better of my Disease. And I have yet less need of a Scrivener or Counsellor, than of a Physician. What I have not settled of my Affairs when I was in <hi>Health,</hi> let no one expect I should do it when I am <hi>sick.</hi> What I will do for the service of Death, is always done. I durst not so much as one day deferr it. And if nothing be done, 'tis as much as to say, either that doubt hinder'd my choice, (and sometimes 'tis well chosen not to choose) or that I was positively resolv'd not to do any thing at all. I write my Book to few men, and to few years. Had it been matter of duration, I should have put it into a better Language; for, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual variation that ours has been continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subject to, who can expect that the present force should be in use fifty years hence? It slips every day thorough our Fingers, and since I was born is alter'd above one half. We say that it is now perfect; and every Age says the same of the Language then spoken: But I shall hardly trust to that, so long as it varies and changes as it does. 'Tis for good and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53645:885"/>
Writings to nail and rivet it to them, and its Reputation will go according to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of our State. For which Reason, I am not afraid to insert in it several private Articles, which will spend their use amongst the men that are now living, and that concern the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular knowledge of some who will see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into them than every common Reader. I will not after all, as I oft hear dead men spoken of, that men should say of me, <hi>He judg'd, and liv'd so and so; he would have done this or that, could he have spoke when he was dying, he would have said so or so, and have given this thing or t'other; I knew him better than any.</hi> Now, as much as Decency permits, I here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my Inclinations and Affections; but I do it more willingly and freely by word of Mouth, to any one who desires to be inform'd. So it is, that in these <hi>Memoires,</hi> if any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, he will find, that I have either told, or design'd to tell all. What I cannot express, I point out with my Finger.

I leave nothing to be desir'd, or to be ghess'd at concerning me. If People must be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me, I would have it to be justly,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53645:886" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and truly. I would come again with all my Heart from the other World, to give any one the lye that should report me other than I was, though he did it to honour me. I perceive that People represent, even living men, quite another thing than what they really are: and had I not stoutly defended a Friend, whom I have lost, they would have torn him into a thousand several pieces. To conclude the account of my frail Humours, I do confess, that in my Travel, I seldom come to my Inn, but that it comes into my Mind to consider whether I could there be sick, and dying at my ease; I would be lodg'd in some convenient part of the House, remote from all noise, ill scents, and smoke. I endeavour to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death by these frivolous Circumstances; or to say better, to discharge my self from all other Incumbrances, that I may have nothing to do, nor be troubled with any thing but it, which will lye heavy enough upon me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the assistance of any other thing to mend the Load. I would have my Death share in the ease and conveniencies of my Life; 'tis a great part of it, and of the greatest importance, and hope it will not for the future contradict what is past. Death has some forms that are more easie than others, and receives divers Qualities, according to every ones Fancy. Amongst the natural ones, those that proceed from Weakness and Stupidity I think the most favourable: amongst those that are violent, I can worse endure to think of a precipice
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53645:886" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than the fall of a House, that will crush me flat in a moment; and a wound with a Sword, than a Harquebuss shot: and should rather have chosen to poyson my self with <hi>Socrates,</hi> then stab my self with <hi>Cato.</hi> And though it be the same thing, yet my Imagination makes as great a difference as betwixt Death and Life, betwixt throwing my self into a burning Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and plunging into the Channel of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: So idely does our Fear more concern it self in the Means than the Effect. It is but an instant, 'tis true, but withall, an instant of such weight, that I would willingly give a great many days of my Life to pass it over after my own fashion. Since every ones Imagination renders it more or less terrible, and since every one has some choice amongst the several forms of dying, let us try a little further, to find some one that is wholly clear from all Offence. Might not one render it moreover Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they did who died with <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi>? I set aside the brave and exemplary efforts produc'd by <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> But amongst men of little mark, such as <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and a <hi>Tigillinus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> there have been found men condemn'd to dispatch themselves, who have as it were rock'd Death asleep with the delicacy of their Preparations; They have made it slip and steal away, even in the height of their accustomed Diversions. Amongst Whores and good Fellows, not a word of Consolation, no mention of making a Will, no ambitious affectation of Constancy, no talk
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53645:887" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their future Condition: amongst Sports, Feastings, Wit, and Mirth, common and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Discourses, Musick, and amorous Verses. Were it not possible for us to imitate this Resolution after a more decent manner? Since there are Deaths that are fit for fools, and fit for the wise, let us find out such as are fit for those who are betwixt both. My Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination suggests to me one that is easie, and since we must dye,<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to the choice of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals by the Tyrants.</note> to be desir'd.

Fortune is assisting to the Facility of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of my Life; having plac'd it in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that for the future it can be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage nor hindrance to those that are concern'd in me. 'Tis a Condition that I would have accepted at any time of my Age: but in this occasion of trussing up my Baggage, I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly pleas'd, that in dying I shall neither do them good nor harm; she has so order'd it by a cunning Compensation, that they who may pretend to any considerable advantage by my death, will at the same time sustain a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Inconvenience. Death sometimes is more
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53645:887" rendition="simple:additions"/>
grievous to us, in that it is grievous to others, and interests us in their interest as much as in our own, and sometimes more. In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of lodging that I desire, I mix nothing of Pomp and Splendor, I hate it rather; but a certain plain neatness, which is oftest found in places where there is less of Art, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has adorn'd with some grace that is all her own. <hi>Non ampliter, sed munditer convivium.</hi>

I, who for the most part travel for my pleasure, do not order my Affairs so ill. If the way be foul on my right-hand, I turn on my left, if I find my self unfit to ride, I stay where I am: and so doing, in earnest, I see nothing that is not as pleasant and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as my own House. 'Tis true, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find superfluity superfluous, and observe a kind of trouble even in abundance it self. Have I left any thing behind me unseen, I go back to see it, 'tis still my way; I trace no certain line, either strait or crooked. Do I not find in the place to which I go what was reported to me? as it oft falls out, that the Judgments of others do not jump with mine, and that I have found those Reports for the most part false; I never complain of losing my Labour: I have at least inform'd my self that what was told me was not true. I have a Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body as free, and a Palat as indifferent
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53645:888" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as any man living: the diversity of Fashions of several Nations no further concern me than the mere pleasure of Variety. Every Usance has its Reason. Let the Plate and Dishes be Pewter, Wood, or Earth, my Meat be boyl'd or roasted, let them give me Butter or Oyl, of Nuts, or Olives, hot, or cold, 'tis all one to me; and so indifferent, that growing old, I accuse this generous Faculty, and have need that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy and choice should correct the Indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Appetite, and sometimes relieve my Stomach. When I have been abroad out of <hi>France,</hi> and that People out of Courtesie have ask'd me if I would be serv'd after the <hi>French</hi> manner, I laugh'd at the question, and always frequented Tables the most fill'd with Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. I am asham'd to see my Country-men besotted with this foolish Humour of quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with forms contrary to their own. They seem to be out of their Element, when out of their own Village. Wherever they go, they keep strictly to their own fashions, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate those of Strangers. Do we meet with a Compatriot in <hi>Hungary</hi>? Oh the happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture! They are thence-forward insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they cling together, and their whole Discourse is to condemn the barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they see there. And why barbarous, but because they are not <hi>French</hi>? And those have made the best use of their Travels, who have observ'd most to speak against; for most of them go for no other end, but to come again. They proceed in their Travel with great Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53645:888" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Circumspection, with a silent and incommunicable Prudence, preserving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Contagion of an unknown Air. What I am saying of them, puts me in mind of something like it. I have sometimes obsev'd in some of our young Courtiers, they will not mix with any but men of their own sort; and look upon us as men of another World, with disdain and pity. Put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Discourse but the Intrigues of the Court, and they are utterly at a loss; as very Owls and Novices to us, as we are to them. And 'tis truly said, that a well bred man is of a compound Education. I, on the contrary, travel very much sated with our own fashions; not to look for <hi>Gascons</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> I have left them at home: I rather seek for <hi>Greeks</hi> than <hi>Persians,</hi> they are the men I indeavour to be acquainted with, and the men I study, 'tis there that I bestow and imploy my self: and which is more, I fancy that I have met but with few Customs that are not at least as good as our own. I have not, I confess, travell'd very far; scarce out of the sight of the fanes of my own House. As to the rest, most of the accidental Company a man falls into upon the Road, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him more Trouble than Pleasure; I wave them as much as I civilly can, especially now that Age seems in some sort to priviledge and sequester me from the common forms. You suffer for others, or others suffer for you; both of them Inconveniencies of importance enough, but the latter appears to me the greater. 'Tis
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53645:889" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a rare Fortune,<note place="margin">Worthy Men of great Solace in Travel.</note> but of inestimable solace, to have a worthy man, one of a sound Judgment, and of Manners conformable to your own, who takes a delight to bear you Company. I have been at an infinite loss for that upon my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. But such a Companion should be chose and acquir'd from your first setting out. There can be no Pleasure to me without Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: there is not so much as a spritely thought comes into my mind, that it does not grieve me to have produc'd alone, and that I have no one to communicate it unto.<note place="margin">

And such a one there may be, as has no way offended the Laws, who nevertheless would not deserve the Character of a virtuous man, and that Philosophy would justly condemn to be whip'd; so unequal and perplex'd is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. We are so far from being good men, according to the Laws of God, that we cannot be so according to our own. Humane wisdom
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53645:893" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could never yet arrive at the Duty as it had it self prescrib'd; and could it arrive there, it would still prescribe it self others beyond it, to which it would ever aspire and pretend; so great an enemy to consistency is our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane condition. Man enjoyns himself to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily in fault. He is not very discreet to cut out his own Duty by the measure of any other <hi>Being</hi> than his own. To whom does he prescribe that which he does not expect any one should perform? Is he unjust in not doing what it is impossible for him to do? The Laws which condemn us not to be able, condemn us for not being able. At the worst hand, this difform liberty of presenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves two several ways, the Actions after one manner, and the Discourses after another way, be allow'd to those who only speak of things; but it cannot be allow'd to those who speak themselves, as I do; I must march my pen as I do my feet. The common Life ought to have communication with the other Lives. The Virtue of <hi>Cato</hi> was vigorous beyond the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Age he liv'd in, and for a man whose province it was to make one in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning others, doubtless dedicated to the Publick Service; and yet it might be call'd a Justice, if not unjust, at least vain, and out of season. Even my own manners, which have not above an inch of singularity in them above those that are current amongst us, render me nevertheless a little odd and unsociable to the Age I live in.

I have formerly tried to employ in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of publick Affairs, Opinions and Rules of living, as rude, new, unpolish'd, or unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, as either born with me, or brought away from my education, and wherewith I serve my own turn, if not so commodiously, at least as securely, in my own particular Concerns: but I have found a scolastick and novice Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, foolish and dangerous. He that goes into a Crowd, must now go one way, and then another, keep his Elbows close, retire, or advance, and quit the direct way, according to what he encounters; and must live not so much according to his own Method, as that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53645:894" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of others; not according to what he proposes to himself, but according to what is propos'd to him: according to the Time, according to Men, according to Occasions. <hi>Plato</hi> says, that whoever escapes from the Worlds handling with clean Breeches, escapes by Miracle: and says withall, that when he appoints his <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi> the head of a Government, he does not mean a corrupt one like that of <hi>Athens,</hi> and much less such a one as this of ours, wherein Wisdom it self would be to seek. And a good Herb transplanted into a soil very contrary to its own nature, much sooner conforms it self to the Soil, than it reforms the Soil to it. I find, that if I were wholly to apply my self to such Employments, it would require a great deal of change and new modelling in me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could be any way fit for it. And though I could so far prevail upon my self, (and why might I not with Time and Diligence work such a feat) I would not do it. By the little tryal I have had of publick Employment, it has been so much disgust to me; I feel by times some Temptations toward Ambition rising in my Soul, but I obstinately oppose them.

'Tis the original Language of the <hi>Gods</hi>; I mean, that my matter distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes it self; it sufficiently shews where it changes, where it concludes, when it begins, and where it rejoyns, without interlacing it with words of connexion, introduc'd for the relief of weak or negligent Ears, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explaining my self.

If to take a Book in hand, were to read it, to look upon it were to consider it, and to run it slightly over, were to make it a man's own; I were then to blame to make my self so ignorant, as I say I am. Seeing I cannot fix the Attention of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53645:897" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Reader by the weight of what I write, <hi>Manco male, I am much mistaken,</hi> if I should chance to do it by my Intricacies; nay, he will afterward repent that he ever perplext himself about it: 'tis very true, but he will yet be there perplext. And besides, there are some Humours in which Intelligence produces disdain; who will think better of me for not understanding what I say, and will conclude the depth by the obscurity of my Sense; which, to speak sincerely, I mortally hate, and would avoid it if I could. <hi>Aristotle</hi> boasts some where in his Writings, that he affected it; vicious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation. The frequent <hi>Breaks,</hi> and short <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs</hi> in Chapters that I made my Method in the beginning of my Book, I have since thought, broke and dissolv'd the Attention before it was rais'd, as making it disdain to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle it self to so little; and upon that account have made the rest longer, such as require Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and assign'd leisure. In such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to whom you will not give an hour, you give nothing; and do nothing for him, for whom you only do whilst you are doing something else. To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I have peradventure some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Obligation to speak only by halves, to speak confusedly and discordantly. I am therefore angry at this kind of perplexing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; these extravagant Projects that trouble a man's Life, and those Opinions so fine and subtle, that though they be true, I think them too dear bought. On the contrary, I make

it my business to bring Vanity it self in repute, and Folly too, if it bring me any Pleasure; and permit me to follow my own natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, without carrying too strict a hand upon them. I have seen elsewhere Palaces in rubbish, and Statues both of Gods and Men defac'd, and yet there are men still; all this is true, and yet for all that, I cannot so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the ruines of that so great, and so puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant <hi>City,</hi>

The care of the dead is recommended to us; besides, I have been bred up from my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy with these People: I had knowledge of the Affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> long before I had any of those of my own House.

They are all dead, and so is my Father as absolutely dead as they; and is remov'd as far from me and Life in eighteen years, as they are in sixteen hundred; whose Memory ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, Friendship and Society, I do not cease to hug and embrace with a very perfect and lively Union.<note place="margin">Gratitude towards the dead.</note> Nay, of my own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I render my self more officious to the dead; they no longer help themselves, and therefore methinks the more require my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: 'tis there that Gratitude appears in its full lustre.

Being before Burgess of no City at all, I am glad to be created one, of the most Noble that ever was, or ever shall be. If other men would consider themselves at the rate I do, they would, as I do, discover themselves to be full of inanity and foppery; to rid my self of it I cannot, without making my self away. We are all leaven'd with it, as well one as another; but they who are aware on't, have the better bargain, and yet I know not whether they have or no: This Opinion, and common Usance, to observe others more than our selves, has very much reliev'd us that way. 'Tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry displeasing Object: We can there see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Misery and Vanity. Nature, that we may not be dejected with the sight of our
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53645:902" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own Deformities, has wisely thrust the action of Seeing outward. We go forward with the Current, but to turn back towards our selves is a painful motion; so is the Sea mov'd and troubled when the Waves rush against one another. Observe, says every one, the motion of the Heavens, the Revolution of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; observe the quarrel of such a Person, take notice of such a ones Pulse, of such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers last Will and Testament; in sum, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looking high or low, on one side, before, or behind you. It was a Paradoxical command antiently given us by the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Delphos, Look into your self, discover your self, keep close to your self; call back your Mind and Will, that else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where consumes themselves into your self; you run out, you spill your self, carry a more steady hand: men betray you, men spill you, men steal you from your self.</hi> Dost thou not see that this World we live in keeps all its sights confin'd within, and its Eyes open to contemplate it self? 'Tis always Vanity for thee, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, but 'tis less Vanity when less extended. Excepting thee, (O man) said that <hi>God,</hi> every thing studies it self first, and has bounds to its Labours and Desires, according to its need. There is nothing so empty and necessitous as thou who imbracest the Universe, thou art the <hi>Explorator</hi> without Knowledge, the Magistrate without Jurisdiction; and after all, the Fool in the Play.</p>

I am very sollicitous, both by Study and Argument, to enlarge this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Insensibility, which is in me naturally rais'd to a pretty degree; so that consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I espouse, and am very much mov'd with very few things. I am clear sighted enough, but I fix upon very few Objects; have a sence delicate and tender enough, but an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and Application hard and negligent; I am very unwilling to engage my self. As much as in me lies, I imploy my self wholly for my self; and in this very Subject, should rather chuse to curb and restrain my Affection from plunging it self over Head and Ears into it, it being a Subject that I possess at the mercy of others, and over which Fortune has more right than I. So that even so much as to health, which I so much value, it were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for me, not so passionately to covet and desire it, as to find Diseases insupportable. A man ought to moderate himself betwixt the hatred of Pain, and of love of Pleasure. And <hi>Plato</hi> sets down a middle Path of Life betwixt both. But against such Affections as wholly

carry me away from my self, and fix me else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; against those, I say, I oppose my self with my utmost force and power. 'Tis my Opinion, that a man should lend himself to others, and only give himself to himself. Were my Will easie to lend it self out, and to be sway'd, I should not stick there: I am too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both by nature and usance,

The is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that would render my heat and obstinacy disgraceful, would peradventure vex me to the last degree. Should I set my self to it at the rate that others, who do pursue and grasp at so much, my Soul would never have the force to bear the Emotion and Alarms; it would immediately be disorder'd by this inward Agitation.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53645:903" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proper and natural Business, without medling with the concerns of others. Such as know how much they owe to themselves, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Offices they are bound to of their own, find, that Nature has cut them out work enough of their own to keep them from being idle. Thou hast Business enough at home, look to that. Men let themselves out to hire, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are not for themselves, but to be imploy'd for those to whom they have inslav'd themselves; this common Humour pleases not me. We must be thrifty of the liberty of our Souls, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let them out but upon just Occasions, which are very few, if we judge aright. Do but observe such as have accustom'd themselves to be at every ones call, they do it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently upon all, as well little as great Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in that which nothing concerns them, as much as in what imports them most: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themselves indifferently where ever there is business, and are without Life, when not in the bustle of Affairs. <hi>In negotiis sunt,</hi>

They only seek business for business sake.</hi> It is not so much that they will go, as it is that they cannot stand still: Like a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Stone that cannot stop till it can go no farther. Business, in a certain sort of men, is a mark of Understanding, and they are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it. Their Souls seek repose in Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Children do by being rock'd in a Cradle. They may pronounce themselves as service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Friends, as troublesome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. No one distributes his Money to others,

but every one therein distributes his Time and his Life. There is nothing of which we are so prodigal, as of those two things, of which to be thrifty, would be both commendable and useful. I am of a quite contrary Humour.

                        <hi>Fortune</hi> would have a hand in my Promotion, by this particular Circumstance which she put in of her own; not altogether vain; for <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> disdain'd the Ambassadors of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who came to make him a tender of a Burgess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of their City; but when they proceeded to lay before him, that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> were also in the Register, he thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the knowledge they had had of my
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53645:905" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Father, and the Honour they had for his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, had been the only Motives to conferr this Favour upon me: I plainly told them, that I should be very sorry any thing should make so great an Impression upon me as their Affairs, and the Concerns of their City had done upon him, whilst he had the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to which they had preferr'd me. I very well remember, from a Boy, to have seen him in his old Age, tormented with, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about the publick Affairs, neglecting the soft repose of his own House, to which the declension of his Age had reduc'd him for several years before; the management of his own Affairs, and his Health, and certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising his own Life, which was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being lost, by being ingag'd in long and painful Voyages on their behalf. Such was he, and this Humour of his proceeded from a marvellous good Nature. Never was there a more charitable and popular Soul. Yet this proceeding which I commend in others, I do not love to follow my self, and am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse. He had learnt, that a man must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himself for his Neighbour, and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were in no manner of consideration in comparison with the general Concern. Most of the Rules and Precepts of this World run this way, to drive us out of our selves into the wide World for the benefit of publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They thought to do a great Feat, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us from our selves, presuming we were but too much fixt at home, and by a too na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53645:905" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Inclination, and have said all they could to that purpose: for 'tis no new thing for wise men to preach things as they <hi>serve,</hi> not as they <hi>are.</hi> Truth has its Obstructions, Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, and Incompatibilities with us.

I believe, that in the Temple of <hi>Pallas,</hi> as we see in all other <hi>Religions,</hi> there were apparent <hi>Misteries</hi> to be expos'd to the <hi>People,</hi> and others more secret and high, that were only to be shown to such as were <hi>profess'd.</hi> 'Tis likely that in these, the true point of Friendship that every own owes to himself is to be found; not a false Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that makes us embrace <hi>Glory, Knowledge, Riches,</hi> and the like, with a principal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Affection, as Members of our Being: nor an indiscreet and effeminate Friendship, wherein it happens as with Ivy, that decays and ruines the Walls it does embrace: but a sound and regular Friendship, equally utile and pleasant.

But 'tis only borrow'd, and accidentally; his Mind being always in Repose, and in Health, not without Action, but without Vexation, without Passion. To be simply doing, costs him so little, that he acts even sleeping. But it must be set on going with Discretion; for the Body receives the Offices impos'd upon it, just according to what they are; the Mind oft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and makes them heavier at its own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, giving them what measure it pleases. Men perform like things with several sorts of Indeavour, and different Contention of Wit; the one does well enough without the other.

and the more, because I see others commonly fail on the contrary side.

I discover some remains of respect and good will; and am therefore of Opinion, that had it been possible, each of them would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done his Business without the ruine of the other, than with it. Take notice how much otherwise Matters went with <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla.</hi> We must not precipitate our selves so head-long after our Affections and Interest. As when I was young, I oppos'd my self to the progress of <hi>Love,</hi> which I perceiv'd to advance too fast upon me, and had a care lest it should at last become so pleasing, as to force, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate, and wholly reduce me to his Mercy: so I do the same upon all other Occasions where my Will is running on with too warm an Appetite. I lean opposite to the side it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to, as I find it going to plunge and make it self drunk with its own wine; I evade nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing its Pleasure so far, that I cannot reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it without infinite loss. Souls, that through their own Stupidity only discern things by halves, have this happiness, that they smart least with hurtful things. 'Tis a spiritual <hi>Leprosie</hi> that has some show of Health, and such a Health as Philosophy does not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn; but yet we have no Reason to call it Wisdom, as we often do. And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, some one anciently mock'd <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who in the depth of Winter, and stark naked, went hugging an Image of Snow for a Tryal of his Patience: this other meeting him in this Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, <hi>Art thou now very cold</hi>? said he,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>What great and exemplary thing can'st thou think thou do'st in imbracing that Snow</hi>? A man, to take a true measure of <hi>Constancy,</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily know what <hi>suffering</hi> is; but Souls that are to meet with adverse Events, and the Injuries of Fortune in their depth and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that are to weigh and taste them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their natural weight and sharpness, let such shew their skill in avoiding the <hi>Causes,</hi> and diverting the Blow.

In like manner, I have willingly avoided all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in my Affairs, and never coveted to have my estate contiguous to those of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and such with whom I coveted a strict Friendship; whence Matters of Unkindness and falling out do oft proceed. I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lov'd Cards and Dice, but have long since left them off, only for this Reason, that though I carried my losses as handsomly as another, I was not well satisfied and quiet within. Let a man of Honour, who ought to be sensible of the <hi>Lye,</hi> and who is not to take a scurvy excuse for Satisfaction, avoid Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of dispute.

Let us never attempt these Examples, we shall never come up to them. They set themselves resolutely, and without trouble, to behold the ruine of their <hi>Country,</hi> to which all the good they can contrive or perform is due. This is too much, and too rude for our common Souls to undergo. <hi>Cato</hi> indeed gave up the noblest Life that ever was upon this account; but it is for us meaner spirited men, to fly from the storm as far as we can; we ought to make provision of Resentment, not of Patience, and evade the Blows we cannot put by. <hi>Zeno,</hi>

seeing <hi>Chremonidez,</hi> a young man whom he lov'd, draw near to sit down by him, suddenly start up; and <hi>Cleanthes</hi> demanding of him the Reason why he did so, <hi>I hear,</hi> said he, <hi>that Physicians, especially order'd Repose, and forbid Emotion in all Tumors.

Now we should proceed contrary to the Reed, which at its first springing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a long and strait shoot, but afterwards, as if tir'd and out of Breath, it runs into thick and frequent joynts and knots, as so many pauses; which demonstrates, that it has no more its first Vigour and Constancy. 'Twere better to begin fair and coldly, and to keep
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53645:916" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a mans Breath, and vigorous attaques for the height and stress of the Business. We guide and govern Affairs in their Beginnings, and have them then in our own power; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when they are once at work, 'tis they that guide and govern us, and we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them. Yet do I not pretend by this to say, that this Councel has discharg'd me of all difficulty, and that I have not often had enough to do to curb and restrain my Passions. They are not always to be govern'd according to the measure of Occasions, and often have their Entries very sharp and violent. So it is, that thence good fruit and profit may be reap'd; except for those, who in well doing are not satisfied with any benefit, if Reputation be wanting: For in truth, such an effect is not valued but by every one to himself. You are better contented, but not more esteem'd; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you reform'd your self before you came into play, and that any Vice was discover'd in you: yet not in this only, but in all other Duties of Life, also the way of those who aim at Honour, is very different from that they proceed by; who propose to themselves Order and Reason. I find some, who rashly and furiously rush into the <hi>Lists,</hi> and cool in the <hi>Course.</hi> As <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, that as those who thorough Bashfulness, being soft and facile to grant whatever is desir'd of them, are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as frail to break their word, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; so likewise he who enters lightly into a Quarrel, is subject to go as lightly out. The
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53645:917" rendition="simple:additions"/>
same difficulty that keeps me from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, would, when once hot and engag'd in Quarrel, incite me to maintain it with great Obstinacy and Resolution. 'Tis the Tyranny of Custom, when a man is once engag'd, he must go through with it, or dye. <hi>Vndertake coldly,</hi> said <hi>Bias, but pursue with Ardour.</hi> For want of Prudence, men fall into want of Courage, which is more intolerable. Most Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Quarrels of these days of ours, are shameful and false, we only seek to save Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences, and in the mean time betray and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow our true Intentions. We salve the fact. We know very well how we said the thing, and in what sence we spoke it, and both all the Company, and of them our Friends with whom we would appear to have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, understand it well enough too. 'Tis at the expence of our Liberty, and the Honour of our Courage, that we disown our Thoughts, and seek refuge in Falsities, to be Friends. We give our selves the <hi>Lye,</hi> to excuse the <hi>Lye</hi> we have given to another. You are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if your Word or Action may admit of another Interpretation; 'tis your own true and sincere Interpretation of, and your real mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what you said or did, that you are thenceforward to maintain, whatever it cost you. Men speak to your Virtue, Honour, and Conscience, which are none of them to be disguis'd. Let us leave these pittiful Ways and Expedients to the Juglers of the Law. The Excuses and Satisfactions that I see every day
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53645:917" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made, and given to repair Indiscretion, seem to me more scandalous than Indiscretion it self. It were better to affront your Adversary a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, than to offend your self by giving him so unmanly a Satisfaction. You have brav'd him in your heat and anger, and you go to flatter and appease him in your cooler and better sense; and by that means lay your self lower, and at his feet, whom before you pretended to over-top. I do not find any thing a <hi>Gentleman</hi> can say so rude and vicious in him, as unsaying what he has said is infamous; when to unsay it is authoritatively extracted from him, for as much as Obstinacy is more excusable in a man of Honour than Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity can possibly be.

I am impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to be doing where my Will spurs me on; but this point is an enemy to Perseverance.

short, and moreover, a hazardous Conduct are necessary, I peradventure may do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but if it must be long, subtle, laborious, artificial and intricate, they were better call in some body else. All important Offices are not hard: I came prepar'd to carry my self a little more roughly, had there been great occasion; for it is in my power to do something more than I do, or than I love to do; I did not to my knowledge omit any thing that my Duty really requir'd; 'tis true, that I easily forget those Offices that Ambition mixes with Duty, and palliates with Title. Those are they, that for the most part, fill the Eyes and Ears, and give men the most satisfaction. Not the thing, but the appearance contents them. They think men sleep if they hear no noise. My Humour is no friend to tumult. I could appease a <hi>Riot</hi> without emotion, and chastise a Disorder with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration. If I stand in need of Anger and Inflammation, I borrow it, and put it on; my Manners are heavy, rather faint than sharp. I do not condemn a <hi>Magistrate</hi> that sleeps, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the People under his charge sleep as well as he: the <hi>Laws</hi> in that case sleep too.

Equity, Constancy, and such quiet and obscure Qualities, are no more thought on or regarded. Rough bodies make themselves felt, the smooth are imperceptly handled. Sickness is felt, Health little, or not at all, no more than the Oyls that foment us, in comparison of the Pains for which we are fomented. 'Tis acting for a man's Reputation and particular profit, not for the Publick good, to referr that to be done in the publick place, which a man may as well do in the Council-Chamber, and to noon-day, what might have been done the night before; and to be jealous to do that himself which his Colleague can do as well as he. So were some <hi>Chirurgions</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> wont to make their Operations upon <hi>Scaffolds</hi> in the sight of the People, to draw more practise and profit. They think that good Orders can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood but by the sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. Ambition is not a Vice of little People, and of so mean Abilities as ours. One said to <hi>Alexander,</hi> your <hi>Father</hi> will leave you a great Dominion, easie and pacifick; this Youth was emulous of his <hi>Father</hi>'s Victories, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his Government; and would not have injoy'd the Empire of the World in ease and peace. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> had rather dye Young, Beautiful, Rich, Noble, and Learned, and all this with Excellence, than to continue in the state of such a Condition. This disease is peradventure excusable in so strong and so full a Soul. When these wretched and dwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish Souls gull and deceive themselves, and

think to spread their Fame, for having given right judgment in an Affair, or continued the discipline of keeping the Guard of a <hi>Gate</hi> of their City, the more they think to exalt their heads, the more they shew their tails. This little well doing has neither body nor life; it vanishes in the first mouth, and goes no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from one Street to another.

We have Pleasures suitable to our Fortunes, let us not usurp those of Grandeur. Our own are more natural, and by so much more solid and sure, as they are more low. If not for that of Conscience, yet at least for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions sake, let us reject Ambition, let us dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain that thirst of Honour and Renown, so low and mendicant, that it makes us beg it of all sorts of People: <hi>Quae est ista laus quae pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit Ã¨ macello peti? What praise is that which is to be got in the Market?</hi> by abject means, and at what cheap rate soever. 'Tis dishonour to be so honour'd. Let us learn to be no more greedy, than we are capable of Honour. To be puff'd up with every Action that is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or of use, is only for such with whom such things are extraordinary and rare: They will value it as it costs them. How much more a good effect makes a noise, so much I abate of the goodness of it; and enter into suspition that it was more perform'd for noise, than upon the account of goodness. Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon the stall, 'tis half sold.

Innovation is of great lustre, but 'tis interdicted in this time, when we are press'd upon, and have nothing to defend our selves from but Novelties. To forbear doing, is oft as generous as to do, but 'tis less in the light; and the little of good that I have in me is of this kind. In fine, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in this Imployment of mine have been confederate with my Humour, and I thank them for it. Is there any one who desires to be sick that he might see his <hi>Physicians</hi> Practice? And would not that <hi>Physician</hi> deserve to be whip'd, who should wish the Plague amongst us, that he might put his Art in practice? I have never been of that wicked Humour, and common enough, to desire that the troubles and disorders of this City should elevate and honour my Government; I have ever willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributed all I could to their tranquility and ease.

Neither have I satisfied my self in this Imployment, but I have very near arrived at what I expected from my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and have yet much surpass'd what I promised them with whom I had to do: For I am apt to promise something less than what I am able to do, and than what I hope to make good. I assure my self that I have left no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Offence or Hatred behind me, and to leave a regret or desire of me amongst them.

This was properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> at once; and yet nothing for all that stirs from its place: my neighbours still find their seasons of sowing and reaping, the opportunities of doing their business, with the hurtful and propitious days, just at the same time, where they had time out of mind assign'd them. There was no more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour perceived in our old usance, than there is amendment found in this new alteration. So great an incertainty there is throughout; so gross, obscure, and dull is our understanding. 'Tis said, that this regulation might have been carried on with less inconvenience, by substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting. according to the example of <hi>Augustus,</hi> the <hi>Bissextile,</hi> which is in some sort a day of trouble, till we had exactly satisfied that debt; which is not perform'd neither by this corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and we yet remain some days in arrear: And yet by the same means such order might be taken for the future, ordering, that after the revolution of such a year, or such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, the supernumerary day might be alwayes thrown out, so that we could not henceforward erre above four and twenty

hours in our computation. We have no other account of time but years; the World has for many Ages made use of that only, and yet it is a measure that to this day we are not agreed upon; such a one, that we still doubt what form other <hi>Nations</hi> have variously given to it, and what was the true use of it. What does this saying of some mean, that the Heavens in growing old bow themselves down nearer towards us, and put us into an uncertainty even of hours and days? And that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> says of the Months, that <hi>Astrology</hi> had not in his time determin'd of the motion of the <hi>Moon?</hi> So what a fine condition are we in to keep <hi>Records</hi> of things past. I was just now rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, as I often do upon this, what a free and roving thing humane judgment is. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily see, that men, in things propos'd to them, more willingly study to find out the Reason than to find out the Truth: they slip over <hi>presuppositions,</hi> but are curious in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>consequences.</hi> They leave the <hi>things</hi> and fly to the <hi>causes.</hi> Pleasant praters!

Neither is Wine more pleasant to him that knows its first facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. On the contrary, both the Body and the Soul alter and interrupt the right they have of the use of the World, and of themselves, by

mixing with it the Opinion of Learning. Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects concern us, but the means not at all. To determine, and to distribute appertain to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority and command, as it does to subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to accept it. Let me reprehend our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom. They commonly begin thus: <hi>How is such a thing done?</hi> Whereas they should say, <hi>Is such a thing done?</hi> Our prattle is able to create a hundred other Worlds, and to find out the beginnings and contexture; it needs neither Matter nor Foundation. Let it but run on, it builds as well in the <hi>Air,</hi> as on the <hi>Earth</hi>; and with Inanity as well as Matter.

They escape our sight by their littleness: And in truth, a prudent, diligent, and subtle Inquisition is requir'd in such searches; indifferent, and not prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd. To this very hour all these Miracles and strange Events have conceal'd themselves from me, I have never seen greater Monster or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in the World than my self: a man grows familiar with all strange things by time and custom; but the more I frequent, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I know my self, the more does my own deformity astonish me, and the less I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my self.

Great abuse in the World is begot, or to speak more boldly, all the abuses of the World are begot by our being taught to be afraid of professing our ignorance, and that we are bound to accept all things we are not able to refute. We speak of all things by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Resolution. The Stile of <hi>Rome</hi> was, that even that which a witness depos'd for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen it with his own eyes, and what a Judge determin'd with his most certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was couch'd in this form of speaking, <hi>it seems.</hi> They make me hate things that are likely, when they impose them upon me for infallible.

very high price, upon them to cause a man to be roasted alive.

What is it we may not reason of at this rate? I might also say of these, that this jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Breeches, whilst so sitting at work, rouzes and provokes their desire, as the swin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and jolting of Coaches does that of our <hi>Ladies.</hi> Do not these Examples serve to make good what I said at first, that our Reasons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten anticipate the Effect, and have so infinite an extent of Jurisdiction, that they judge and exercise themselves, even in Inanity, and where there is no Being? Besides the flexibility of our invention to forge Reasons of all sorts of Dreams, our Imagination is equally facile to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive impressions of falsity, by very frivolous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences. For, by the sole authority of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and common Use of this <hi>Proverb,</hi> I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made my self believe, that I have had more Pleasure in a Woman by reason she was not

Which is the very same from which <hi>Suetonius</hi> draws a quite contrary Conclusion; for he says on the contrary, that <hi>Germanicus</hi> had made his Legs bigger by the continuation of the same Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.

He was also always one and the same, and rais'd himself not by starts, but by complexion, to the highest pitch of vigour; or to say bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he exalted nothing, but rather brought down, and reduc'd all asperities and difficulties to their original and natural Condition, and subjected their power: for in <hi>Cato</hi> 'tis most manifest, that there is a proceeding extended far beyond the common ways of ordinary men. In the brave exploits of his Life, and in his Death, we find him always mounted upon his manag'd Horses.

Death, and the nicest traverses that would present themselves in the course of humane Life. It has fallen out well, that the man most worthy to be known, and to be presented to the World for Example, should be he of whom we have the most certain knowledge; he has been pry'd into by the most clear-sighted men that ever were. The Testimonies we have of him are admirable both in Fidelity and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 'Tis a great thing that he was able so to order the pure Imaginations of a Child, that without altering, or wresting them, he has thereby produc'd the most beautiful effects of a humane Soul.

In the beginning of Popular Maladies, a man may distinguish the sound from the sick; but when they come to continue, as ours have done, the whole body is then infected from head to foot, and no part is free from Corruption.

Besides this shock I suffer'd others. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the inconveniences that moderation brings along with it in such a Disease.

The scituation of my House, and my friendliness to my Neighbours, presented me with one face, my Life and my Actions with another. They did not lay form'd accusations to my charge, for they had no
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53645:938" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foundation of so doing. I never slink, nor hide my head from the Laws, and whoever would have question'd me, would have done himself a greater prejudice than me. They were only mute suspitions that were whisper'd about, which never want apparence in so confus'd a mixture, no more than envious or idle heads. I commonly my self lend a hand to presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous injuries that Fortune scatters abroad against me, by a way I have ever had of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to justifie, excuse, or explain my self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that it were to referr my Conscience to arbitration, to plead in its behalf; <hi>Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitas enim, Argumentatione elevatur. For the Perspicuity of a cause is clouded and darken'd by Argumentation.</hi> And, as if every one saw as clearly into me as I do my self, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring from an accusation, I step up to meet it, and rather give it some kind of colour by an ironical and scoffing confession, if I do not fit totally mute, as of a thing not worth my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But such as look upon this kind of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of mine as too haughty a Confidence, have as little kindness for me as they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it the weakness of an indefensible cause; namely, the great ones, towards whom want of submission is a very great fault. Rude to all Justice that knows and feels it self, and is not submiss, humble, and suppliant. I have oft knock'd my head against this Pillar. So it is, that at what then befell me an ambitious man would have hang'd himself, and a covetous man would have done the same. I have no manner of care of getting.

But the losses that befell me by the injury of others, whether by theft or violence, go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as near my heart, as they would do to that of the most avaricious man. The offence troubles me, without comparison, more than the loss. A thousand several sorts of mischiefs fell upon me in the neck of one another; I could better have born them all at once. I have already been considering to whom amongst my Friends I might commit a helpless and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid Age; and having turn'd my Eyes quite round, I found my self at a loss. To let a man's self fall plum down, and from so great a height, it ought to be in the arms of a solid, vigorous, and fortunate Friendship. They are very rare, if there be any. At last I concluded that it was safest for me to trust to my self in my greatest Necessity, and if it should so fall out, that I should be but upon cold terms in <hi>Fortunes</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I should so much more pressingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to my own, and look so much the better to my self. Men on all occasions throw themselves upon foreign Assistances to spare their own, which are the only certain
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53645:939" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and sufficient ones with which they can arm themselves. Every one runs elsewhere, and to the future, forasmuch as no one is arriv'd at himself. And I was satisfied, that they were profitable Inconveniencies, forasmuch as ill Scholars are to be admonish'd<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with the <hi>Rod,</hi> when Reason will not do, as a crooked piece of Wood is by fire and straining to be reduc'd to straightness. I have a great while preach'd to my self to stick close to my own Concerns, and separate my self from the affairs of others; yet I am still turning my Eyes aside. A <hi>bow,</hi> a <hi>kind word</hi> or <hi>look</hi> from a great Person tempts me; of which <hi>God</hi> knows how little scarcity there is in these days, and how little they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie. I moreover, without wrinkling my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, hearken to the perswasions are offer'd me, to draw me into some place of Traffick, and so gently refuse it, as if I were half willing to be overcome. Now to so indocile a spirit blows are requir'd, and this Vessel which thus chops and cleaves, and is ready to fall one piece from another, is to have the hoops forc'd down with good sound stroaks of a Mallet. Secondly, that this accident serv'd me for Exercise to prepare me for worse, if I, who both by the benefit of Fortune, and by the condition of my Manners, hop'd to be the last, should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be one of the first should be trapt in this storm.

To which may be added, that it is half true. <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ex publicis malis sentimus, quantum ad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatas res pertinet.

It was Health, but not otherwise than in comparison of the Sickness that has succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. We are not fall'n from any great height. The corruption and thievery which is in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Office, seems the most insupportable to me. We are less injuriously rifled in a Wood than in a place of security. It was an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Juncture of particular Members, rotten to emulation of one another, and the most of them with inveterate Ulcers, that neither requir'd nor admitted of any Cure. This conclusion therefore did really more animate than press

me by the assistance of my Conscience, which was not only at peace within it self, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and I did not find any reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my self. Also, as <hi>God</hi> never sends <hi>Evils</hi> any more than <hi>Goods,</hi> absolutely pure to men, my Health continued at that time more than usually good; and, as I can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, there are few things that I cannot do with it. It afforded me means to rouze up all my provisions, and to lay my hand before the wound, that would else peradventure have gone farther, and experimented in my Patience, that I had some opposition against Fortune; and that it must be a great shock could throw me out of the Saddle. I do not say this to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <hi>her</hi> to give me a more vigorous Charge; I am her humble Servant, and submit to her pleasure. Let her be no other towards me than she has used to be in <hi>God</hi>'s Name. Do you ask if I am sensible of her Assaults? Yes, certainly I am. But, as those who are possess'd and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd with sorrow, may sometimes suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves nevertheless by intervals to taste a little Pleasure, and are sometimes surpriz'd with a Smile.

And in the mean time, from the foot-steps of her Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that little, which by the benefit of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, remains of her Image imprinted in the life of this rustick <hi>rout</hi> of unpolish'd men, <hi>Science</hi> is constrain'd every day to borrow thence to make a pattern for her Disciples of Constancy, Tranquility, Innocence. 'Tis pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to see, that these complain of so much fine Knowledge, being to imitate this foolish sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and that in the most principal acts of Virtue. And that our Wisdom must learn even from Beasts, the most profitable instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the greatest and most necessary Concerns of humane life: As, how we are to live and dye, mannage our Fortunes, love, and bring up our Children, and to maintain Justice.

He ow'd his Life not to himself, but to the Example of the World. Had it not been a publick dammage, that he should have concluded it after a lazy and obscure manner?

He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents, in an inartificial boldness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantive security, the pure and first impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ignorance of <hi>Nature.</hi> For it is to be believ'd, that we have naturally a fear of Pain, but not of Death, by reason of it self. 'Tis a part of our Being, and no less essential than Living. To what end should <hi>Nature</hi> have begot in us a hatred to it, and a horror of it, considering that it is of so great utility to her in maintaining the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and Vicissitude of her Works? And that in this universal Republick it conduces more to truth and augmentation, than to loss or ruine.

But besides all this, is not the way of arguing which <hi>Socrates</hi> here makes use of, equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, both in simplicity and vehemence? Really, it is much more easie to speak like <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and to live like <hi>Caesar,</hi> than to speak and live as <hi>Socrates</hi> did. There lies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream degree of perfection and difficulty: Art cannot reach it. Now our Faculties are not so train'd up. We do not try, we do not know them, we invest our selves with those of others, and let our own lye idle. As some one may say of me, that I have here only made a Nosegay of cull'd Flowers, and have brought nothing of my own but the thread that ties them. In earnest, I have so far yielded to the publick Opinion, that those borrow'd Ornaments do accompany me, but I do not think that they totally cover and
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53645:948" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hide me; that is quite contrary to my design, who desire to make a shew of nothing but what is my own, and what is my own by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>: and had I taken my own advice, I had at all adventures spoken purely alone. I dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more load my self every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my purpose and first Method, upon the account of Idleness, and the humour of the Age. If it misbecome me, as I believe it does, 'tis no matter, it may be of use to some other. Such there are, who quote <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> who never saw either of them: and I also have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of places far enough distant from their Source. Without pains and without Learning, having a thousand Volumes about me in the place where I write, I can presently borrow, if I please, from a dozen such Scrap-gatherers as I am, Authors that I do not much trouble my self withall, wherewith to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this Treatise of Physiognomy. There needs no more, but a praeliminary Epistle of the German <hi>cut,</hi> to stuff me with proofs, and we by that means go a begging for a fading <hi>Glory,</hi> and a cheating the sottish World. These <hi>Rhapsodies</hi> of <hi>Common Places,</hi> wherewith so many furnish their <hi>Studies,</hi> are of little use but to common Subjects, and serve but to shew, and not to direct us: a ridiculous fruit of Learning, that <hi>Socrates</hi> does so pleasantly canvase against <hi>Euthidemus.</hi> I have seen Books made of things that were never either studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or understood; the Author committing to several of his learned Friends the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of this and t'other matter to compile it; contenting himself for his share to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the <hi>Design,</hi> and by his industry to have ty'd together this <hi>Fagot</hi> of unknown Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the Ink and Paper at least are his. This is to buy or borrow a <hi>Book,</hi> and not to make one; 'tis to shew men, not that a man can make a <hi>Book,</hi> but that, whereof they may be in doubt, that he cannot make one. A <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> in my hearing boasted, that he had clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd two hundred and odd common places in one of his <hi>Judgments</hi>; in telling which, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd himself of the Glory that had been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to him. In my Opinion, a pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and absurd Vanity for such a <hi>Subject,</hi> and such a <hi>Person.</hi> I do quite contrary; and amongst so many borrow'd things, am glad if I can steal one, disguising and altering it for some new service, at the hazard of having it said, that 'tis for want of understanding its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use. I give it some particular address of my own hand, to the end it may not be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely strange. These set their thefts to shew, and value themselves upon them. And also they have more credit with the Laws than with me. We Naturalists think that there is a great and incomparable preference in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Invention, to that of Quotation. If I would have spoke by Learning, I had spoke sooner, I had writ in a time nearer to my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when I had more Wit and better Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and would sooner have trusted to the vigour of that Age than this, would I have

Two of my Acquaintance, great men in this faculty, have, in my Opinion, lost half, in refusing to publish at forty years old, that they might stay till threescore.

guess at our internal Complexions, and our <hi>Fortunes</hi> to come, is a thing that does not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry directly and simply lye under the Chapter of Beauty and Deformity, no more than eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good odour and serenity of Air promises Health, nor all fogg and stink, Infection, and a time of Pestilence.

throw my self headlong into her arms, and have hitherto found more reason to applaud, than to condemn my self for so doing; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ever found her more sollicitious of, and more a friend to my affairs, than I am my self. There are some actions in my Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Conduct may justly be call'd difficult; or, if they please, prudent.

The last comers kept themselves on horseback in my Court, whilst their Leader was with me in the Parlour, who would not have his Horse set up in the Stable, saying, he would immediately retire, so soon as he should have news of the rest of his men. He saw himself Master of his Enterprize, and nothing now remain'd but the execution. He has since several times said, (for he was not asham'd to tell the story himself) that my Countenance and freedom had snatch'd the Treachery out of his hands. He again mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his horse; his followers having continually their Eyes intent upon him, to see when he would give the sign; very much astonish'd to
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:53645:953" rendition="simple:additions"/>
see him march away and leave his prey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Another time, relying upon I know not what <hi>Truce,</hi> newly publish'd in the Army, I took a Journey through a very tickle Countrey. I had not rid far, but I was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and two or three Parties of Horse, from several places, were sent out to take me; one of them the third day overtook me, where I was charg'd by fifteen or twenty Gentlemen in <hi>Vizors,</hi> followed at a distance by a Band of <hi>Argoulets.</hi> Here was I surrendred, and taken, withdrawn into the thick of a neigh'bring Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, dismounted, sob'd, my Trunks rifled, my Cabinet taken, and my Horses and Equipage divided amongst new Masters. We had in this Copse a very long Contest about my <hi>Ransom,</hi> which they set so high, that it very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd I was not known to them. They were moreover in a very great debate about my Life; and in truth, there were several cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that threatned me of the danger I was in.

behold a sudden and unexpected alteration; I saw the Chief amongst them return to me with gentler Language, making search amongst the Troopers for my squander'd Goods, and causing as many as could be recover'd to be restor'd to me, even to my Cashet; but the best present they made me was my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the rest did not much concern me in those dayes. The true cause of so sudden a change, and of this more mature deliberation, without any apparent impulse, and of so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous a repentance, in such a time, in a complotted and deliberated Enterprize, and become just by usance, (for at the first dash I plainly confess'd to them of what Party I was, and whither I was going) in earnest, I do not yet rightly apprehend.

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53645:954"/>
me over and over again, that I was oblig'd for my deliverance to my Countenance, and the liberty and boldness of my Speech, that rendred me unworthy of such a misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and demanded assurance from me of the like courtesie.

If my Face did not answer for me, if men did not read in my Eyes, and in my Voice, the innocency of my Intention, I had not liv'd so long without quarrels, and without giving offence, with the indiscreet liberty I take, right or wrong to say whatever comes at my Tongues end, and to judge so rashly of things. This way may with reason appear uncivil, and ill adapted to our way of Conversation, but I have never met with any who have judg'd it outragious or malicious, or that took offence at my liberty, if he had it from my own mouth.

which is a means much more weak and cheap. But <hi>Truth</hi> is so great a thing, that we ought not to disdain any Mediation that will guide us to it. <hi>Reason</hi> has so many forms, that we know not to which to take; Experience has no fewer. The Consequence we will draw from the conference of Events is unsure, by reason they are always unlike. There is no quality so universal in this Image of things, as diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and variety. Both the Greeks, the Latins, and we, for the most express Example of simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, have pitch'd upon that of Eggs.

And that he who so clearly expresses himself; whatever he speaks or writes, cannot find in this any way of declaring himself that does not fall into doubt and contradiction? If it be not that these <hi>Princes</hi> of that <hi>Art,</hi> applying themselves with a peculiar attention to invent and cull out hard words, and contrive artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Clauses, have so weigh'd every Syllable, and so thoroughly sifted every sort of quirk, that they are now confounded and intangled in the infinity of Figures, and so many minute Divisions, that they can no more fall into any Rule or prescription, nor any certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. <hi>Confusum est quidquid usque in pulvere in sectum est.

Every place saies, with <hi>Commentaries</hi> of Authors there is great scarcity. Is it not the principal and most reputed knowledge of our Ages to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Learned? Is it not the common and almost end of all Studies? Our Opinions are grafted upon one another; the first serves for

From whence it come to pass, that he which is mounted highest has oft more Honour than Merit; for he is got up but a grain upon the shoulders of the last but one. How oft, and peradventure how foolishly, have I stretch'd my Book, to make it speak of it self; foolishly, if for no other reason but this; that I ought to call to mind what I say of others who do the same. These frequent amorous glances that they so oft cast upon their works, witness that their Hearts pant with self love, and that even the disdainful Severity wherewith they lash and scourge them, are no other than the wanton Dissimulations of a nataral kindness: According to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose valuing and undervaluing himself, oft spring from the same air of Arrogancy; I urge for my excuse, that I ought in this to have more liberty than others, forasmuch as I write of my self, and of my Writings, very near as I do of my other Actions; and let my Theam return upon my self, I know not whether or no every one else will take it. I have observ'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> has left as many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Disputes about the doubt of his Opinions, and more than he himself has rais'd upon the Holy Scriptures.

He put out one question, and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnest us a whole Hive. As no Event, nor no Face intirely resembles another, so do they not intirely differ. An ingenious mixture of Nature. If our Faces were not alike, we could not distinguish man from Beast; if they were not unlike, we could not distinguish one man from another. All things hold by some Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, all Example halts. And the relation which is drawn from Experience is always faulty and imperfect; comparisons are always coupled at one end or other. So do the <hi>Laws</hi> serve and are fitted to every one of our Affairs, by some wrested, bias'd and forc'd Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since the Ethick <hi>Laws</hi> that concern the particular Duty of every one in himself, are so hard to be taught and observ'd, as we see they are; 'tis no wonder if those who govern so many particulars, is much more.

the form of this <hi>Justice</hi> that governs us, 'tis a true Testimony of humane weakness, so full it is of Error and Contradiction. What we find to be Favour and Severity in Justice, and we find so much of them both, that I know not whether the mean is so often met with, are sick parts, and unequal Members of the very Body, and offence of <hi>Justice.</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People run to bring me News in great haste, that they just left in a Forrest of mine, a man with a hundred Wounds upon him, who was yet breathing, and begg'd of them Water for pitty's sake, and help to carry him to some place of relief; saying, they durst not come near him, but run away, lest the Officers of Justice should catch them there; and as it falls out with those who are found near a murther'd Person, they should be call'd in question about this accident to their utter ruine, having neither Money nor Friends to defend their Innocence. What should I have said to these People? 'Tis certain that this Office of humanity would have brought them into trouble. How many Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents have we known that have been punish'd without the <hi>Judges</hi> fault, and how many that have not arriv'd at our knowledge? This hapen'd in my time. Certain men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to die for a murther committed, their Sentence if not pronounc'd, at least determin'd and concluded on. The <hi>Judges</hi> just in the nick, are advertis'd by the Officers of an inferiour <hi>Court</hi> hard by, that they have some men in Custody, who have directly confess'd the said
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:53645:961" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Murther, and make an undubitable discovery of all the particulars of the <hi>Fact.</hi> 'Twas then notwithstanding put to the question, whether or no they ought to suspend Execution of the <hi>Sentence</hi> already past upon the first accus'd. They consider'd the novelty of the Example, and the consequence of reversing Judgments, that the Sentence of Death was duly pass'd, and the Judges acquit of repentance: To conclude, these poor <hi>Devils</hi> were sacrifis'd to the <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Justice. Philip,</hi> or some other, provided against a like Inconvenience, after this manner. He had condemn'd a man in a great fine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, by a determinate <hi>Judgment.</hi> The truth some time after being discover'd, he found that he had pass'd an unjust Sentence; on one side was the Reason of the Cause, on the other side the Reason of the Judiciary Forms. He in some sort satisfied both, leaving the Sentence in the state it was, and out of his own Purse recompencing the interest of the condemn'd party. But he had to do in a repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable affair, mine were irreparably hang'd. How many <hi>Sentences</hi> have I seen more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than the Crimes themselves? All which makes me remember the ancient Opinions, <hi>That there is a necessity a man must do wrong by retail, who will do right in gross; and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in little things, that will come to do Justice in great: that humane justice is form'd after the model of Physick, according to which,</hi> all that is utile, is also just and honest; and of what is held by the Stoicks, <hi>That Nature her self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53645:961" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrary to Justice in most of her works</hi>; and of what is receiv'd by the <hi>Cyrennicks, that there is nothing just of it self, but that Customs and Laws make Justice</hi>: And what the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorians</hi> hold, that maintain <hi>Theft, Sacriledge,</hi> and all sorts of <hi>Vncleanness</hi> just in a wise man, if he knows them to be profitable to him: there is no Remedy. I am in the same case that <hi>Alcibiades was,</hi> that I will never, if I can help it, put my self into the hands of a man who shall determine of my Head, where my Life and Honour shall more depend upon the care and diligence of my <hi>Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> than my own innocence. I would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my self with such a Justice as would take notice of my good Deeds as well as my ill, and where I had as much to hope as to fear Indemnity is not sufficient pay to a man who does better than not to do amiss; but our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice presents us but one hand, and that the left hand too; let him be who he will, he shall be sure to go off with less. In <hi>China,</hi> of which Kingdom the Governments and Arts, without commerce with, or knowledge of ours, surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses our best Examples, in several parts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence; and of which, the History gives me to understand, how much greater and more various the World is, than either the <hi>Ancients</hi> or <hi>We</hi> have been able to penetrate. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers deputed by the <hi>Prince</hi> to visit the state of his <hi>Provinces,</hi> as they punish those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves ill in their Places, so do they liberally reward those who have carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

above the common sort, and beyond the necessity of their Duty; they there present themselves, not only to be approved but to get, nor simply to be paid but to be presented. No <hi>Judge,</hi> thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> has ever yet spoke to me in the quality of a <hi>Judge,</hi> upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatever, whether my own, or that of another, whether <hi>Criminal</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi>; nor no <hi>Prison</hi> has ever receiv'd me, so much as upon the account of entring in to see it. Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renders the very outside of a Goal formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me: I am so inamour'd of Liberty, that should I be interdicted the remotest corner of the <hi>Indies,</hi> I should live a little more uneasie. And whilst I can find either <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Air</hi> open in any part of the World, I shall never lurk any where, where I must hide my self. <hi>Good God!</hi> how ill should I indure the condition wherein I see so many People, nail'd to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Kingdom, depriv'd of the priviledge of entring into the principal <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Courts,</hi> and the liberty of the publick <hi>Roads,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quarrell'd with our <hi>Laws.</hi> If those under which I live, should but wag a finger at me by way of menace, I would immediately go seek out others, let them be where they would; all my little Prudence in the <hi>Civil War</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are now ingag'd, is imploy'd, that they may not hinder my liberty of riding from place to place. Now the <hi>Laws</hi> keep up their credit, not for being <hi>just,</hi> but because they are <hi>Laws:</hi> It is the mystical foundation of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they have no other; and 'tis well it is
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:53645:962" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so, for they are oft made by Fools; for the most part, by men that out of hatred to equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, go less in equity; but always by men who are vain and irresolute <hi>Authors.</hi> There is nothing so much, nor so grosly, nor so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily faulty, as the <hi>Laws.</hi> Whoever obeys them because they are just, does not justly obey them as he ought. Our <hi>French Laws,</hi> by their irregularity and deformity, do in some sort lend a helping hand to disorder and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as is manifest in their Dispensation and Execution. The Command is so perplext and inconstant, that it in some sort excuses both Disobedience, and the Vice of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the administration, and the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. What fruit then soever we may extract from Experience, yet that however will little advantage our Institution, which we draw from foreign Examples; if we make so little profit of that we have of our own, which is more familiar to us, and doubtless sufficient to instruct us in that whereof we have need.

In this <hi>Vniversity,</hi> I suffer my self to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly and negligently lead by the general Law of the World.

but yet one that is easie, quiet, and salutiferous; and that very well performs what the other promises, in him who has the good luck to know how to employ it sincerely and regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is to say, according to <hi>Nature.</hi> The most simply to commit a mans self to <hi>Nature,</hi> is to do it the most wisely. Oh, what a soft, easie, and wholsom Pillow is ignorance and incuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, whereon to repose a well contriv'd Head!

Whoever will remember the hazards he has run of those that threaten'd him, and the light occasions that have remov'd him from one state to another, will by that prepare himself for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture changes, and the acknowledgment of his Condition.

In all my other Errors I do the same, and find from this Rule great utility to Life, I regard not the <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>individual,</hi> as a Stone that I have stumbled at; I learn to suspect my steps throughout, and am careful to place them right. To learn that a man has said or done a foolish thing, is a thing of nothing. A man must learn that he is nothing but a fool, a much more ample and important Instruction. The false steps that my Memory has so often made, even then when it was most secure and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it self, are not idly thrown away, it may now swear to me, and assure me as much as it will, I shake my Ears, and dare not trust it, the first opposition that is made to my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, puts me into suspence; and I durst not rely upon it in any thing of moment, nor warrant it in another bodies concerns: and were it not that what I do for want of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, others do more often for want of Faith; I should always in matter of fact, rather choose to take truth from anothers mouth than my own.

in considering my self, does also fit me to judge tollerably of others; and there are few things whereof I speak better, and with better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. I happen very oft more exactly to see and distinguish the conditions of my Friends, than they do themselves. I have astonish'd some with the pertinence of my description, and have given them warning of themselves. By having from my Infancy been accustomed to contemplate my own Life in those of others, I have acquir'd a Complexion studious in that particular. And when I am once intent upon it, I let few things about me, whether Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, Humours, or Discourses, that serve to that purpose, escape me. I study all, both what I am to avoid, and what I am to do. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in my Friends, I discover by their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons their inward inclinations; not to order this infinite variety of so diverse and distracted Actions into certain Genders and Chapters, and distinctly to distribute my parcels and divisions under known heads and classes.

Wisdom is a solid and intire building, of which every piece keeps its place, and carries its mark.<note place="margin">

A <hi>King</hi> is not to be believ'd when he brags of his Constancy in standing the shock of the Enemy for his Glory, if for his Profit and Amendment, he cannot stand the Liberty of a Friends Advice, which has no other Power but to pinch his Ear, the remainder of its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect being still in his own Hands. Now there is no Condition of Men whatever who stand in so great need of true and free advertisement as they do. They support the publick Life, and are to satisfie the Opinion of so many Spectators, that when men have us'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from them whatever should divert them from their own way, they insensibly have found themselves involv'd in the hatred and detestation of their People,<note place="margin">Free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for Kings.</note> sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so slight Occasions as they might have avoided without any prejudice even of their Pleasures themselves, had they been advis'd and set right in time.

To conclude all this <hi>Hodg-podg</hi> which I scribble, here is nothing but a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Essays</hi> of my own Life, which for the internal soundness is exemplary enough to take instruction against the Hair; but as to bodily health, no man can furnish out more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Experience than I, who present it pure, and no way corrupted and chang'd by Art or Opinion. Experience is properly upon its own Dung-hill in the Subject of <hi>Physick,</hi> where <hi>Reason</hi> wholly gives it place. <hi>Tyberius</hi> said, that whoever had liv'd twenty years, ought to be responsible to himself for all things that were hurtful or wholsome to him, and know how to order himself without <hi>Physick.</hi> And he might have learnt it of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his <hi>Disciples</hi> to be sollicitous of their Health, as the chiefest study, added, that it was hard if a man of Sense, having a care of his Exercises and Diet, did not better know than any Physician, what was good or ill for him. And also <hi>Physick</hi> does profess always to have Experience for the touch of its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And <hi>Plato</hi> had reason to say, that to be a right <hi>Physician,</hi> it would be necessary that he who would take it upon him, should first himself have pass'd through all the Diseases he will pretend to cure, and thorough all the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:53645:969" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Circumstances whereof he is to judge. 'Tis but Reason they should get the <hi>Pox</hi> if they will know how to cure it; for my part, I should put my self into such hands: for the others but guide us like him who paints the Sea-Rocks and Ports upon his Cloth, and there makes the Figure of a Ship to sail in all security; and put him to't in earnest, he knows not at which end to begin. They make such a Description of our Maladies, as a <hi>Town-Crier</hi> does of a lost Horse or Dog, such a Colour, such a Height, such an Ear; but bring him to him, and he knows him not for all that. <hi>God</hi> grant that <hi>Physick</hi> may one day give me some good and visible relief, namely, when I shall cry out in good earnest.

The Arts that promise to keep our Bodies and Souls in Health, promise a great deal, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, there is none that less keep their Promise. And in our times, those that make profession of these Arts amongst us, less manifest the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than any other sort of men. One may say of them at the most, that they sell Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Drugs, but that they are <hi>Physicians</hi> a man cannot say. I have liv'd long enough to be able to give an account of the Custom that has carried me so far.

I have no Custom that has not varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to accidents; but I only record those that I have been best acquainted with, and that hitherto have had the greatest possession of me. My form of Life is the same in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that it is in Health, the same Bed, the same Houses, the same Meat, and the same Drink serve me in both Conditions alike; I add nothing to them but the moderation of more or less, according to my Strength and Appetite. My Health is to maintain my wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed state without disturbance. I see that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness puts me off it on one side, and if I will be rul'd by the <hi>Physicians,</hi> they will put me off on the other; so that by <hi>Fortune</hi> and by <hi>Art</hi> I am out of my way. I believe nothing more certainly than this, that I cannot be offended by the usage of things to which I have been so long accustom'd. 'Tis for Custom to give a form to a mans Life, such as it best pleases, she is all in all in that: 'Tis the Beverage of <hi>Circe</hi> that varies our Nature as she pleases best. How many Nations, and but three steps from us, think the fear of the serene that so manifestly is hurtful to us, a ridiculous fancy, and our Water-men and Peasants despise it.

                        <hi>Hearths,</hi> by the same Arguments which we commonly make use of in decrying their <hi>Stoves</hi>: For, to say the truth, that smother'd heat, and then the scent of that heated matter of which the Fire is compos'd, very much offend such as are not us'd to them; not me. But as to the rest, the Heat being always equal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and universal, without flame, without smoke, and without the wind that comes down our Chimnies, they may many ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce comparison with ours. Why do we not imitate the Roman <hi>Architecture?</hi> For, they say, that anciently Fires were not made in their Houses, but on the outside, and at the foot of them, from whence the heat was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to the whole Fabrick by Pipes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd in the Wall, which were drawn twining about the Rooms that were to be warm'd: Which I have seen plainly describ'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>Seneca.</hi> This Gentleman hearing me commend the Conveniences and Beauties of his <hi>City,</hi> which truly deserves it, began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment me that I was to go away. And the first inconvenience he alledg'd to me was, the heaviness that the Chimneys elsewhere brought upon me. He had heard some one make this Complaint, and fixt it upon us, being by Custom depriv'd of the means of perceiving it at home. All heat that comes from the Fire makes me weak and dull, and yet <hi>Evenus</hi> said, that Fire was the best condiment of Life. I rather chuse any other way of making my self warm.

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:53645:971" rendition="simple:additions"/>
useful what we see before us, and judge of it lively enough to draw it into Example. For if we say that we want authority to procure faith to our testimony, we speak from the purpose; forasmuch as, in my opinion, of the most ordinary, common, and known things, could we but find out their light, the greatest miracles of Nature might be form'd, and the most wonderful Examples, especially upon the subject of humane actions. Now upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I am speaking of, setting aside the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples I have gathered from <hi>Books,</hi> and what <hi>Aristotle</hi> says of <hi>Andron</hi> the <hi>Argian,</hi> that he travell'd over the arid Sands of <hi>Lybia</hi> without drinking; a Gentleman, who has very well behav'd himself in several Employments, said, in a place where I was, that he had rid from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the heat of <hi>Summer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Drink at all; He is very healthful, and vigorous for his Age, and has nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in the usance of his Life, but this, to live sometimes two or three months, nay, a whole year without drinking. He is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a thirst, but he lets it pass over, and holds, it is an Appetite which easily goes off of it self, and drinks more out of humour, than either for need or pleasure. Here is another Example; 'Tis not long ago, that I found one of the Learned'st men in <hi>France,</hi> among those of the greatest Fortunes, studying in a corner of a Hall that they had separated for him with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestry, and about him a rabble of his Servants, that you may be sure were rude and loud
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:53645:971" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enough. He told me, and <hi>Seneca</hi> almost says the same of himself, he made an advantage of this noise; as if beaten with this rattle, he so much the better recollected and retir'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into himself for Contemplation, and that this tempest of Voices repercuss'd his thoughts within himself. Being at <hi>Padua,</hi> he had his Study so long scituated in the rattle of Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Tumult of the publick place, that he not only form'd himself to the contempt, but even to the use of noise, for the service of his Studies. <hi>Socrates</hi> answer'd <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who being astonish'd at his Patience, ask'd him how he could endure the perpetual scolding of his Wife, <hi>Why,</hi> said he, <hi>as those do who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to the ordinary noise of wheels to draw Water.</hi> I am quite otherwise, I have a tender Head, and easily discompos'd, when 'tis bent upon any thing, the least buzzing of a Fly tears it into pieces. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his youth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by the Example of <hi>Sextius,</hi> put on a positive resolution of eating nothing but what died of it self, pass'd over a whole year in this Diet, and, as he said, with pleasure, and only left it off, that he might not be suspected of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up this Rule from some new Religion, by which it was prescrib'd. But he took up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, from the Precepts of <hi>Attalus,</hi> a custom, not to lye any more upon any sort of bedding that yielded under a man's weight, but even to his old age made use of such as would not yield to any pressure. What the usance of his time made him account Authority, that of ours
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:53645:972" rendition="simple:additions"/>
makes us look upon as Effeminacy and Ease. Do but observe the difference betwixt the way of living of my Laborers, and that of mine; the <hi>Indies</hi> have nothing more remote both from my Force and Method. I know very well, that I have pick'd up Boys from begging to serve me, who soon after have quitted both my <hi>Kitchin</hi> and <hi>Livery,</hi> only that they might return to their former course of Life: and found one afterwards gathering <hi>Mussels</hi> out of the <hi>Sink</hi> for his Dinner, whom I could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Intreaties nor Threats, reclaim from the sweetness he found in Indigence. <hi>Beggars</hi> have their Magnificences and Delights as well as the Rich; and, 'tis said, their <hi>Dignities</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> These are the Effects of Custom, she can mould us not only into what form she pleases, (and yet the <hi>Sages</hi> say, we ought to apply our selves to the best, which she will soon make easie to us) but also to change and variation, which is the most noble and most usefull of all she makes us perfect in. The best of my bodily perfection is, that I am flexible, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little obstinate. I have Inclinations more proper and ordinary, and more agreeable than others; but I am diverted from them with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ado, and easily slip into a contrary course. A young man ought to cross his own <hi>Rules</hi> to awake his Vigour, and to keep it from growing faint and rusty. And there is no course of Life so weak and sottish, as that which is carried on by Rule and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.

He shall oft throw himself even into Excesses, if he will take my advice, otherwise the least Debauch will ruine him. He will render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self uneasie, and disagreeable in conversation. The worst quality in a well bred man is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and an obligation to a certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way: and it is particular, if not pliable and supple. It is a kind of reproach not to be able, or not to dare to do what we see others do before us. Let such as those sit at home. It is in every man indecent, but in a Souldier vicious and intolerable; who, as <hi>Philopoemenes</hi> said, ought to accustom himself to all variety and inequality of Life. Though I have been brought up, as much as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to liberty and indifference, yet so it is, that growing old, and having more settled upon certain forms (my Age is now past In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and I have henceforward nothing to do but to keep it up as well as I can) Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom has already, e're I was aware, so imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its Character in me, in certain things, that I look upon it as a kind of excess to leave them off. And, without a force upon my self,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:53645:973" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot sleep in the day-time, nor eat between meals, nor break-fast, nor go to bed, without a great interval betwixt eating and sleeping, as of three hours after Supper; nor get Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but before I sleep, and never standing upon my feet, nor endure my own Sweat, nor quench my thirst either with pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Wine, nor keep my head long bare, nor cut my hair after dinner; and should be as uneasie without my Gloves as without my Shirt, or without washing when I rise from Table, or out of my bed; and could not lye without a Canopy and Curtains, as if they were necessary things: I could dine without a Table-cloth, but without a clean Napkin, after the <hi>German</hi> fashion, very incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. I foul them more than they, or the <hi>Italians</hi> do, and make but little use either of Spoon or Fork. I am sorry that the same is not in use amongst us, that I see the Example of in Kings; which is, to change our Napkins at every service, as they do our Plates. We are told of that laborious Souldier <hi>Marius,</hi> that growing old, he became nice in his Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never drank but out of a peculiar Cup of his own. I, in like manner, have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd my self to fancy a certain form, of Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and do not willingly drink in common Glasses, no more than from a common hand: All metal offends me in comparison of a clear and transparent matter: let my eyes taste too, according to their capacity. I owe several other such niceties to Custom. <hi>Nature</hi> has also
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53645:973" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on the other side helpt me to some of hers, as no more to be able to endure two full meals in one day without overcharging my Stomach, nor a total abstinence from one of those meals, without filling my self with Wind, drying up my Mouth, and dulling my Appetite, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great inconvenience in the Evening Air. For of late years, in night marches, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen to be all night long, after five or six hours my Stomach begins to be queasie, with a violent pain in my Head, so that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways vomit before the day can break. When others go to break-fast I go to sleep, and when I rise, am as brisk and gay as before. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been told, that the <hi>serene</hi> never desperst it self but in the beginning of the Night; but for certain years past, long and familiar frequenting a Lord possess'd with this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>serene</hi> is more sharp and dangerous about the declining of the <hi>Sun,</hi> an hour or two before his Set, which he carefully avoids, and despises that of the Night; he had almost imprinted in me, not only his Discourse, but his Opinion. What, shall the very doubt and inquisition wound our Imagination so as to turn to our Inconvenience? Such as absolutely and on a sudden give way to their Propensions, put a total ruine upon themselves. And I am sorry for several Gentlemen, who, through the Folly of their <hi>Physicians,</hi> have in their Youth and Health put themselves into Consumptions. It were yet better to endure a <hi>Cough,</hi> than by disusance for ever to lose the commerce of the

common Life in an Action of so great use. Ill natur'd <hi>Science,</hi> to interdict us the sweetest and most pleasant hours of the Day: Let us keep Possession of it to the last. For the most part a man hardens himself by being obstinate, and corrects his Constitution; as <hi>Caesar</hi> did the <hi>Falling-sickness,</hi> by dint of Contempt. A man should addict himself to the best <hi>Rules,</hi> but not inslave himself to them; if not to such, if there be any such, to which the Obligation and Servitude are of Profit. Both <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> go to stool, and <hi>Ladies</hi> too; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lives are bound to <hi>Ceremony,</hi> mine that is obscure and private, enjoys all natural Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. <hi>Souldier</hi> and <hi>Gascon</hi> are also quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a little subject to Indiscretion, wherefore I shall say this of this action of exonerating Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is necessary to referr it to certain prescrib'd and nocturnal Hours, and force a mans self to it by Custom, as I have done; but not to subject himself, as I have done in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years, to a particular Convenience of Place and Seat for that purpose, and make it troublesome by long sitting: and yet in the foulest Offices, is it not in some measure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable to require more care and cleanliness? <hi>Natura homo mundum,</hi>

off the usage of Life. Both well and sick, I have ever willingly suffer'd my self to obey the Appetites that prest upon me. I give great Authority to my propensions and desires. I do not love to cure one Disease by another. I hate remedies that are more troublesom than the Disease it self. To be subject to the Stone, and subject to abstain from eating Oysters, are two Evils instead of one. The Disease tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us on the one side, and the remedy on the other. Since we are ever in danger of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking, let us rather hazard, rather deferr the discovery of the mistake till after pleasure. The World proceeds quite contrary, and thinks nothing profitable that is not painful; Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity stands suspected to it. My Appetite is in several things of it self happily enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the health of my Stomach. Acrimony and quickness in Sawces were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to me when young, but my Stomach dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking them, since my Taste incontinently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. Wine is hurtful to sick People; and 'tis the first thing that my mouth disrelishes when I am sick, and with an invincible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste. Whatever I take against my liking, does me harm; and nothing hurts me that I eat with Appetite and delight; I never receiv'd harm by any action that was very pleasant to me; and accordingly have made all Medicinal conclusions mightily give way to my Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

to be, but that <hi>Nature</hi> must have a hand in it. And then how easie a thing is it to satisfie the Fancy?

<pb n="519" facs="tcp:53645:976" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abstinence to contend with his Disease. His fellow <hi>Physicians</hi> said, that on the contrary, this abstinence from Drink had dried his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy up, and bak'd the Gravel in his Kidneys. I have observ'd, that both in Wounds and Sicknesses, speaking discomposes and hurts me as much as any disorder I can commit. My Voice spends and tires me, for 'tis loud and forc'd; so that when I have gone to whisper some great Persons about Affairs of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, they have oft desired me to moderate my Voice. This Story deserves a place here. Some one in a certain Greek School, speaking loud as I do, the Master of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> sent to him to speak softly, <hi>Tell him then he must send me,</hi> reply'd the other, <hi>the tone he would have me speak in.</hi> To which the other reply'd, <hi>That he should take the tone from the Ears of him to whom he spake.</hi> It was well said, if to be understood, <hi>Speak according to the Affair you are speaking about to your Auditor,</hi> for if it mean, <hi>'tis sufficient that he hears you, or govern your self by him</hi>; I do not find it to be reason. The tone and motion of my Voice carries with it a great deal of the Expression and Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my meaning, and 'tis I who am to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, to make my self understood. There is a Voice to instruct, a Voice to flatter, and a Voice to reprehend. I will not only that my Voice reach him, but peradventure that it strike and pierce him. When I rattle my Foot-man with sharp and bitter Language, it would be very pretty for him to say, <hi>Pray Master speak
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:53645:977" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lower, I hear you very well. Est quaedam Vox ad auditum accomodata, non Magnitudine sed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietate. There is a certain Voice accomodated to the Hearing, not by the Loudness, but Propriety.</hi> Speaking is half his that speaks, and half his that hears; the last of which ought to prepare himself to receive it, according to its motion and rebound. Like <hi>Tennis</hi> Players, he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Ball, shifts and prepares, according as he sees him move who strikes the stroke, and according to the stroke it self. Experience has moreover taught me this, that we lose our selves with impatience. Evils have their Life and Limits, their Diseases, and their Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Constitution of Maladies is form'd by the pattern of the Constitution of Animals, they have their Fortunes and Days limited from their Birth. Whoever attempts imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to cut them short by force in the middle of their Course, does lengthen and multiply them, and incenses instead of appeasing them. I am of <hi>Crantor's</hi> Opinion, that we are neither obstinately and wilfully to oppose <hi>Evils,</hi> nor truckle under them for want of Courage, but that we are naturally to give way to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Condition and our own, we ought to grant free passage to Diseases: And I find they stay less with me, who let them alone. And I have lost those which are reputed the most tenacious and obstinate of their own defervescence, without any Help or Art, and contrary to their <hi>Rules.</hi> Let us a little permit <hi>Nature</hi> to take her own way; she better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands

her own Affairs than we. But such a one died, and so shall you, if not of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, of another. And how many have not escap'd dying, who have their <hi>Physicians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at their tails? Example is a bright and universal mirror, and in all Sciences. If it be a delicious Medicine, take it, 'tis always so much present good. I will never stick at the Name nor the Colour, if it be pleasant and gratefull to the Pallat: Pleasure is one of the chiefest kinds of profit. I have suffer'd Rheums, gouty Defluxions, Relaxations, Palpitations of the Heart, Meagrims, and other Accidents, to grow old, and dye in me a natural Death, which I have been rid of when I was half fit to nourish and keep them. They are sooner prevail'd upon by Courtesie than huffing; we must patiently suffer the Laws of our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are born to grow old, to grow weak, and to be sick in despite of all Medicine.

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53645:978" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compos'd of contrary things, of several notes, sweet and harsh, sharp and flat, spritely and solemn; and the <hi>Musician</hi> who should only affect one of these, what would he be able to do? He must know how to make use of them all, and to mix them; and we likewise, the <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>evils</hi> which are consubstantial with Life: Our Being cannot subsist without this mixture, and the one are no less necessary to it than the other.

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:53645:979" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me that 'tis for my good to have the Stone: that the compositions of my Age are naturally to suffer some decay: that it is now time they should begin to disjoynt, and to confess a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: 'tis a common necessity, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, either miraculous or new: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in pay what is due to old Age, and I cannot expect a better account: that Society ought to comfort me, being fallen into the most common infirmity of my time.<note place="margin">The Stone ordinary in old men, especially men of Quality.</note> I see every where men tormented with the same Disease; and am honour'd by the Fellowship, forasmuch as men of the best Quality are most frequently afflicted with it; 'tis a noble and dignified Disease.

consider this chastisement, 'tis very easie in comparison of that of others, and inflicted with a Paternal tenderness: Do but observe how late it comes; it only seizes on and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates that part of thy Life, which is upon the matter steril, and lost; having, as it were by compact, given way to the licence and pleasures of thy Youth. The fear and the compassion that the People have of this Disease, serves thee for matter of glory. A quality, whereof if thou hast thy Judgment purified, and that thy Reason be right and sound, thy Friends will yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing discover some tincture in thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. 'Tis a pleasure to hear it said of a man's self, <hi>here is great force, here is great patience.</hi> Thou art seen to sweat with pain, to look pale and red, to tremble, vomit blood, to suffer strange contractions and convulsions, by starts to let great tears drop from thine eyes, to urine thick, black, and dreadful Water, or to have it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by some sharp and craggy stone, that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:53645:980" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pricks and tears the neck of the Bladder, whilst all the while thou entertain'st the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with an ordinary countenance, drolling by fits with thy Servants, making one in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued discourse, now and then excusing thy pain, and making thy suffrance less than it is. Dost thou call to mind the men of past times, who so greedily sought Diseases to keep their Virtue in breath and exercise? Put the case that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> force and put thee on to this glorious School, into which thou wouldst never have enter'd of thy own free will. If thou tell'st me, that it is a dangerous and mortal Disease; what others are not? For 'tis a Physical cheat to except any, and to say, that they do not go directly to death: what makes matter if they tend that way by accident, and if they easily slide and slip into the path that leads us to it? But thou dost not dye because thou art sick, thou diest because thou art living. Death kills thee without the help of Sickness: And in some, Sickness has deferr'd Death, who have liv'd longer by reason that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves always dying. To which may be added, that as in Wounds, so in Diseases, some are medicinal and wholsom. The Cholick is oft no less long-liv'd than you. We see men with whom it has continu'd from their Infancy even to their extreme old Age, and if they had not broke company, it would have afflicted them longer still; you ofter kill it, than it kills you: And though it present you the image of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, were it not a good Office
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:53645:980" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to a man of such an Age, to put him in mind of his end? And, which is worse, thou hast no longer any thing that should make thee desire to be cur'd. Common Necessity will however presently call thee away. Do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how artificially and gently she puts thee out of taste with Life, and weans thee from the World; not forcing and compelling thee with a tyrannical Subjection, like so many other Infirmities which you see old men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted withall, that hold them in continual Torment, and keep them in perpetual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermitted Pains and Dolors; but by Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements and Instructions at several intervals, intermixing long pauses of repose, as it were to give thee leave to meditate and ruminate upon thy lesson at they own ease and leisure: to give thee means to judge aright, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Resolution of a man of Courage, she presents to thee the intire state of thy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in good and evil, and one while a very chearfull, and another an insupportable Life, in one and the same day. If thou imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest not Death, at least thou shak'st hands with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t once a Month; by which thou hast more cause to hope that it will one day surprise thee without warning. And that being so oft conducted to the water side, and thinking thy self to be still upon the accustom'd terms, thou and thy Confidence will at one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be unexpectedly wasted over. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reasonably complain of Diseases that fairly divide the time with Health. I am oblig'd to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:53645:981" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fortune for having so oft assaulted me with the same sort of weapons; she forms and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions me by usance, hardens and habituates me so, that I can know within a little for how much I shall be quit. For want of natural memory, I make one of Paper; and as any new symptom happens in my Disease, I set it down; from whence it falls out, that being now almost past all sorts of Examples, if any astonishment threaten me, tumbling over these little loose notes, as the <hi>Sybills</hi> Leaves, I never fail of finding matter of Consolation from some favourable <hi>Prognostick</hi> in my past Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Custom also makes me hope better for the time to come. For the Conduct of this Evacuation having so long continued, 'tis to be believ'd that <hi>Nature</hi> will not alter her course, and that no other worse accident will happen than what I already feel. And besides, the condition of this Disease is not unsuitable to my prompt and sudden Complexion. When it assaults me gently, I am afraid, for 'tis then for a great while; but it has naturally brisk and vigorous Excesses. It claws me to purpose for a day or two. My Reins hold out an Age without Alteration, and I have almost now liv'd another since they chang'd their state. <hi>Evils</hi> have their Periods as well as <hi>Goods,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the Infirmity draws towards an end. Age weakens the heat of my Stomach, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of which being less perfect, it sends this crude matter to my Reins; and why at a certain revolution may not the heat of my
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:53645:981" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Reins be also abated, so that they can no more petrifie my flegm, and Nature find out some other way of purgation: Years have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently help'd me to drain certain <hi>Rhumes</hi>; and why not these excrements which furnish matter for <hi>Gravel</hi>? But is there any thing sweet in comparison of this sudden change, when from an excessive pain, I come, by the voiding of a Stone, to recover, as from a flash of Lightning, the beautiful light of health, so free and full as it happens in our sudden and most sharp <hi>Cholicks</hi>? Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in the pain suffer'd, that a man can counterpoize to the pleasure of so sudden an amendment? Oh!<note place="margin">Health more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant after Sickness.</note> how much does Health seem so much the more pleasant to me after so near and contiguous sickness, as that I can distinguish them in the presence of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their greatest bravery, wherewith they dress themselves in emulation, as if to make head against, and to dispute it with one another! What the <hi>Stoicks</hi> say, that Vices are profitably introduc'd, to give value to, and to set off virtue; we can with better reason, and less temerity of censure, say of Nature, that she has given us pain for the honour and service of pleasure and indolence. When <hi>Socrates,</hi> after his Fetters were knock'd off, felt the pleasure of that itching which the weight of them had caus'd in his Legs, he rejoyc'd to consider the strict alliance betwixt pain and pleasure, how they are link'd together by a necessary connexion, so that by turn they
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:53645:982" rendition="simple:additions"/>
follow and mutually beget one another; and cry'd out to <hi>Aesop,</hi> that he ought out of this consideration, to have taken a Body proper for a fine Fable. The worst that I see in other diseases is, that they are not so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in their effect, as they are in their issue. A man is a whole year in recovering, and all the while full of weakness and fear. There is so much hazzard, and so many steps to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at safety, that there is no end on't. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have unmuffled you of a Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and then of a Callot, before they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to walk abroad and take the Air, to drink Wine, lye with your Wife, and eat Melons, 'tis odds you relapse into some new Distemper. The <hi>Stone</hi> has this priviledge, that it carries it self clean off. Whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers always leave behind them some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and alteration, that renders the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy subject to some new disease, and lend a hand to one another. These are excusable, that content themselves with possessing us, without extending it farther, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their consequences: But courteous and kind are those whose passage brings us any profitable issue. Since I have been troubled with the Stone, I find my self freed from all other accidents, much more methinks than I was before, and have never had any <hi>Feaver</hi> since. I argue, that the extreme and frequent vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that I am subject to, purge me; and on the other side, my nausities, and the strange Fasts I am forc'd to keep, digest my present
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:53645:982" rendition="simple:additions"/>
humours; and Nature in those Stones voids whatever there is in me of superfluous and hurtful. Let them never tell me that it is a medicine too dear bought. For what avails so many stinking <hi>Apozemes,</hi> Causticks, Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Sweats, Setons, Diets, and so many other methods of Cure; which oft, by reason we are not able to undergo their violence and importunity, bring us to our Graves: So that when I am ill, I look upon it as <hi>Physick,</hi> when well, for an absolute deliverance. And here is another particular benefit of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; which is, that it almost plays its game by it self, and lets me play mine, or else I only want Courage to do it; for in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fury, I have endured it ten Hours together on Horse-back; do but endure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you need no other regiment: Play, Run, do this, and the t'other thing too if you can, your debauch will do you more good than harm. Say as much to one that has the Pox, the Gout, or Bursten Belly. The other diseases have more universal obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wrack our actions after another kind of manner, disturb our whole order, and to their consideration engage the whole state of life. This only pinches the Skin, it leaves the Understanding and the Will wholly at our own dispose, as also the Tongue, Hands and Feet. It rather awakes than stupifies you. The Soul is struck with the ardour of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> over-whelm'd with an <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd by a sharp <hi>Megrim,</hi> and finally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astonish'd
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:53645:983" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by all the Diseases that hurt the whole Mass, and the most noble parts: This never meddles with the Soul. If any thing goes amiss with her, 'tis her own fault, she betrays, dismounts, and abandons her self. There are none but Fools who suffer themselves to be perswaded, that this hard and massy body which is bak'd in our Reins is to be dissolv'd by drinks; wherefore, when it is once stirr'd, their is nothing to be done but to give it passage, and also it will take it of it self. I moreover observe this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular convenience in it, that it is a disease wherein we have little to guess at. We are dispenc'd from the trouble into which other diseases throw us, by the incertainty of their <hi>Causes, Conditions</hi> and Progress. A trouble that is infinitely painful. We have no need of Consultations and Doctoral Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the sense well enough informs us both what it is and where it is. By such like Arguments, weak and strong, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> did the disease of his Old Age, I try to rock asleep and amass my imagination, and to dress its Wounds. If I find them worse to morrow, I will provide new remedies and applications. That this is true, I am come to that pass of late, that the least motion forces pure blood out of my Reins: And what of that, I stirr nevertheless as before, and ride after my Hounds with a Juvenile ardour; And find that I have very good satisfaction for an accident of that importance, when it
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:53645:983" rendition="simple:additions"/>
costs me no more but a little heaviness and uneasiness in that part. 'Tis some great Stone that wasts and consumes the substance of our Kidneys, and of my Life, which I by little and little evacuate, not without some natural pleasure, as an excrement hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward superfluous and troublesome. Now if I feel any thing to rowl and stir, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I should trouble my self to consult my Pulse or my Urine, thereby to put my self upon some tormenting prevention. I shall soon enough feel the pain, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it more and longer, by the disease of fear. Who fears to suffer, does already suffer what he fears. To which may be added, that the Doubts and Ignorance of those who take upon them to expound the designs of <hi>Nature</hi> and her internal Progressions, and the many false <hi>Prognosticks</hi> of their <hi>Art,</hi> ought to give us to understand that her ways are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable and utterly unknown. There is great uncertainty, variety and obscurity,<note place="margin">The gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases by Urine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> in what she either promises or threats. Old Age excepted, which is an undoubted sign of the approach of Death, in all other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I see few signs of the future, wherein we may ground our Divination. I only judge of my self by my real sense, and not by discourse: To what end, since I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to bring nothing to it but expectation and patience. Will you know how much I get by this? Observe those that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and who rely upon so many diverse
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:53645:984" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perswasions and counsels; how oft and how much they labour under imagination, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bodily pain at all. I have many times pleas'd my self, being well and in safety, and deliver'd from these dangerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, to communicate them to the <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as but then beginning to discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in me; where I under-went the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sentences of their dreadful conclusions, being very well at ease, and was so much the more obliged to the favour of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> and better satisfied of the vanity of this <hi>Art.</hi> There is nothing that ought so much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to Youth, as Activity and Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Our Life is nothing but motion: I move with great difficulty, and am slow in every thing, whether in Rising, going to Bed, or Eating. Seven of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is early for me; and where I govern, I never Dine before Eleven, nor Sup till after Six. I have formerly attributed the cause of the <hi>Feavers,</hi> and other Diseases I have faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to the heaviness that long sleeping had brought upon me, and have ever repented my sleeping again in the morning. <hi>Plato</hi> is more angry at the excess of sleeping, than that of drinking: I love to lye hard, and alone, even without my Wife, as <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> do, but well cover'd with Cloathes: They never warm my Bed, but since my being grown Old, they give me for need, warm Cloths to lay to my Feet and Stomach. They find fault with the great <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:53645:984" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a great Sleeper; not, in my opinion, for any other reason, if not that men were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd, that he alone should have nothing in him to be found fault withal. If I have any thing curious in my way of Living, 'tis rather in my Lying than any thing else; but generally, I give way and accommodate my self as much as any one to necessity. Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has taken up a great part of my Life, and I yet continue at the Age I now am, to sleep eight or nine hours together; I wean my self to my advantage, from this propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to sloth, and am evidently the better for so doing. I find the change a little hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but in three days 'tis over, and see but few that live with less Sleep, when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and that more constantly exercise themselves, nor to whom long Journeys are less troublesome. My Body is capable of a firm, but not of a violent or sudden Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I evade of late all violent exercises, and such as make me sweat, wherein my Limbs grow weary before they are hot. I can stand a whole day together, and am ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weary of walking: But from my Youth, I never lov'd to Ride upon Pavements. On foot, I go up to the Breech in dirt, and little Fellows as I am, are subject in the Streets to be Elbow'd and Justled, for want of Presence and Stature, and I have ever lov'd to repose my self, whether sitting or lying, with my Heels as high, or higher than my Seat.

I am easily satisfied with few Dishes, and am an enemy to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Favorinus,</hi> that in a Feast they must snatch from you the meat you like, and set another Plate of another sort before you, and that it's a pitiful Supper, if you do not sate your Guests with the Rumps of several Fowls, and that the <hi>Beccafico</hi> only deserves to be all eaten.

There is indeed this difference, that 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to oblige a mans appetite to things that are most easie to be had, but 'tis always Vice to oblige a mans self.

This humour of his yet aim'd at another end, that is, to make me familiar with those people, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men which most need our assistance;

believing that I should be more oblig'd rather to regard them who extended their Arms to me, than those who turn'd their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. And for this Reason also it was, that he provided me <hi>Godfathers</hi> of the meanest Fortune, to oblige, and bind me to them. Neither has his design succeeded altogether ill; for, whether it be upon the account of glory, because there is no more honour in such a condescension, or out of a natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, that has a very great power over me, I have a very kind inclination towards the meaner sort of people.

I am

naturally more apt to follow the example of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who still more readily gave his assistance to those that had most need of him, than to those who had power to do him good; than I do to that of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who was of an humour to truckle under the great, and to domineer over the meanest sort of people. Long sittings at meat both trouble me, and do me harm; for, be it for want of better countenance, or that I have accustomed my self to it from a Child, I eat all the while I sit. Therefore it is, that at my own House, though the meals there are of the shortest, I usually sit down a little while after the rest, after the manner of <hi>Augustus</hi>; but I do not imitate him in rising also before the rest of the Company: On the contrary, I love to sit still a long time after, and to hear them talk, provided I am none of the talkers, for I tire, and hurt my self with speaking upon a full Stomach, as much as I find it pleasant and very wholsome to argue, and to strain my voice before Dinner. The antient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had more reason than we,<note place="margin">Long meals of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</note> in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart for Eating, which is a principal action of Life, if not diverted by other extraordinary business, many hours, and the greatest part of the night eating and drinking more deliberately than we do, who perform all our Actions in <hi>Post</hi> haste; and in extending this natural pleasure to more leisure and better use, intermixing with their meals several pleasant and profitable
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:53645:989" rendition="simple:additions"/>
offices of conversation. They whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it is have a care of me, may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily hinder me from eating any thing they think will do me harm; for in such things I never covet nor miss any thing I do not see: But withal, if it once comes in my sight, 'tis in vain to perswade me to forbear, so that when I design to Fast, I must be parted from those that eat Suppers, and must have only so much given me, as is required for a regular Collation; for if I sit down to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I forget my resolution. When I order my <hi>Cook</hi> to alter the manner of dressing any Dish of Meat, all my Family know what it means, that my Stomach is out of order, and that I shall scarce touch it: I love to have all meats that will indure it very little boyl'd or roasted, and love them mightily mortified, and even to stinking in many. Nothing but hardness generally offends me, (of any other quality) I am as patient and indifferent as any man I have known: So that, contrary to the common humour, even in Fish, it oft happens, that I find them both too fresh and too firm: Not for want of Teeth, which I ever had good, even to Excellence, and that Age does but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to threaten at this time of my Life. I have ever been us'd every Morning to rub them with a Napkin, and before and after Dinner. <hi>God</hi> is favourable to those whom he makes to dye by degrees; 'tis the only bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of old Age; the last Death will be so much
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:53645:990" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the less painful; it will kill but a quarter of a man; or but half a one at most. I have one Tooth lately fall'n out without drawing, and without pain: it was the natural term of its duration. Both that part of my Being, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, are already dead, and others half dead, of those that were most active, and in highest esteem during my vigorous years; so that I melt and steal away from my self. What a folly would it be in my understanding to apprehend the height of this fall, already so much advanc'd, as if it were from the utmost Precipice? I hope I shall not. I in truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a principal Consolation in the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Death, that it will be just and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and that henceforward I cannot herein either require or hope from Destiny any other but unlawfull Favour. Men make themselves believe that they have formerly had, as greater Statures, so longer Lives. But they deceive themselves; and <hi>Solon,</hi> who was of those el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times, does nevertheless limit the Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life to threescore and ten years.

It is too much to abuse Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make her trot so far that she must be forc'd to leave us, and abandon our Conduct, our Eyes, Teeth, Legs, and all the rest, to the mercy of a foreign and begg'd assistance; and to resign us into the hands of <hi>Art,</hi> being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of following us her self. I am not very fond either of Sallets or Fruits, except <hi>Melons.</hi> My Father hated all sorts of <hi>Sawces,</hi> and I love them all. Eating too much hurts me, but for the quality of what I eat, I do not yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know that any sort of Meat disagrees with my Stomach; neither have I observed that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Full-moon</hi> or <hi>Decrease, Spring</hi> or <hi>Autum,</hi> are hurtfull to me. We have in us motions that are inconstant, and for which no reason
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:53645:991" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can be given. For Example, I found Radishes first grateful to my Stomach, since that nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and now at present grateful again. In se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other things likewise I find my Stomach and Appetite to vary after the same manner. I have chang'd and chang'd again, from <hi>White</hi> to <hi>Claret,</hi> from <hi>Claret</hi> to <hi>White.</hi> I am a great lover of Fish, and consequently make my <hi>Fasts, Feasts,</hi> and my <hi>Feasts, Fasts</hi>; and believe what some People say, that it is more easie of digestion than Flesh. As I make a Conscience of eating Flesh upon Fish-days, so does my Taste make a Conscience of mixing Fish and Flesh, the difference betwixt them seems to me to be too great so to do. From my Youth I have us'd sometimes to be out of the way at Supper, either to sharpen my Appetite against the next Morning, (for as <hi>Epicurus</hi> fasted and made lean Meals to accustom his Pleasure to make shift without abundance; I on the contrary do it to prepare my Pleasure to make better and more chearful use of Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance) or else I fasted to preserve my Vigour for the service of some Action of Body or Mind: for both the one and the other of those are cruelly dull'd in me by Repletion (and above all things, I hate that foolish coupling of so healthful and spritely a <hi>Goddess</hi> with that little belching <hi>God,</hi> bloated with the fume of his Liquor) or to cure my sick Stomach, and for want of fit Company. For I say as the same <hi>Epicurus</hi> did, that a man is not so much to regard what he eats, as with whom; And
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:53645:991" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commend <hi>Chilo,</hi> that he would not engage himself to be at <hi>Perianders</hi> Feast, till he first was inform'd who were to be the other <hi>Guests.</hi> No Dish is so acceptable to me, nor no Sawce so alluring, as that which is extracted from Society. I think it to be more wholesome to eat more liesurely and less, and to eat ofter: but I will have the value of Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and Hunger enhanc'd. I should take no pleasure to be fed with three or four pittiful and stinted Repasts a day, after a <hi>Physical</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Who will assure me, that if I have a good Appetite in the morning, I shall have the same at Supper: But especially, let us old Fellows take the first opportune time of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and leave to <hi>Almanack-makers</hi> the <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>Prognosticks.</hi> The utmost fruit of my health is pleasure; let us take hold of the present and known. I avoid constancy in these Laws of Fasting. Who will that one Form shall serve him, let him evade the continuing of it; We harden our selves in it, our Forces are there stupified and laid asleep: six months after you shall find your Stomach so inured unto it, that all you have got is only the loss of your liberty of doing otherwise, but to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. I never keep my Legs and Thighs warmer in <hi>Winter</hi> than in <hi>Summer,</hi> one single pair of Silk-stockings is all: I have suffer'd my self for the relief of my Rheums to keep my Head warmer; and my Belly upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Cholick: my Diseases in a few dayes habituated themselves, and disdain'd my
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:53645:992" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ordinary Provisions. I was presently got from a single <hi>Cap</hi> to a <hi>Napkin,</hi> and from a <hi>Napkin</hi> to a quilted <hi>Cap.</hi> The <hi>belly-pieces</hi> of my Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet serve only for decency, they signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if I do not add a <hi>Hares-skin</hi> or a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macher, and wear a <hi>Callot</hi> upon my Head. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this gradation, and you will go a very fine way to work. I am resolv'd to proceed no further, and would leave off those too, if I durst. If you fall into any new inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all this is labour lost; you are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to it; seek out some other way: thus do such ruine and destroy themselves, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be pester'd with these enforc'd and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Rules; they must add something more, and something more after that, there is no end on't. For what concerns our Affairs and Pleasures, it is much more commodious; as the <hi>Ancients</hi> did, to lose a man's Dinner, and deferr making good cheer, till the hour of retirement and repose, without breaking a day; and so was I formerly us'd to do. For health, I since by experience find on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that it is better to dine, and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion is better made waking. I am not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apt to be thirsty, either well or sick, my Mouth is indeed apt to be dry, but without thirst; and commonly I never drink but with thirst that is created by eating, and then I drink as hard as any. I drink pretty well for a man of my pitch: In Summer, and at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry meal, I do not only exceed the limits of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that drank but thrice precisely; but
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:53645:992" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not to offend <hi>Democrates</hi> his Rule, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that men should stop at four times, as an unlucky number; I proceed for need to the fifth glass, about three half pints. For the little glasses are my favourites; and I take a delight to drink them off, which other People avoid as an indecent thing. I mix my Wine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with half, sometimes the third part Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And when I am at home, by an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom that my Fathers <hi>Physician</hi> prescib'd both to him and himself, they mix that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for me in the Buttery three or four hours before 'tis brought in. 'Tis said, that <hi>Cranaus</hi> King of <hi>Athens</hi> was the inventer of this Custom of dashing Wine with Water; whether profitable or no, I have heard dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I think it more decent and wholsom for Children to drink no Wine till after sixteen or eighteen years of age. The most usual and common method of living is the most becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: all particularity in my opinion is to be avoided, and I should as much hate a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that mix'd Water with his Wine, as I should do a <hi>Frenchman</hi> that drank it pure. Publick <hi>Vsance</hi> gives the <hi>Law</hi> in those things. I fear a Fog, and fly from Smoke, as from the Plague, (the first repairs I fell upon in my own house were the <hi>Chimnies</hi> and <hi>Houses of Office,</hi> the common and insupportable nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sances of all old Buildings) and amongst the difficulties of War, reckon the choaking dust they make us ride in a whole day together. I have a free and easie respiration, and my Colds
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:53645:993" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the most part go off without offence to the Lungs, and without a Cough. The heat of Summer is more an enemy to me than the cold of Winter; for, besides the incommodity of Heat, less remediable than Cold, and besides the force of the Sun-beams that strike upon the Head, all glittering light offends my eyes, so that I could not now sit at dinner over against a flaming Fire. To dull the whiteness of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in those times when I was more wonted to read, I laid a piece of glass upon my Book, and found my Eyes much reliev'd by it. I am to this hour ignorant of the use of Spectacles, and can see as far as ever I did, or any other. 'Tis true, that in the Evening I begin to find a little trouble and weakness in my Sight, if I read; an exercise that I have always found troublesome, especially by Night. Here is one step back, and a very sensible one; I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire another, from the second to the third, and so to the fourth, so gently, that I shall be stark blind before I shall be sensible of the age and decay of my sight: so artificially do the <hi>fatal Sisters</hi> untwist our Lives. And yet I doubt that my Hearing begins to grow thick, and you shall see I shall have half lost it, when I shall still lay the fault on the Voices of those that speak to me. A man must screw up his Soul to a high pitch, to make it sensible how it ebbs away. My walking is quick and firm, and I know not which of the two, my Mind, or my Body, I have most to do to keep in the same state. That <hi>Preacher</hi> is very much my
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53645:993" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Friend, that can oblige my Attention a whole Sermon through. In places of Ceremony, where every ones Countenance is so starch'd, where I have seen the <hi>Ladies</hi> keep even their Eyes so fixt; I could never order it so, that some part or other of me did not lash out; so that though I was <hi>set,</hi> I was never <hi>setled</hi>: As the Philosopher <hi>Chrysippus</hi> his Chamber-Maid said of her Master,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chrysippus</hi> drunk in his Legs.</note> that he was only drunk in his Legs, for it was his Custom to be always kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Legs about in what place soever he sat; and she said it at a time when the Wine having made all his Companions drunk, he found no alteration in himself at all. The same may also be said of me from my Infancy, that I have either folly or quicksilver in my feet, so much stirring and unsettledness there is in them wherever they are plac'd. 'Tis indecent, besides the hurt it does to ones Health, and even to the pleasure of eating, to eat so greedily as I do; I oft bite my Tongue, and sometimes my Fingers for haste,<note place="margin">Greedy eating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by <hi>Diogenes.</hi>

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:53645:994" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Reason he had from <hi>Plato,</hi> that it is the Custom of popular men to call <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and <hi>Singing-men</hi> to Feasts, for want of good Discourse; and pleasant talk, with which men of Understanding know how to entertain one another. <hi>Varro</hi> requires all this in great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, Persons of graceful Presence, and agreeable Conversation, that are neither silent nor bablers; Neatness and Delicacy both of Meat and Place, and fair Weather. A good Treat is neither slightly artificial, nor a little voluptuous; neither the greatest <hi>Captains,</hi> nor the greatest <hi>Philosophers</hi> have disdain'd either the Use or Science of eating well, My Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation has deliver'd three of them to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody of my Memory, which Fortune rendred sovereignly sweet to me upon several occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in my most flourishing Age. My present state excludes me. For every one, according to the good temper of Body and Mind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he then finds himself, does from thence make out to his own use a particular grace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but I, who but crawl upon the Earth, hate this inhumane Wisdom, that will have us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and hate all culture of the Body. I look upon it as an equal Injustice to loath natural Pleasures, as to be too much in love with them. <hi>Xerxes</hi> was a <hi>Fop,</hi> who, environ'd with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Delights, propos'd a reward to him that could find him out others; but he is not much less so, who cuts off any of those Pleasures that Nature has provided for him. A man should neither pursue nor flie, but receive them. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53645:994" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them I confess a little too affectionately and kindly, and easily suffer my self to follow my natural Propension. We have nothing to do to exaggerate their inanity, they themselves will make us sufficiently sensible of it. Thanks be to our sick Minds that abate our Joys, and put them out of taste with them, as with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. They entertain both themselves and all they receive, one while better, and another worse, according to their insatiable, vagabond, and versatile Essence.

I, who boast that I so curiously and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly imbrace the conveniences of Life, do find, when I most nearly consider them, but very little more than Wind. But what? We are all Wind throughout, and moreover the Wind it self loves to bluster and shift from corner to corner more discreetly than we, and contents it self with its proper Offices, without desiring stability and solidity, Qualities that nothing belong to it. The pure Pleasures, as well as the pure Displeasures of the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, say some, are the greatest, as was express'd by the balance of <hi>Critolaus.</hi> 'Tis no wonder. It makes them to its own liking, and cuts them out of the whole Cloth. Of which I every day see notable Examples, and peradventure
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:53645:995" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be desir'd. But I, who am of a mixt and heavy Condition, cannot snap so soon at this one simple Object, but that I negligently suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my self to be carried away with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Pleasures of the general humane <hi>Law.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectually sensible, and sensibly intellectual. The <hi>Cyrenick Philosophers</hi> will have it, that as corporal Pains, so corporal Pleasures are more powerful, both as double, and as more just. There are some, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, who out of a savage kind of Stupidity, pretend to disgust them: and I know others, who out of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do the same. Why do they not moreover forswear breathing? Why do they not live of their own, and refuse Light because it shines <hi>gratis,</hi> and costs them neither pains nor inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Let <hi>Mars, Pallas,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> afford them their light by which to see, instead of <hi>Venus, Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Will they not seek the <hi>Quadrature</hi> of the <hi>Circle,</hi> even when moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon their Wives? I hate, that we should be injoyn'd to have our minds in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> when our <hi>bodies</hi> are at Table; I will have the mind there nail'd, not that it should wallow there, but I am willing it should apply it self to that place, to sit, but not to lye down there. <hi>Aristippus</hi> maintain'd nothing but the Body, as if we had no Soul; <hi>Zeno</hi> stickled only for the Soul, as if we had no Body. Both of them faultily. <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> say they, follow'd a <hi>Philosophy</hi> that was all <hi>Contemplation; Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> one that was all <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Action.

<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53645:995" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only say so for Discourse sake, for the true mean is found in <hi>Socrates</hi>; and <hi>Plato</hi> is more <hi>Socratick</hi> than <hi>Pythagorick,</hi> and it becomes him better. When I dance, I dance, when I sleep, I sleep. Nay, and when I walk alone in a beautifull Orchard, if my Thoughts are some part of the time taken up with strange Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, I some part of the time call them back again to my walk, to the Orchard, to the sweetness of the Solitude, and to my self. <hi>Nature</hi> has with a Motherly tenderness ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd this, that the actions she has injoyn'd us for our necessity, should be also pleasant to us, and invites us to them, not only by Reason, but also by Appetite: and 'tis injustice to infringe her <hi>Laws.</hi> When I see both <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> in the thickest of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est business, so fully injoy humane and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Pleasures, I do not say that they slacken'd their Souls, but wound them up higher by Vigour of Courage, subjecting these violent Imployments and laborious Thoughts to the ordinary usance of Life.

though he was only follow'd by two more in all. He has been seen, when courted by a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which he was in love, yet maintain a severe abstinence in time of need. He has been seen continually to go to the <hi>War,</hi> and with his bare feet to trample upon the Ice; to wear the same Robe Winter and Summer, to surpass all his Companions in Patience of suffering, and to eat no more at a Feast, than at his own private Dinner. He was seen seven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years together to endure Hunger, Poverty, the Indocility of his Children, and the Talons of his Wife, with the same Countenance; and in the end Calumny, Tyranny, Imprisonment, Fetters, and Poyson.

more easily indeed by the ends, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity serve for a bound, a stop, and guide, than by the middle way, which is large and open, and according to <hi>Art,</hi> than according to <hi>Nature</hi>; but withall, much less nobly and commendably. The grandure of Soul consists not so much in mounting and in proceeding forward, as in knowing how to govern and circumscribe it self. It takes every thing for great, that is enough; and demonstrates it self better in moderate, than eminent things. There is nothing so handsome and lawfull, as well and duly to play the man; nor <hi>Science</hi> so hard as well to know how to live this Life, and of all the Infirmities we have, 'tis the most savage to despise our Being.

                        <hi>Phrase</hi> of past-time, and passing away the time, represents the usance of those wise sort of People, who think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a better account of their Lives, than to let them run out and slide away, to pass them over, and to baulk them, and, as much as they can, to take no notice of them, and to shun them, as a thing of troublesome and contemptible Quality: but I know it to be another kind of thing, and find it both valuable and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even in its latest decay, wherein I now injoy it: and Nature has deliver'd it into our hands in such and so favourable Circumstances, that we commonly complain of our selves if it be troublesome to us, or slide unprofitably away.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Stulti Vita ingrata est, trepida est, tota in futurum fertur. The Life of a Fool is uneasie, timorous, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent upon the future.</hi> Nevertheless, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my self to lose mine without regret, but withall, as a thing that is loseable by its Condition, not that it troubles or importunes me. Neither does it properly well become any, not to be displeas'd when they dye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting such as are pleas'd to live. There is good husbandry in enjoying it. I enjoy it double to what others do; for the measure in Fruition depends more or less upon our application to it. Now especially that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mine to be so short in time, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it in weight; I will stop the suddenness
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:53645:999" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of its flight, by the suddenness of my sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon it: and by the vigour of using it, recompence the speed of its running away. By how much the possession of living is more short, I must make it so much deeper and more full. Others are sensible of Contentment, and of Prosperity, I feel it too, as well as they, but not only as it slides and passes by; and also a man ought to study, taste, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate upon it, to render condign thanks to him that grants it to us. They enjoy the other Pleasures as they do that of sleep, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it; to the end, that even sleep it self should not so stupidly escape from me, I have formerly caus'd my self to be disturb'd in my sleep, to the end that I might the better and more sensibly relish and taste it. I consult with my self of a contentment; I do not skin, but sound it, and bend my Reason, now grown perverse and ill humour'd, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it. Do I find my self in any calm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedness? is there any Pleasure that tickles me? I do not suffer it to dally with my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses only, I associate my Soul to it too: not there to engage it self, but therein to take delight; not there to lose it self, but to be present there; and employ it on its part, to view it self in this prosperous Estate, to weigh, esteem, and amplifie the good hap. It reckons how much it stands indebted to <hi>Almighty God</hi> that it is in repose of Conscience, and other intestine Passions, to have the Body
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:53645:1000"/>
in a natural disposedness, orderly, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently enjoying the soft and flattering fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by which he of his bounty is pleas'd to recompence the sufferings wherewith his Justice at his good Pleasure does scourge and chastise us. How great a benefit is it to man to have his Soul so seated, that which way soever she turns her Eye the Heaven is calm and serene about her? No Desire, no Fear or Doubt, that troubles the Air, nor any Difficulty past, present, or to come, that his Imagination may not pass over without Offence. This Consideration takes great lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre from the comparison of different Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore it is, that I propose to my self in a thousand faces, those whom Fortune or their own Error torment and carry away; and moreover those, who more like to me, so negligently and incuriously receive their good Fortune. They are men who pass away their time indeed, they run over the present, and that which they possess, to give themselves up to hope, and for vain Shadows and Images which fancy puts into their Heads;

they were the Raptures of <hi>Archimedes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, what were they worth? I do not here speak of, nor mix with the rabble of us ordinary men, and the vanity of the thoughts and desires that divert us, those venerable Souls, elevated by the ardour of Devotion and Religion, to a constant and conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of Divine things, who, by a lively endeavour and vehement hope, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing the use of the eternal nourishment, the final aim and last step of Christian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, the sole, constant, and incorruptible pleasure, disdain to apply themselves to our necessitous, fluid, and ambiguous conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and easily resign to the Body the care and use of sensual and temperate feeding. 'Tis a priviledg'd study. I have ever amongst us observ'd, supercelestial opinions, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean manners, to be of singular accord. <hi>Aesop,</hi> that great man, saw his Master piss as he walk'd: What, said he, <hi>must we then dung as we run</hi>? Let us manage our time as well as we can, there will yet remain a great deal that will be idle and ill employ'd.
