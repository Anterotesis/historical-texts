         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

deafe and dull of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Miniſters need not
cry, but are not yee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to heare as well
as we to cry. The Cock
crowes when men are
aſleepe. Yea the Cocke
crowes and <hi>Peter</hi> ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
his Maſter, <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 70, 72, 74.</p>
            <p>It is ſinne and ſinne
onely that provokes
God to cry againſt us.
Our ſinnes doe buffet
God on every ſide as
the Iewes did Chriſt,
therefore hee will not
leave till hee have by
crying ſlaine either you
or your ſinnes. When
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12420:8"/>
God therefore cryes we
ſhould weepe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
wherefore he cries.</p>
            <p>Reproofe is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarieſt
office yet moſt
abhorred, as if he hated
us that reproves us. Yet
God ſaith, <hi>Lev. 19. 7. Thou
ſhalt not hate thy brother
but reprove him.</hi> So that
to flatter any in ſinne is a
manifeſt ſigne of hatred,
what love ſoever wee
pretend, ſince it tends
to the hurt of their
ſoules and offence of
God. Yea if a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
reproove ſinne hee
is thought to do it of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
or ſome particular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12420:8"/>
grudge, expecting hee
ſhould preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and bid him keepe
his Text, as if no Text
in Scripture did reprove
ſinne: but let him preach
darke myſteries, odd
conceits, or braineſicke
dreames he is well come.
<hi>Balaams</hi> aſſe never ſpake
but once and then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved,
then if <hi>Balaams</hi>
aſſe reproved <hi>Balaam,</hi>
how much more ought
<hi>Balaam</hi> to reproove aſſes.
But perſwade your
ſelves though we ſeeme
angry, wee preach the
Law to bring you to the
Goſpell, wee preach
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12420:9"/>
Iudgement that ye may
finde Mercy, we preach
Hell to bring you to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus wee have heard
<hi>Ionahs</hi> charge to cry,
But what ſhould he cry?
The Papiſts ſay it was
for their neglect of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they gather
out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ioh. 16. 12. Ioh. 21.
25. Acts 1. 3. 1 Tim. 6. 20.
2 Tim. 1. 13. &amp;</hi> 22. But
his charge is expreſſed,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2. O that none
would cry but what
God had commanded.</p>
            <p>But what did God
command him to cry?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12420:9"/>
even this, <hi>Yet forty daies
and Nineveh ſhall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi>
yea ancient <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi>
faire <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
proud <hi>Nineveh</hi> muſt bee
deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>No man ſits ſo high
but deſtruction ſits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him. Iuſtice would
have come without cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but the mercifull
God cryes to them, that
they hearing his cry,
might cry themſelves
and God hearing their
cry againe tooke pitty on
them. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to cry. <hi>Iſa. 40.
6,</hi> 7. And <hi>Iohn</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the ſpirit of<note place="margin">Mat. 7 3.</note>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:12420:10"/>
               <hi>Eliah</hi> to cry; and <hi>Ionah</hi>
was commanded to cry,
and he cryed. And all
Preachers are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to <hi>cry aloud</hi> and not
to <hi>ſpare,</hi> and to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in their meſſage,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. and woe to
them that love the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne more then
the glory of God.</p>
            <q>For their wickedneſſe is
come up.</q>
            <p>Wee have heard the
charge given, heavie
newes. Now the cauſe
is, <hi>Nineveh</hi> hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her luſts, ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her deſires, forgotten
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12420:10"/>
Gods lawes, let her
therefore prepare for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>When God ſends
cryes unto a people it is
a manifeſt ſigne their
wickedneſſe is come up
before him.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> And then
if they will not repent
while God continues
crying amongſt them,
the Lord of Hoſts will
riſe up in armes againſt
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nineveh</hi> was as full of
ſinne as people, proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and ſecurity kiſſed
each other, <hi>Nah.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:12420:11"/>
            <q>Is come up.</q>
            <p>Sinne mounts up on
high and carries us up as
the Tempter did Chriſt
to the top of a pinacle to
behold all the pleaſures
of the world at once:<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> but
a grievous thing it is to
conſider, what a man is
doing while hee ſinnes,
and what ſinne is doing
at the barre of Gods
juſt judgement, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſtay ſinne once
committed from aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up before the face
of the Eternall God. An
arrow is ſwift, the Sun
is ſwifter, but ſinne is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12420:11"/>
ſwifteſt of all, for in a
moment it is committed
on earth, comes before
God and is condemned
to hell. For though
<hi>Nimrod</hi> could not climbe
to Heaven, yet his ſinnes
flew up. When wee
ſinne wee are like the
ſhell-fiſh which the
Eagle carries into the
ayre, lets fall upon the
rockes, daſheth in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and ſo devours it.
So the wrath of God
throwes us low upon the
rockes of ſhame and
contempt and terror of
conſcience, and then
the grave and hell that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12420:12"/>
double death devoures
us.</p>
            <q>Is come before me.</q>
            <p>By ſinnes comming
before God is meant
Gods beholding and
ſeeing it. Wee faſt as
before him, we pray as
before him, and doe
every good duty as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, becauſe wee
doe it freely not caring
who lookes upon us,
but we ſinne as behind
him, as loath to bee
ſeene, and we ſuppoſe
we ſinne behind him, as
if he ſaw us not, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> accuſed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12420:12"/>
               <hi>Iob</hi> to have ſaid <hi>Iob 2. 12,
13, 14. Is not God in the
height of the heavens,
and ſee the highneſſe of
the Starres how high they
are, therefore how could
God know it,</hi> &amp;c. but
then chiefly wee thinke</p>
            <p>God beholds us not
when men cannot ſee us,
but be not deceived,
God ſeeth not as man
ſeeth. Man ſees one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the outward act, but
God ſeeth the ſecreteſt
imaginations of the
heart. Againe, Man
ſeeth but one thing at
once, and cannot ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and behind him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12420:13"/>
with one looke, but
God ſeeth all things at
all times: for when
wee ſpeake evill hee is
all eares to heare us,
when wee doe evill he
is all eyes to ſee us.
<hi>Ananias</hi> might have
gained by his craft if
God had not ſeene his
heart, <hi>Acts 5. Gehezi</hi>
might have profited by
his lye, and gained a
bribe for his labour if
God had not ſeene his
fetches and turned his
bribe into a Leproſie,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. The man
that bad his ſoule bee
merry, might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12420:13"/>
his pleaſure many
yeares had not God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
his ſecurity, <hi>Luke
12. Achan</hi> might have
kept his gold had not
God ſeene him. <hi>Achan</hi>
would never have ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
nor <hi>Gehezi</hi> taken
bribes had they thought
God beheld them; will
any ſteale the owner
looking on, will any
ſpeake treaſon the King
hearing it: Therefore
marke but this part of
my Sermon. Say when
thy hand is at a ſinne,
I will not doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Lord ſees me.
And as hee is all eyes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12420:14"/>
to ſee ſinne, and all
hands to puniſh it, ſo
if wee repent, hee is all
mercy to forgive it.
Now therefore repent
of thy ſinne, hye thee
faſt to the throne of
Grace, and try if thy
repentance will not as
powerfully cry for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
as thy ſinnes did
vehemently cry for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
The Angell
cryed not ſo loud <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
is fallen, Revel.</hi> 18. 2.
as the Spirit of truth
ſhall aſſure thee thy
ſinnes are forgiven thee,
<hi>Rom. 6. 14. Psal. 91. 10.
34. 10. 84. 11. Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12420:14"/>
28. Repent therefore
and truly repent by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ſinne with the
occaſion and appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and love the truth,
and as much as is in you,
have peace with all
men, that the God of
peace may give you
peace in Chriſt. All
this is grounded on this
that God ſeeth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we doe. So <hi>Rev.
2. 2-9-13.</hi> and 3-1-8.
<hi>I know thy workes,</hi> is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to incourage the
<hi>Sardians</hi> and <hi>Laod ceans</hi>
to repentance knowing
that God is a liberall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12420:15"/>
ſeeke him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <q>Is come before me.</q>
            <p>Sinne once commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

thinkes the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <q>But Jonah roſe
up to flee unto Tarſhiſh,
from the preſence of the
Lord, and went downe to
Joppa, and he found a ſhip

with them unto Tarſhiſh
from the preſence of the

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT followes now to

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12420:17"/>
the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him. Firſt, he
neglected it, afterwards
being chaſtiſed and ſo
repenting he faithfully
diſcharged it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of his Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Ionah</hi> was ſent to
<hi>Nineveh</hi> to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their ungodlineſſe,
to reclaime them that
they might repent, &amp; ſo
the wrath of God be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away, how happy a
meſſage ſhould this have
beene that brought ſuch
bleſſed effects, but ſtill
one flie or other ſpoyles
the boxe of ointment,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 1. Satan ſtands
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12420:17"/>
up and ſends him inſtead
of <hi>Nineveh</hi> to <hi>Tarſhiſh;</hi>
meaning thereby,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to put him out
of Gods favour, to bring
upon him torment of
conſcience, decay of
gifts and diſreputation
among the people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to harden
the people in their ſinnes
and againſt Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the moſt
populous and wealthy
Citty in <hi>Aſſyria</hi> might
be deſtroyed all dying
unrepentant in their ſins,
that the very Angels in
Heaven ſhould mourne
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12420:18"/>
at it. So by urging the
unkindneſſe to his owne
Nation and blood in
leaving them to preach
to ſtrangers, as alſo the
difficulty of doing good
among ſuch notorious
ſinners, and the danger
of his owne perſon in
bringing ſo unwellcome
a meſſage he getteth him
to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>Thus Satan is ever
croſſing and tempting
us when wee addreſſe
our ſelves to the will of
God. So was <hi>Moſes,
Ieremy, Ezekiel, Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
and <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
tempted being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12420:18"/>
moſt notable
workes, <hi>Exod. 3. 11.
4. 10. Ier. 1. 6. Ezek. 3.
14. Neh. 2. 19. Luke 22.
31.</hi> And Chriſt tells
<hi>Peter, Satan deſired to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
him, Mat. 4. 1. Luke
4. 2. 4. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 8.
So even <hi>Peter, Iames</hi>
and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Therefore
never dreame of a
truce with Satan, for
hee is perpetually ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
whom hee may
devoure, either temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us by flattery or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
threatning: for
whatſoever wee doe
comes either from the
ſpirit of Satan, of God
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12420:19"/>
or our owne ſpirit.
Now our owne ſpirit
is occupied about the
pleaſures of this world.
The Spirit of God is
gentle and meeke, not
forcing, not threatning,
as <hi>Luke 19. 23. If any one
will follow me,</hi> not you
ſhall follow me. So <hi>Cant,
5. 2, 3. Open unto mee</hi>—Now
Satan takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
courſe, if hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
allure to ſinne hee
threatens loſſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
friends, goods, and
by his Imps torments
and death. Christ ſaith
if you will follow mee,
but he ſaith I will make
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12420:19"/>
you follow me or you
ſhall have fire and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
ſo ſaith his eldeſt
Sonne Antichriſt. His
order of tempting is firſt
to make us doubt of the
truth of Gods Word.
Secondly, he falls to flat
denying of it. Thirdly,
hee comes in with his
owne countermards and
contrary aſſertions. Thus
he ſaith advance your
ſelves. God ſaith <hi>Love
thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,
Mat.</hi> 22. 39. hee ſaith,
Firſt, love little and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.
Secondly, love
none but thy ſelfe.
Thirdly, hate thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12420:20"/>
envy thy betters,
diſdaine thine equalls,
deſpiſe thine inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.</p>
            <p>Now the meanes the
divell tempts with are
arguments drawne from
mans owne wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſo <hi>Ionah</hi> argues
here, if the Iewes will
not heare me, it is in
vaine to preach to theſe
Gentiles. Thus fleſh
and blood ſtands ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,
miſdoubting
troubles when it ſhould
doe any good, but in
ſinne never conſidereth
the following woe. Yet
this I confeſſe was a ſore
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12420:20"/>
temptation for <hi>Ionah</hi> to
preach to a heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
this doctrine, that
there is but onely one
true God to them who
have ſerved a thouſand,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. as if a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
were commanded
to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> gates and
preach againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
juriſdiction, I
feare hee would hardly
doe it. Thus we regard
rather to enter no great
action for Gods glory
and his Churches good,
then to receive any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in our doings,
Satan knowes from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
wee are eaſily
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12420:21"/>
brought to loyter, and
from feare and paine to
ſecurity and pleaſure.
Thus hee tempted our
Saviour with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of the world, <hi>All
this will I give thee.</hi> This
gaine, this eaſe, this
profit ſhalt thou have
to leave the ſociety of
godly men and ſerve
mee, not being ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to ſweare for your
gaine, to lie for your
pleaſure, to cozen for
riches, and ſo bee free
from the reproaches and
contempt wherewith
profeſſors are overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but be rich and live
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12420:21"/>
in eaſe and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſinne but not
conſtrained, urged, but
not compelled, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
can intice mightily,
but not inforce violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This is our comfot,
our enemies power is in
our Fathers hand, 1 <hi>Cor.
10. 11. Rom. 8. 35. Luke
22.</hi> 32. This may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us to <hi>Reſiſt the
divell and hee ſhall flie
from us, Iames</hi> 4. 7. God
hath made no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to the divell, that
if hee tempt hee ſhall
prevaile, what a ſhame
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12420:22"/>
is it then that Satan is
bolder in tempting then
we are in reſiſting. O
that wee were as wiſe,
as watchfull to withſtand
as Satan is diligent to
aſſault. But doth <hi>Ionah</hi>
now reſiſt as manfully as
Satan ſets on him cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly.
Alas no, he as
ſoone reſolved as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. It is ſaid,
<hi>God ſpake and it was done.</hi>
Surely the divell but
ſpeakes and it is done,
he is ſuch an Orator as
no man can denie him:
for hee pretends to
counſell as a moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
friend, as an holy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12420:22"/>
Angell jealous of Gods
honour, therefore hee
made not onely <hi>Gehezi</hi>

5. 22. Demas</hi> to imbrace

<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 48. and
<hi>Caine</hi> to kill his brother,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. but <hi>Rebecca</hi> alſo

<hi>Iacob</hi> to be bold by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſeeke for the

the <hi>Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
to commit folly
with <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16. 43.
and here <hi>Ionah</hi> not to
goe to <hi>Nineveh</hi> leſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
God ſhould not be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12420:23"/>
true of his words.</p>
            <p>We have ſeene Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
malice and wily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in tempting, wee
have ſufficient armour to
reſiſt him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 11.
and promiſe to prevaile,
<hi>Iames</hi> 5. 7. Therefore
wee forget our enemy,
neglect the promiſe, or
take not the armour, or
like not that arrow-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
humility, ſubmit
your ſelves to God, and
then reſiſt the divell: but
are ready, ſo fooliſh are

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12420:23"/>
not bee foyled, then
conſider how ſhamefull

            <p>Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> tempted

            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> was ſent to <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi>

moſt rebelliouſly wee

Hereof it hath come to

indignation of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

ſpecially hindring the

For the Lord
was not ſo earneſt to
ſtop the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi>
leſt hee ſhould commit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12420:27"/>
wickedneſſe, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell

            <p>But who would have
thought that ſuch a
Prophet ſhould flie from
the Lord, yea and then
when he ſhould doe him
moſt ſervice? A feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

let him that ſtandeth
take heed leſt hee fall:
for the way is ſlippery
wherein wee are to

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12420:27"/>
the fall of
the Prophet, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that thou art much
weaker then a Prophet,
and therefore the eaſier
to bee encountred and
overthrowne, and the
likelier to have a moſt
grievous fall, except the
Lord doe mightily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

if thou ſee <hi>Ionah</hi> flie,
<hi>Moſes</hi> murmur, <hi>David</hi>
fall to adultery, <hi>Salomon</hi>
to idolatry, and <hi>Peter</hi> to

then learne thou not to

nor to thy owne
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12420:28"/>

but ſeeke helpe
and crave ſtrength at

God, who giveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
to every one
that asketh; which doth
not bruiſe the broken
reed, nor quench the
ſmoking flax, but doth
rather increaſe our zeale
then diminiſh it.</p>
            <p>And judge favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of ſuch as fall, for
though <hi>Ionah</hi> fled, yet he
returned againe; and
though <hi>David</hi> joyned
murther with adultery,
yet he repented.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:12420:28"/>
            <q>And he found a ſhip go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Tarſhiſh.</q>
            <p>As ſoone as hee ſet
forward to flie from
God, Satan ſeconds his
temptation with oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
hee findes a ſhip
ready, hee fits <hi>Iudas</hi>
with money and <hi>Ionah</hi>
with a ſhip, if thou wilt
flie from God, the divell
will lend thee both
ſpurres and a horſe, yea a
poſt-horſe to carry thee
haſtily and ſwiftly to all
ungodly luſts.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:12420:29"/>
            <q>And he payed the fare.</q>
            <p>This money was caſt
into the ſea, many waſt
their money upon dice
and unlawfull games, it
were good for them if
they had not a penny to
looſe, and ſo men care
not what they pay for
vanities and braveries,
this alſo is caſt into the
ſea, but they will give
little or nothing to doe
good withall, So <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
can get nothing, and
<hi>David</hi> can get no meate,
<hi>ſhall I give my bread and
wine to one I know not?</hi>
ſaith churliſh <hi>Naball.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:12420:29"/>
We can bee content to
give and do any thing
to win the world, but
wee will give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor doe nothing,
whereby to win the
kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> is entred into
the ſhip and ſleepes,
ſleepes ſoundly, and
being wakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
not his ſinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
hee was forced to it
by diſcovery of caſting
lots. Thus God ſets
out the ſtubborneneſſe
and diſobedience of
<hi>Ionah,</hi> in that this thing
was not done upon a
ſudden, but upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12420:30"/>
and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
he had ſpace and
ley ſure enough to have
repented, but did not.
<hi>Ionah</hi> firſt liftned to
Satans aſſaults, liked
them, conſented to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them, put them in
practiſe, fled to <hi>Ioppa,</hi>
hyred the ſhip, hoyſed
up ſayles and went to
ſleepe, to ſhew that
ſinne runs on wheeles
and poſts downe hill,
and never ſtayes till it
arrive even in Hell.
So ſinnes follow one
another like linkes of a
chaine, till the tempeſt
of deſtruction breake it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12420:30"/>
in ſunder: but if <hi>Ionah</hi>
had conſidered the all-ſeeing
eye of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, hee would
have leaped out of the
ſhip that carried him at

from his duty, ſince the

the <hi>Epheſians, 1 Sam. 5.
5. Acts</hi> 19. 35. and
every one of us in our

no trouble ſo great

them to forget it, others
to their glorious attires
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12420:38"/>
and coſtly jewels, ſome

and ſoft beds. In ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
wee cry come
Phyſitian, in heavineſſe

leaving the Creator
which is all goodneſſe
and power, and flie to
the creature which have
neither. Thus they did
well that they prayed,
but they prayed not
well, for they prayed to
fained gods, while none
could helpe but one,
they cryed to many, thus
ſtirred they the tempeſt
more, like Papiſts, from
one Saint to another,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12420:38"/>
thinking if one Saint
doe not helpe, another
will.</p>
            <q>They cryed.</q>
            <p>But this cry is often
without faith, and let
not the wavering min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

any good of the

            <q>And they caſt their wares

            <p>The Marriners are
content to caſt their
wares into the Sea, in
hope of ſome furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12420:39"/>
to ſave their lives
thereby: for though
many venture their
lives for riches, yet they
will rather part with all
their riches, then with
their lives. But the
ſhip though it bee ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is not the ſafer; for
it was ſinne that procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the danger, which
being caſt away, would
have ſaved all, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retained, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
is not abated. <hi>If I

If I caſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12420:40"/>
ſatisfied: though
they thinke themſelves
beneficiall to the poore
thereby, and hope for a
reward, yet God will
accept of them but as
Hypocrites, hee will
none of their oblations,
he abhorreth their very
prayers, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
            <q>And they caſt, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Obſerve here, that
oftentimes many are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

which order is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to bee uſed of all
Chriſtians in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
Firſt, to ſeeke
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12420:41"/>
for aid and aſſiſtance
from God, and then
to uſe all ſuch good
meanes to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them too; truſting
that of his goodneſſe
hee will bleſſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
God indeed
is the laſt refuge, but
hee is alſo the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
which is to bee
ſought unto: for hee
will have us to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that <hi>man liveth
not by bread onely,</hi> and
<hi>an horſe is but a vaine
thing to ſave a man,</hi> and
<hi>except the Lord keepe the
Citty, the Watchman wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12420:42"/>
but in vaine;</hi> no
meanes can helpe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his bleſſing. But
then, hee will not have
us negligent in uſing of
lawfull meanes: for he
never or very ſeldome
worketh without means,
when the meanes may
bee uſed. Danger then
wee have ſeene made
them to feare, but feare
aſtoniſhed them not,
but gathered their wits
together, for they
uſed meanes with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But when the
Lord ſends calamity
upon many of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12420:42"/>
they have ſo
guilty a conſcience, that
whileſt they feele the
great hand of God, they
are even diſtraught of
their wits, and made as it
were ſenſeleſſe, that they
know not what they
doe: yea when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
come, it makes
them like a headleſſe
Bee, which buzzeth
about ſhee knowes not
whither, or like the
Swallow, which by
compulſion of the
winde, flieth backward
and forward till it fall
into the Sea: or like
<hi>Caine,</hi> whoſe head was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12420:43"/>
fraught with feares, ſo
that hee knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to goe, doubting
to bee ſlaine of every
one whom he ſaw. But
whatſoever befalleth
the childe of God, hee
hath ever matter of
conſolation and ſome
moderation of minde
to beare it withall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
a joyfull iſſue
of all. Therefore bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is hee that hath the
Lord for his God.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:12420:43"/>
            <q>But Ionah was gone
downe into the ſides of
the ſhip, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> was faſt aſleepe
when hee ſhould bee
better occupied, to note
our drowſineſſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and our ſecurity
in ſinne, that though
the very ſenſeleſſe ſhip
ſeemed by rowling and
cracking to cry to <hi>Ionah,</hi>
yet was not hee once
moved, but like one
ſicke of a Lethargy,
deafe to all wakenings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Dove.</hi>
Hee was like <hi>Noahs</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:12420:44"/>
Dove, that out of the
Arke could finde no
reſt; ſo <hi>Ionah</hi> could not
ſleepe being fled from
God, but the Tempeſt
will awake him.</p>
            <q>And he was faſt aſleepe.</q>
            <p>See how little <hi>Ionah</hi> is
aſhamed of his ſinne.
Though all ſmarted
for it yet hee ſleepes;
neither winds blowing,
waters roaring, ſhips
reeling, nor Marriners
crying could wake him.
Thus wee ſleepe more
deadly then <hi>Ionah,</hi> wee
looke not backe on our
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12420:44"/>
ſinnes and examine our
ſelves throughly, that
wee might finde releaſe
of our miſeries.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ionah</hi> a Prophet,
and ſuch a Prophet as
was the figure of Chriſt,
could not withſtand this
one temptation, what
cauſe have we to watch
againſt ſinne, to pray
that wee be not led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ionahs</hi> ſleeping ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when we thinke
our ſelves moſt at reſt,
then are wee in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
danger, as <hi>Ionah</hi>
aſleepe neere his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12420:45"/>
When <hi>Herod</hi>
is vaunting then is hee
ſtricken, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 21.
When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
is in his greateſt pride
then is hee turned out,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27. When <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi>
is banquetting,
the hand writ his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 4.
When the rich man
ſaith unto his ſoule,
thou haſt enough, <hi>Luke
12.</hi> 19. then his ſoule is
taken from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, note here
the nature of ſinne,
while it is in doing,
like a Harlot, ſhewes
nothing but her bravery,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12420:45"/>
Witneſſe <hi>Adams</hi> fruit,

ſuddenly, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably.
So though ſin
bee ſweet in the mouth
it is bitter in the belly.</p>
            <q>Then the ſhip-master came
unto him, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Here <hi>Ionah</hi> is taken
napping, the Marriners
may doe him more
good then the tempeſt,
whom ſinne ſhould wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> is aſleepe and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12420:46"/>
the Marriners wake him,
an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> wakened by
an <hi>Infidell.</hi> Thus the
Lord ſhames his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as hee reproved
<hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Abimelech,
Gen. 20. 9. Balaam,</hi> by an
Aſſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 28.</p>
            <p>This ſtory <hi>Ionah</hi>
writes of himſelfe, that
wee might bee warned
by him to ſuppreſſe all
evill motions that they
take not effect.</p>
            <q>What meaneſt thou, O
ſleeper.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Ionah</hi> being thus war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
did not ſnap at him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12420:46"/>
that wakened him, nor
yet baſely ſit ſtill but ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
            <p>Many of you come
to heare the Word, and
here you fall aſleepe,
when you have moſt
need to bee waking,
but I am glad, I have
now gotten a Text to
waken you, for now I
cannot reade my Text,
but I muſt ſay, <hi>What
meaneſt thou, O ſleeper,
Ariſe.</hi> If you marke
not what is ſaid unto
you, you are aſleepe,
though your eyes bee
open: but if you were
as wiſe as <hi>Ionah,</hi> you
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12420:47"/>
would not ſleepe here
in the ſight of all the
people, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
get you to ſleepe
in ſome corner, for <hi>Ionah</hi>
went under the hatches
to ſleepe, and would
not ſleepe in the ſight
of the Marriners. If
you were as wiſe as
<hi>Ionah,</hi> you would thank
him that wakened you,
as no doubt <hi>Ionah</hi> did;
<hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pro. 28.
23.</hi> that hee which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth,
ſhall have more
favour of a wiſe man,
than hee which flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
The Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi>
ſaith, Woe be unto that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12420:47"/>
ſervant, that when his
Maſter commeth hee
ſhall finde ſleeping,
Canſt thou not watch
one houre, ſaith hee to
<hi>Peter?</hi> Can you not
wake while I ſpeake to
you? You would all be
found in the Church
when the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
but you would
not bee found ſleeping
in the Church. You
are watched, and none
of you can ſteale a nap
and not bee eſpied,
but when your eyes bee
moſt ſhut, and ſee leaſt,
then moſt eyes bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you. I marvell how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12420:48"/>
you can ſleepe having
ſo many eyes upon
you, ſo many cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
in your eares, and
God himſelfe ſpeaking
unto you. If you ſhould
ſee a traitor ſleepe on
the hurdle, or men ſleepe
with meate in their
mouthes, would you not
marvell? Yet even ſo
doe you, while I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God againſt
you, and while I am
feeding ſome of you,
you fall aſleepe, and ſo
I preach in vaine. There
is a Countrey whereof
it is ſaid, that it is night
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12420:48"/>
with them, when it is
day with us. I thinke
that Countrey is here,
for how many are here
which have loſt their
eyes and their eares ſince
they came hither? If all
of you, were as many
of you are (I meane
aſleepe) the ſtrangers
that come hither to
heare, would thinke that
you were all dead, and
that I preached your
funerall Sermon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for ſhame leave
your ſleeping.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:12420:49"/>
            <q>Ariſe and call upon thy
God, if ſo bee hee will
thinke upon us, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>This is another
means which they uſe,
<hi>Ionah</hi> being wakened, to
appeaſe the tempeſt,
now that they ſee they
cannot themſelves allay
the winds, nor aſſwage
the waters, they deſire,
they exhort <hi>Ionah,</hi> to try
what he can doe by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon his God.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:12420:49"/>
            <q>Ariſe call upon thy God,
&amp;c.</q>
            <p>After that the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
had wakened <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
he bids him call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his God, as if he had
ſaid, Watch and pray:
hee ſpeakes like a Saint,
yet hee is an Infidell; he
ſaid not, call upon gods:
but call upon thy God.
The ſhip-maſter, would
not call upon his God:
but (ſaith hee) call upon
thy God, and it may
bee hee will helpe us:
if hee had ſaid call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our god, when hee
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12420:50"/>
ſaid, call upon thy God:
and if he had ſaid, Hee
will helpe us, when hee
ſaid, if ſo bee hee will
helpe us, then hee had
ſhewed ſome ſparke of
faith. Becauſe he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
helpe and comfort,
hee bids him ariſe, and
becauſe hee was feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
hee bids him pray.
It may bee (ſaith he) he
will thinke upon us, that
wee periſh not. As if he
had ſaid, <hi>Ionah,</hi> we know
that thou haſt a God as
well as wee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee ſay, Call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy God, for now
every god is to betried,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12420:50"/>
therefore if ever thou
didſt pray in thy life fall
to it now. Thus Satan
leades men a blinde way
with zeale, in hope of
ſome reliefe being in
trouble. They called
upon them for helpe,
which were neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to aſſiſt them, nor
able to heare them, and
when they perceived by
wofull experience, that
there was no kinde of
ſuccour to bee had that
way, they flie to God,
and then Satan labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to undermine the
confidence and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of helpe, and to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12420:51"/>
place in ſtead thereof
doubtfullneſſe and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
Thus Satan will
bee ſure to loſe nothing
by this bargaine any
way. <hi>Ionah</hi> (ſay they)
call upon thy God, for
if hee cannot helpe us,
wee are all undone and
loſt, for wee have called
upon our gods, we have
laboured hard to amend
our ſtate, wee have caſt
away our goods to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the ſhip, but all in
vaine, for wee are no
whit the better, like
the woman which had
ſpent all her ſubſtance
about Phyſicke, yet all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12420:51"/>
could not helpe her till
Chriſt came, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 43.
So the Papiſts while
they are well, they pray
unto every Saint and
Angell for ſuccour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the troubleſome
times, but in extremity,
or at the point of death,
none of them can helpe,
ſo that then they are
faine to flie unto God
or be deſtitute, as like
Idolaters, as one flie is
like another: they are
like the Heathen, which
worſhip <hi>Iuno, Venus,
Neptune, Pallas, Iupiter,</hi>
and the reſt: ſome hold
on the one, and ſome on
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:12420:52"/>
the other. Some ſay, if
<hi>Ioon</hi> bee with mee, I
care not for all the petty
gods, becauſe I hold
him chiefe: ſo another
ſaith, if Saint <hi>Gabriel</hi>
bee with mee, I care
not for the reſt: and
ſome raiſe great diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
whether this
Saint or that Saint, this
Angell or that Angell
bee better: whether our
Lady of <hi>Bullen,</hi> or our
Lady of <hi>Rome</hi> be ſureſt:
whether Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of
<hi>Callis,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of
<hi>Compoſtella</hi> be ſtrongeſt:
and ſo like beggers
which run from doore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12420:52"/>
to doore, they runne
from one Saint to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If one god will
not helpe, another will,
thinke theſe, as though
the gods were contrary
one to another, and
where the one bids, the
other forbids. So ſome
thought that <hi>Venus</hi> was
a friend to the Trojanes,
and <hi>Pallas</hi> was not their
friend; as fooles thinke
of Witches, one ſtrikes,
another heales.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:12420:53"/>
            <q>Call upon thy God.</q>
            <p>They bid him call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his God, before they
knew him, but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
would not worſhip
a falſe god, though they
may be helped by him.
By the example of theſe
Marriners, if they
thought that their god
was the true God (and
why elſe did they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him:) wee may
learne the ſubſtance of
every temptation that
doth undermine us,
namely, that it will bid
us doe this evill, that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12420:53"/>
good may come of it:
Marke whenſoever thou
art motioned to evill,
if it doe not promiſe
thee ſome goodneſſe
to come of it. But the
ſervants of God ought
not to doe that which is
evill, though they were
ſure to gaine all things
that can bee wiſhed by
ſo doing: for they have
learned their leſſon, and
how to anſwer Satan at
ſuch times: Why
tempteſt thou me Satan?
for it is written, Thou
muſt not doe evill that
good may come of it,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. and this is the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12420:54"/>
armour called <hi>Scriptum
eſt,</hi> wherewith the Lord
overcame the divell in
the wilderneſſe.</p>
            <p>Here alſo wee may
ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the faithfull and
Infidels: for <hi>Call upon
thy God,</hi> ſaith the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
and the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Marriners bid
<hi>Ionah</hi> pray to his God in
their behalfe: but <hi>Ionah</hi>
ſaith not to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
pray to your gods
in my behalfe. And this
is alſo manifeſt, that a
Papiſt will ſay unto a
Proteſtant, and one that
lives well, Pray for me:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12420:54"/>
but a Proteſtant if he be
any thing zealous, will
not ſay unto a Papiſt,
Pray thou for me: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that when a Papiſt
doth pray, hee doth it to
Idols, Saints or Angels,
or at leaſt without faith,
and therefore their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are abhominable in
the ſight of God, and
therefore they will not
bid them doe it becauſe
they will not doe evill,
to the intent that good
may come of it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is manifeſt, that our
Religion is the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
our Adverſaries
themſelves being judges.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12420:55"/>
And ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Moſes</hi> pray for me: but
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid not to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
pray for me, <hi>Exod.
18. 27. &amp;c. Saul</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Samuel,</hi> pray thou for
me: but <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid not
to <hi>Saul,</hi> pray thou for me,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 25. therefore
the Marriners had need
of <hi>Ionah</hi> to pray for
them: but <hi>Ionah</hi> had no
need of ignorant Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to pray for him. And
why ſhould not all pray
to <hi>Ionahs</hi> God, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
pray to <hi>Moſes</hi> God,
ſeeing God hath ſaid,
<hi>Call upon me in trouble and
I will heare thee? Call
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12420:55"/>
upon thy God</hi> (ſay they)
when they cried and
ſaw no helpe, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
their gods, they
thought they would not
helpe: indeed they
could not: therefore
they ran to another
whom they knew not,
hoping to bee helped
by him, becauſe they
thought ſome god there
was that could doe it.
So the Papiſts run from
one god to another, from
S. <hi>Dominick</hi> to S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
and why ſhould they
run from S. <hi>Dominick</hi> to
S. <hi>Francis,</hi> but that they
miſtruſted <hi>Dominick?</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:12420:56"/>
they thinke hee will not
heare them, and ſo they
goe forward: but in the
end the unknowne God
is thought to be the beſt:
yet the Lord taught
not <hi>Peter</hi> one prayer,
and <hi>Iohn</hi> another, but
taught them all one
prayer unto one onely
God, and to wait ſtill
upon him, praying
ſtill, with aſſurance he
will bee a helpe in due
time.</p>
            <q>If peradventure hee will
thinke upon us that we
periſh not.</q>
            <p>This if, perhaps, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12420:56"/>
peradventure, coſt <hi>Adam</hi>
Paradiſe, God ſaid to
<hi>Adam,</hi> If thou doeſt
eate of this tree, thou
ſhalt ſurely die. Then
<hi>Evah</hi> reported theſe
words, thus: leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
we die. The
Serpent ſeeing her in
ſuch a minde, ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
or forgetfull of the
commandement, hee
came and quite changed
the matter, and ſaid; You
ſhall not die. Thus ſin
creepes upon us, while
doubtfullneſſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in us: ſo God ſaith,
You ſhall be ſaved: the
trembling fleſh ſaith,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12420:57"/>
peradventure I ſhall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
then commeth Satan,
and hee ſaith, Thou
ſhalt die: ſo that if you
will aske what is the
faith of ſinners, or if
you would have it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it is this: peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
yea, peradventure
no: if you will aske me
whereupon this faith is
grounded: it is upon
ifs and ands: this is the
faith of the ungodly, to
ſay, If ſo bee God will
helpe us: for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
aſſure themſelves of
any helpe. But wee
may not doubt of our
God, and ſay, It may
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12420:57"/>
be, or, If peradventure:
for we may freely pray
to our God with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
and may ſay, our
God, and the God of
<hi>Ionah</hi> will ſurely helpe
us, and hath helped us.
But yet let us know that
we have ſinned like infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
and doe deſerve to
bee puniſhed like the
Egyptians.</p>
            <q>If ſo be he will, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>Thus it commeth in
like a little leaven, which
ſowreth the whole lump
of dow, and like the
moth, which eateth the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12420:58"/>
whole wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and this ſame
little theefe hath ſtolen
away all the Papiſts
faith: Therefore with
them wickedneſſe lieth
ſicke in bed, and calleth
to every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by, Call upon
God, and pray for me,
if ſo be hee will looke
upon us and helpe us:
and ſo their hope when
the tempeſt commeth,
is either an eaſeleſſe
horrour, or a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
doubting.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:12420:58"/>
            <q>If ſo he will thinke upon us.</q>
            <p>Our God thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
hee thought upon
us, and laid the tempeſt
when our enemies called
upon their gods, Saints
and Angels. But what
doe we meane, beloved,
when mercy is come to
ſend for judgement? for
though we be ſaved with
Iſrael, we deſerve to bee
plagued with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
becauſe wee are not
thankefull for this,
namely that the Lord
hath thought upon us in

our diſtreſſe; for hee
travelleth with mercie,
and laboureth till he be
delivered, he goeth laded
like a Bee, but wants a

hands, a hand to give,
and a hand to receive:
Gods hand to give, and
mans hand to receive:
the hand of God is a
bountifull and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hand, a hand loden
with liberality, full of
gracious gifts: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us ſtretch forth
the good hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, thankefully to
embrace it, cheerefully

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12420:59"/>
to keepe it, let us
receive it by the hand of

and the hand of prayer,
for who ſo commeth

&amp; who ſo commeth
without it, ſhall go emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

have despiſed the waies
of God: for when I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
them, they
would not heare, and
what I taught them they
would not learne, ſaith
the Lord, <hi>Pro. 1. 24, 25.
Ionah</hi> wakened thus, and
thus exhorted to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his God, ſoone no
doubt perceived his
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12420:60"/>
danger, and partly with
the horrour of his ſinne,
partly for feare of the
deſerved, and thus
threatned drowning and
other puniſhments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
queſtion was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
vexed. For hee
could not but ſee, that
the very dumbe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were bent againſt
him for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
the winde blowes,
as though it would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
all, the waters
roare, as though they
would drowne all, the
ſhip tumbles, as though
ſhee were weary of all,
and albeit the Marriners
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12420:60"/>
had cryed, and caſt out
the wares, as though they
would loſe all, yet the
tempeſt rageth ſtill,
their danger is greater
than ever.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now one
might have ſaid to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
Satan thou perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
him to flie from his
defence for his ſafety,
and madeſt him beleeve
that he ſhould come ſafe
to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and there
live at liberty and eaſe,
enjoying all temporall
benefits at his pleaſure,
but now thou haſt
brought him into the
priſon of the ſhip, and it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12420:61"/>
is toſt thus by this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
likely to deſtroy
him, thou leaveſt him in
the greateſt danger, and
rejoyceſt that <hi>Ionah</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
at the tempeſt, and
hath his heart aking for
feare of the danger thus
threatned due to rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
yea, ſeekeſt alſo to
drowne him, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in hell, howſoever
thou pretendeſt a deſire
to preſerve him from
troubles, and procure
him many pleaſures,
with much ſecurity: O
moſt wretched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
lyer, he that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
his enemie, and hee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12420:61"/>
that beleeveth thee, ſhall
ever be deceived. And
now might <hi>Ionah</hi> ſay,
Beware by me, for thus
hath the tempter decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me, he hath allured
mee with flattering fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies,
and perſwaded
me, that it was but an
eaſie thing to flie from
the preſence of the
Lord, that ſeeth alwaies
all things, and from
whom no man, no nor
ſecret lurking in any
mans heart can be hid,
but all are alwaies in his
preſence. Hee made
mee beleeve that light
could be brought out of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12420:62"/>
darkneſſe, that good may
come of evill: for hee
aſſureth mee, that if I
would ſet forth toward
<hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> I ſhould not
onely ſhun the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lord, but
ſhould live at eaſe like
one unknowne, both for
my vocation, and alſo
for my behaviour in the
execution thereof, and
ſo I might creepe into
a familiarity with theſe
people, and enjoy the
benefit of their ſociety.
Otherwiſe, if I went
to <hi>Nineveh</hi> as the Lord
commanded, they would
hate and perſecute me,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12420:62"/>
yea, and ſo I ſhould end
my life in miſery, both
becauſe they being Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and I a Jew, they
cannot abide me, for the
one holdeth the other in
contempt: and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of my meſſage,
namely, a Prophecy of
deſtruction, grounded
upon a reproofe of their
vile and ſinfull pleaſures.
Which meſſage, Satan
perſwaded me would be
ſo hainouſly taken, that
no death, nor torment,
that they could deviſe
for mee, would bee
thought ſufficient, and
ſo I ſhould bee ſure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12420:63"/>
to eſcape their hands
alive, if I went: as though
the eternall and moſt
glorious God, which
ſent me thither, were not
able to defend me from
all evill when I came
thither, as well as he did
<hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Chriſt in the
wilderneſſe among the
ſavage beaſts. And when
Satan had thus perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me I beleeved him
and ſo tooke my journey
to flie from the preſence
of the Lord, if I could
have performed my inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the Lord hath
beheld the ſtubborne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12420:63"/>
and diſobedience

followeth me with great

            <p>But firſt, they conſult

            <p>Seeing therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12420:65"/>
they take counſell,
and agree to find him out
by lots, wherein let us
obſerve; firſt, never a
one of them is of <hi>Davids</hi>
ſpirit, who when he ſaw
the people plagued, ſaid,
Lord it is I: Every man
excuſeth himſelfe: for
every man would exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
his own ſin, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
it, and every one
thinketh his ſinne ſalved,
when hee hath excuſed
himſelfe. Let <hi>Adam</hi> be
his owne judge, and he
will ſay. The woman
tempted him to ſin: and
let the woman be her

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12420:66"/>
ſay, Yonder Serpent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
her to it. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one be his own judge,
and there will be ſuch
poſting off of ſin, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

guilty. There is none
that will be ſo impudent,
as to ſay he hath no ſin at

confeſſe they have
grievouſly ſinned. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe here ſay every
man within himſelfe,
though he be a ſinner, yet
he is no great ſinner.
None are accounted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
unleſſe they bee
openly detected of ſome
notable and hainous
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12420:66"/>
crime. If they be dicers,
ſwearers, drunkards,
brawlers, pickers, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
prophaners of the
Sabbath, ſleepers at
Church, and ſuch like,
they be not thought ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
theſe actions are
counted no ſins, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recreations. For the
multitude count none
ſinners, unleſſe they be
theeves, traytors, open
and groſſe Idolaters, and
taken with ſuch like capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
crimes: no more theſe
neither, were it not for
feare of the law: as none
among the Iewes, but
Publicans, were counted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12420:67"/>
ſinners, all the reſt were
good fellowes, and juſt
men.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts ſay, ſome
thoughts, affections,
words, and outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
not agreeing with
the Law of God, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
waſht away with a
little holy-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
they are not deadly, they
deſerve not the wrath of
God, they are but veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Did you ever read of
theſe veniall ſinnes in the
Scripture? But thinke
you they have nothing
but Scripture? Yes they
have Decrees, they have
decretals, the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12420:67"/>
whereof obſerved,
theſe veniall ſinnes are
ſoone pardoned, &amp; they
have a Pope that can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
any ſins. Thus they
leſſen ſinnes, thus they
abate the price of ſinnes,
and they can buy out ſins
with money, or redeeme
them with Maſſes, and
by a little ſhort pennance
purchaſe a large and
long pardon.</p>
            <p>And as the Marriners,
every man thought hee
was no great ſinner: ſo
<hi>Ionah</hi> thought with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
Though I bee a
great ſinner, yet am I not
ſo grievous a ſinner as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12420:68"/>
theſe Idolatrous hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:
or if he through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned himſelfe,
yet unwilling to bee
knowne ſuch a rebell, he
thought it may be, it is
moſt likely, they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I but one, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
therefore the lot
will not fall upon me:
like a theefe, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
in his own
heart hee acknowledge
himſelfe guilty of that
wherewithall he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
yet will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
untill the matter
be throughly ſifted, and
ſo clearely proved to his
owne face, in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12420:68"/>
that he cannot for ſhame
(though with ſhame hee
confeſſe,) deny it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if God had not ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out this ſinner the
better, <hi>Ionah</hi> would not
have beene knowne
the man, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
would ſtill have
contended who was the
leſſer ſinner, therefore
they conſult to caſt
lots.</p>
            <q>Let us caſt lot.</q>
            <p>They did not uſe to
caſt lots, this was no cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
among the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
but the tempeſt was
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12420:69"/>
ſo wonderfull, that it
made them ſeriouſly to
thinke of God, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to uſe the meanes
preſcribed by God for
the ending of doubtfull
matters, acknowledging
that he ordereth all, and
the lot is the ſentence of
God: by the falling of
the lot, he revealeth the
truth.</p>
            <p>Theſe like worldlings
never confeſſe God, but
when he commeth in a
tempeſt: they will not
ſee his mercy, untill his
juſtice appeare: they
will not acknowledge
Gods governement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12420:69"/>
he bring on them
ſome judgement, like
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Sorcerers, who
confeſſed not Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
while they lived at
eaſe, but when the Lord
plagued them, they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, This is the finger
of God.</p>
            <q>Let us caſt lots, that wee
may know for whoſe cauſe
this evill is come upon
us.</q>
            <p>Why? what are they
the better when they
know him? what would
they doe with him on
whom the lot ſhould
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12420:70"/>
fall? Surely they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
or rather cleerely
ſeeing this tempeſt to be
ſent from ſome wrathfull
power, and that for ſome
one mans ſinne amongſt
them, they determined
having found him, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
him unto the God
that was ſo offended by
him, God turneth evill
unto good, but the divell
turneth good unto evill.
The Gentiles had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
in the time of the
common plague, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
one for the reſt.
This cuſtome they took
by imitation of the
Iewes, in offering beaſts,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12420:70"/>
and of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his ſonne, the divell
that father of lies and
ſchoolemaſter of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
teaching them. So
the divell tooke advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to doe evill by the
ſervice of God. In mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Gentiles to
worke abomination by
offering men, imitating
the Iewes commanded
ſacrifices. But if they
had rightly knowne the
true God, they would
have taken their ſins by
the throat, and have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
them.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:12420:71"/>
            <q>Come, let us caſt lots.</q>
            <p>The Marriners were
not ſo wiſe to prevent
the tempeſt before it
came, as they be diligent
to allay the tempeſt
when it may not be laid:
we overtaken with Gods
juſt judgements, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
carefull alwaies, to uſe
all meanes to bee rid of
them. But who keepeth
a watch over his owne
waies, and diligently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
free from that which
neceſſarily draweth on it
ſelfe Gods judgement?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12420:71"/>
who purgeth himſelfe of
his ſinnes, leſt hee bee
ſicke? who letteth or
fetcheth out his corrupt
bloud of pride, luſt,
covetouſneſſe, leſt hee
before? who keepes a
good diet, and maketh
his choiſe of holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
godly compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
religious conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But know
we, he is not ſafe that is
ſound, neither he ſound
that is intemperate.</p>
            <q>So they caſt lots.</q>
            <p>Whether it be lawfull
to caſt lots, it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12420:72"/>
by this example, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and therefore no
preſident for us: but ſo
farre may we uſe them,
as the Word doth lead
us, and no further.</p>
            <p>There are two Goats
brought to <hi>Aaron, Levit.
16.</hi> that hee might caſt
lots, to ſee which Goat
ſhould bee killed, and
which ſhould not, theſe
Goats ſignifie Chriſt: for
as he died he lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and as he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
he roſe againe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the land of Canaan
is parted by lots, <hi>Numb.
34.</hi> to ſee what part each
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12420:72"/>
Tribe ſhould inhabite.
Againe, that theefe
<hi>Achan</hi> is found out

his Tribe, then by his
Family and laſtly,
by his particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Againe it is ſaid, that
<hi>Saul</hi> was choſen King
by lots, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 10. and
leaſt any ſhould have
ſaid, that it was his
good lucke, his good
lot or chance to bee
King: therefore the
Lord appointed that he
ſhould be annointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee was choſen by
lots.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:12420:73"/>
Againe, <hi>Matthias</hi>
is choſen by lots to the
Apoſtleſhip in ſtead of
<hi>Iudas, Acts</hi> 1. ſo that it
is lawfull in ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to caſt lots, ſo that
they doe attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unto them, and
acknowledge that <hi>the
lot is cast into the lap,
but the diſpoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is from the Lord, Pro.
16.</hi> 33. for they muſt
not ſay that it is their
chance, fortune, or
good lucke: for ſo
they make an Idoll of
it, and rob God of the
honour due unto him.
For it was not <hi>Sauls</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:12420:73"/>
fortune to be King, but
Gods mercy: it was
not <hi>Achans</hi> chance to
be caught, but Gods
judgement. Lots may
bee uſed to prevent
ſtrife, when all other
meanes have beene
uſed, and ſometimes
before all other meanes,
when in wiſedome it is
thought the beſt meanes.
Brethren often and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at firſt divided their
inheritance by lots, as
the Children of Iſrael
divided the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.
Therefore in the
Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> there
is an order, that in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12420:74"/>
the time of plague, there
ſhould be an houſe ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for the ſick to lodge
in, and leaſt they ſhould
bee uncomforted, they
chuſe out a Mininiſter by
lots to doe it.</p>
            <q>So they caſt lots.</q>
            <p>Now we are come to
put up our ſelves to the
Court of Lawyers, to
ſee if they will doe any
thing for God, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or for love,
<hi>viz.</hi> that they would
end mens ſuits quickly,
and let the poore Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
have equity. Some
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12420:74"/>
ſay that Lawyers bee
good untill they bee
Counſellers, like Lions,
which will be gentle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
their tallons grow:
bee not offended, but
amend, for malice
ſpeakes not.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded,
that if the lots were caſt
to ſee who troubles the
ſhip, it would fall upon
the Lawyers: bee not
offended but amend,
for malice ſpeakes not.
A poore Client com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
forth accuſing
one, and going home
accuſeth a hundred: for
ſo many ſeeke to hinder
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:12420:75"/>
him, ſo few ſeeke to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him, and ſo many
ſeeke to hinder him,
that all his gaine is but
labour and loſſe.</p>
            <p>For a ſmall matter
many will come to law,
to ſtrive for that, which
with reaſon might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be attained without
ſuch contention, and
others ſeeke to enrich
themſelves with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
yet in the end loſe
that they ſought, and
that they had beſide:
and ſo they contend and
ſtrive about a thing
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12420:75"/>
commonly, till the
Lawyer hath gained
more by them, than the
thing which is in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
is worth. Theſe
are like the Mouſe and
the Frog, which ſtrove
ſo long about Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
that at length
the Kite came and took
them both from it.
Others will come up to
law about a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and therein ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
themſelves, that
they cannot rid their
hands of it, untill it
have almoſt undone
them, like a ſilly ſheepe
that is hunting a flie,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12420:76"/>
which runneth from
buſh to buſh, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
buſh catcheth a locke
of him, ſo that the
poore ſheepe is threed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
ere he hath done,
and hath not a fleece
left him to cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
withall. So hee
runnes from Court to
Court, to ſue, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
to plead, till he
have ſpent his cloake,
his coat: were it not
better to have caſt lots
for the coat at firſt?
For the Law is like a
Butlers box, play ſtill
on till all come to the
Candleſticke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12420:76"/>
it is lawfull, to end
any controverſie in a
hard matter, to uſe this
meanes.</p>
            <p>Now whether it bee
lawfull to caſt dice, if
lots may not bee uſed
(as <hi>Salomons</hi> words,
<hi>Prov. 18. 18. The lot
cauſeth contention to ceaſe,</hi>
compared with <hi>Heb. 6.
16.</hi> prove) but in hard
matters and waighty
cauſes, when the thing
is doubtfull, and all
good meanes are tried
before to avoid ſtrife:
that queſtion is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which none but
voluptuous men make
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12420:77"/>
queſtion of, namely,
whether dice-play bee
a meet exerciſe for a
Chriſtian ſoule. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſaith, <hi>the lot cauſeth
contention to ceaſe:</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lots are to end
ſtrife, but theſe lots
make ſtrife: for before
thou takeſt the Dice,
thou knoweſt thine
owne, and no man ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to take it from
thee: but when thou
caſteſt the Dice, thou
doeſt (as it were) aske
whether thine owne be
thine owne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
a ſtrife of no ſtrife.
Art thou not worthy
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12420:77"/>
to loſe the gifts of God,
which ventureſt to loſe
them when thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not? Doeſt thou
not deſerve to forgoe
thine owne, which art
ſo greedy of anothers,
that thou wouldeſt have
his living for nothing,
but for turning of a
Die? <hi>Eſau</hi> did not ſell
his birth-right ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but hee had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for it which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
his hunger, but
God hath given thee
a living, and thou ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
it for nothing. The
Marriners did caſt lots
to finde out the ſinner:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12420:78"/>
they did not caſt Dice
to ſee who ſhould
winne, as Dicers doe:
for to whom the lot
falls, hee taketh all,
which deſerves to loſe
all as well as the other,
and hath no right unto
it by any law: for God
hath not allowed one
man to take anothers
goods for the tripping
of a Die, but either
they muſt bee merited,
or they muſt be given,
or they muſt be bought,
or elſe it is unlawfull,
ungodly, unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to take them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the brawles, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12420:78"/>
coſenages, the oathes
annexed to this game,
which would not agree
with it, unleſſe it had
beene a meete compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for them. Thou
takeſt another mans
goods for nothing,
whereas God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thee to get thy
living, with the ſweat
of thy browes, for thou
takeſt away that which
others ſweat for, and
whereas thou ſhouldeſt
live by working, thou
ſeekeſt to live by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
like as the Ape
which lives by toying.
Doth any Dicer thinke
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12420:79"/>
he doth well? Tell me
what thinkeſt thou?
for every ſinner doth
condemne in his prayer
to God, that which he
excuſeth before men: if
they which are Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
repent it, how can
they which are Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
defend it? Thou
ſhouldeſt doe nothing,
but that thou wouldeſt
have God finde thee do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if hee ſhould come
to judgement: wouldeſt
thou have him take thee
at dice? I am ſure thou
wouldeſt not have God
ſee thee ſo vainely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied:
neither canſt thou
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12420:79"/>
thinke, that Chriſt, or
his Prophets, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
or Evangeliſts,
were Dicers, for no ſuch
lots are named in the
holy Scripture, and yet
the Lords day is moſt
prophaned with this
exerciſe, Cards and
Dice, as though they
kept all their vanities to
celebrate holy dayes,
what haſt thou to alledge
for Dice, now evidence
is given up againſt them?
haſt thou any patron to
ſpeake for them, but
thy vaine pleaſure and
filthy covetouſneſſe,
which are condemned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12420:80"/>
already, and therefore
have no voice by Law?
Take away theſe, and
take away Dice. The
Patron condemnes the
Clients, when one
voyce condemnes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
if the exerciſe
were lawfull, ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
as pleaſure and
covetouſneſſe would not
ſpeake for it. Take thy
pleaſure therefore in that
which is good, and the
Angels will rejoyce
with thee: if this were
good, God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
them better that
uſe it: but neither win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
nor looſers are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12420:80"/>
gainers. I know not
how, but there is not
ſo much wonne as loſt,
as though the Divell did
part ſtakes with them,
and draw away with
a blacke hand, when no
man ſeeth, for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſaith, he hath not
wonne halfe ſo much as
the looſer hath loſt.
One would thinke that
one of them ſhould flow,
when ſo many ebbe:
there is never an ebbe
without a flowing, never
one loſeth, but another
winneth, but at Dice.
What a curſed thing is
this that turnes no man
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:12420:81"/>
to good, which robs
others, &amp; beggars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
The Schoole
of deceit, the ſhop of
oathes, and the field
of vanities. Thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
not onely hazzard
thy money (in this
game) but ventureſt
thy ſalvation, and caſteſt
Dice with the divell,
who ſhall have thy
ſoule. For every thing
that commeth well to
man, he giveth thankes,
but for that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by Dice, hee is
aſhamed to give thankes;
which ſheweth, that in
conſcience that gaine is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12420:81"/>
evill gotten, and that
hee ſought it without
God. Can this bee
good when worſt men
uſe it moſt? If it were
good, the evill would
like worſe of it than
the good: but the more
a man ſavoureth of any
goodneſſe, the more he
begins to abhorre it, and
his Conſcience doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him for it as for
ſinne. They which
doubt whether GOD
doe allow it, need but
looke how hee doth
proſper them that uſe
it: but they truſt not
in God, (the termes of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12420:82"/>
their occupation diſcrie)
for they call all their
caſts, chances, as
though they relyed not
upon God, but upon
chance. Therefore if
Dice make ſtrife with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe, if they take
away others goods for
nothing, if wee may
not live by playing, but
by labour, if they
which have beene Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
repent it among
their ſinnes, if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men never uſed this
recreation, but the worſt
moſt delight in it, if
thou wouldeſt not have
God ſee thee when thou
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12420:82"/>
playeſt at Dice, nor
take thee at it when he
comes to judgement,
if nothing but pleaſure
and covetouſneſſe ſpeake
for them, if they doe
not proſper which take
pleaſure in it, if they
truſt not upon God,
but relie upon chance,
if thou doeſt not onely
venture thy money, but
hazzard thy ſoule, then
the beſt caſt at Dice
is, to caſt them quite
away.</p>

            <q>And the lot fell upon

            <p>The lot fell upon
<hi>Ionah,</hi> not becauſe hee
was the greateſt ſinner
of them all, (for ſo is
the opinion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them worſt whom
they ſee moſt afflicted:
If any one bee ſeene
to beare his croſſe, then

ſuppoſing that
God is not bent againſt

            <q>And the lot fell upon

            <p>Now when the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that troubled the

               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:12420:84"/>
can hide himſelfe no
longer. Now he might
alſo feare to bee ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
by the Marriners
preſently. For the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
partly for the
paine they had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
partly for the loſſe
they had ſuſtained, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they remained, were
no doubt as the ſhee
wolves robbed of their
whelpes, out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
furious and fully
bent to ſacrifice him on
whom the lot fell, to
appeaſe the wrathfull
God. But God ſtayed,
and reſtrained the rage
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12420:84"/>
of the Marriners, and
made them afterward
willing to abide the
tempeſt a while, and
put themſelves to more
paine to ſave him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouring
by rowing
to recover land. For
having heard of the true
God, and though they
loſt their goods, having
found who is all good,
ſhall we (ſay they) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
him that hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us? Shall we give
him up to death unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily,
that hath
brought us to life, and
aſſured us to reigne with
God in all glory everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting?
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12420:85"/>
Surely the thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
are graceleſſe: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they that love
not, and ſhew not forth
the labour of love for
their gracious guide to
God: but therefore wee
may ſee that the hearts
of men are in the hands
of God, and he turneth
them which way he liſt,
hee faſhioneth their
hearts every one, yea
even Kings hearts, as
rivers of water doth he
turne, to water and make
fruitfull his vine: to
pitty and to perſecute, to
honour and to ſhame, to
love and hate his people:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12420:85"/>
to deliver their power to

And againe to eate the

let us never feare

for he formeth
the hearts of all, who

them that honour
him but to make them

let us put confidence
in man, nor in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for their hearts
are rivers of water of

themſelves, fleeting ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
as they be led fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
But eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
let us not forget
chiefly to make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
ſupplications, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions,
and to give

            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:12420:86"/>
            <q>And the lot fell upon
Ionah.</q>
            <p>Now <hi>Ionah</hi> could
not deny hee was that
ſinner, unleſſe he would
accuſe God of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgement: for
the lot is caſt into the
Lap, but the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
thereof is of the
Lord. Now therefore
he muſt needs confeſſe
it. The windes thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
the waves tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
the ſhip cracking,
the Marriners quaking,
upon their gods crying,
their wares forth ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12420:87"/>
               <hi>Ionahs</hi> prayers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
to caſt lots
conſulting, <hi>Ionah</hi> kept
himſelfe cloſe, hee
would not be thought
that ſinner. The winde
ſaid, I will overturne
thee; the water ſaid, I
will drowne thee: the
ſhip ſaid, I cannot hold
thee: the Marriners
ſaid, Wee cannot helpe
thee: his prayers ſaid,
Wee cannot profit thee:
his conſcience within
bleeding, and God at
the doore of his heart
knocking, and the lots
now ready for caſting,
ſaid threatningly, For
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12420:87"/>
thee the tempeſt is
come, thou fugitive,
and wee will diſcover
thee.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Ionah</hi> conceales
his ſinne, ſo much did
hee abhorre the ſhame
of men, of ſtrange men,
a few men, fraile men,
or the feare of the fury
of the fleſh. Therfore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the windes had roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and alſo the waves
raged, and the ſhip ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
cryed, and the lot,
his conſcience, and God
himſelfe threatned him,
the lot alſo condemned
him, and the feare of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12420:88"/>
being ſacrificed by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to Satan terrified
him, ſo that hee forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
repented through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he declared it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and confeſſed his ſin
freely. Such a ſtirre hath
God before hee can
come by his owne: he
muſt croſſe us, and ſet
himſelfe and all his
creatures againſt us, he
muſt ſtraine our bodies,
or leave our ſoules, and
conſtraine us to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee will returne
from our wicked waies
and throughly humble
our ſelves to yeeld him
due obedience, O the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12420:88"/>
goodneſſe of the great
God? O long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and bountifullnes
unſpeakeable, which not
onely leadeth, but alſo
in the chaines of love
draweth us to true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>It was Gods great
goodneſſe to <hi>Ionah,</hi> that
the Marriners ſacrificed
him not: greater, that
he truely repented: that
God continueth in his
calling, and bleſſeth his
(whoſe flying from
God, deſerved flinging
to Satan) not ſo much
ſolemne Preaching, as
ſudden confeſſion, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12420:89"/>
ſhort denuntiation of
vengeance, yea made
it ſo powerfull, that it
converted Idolatrous
Heathens, moſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Idolaters: firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
then <hi>Ninevites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what a bleſſing
felt <hi>Ionah,</hi> God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing
him of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to offer them a
lively, holy, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſacrifice to God,
by whom hee preſently
before, greatly feared
to have beene offered a
dead, unholy, and ſo a
delightfull ſacrifice to
Satan. This feare bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
and that joy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12420:89"/>
him, what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Almighty did
<hi>Ionah</hi> thinke it: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee converted the
<hi>Ninevites,</hi> he was more
to be humbled, fuller
to be ſtrengthened, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
every way to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
Therefore God
would have the ſea to
waſh him, the Whale
to faſt him, and yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
ſafe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him, that being
purified, he might pray
fervently: and being
delivered, finde power,
comfort, and courage
abundantly. Therefore
when by lot being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12420:90"/>
and by his owne
confeſſion found the
man that procured the
tempeſt, the Marriners
in love and compaſſion
of him, had aſſayed by
rowing to get to land,
but could not, the Sea
raging more and more,
and <hi>Ionah</hi> himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
he knew the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
was ſent for his
cauſe, and would bee
layed, he being caſt into
the Sea. <hi>Ionah</hi> at length
was caſt out of the ſhip
into the ſwelling ſurge
of the tempeſtuous Sea.
What hope of life then
left? Is there any? to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:12420:90"/>
ſwallow up all, ſoone
after hee is ſwallowed
whole of a Whale.
Here let us marke, that
after the tempeſt had
terrified <hi>Ionah,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
reprooved him:
when they had reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, his conſcience
pricked him, when
his conſcience had
pricked him, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
to caſt lots grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him: after griefe for
conſulting, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
to caſt lots vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: vexed at the
concluſion, the lot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
him: the lot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
condemned him,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:12420:91"/>
in what an agony think
we was <hi>Ionah?</hi> partly,
that he ſhould bee held
that notorious wretch
that had brought this
woe? partly, leſt they
in their raging griefe,
for their great trouble
of body, loſſe of goods,
and danger of life,
ſhould forthwith kill
him for a ſacrifice, to
appeaſe the unknowne
angry God? But after
this agony, the terror of
drowning followed, and
after that the horror of
that huge fiſh: firſt, leſt
it teare him in peeces,
then leſt it melt him,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12420:91"/>
afterward, leſt it poyſon
him: laſtly, three daies
and three nights the
comfortleſſe horror of
darkeneſſe, and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſtinke in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
belly tormented
him.</p>
            <p>Firſt then ſee, the
windes could not further
him, the waters could
not beare him, the ſhip
could not hold him, the
Marriners could not
helpe him: and being
caſt out, leſt all for him
be caſt away, the Whale
would not ſpare him,
the ſtinch would ill feed
him, the darkneſſe would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12420:92"/>
leſſe glad him, and light
might not viſit him.
Now ſee then what
<hi>Ionah</hi> got by his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
notwithſtanding all
the promiſes of which
Satan aſſured him, and
all the furtherances
which the Serpent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
him, hee loſt his
labour, loſt his money,
loſt his joy, loſt his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
loſt his quiet, and
ſaw no hope but to loſe
his life too, finding plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
and bitterly fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
dreadfull feares. He
truſted to the windes,
the windes could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſave him: hee truſted to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12420:92"/>
the ſhip, the ſhip could
not keepe him: he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to the Marriners,
the Marriners could not
hold him: he truſted to
the lot, the lot would
not ſpare him: he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to the waters, the
waters could not beare
him, neither would the
Whale forbeare him,
neither did any thing
make ſhew of likelihood
to ſave him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee may ſee in
<hi>Ionah,</hi> what it profiteth
a man to flie from God,
forſaking his calling,
and ſo practiſing the
evill motions of Satan
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12420:93"/>
in ſtead of the knowne
will of God. Aſſuredly,
if we follow his flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as <hi>Ionah</hi> did, we ſhall
have as hee had, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
conſciences, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearts, and the wrath
of God upon our heads.
For hee hath nothing
to give us, although he
promiſe and make us
beleeve hee hath King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
Yes indeed, he
hath horror of minde for
all that obey him, and
hell for the reward of
his, which will make all
their hearts ake which
receive it.</p>
            <p>See ſecondly in this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12420:93"/>
puniſhment of <hi>Ionah,</hi> the
juſtice of God. The
Bee, when ſhee hath
once ſtung, doth leeſe
her ſting, ſo that ſhee
can ſting no more: So
doth not Gods juſtice
puniſhing ſinne: for it
retaineth power, it hath
ſtore of ſtings to vexe
ſtill: when one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is executed, hee
ever hath other enow
ready, either of the ſame
kinde in another degree
more ſharpe, or of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort: for all the
creatures with their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
powers, are Gods
darts to ſtrike us when
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12420:94"/>
hee commands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we be ſicke, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is not dead with us:
if we be poore, poverty
endeth not: if we be in
danger, danger is not
therefore put downe for
ever after: and if we be
vexed, vexation hath
not therefore loſt his
ſting: his darts, his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
alſo are as ſharpe
now as they were at the
firſt, and ſharper too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee are ſinfuller.
For according to the
ſickneſſe is the medicine,
and wounds more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
require more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourous
plaiſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:12420:94"/>
And if thou be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
then hee will
lead thee through them
all, untill he hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thee, and made
thee to glorifie him
with obedience, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſtroyed thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
neither lightly think
of this that God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to puniſh for
ſinne, yea moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to correct his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
though repenting.
If our Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi>
here may not keepe
thee ſome good while
in a due meditation of it,
let that man after Gods
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12420:95"/>
owne heart, the ſweet

            </p>
            <q>And the lot fell upon

            <p>The lot fallen upon
<hi>Ionah,</hi> the juſtice of God
(both manifeſting the
truth incorruptly, and
chaſtiſing his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſervant ſeverely) did
appeare but with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
mercy ſhined, and
the Marriners mindes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12420:99"/>
were mollified, in that
they ſacrificed him not
to Satan, but much more
that he by that meanes
truely repented. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the old Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Marriners, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by him were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and he caſt into the
Sea, was not drowned,
ſwallowed of the whale,
and three daies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein periſhed not,
but miraculouſly was
preſerved, and moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
caſt on land ſafe:
and laſtly, crying againſt
<hi>Nineveh</hi> that ſinnefull
Cittie, had his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ſo mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12420:99"/>
that he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
humbled them all.
This mercy was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
this goodneſſe of
God to <hi>Ionah</hi> moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
For the <hi>Ninevites</hi>
hearing, <hi>Yet forty daies
and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall bee
overthrowne, Ionah</hi> 3. 5.
firſt as the Marriners had
before done, beleeved
the Word of GOD,
though they never heard
it before? If we heard
the Word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
as the Marriners
and Ninevites did with
trembling hearts, in the
ſenſe of Gods Majeſty,
it would not be but wee
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12420:100"/>
ſhould feele the power
of it lively, and filled
with all joy in beleeving
ſpeedily, but uneffectuall
and fruitleſſe is Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
becauſe there is
nothing almoſt but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
and ſenſeleſſe
hearing. And why
ſhould God teach the
heedleſſe to learne?
Why ſhould hee give
pearles to dung-hill
Cockes, nay, to very
ſwine? But they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Word aſſoone
as they heard it, though
they never heard it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
What doth that
argue? Surely it ſheweth,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12420:100"/>
that the fooliſh and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are more diligent and
ready, both to heare and
receive the Word of
God, then thoſe that
are wiſe in their owne
conceit, or alſo in the
view of the world.
What ſaith Chriſt? <hi>The
poore receive the Goſpell,
Mat.</hi> 11. 5. What ſaith
<hi>Paul? Not many rich, not
many wiſe, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 26. For
though we have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if our knowledge
be like the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi>
23. 13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28.
that is, in ſhew of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
onely, in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
holineſſe, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12420:101"/>
hearted friendſhip
through hypocriſie, it
had beene better for us
that we had beene igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
for it will but leave
us the more inexcuſable,
it will be found inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſave us, but ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
the more fearefully
to condemne us, becauſe
we know our Maſters
will and doe it not.
Therefore as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid
to <hi>Simon Magus, Thy
money periſh with thee,
Acts</hi> 8. 20. So will the
Lord ſay unto ſuch, Thy
knowledge periſh with
thee, ſeeing it is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:12420:101"/>
But when <hi>Nineveh</hi> had
beleeved God, what did
they ſecondly? They
ſpeedily, they notably
repented, they proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a faſt, they put on
ſack-cloth, they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themſelves before
the Lord, they earneſtly
beſought him to turne
away his wrath from
this woefull Cittie. <hi>Ionah</hi>
preached at <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
crying againſt it, ſeemeth
to have humbled them,
and that without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(without which
ſcant any doctrine is of
credit among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles)
not onely within
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12420:102"/>
forty, but within foure
daies, much within forty
dayes, he converted <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi>
ruffling <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
old and Idolatrous <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi>
long before forty
dayes be ended, the ſeed
is ſowne, growne, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mightily, and full
ripe, in a ſoile in reaſon
moſt barren. Sow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yee Seedſmen,
where you are ſet. If ye
ſow cheerefully, ye ſhall
reape plenteouſly in due
time: Faint not: ſay not
I have a ſtony, or a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or a thorny ground:
<hi>Nineveh</hi> repents in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:12420:102"/>
In which willing
ſubmiſſion of theirs,
and ſpeedy lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
at the words
of the Prophet, (after
hee had beene three
daies and three nights
in the Whales belly)
the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
by Chriſt, (after
hee had beene three
daies and three nights
in the bowels of the
Earth) might well bee
ſignified. For they no
leſſe willingly than the
Ninevites, ſubmitted
themſelves to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
preached no leſſe
ſpeedily, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12420:103"/>
more truely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For though they
now thus wonderfully
humbled themſelves,
not the fearefull multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
onely, but the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
and greateſt, the
Nobles and King alſo,
and ſo all eſcaped now:
ſoone after they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their vomit, and
never ceaſed to adde
ſinne to ſinne, till they
were by open warres
miſerably weakned, and
at length fulfilling the
Prophecy of <hi>Nahum,
(Nah. 3. 16.)</hi> utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
Therefore firſt,
for the comfort of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:12420:103"/>
godly, ſince <hi>Ahab</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſelfe before the
Lord, <hi>(1 King. 22. 26, 27,
29.) Ahab,</hi> I ſay, that
had done exceeding ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominably,
in following
Idols, and ſold himſelfe
to worke wickedneſſe
in the ſight of the Lord,
ſubmitted himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the hand of God,
faſting in ſackecloth,
though hee did all in
hypocriſie: had not the
evill threatned brought
upon him in his daies:
ſeeing <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (and
the Princes of Iſrael
who had forſaken the
Lord) and the whole
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12420:104"/>
Tribe of Iudah, which
wrought wickedneſſe in
the ſight of the Lord,
and provoked him more
with their ſinnes than
all that their Fathers had
done humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before the Lord,
and confeſſing him juſt,
had not the wrath of
the Lord powred upon
them, by <hi>Shiſhak</hi> King
of Egypt were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
but ſhortly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
yea alſo things
proſpered in <hi>Iudah,</hi>
though the Lord had
threatned to leave them
in the hands of <hi>Shiſhack,</hi>
albeit they truely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12420:104"/>
not: laſtly, for as
much as <hi>Nineveh</hi> that
bloudy Citty full of lies
and robbery, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
harlot, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of fornications,
that Miſtreſſe of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſts,
which ſold the
people through her
whoredomes, and the
nations through her
witch-craft, humbling
themſelves with faſting,
and putting on of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
the Lord repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the evill he had
threatned them, and did
it not: how aſſured may
wee bee that whatſoever
judgement the Lord
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12420:105"/>
threatneth us, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he threaten it, it
ſhall not light on us,
when wee unfainedly
humble our ſelves in true
faſting, turning from
our evill waies, and
from the heart vowing
to ſerve God in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
For this is the
cleare promiſe of the
faithfull God; 2 <hi>Chron.
7. 13, 14. If I ſhut the
Heaven that there bee
no raine, or if I command
the Graſhopper to devoure
the land, or if I ſend pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence
amongſt my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if my people, among
whom my Name is called
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12420:105"/>
upon, doe humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and pray and ſeeke
my preſence, and turne
from their wicked waies:
then will I heare in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and bee mercifull to
their ſinnes, and heale
their land.</hi> Againe, as
generally moſt plainely
ſaith juſt <hi>Iehovah; Ier.
18. 7, 8. I will ſpeake ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
againſt a Nation, or
against a kingdome, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I will plucke it up,
and root it out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it, but if this Nation
against which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
this, turne from
their wickedneſſe, I will
repent of the plague that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12420:106"/>
I thought to bring upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.</hi>
Let us then, O beloved
of the Lord, whoſoever
love the Lord Ieſus, be
carefull to fulfill the
condition, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
not doubting of
the performance of the
promiſe, by ſo much
the more, by how much
the fewer we be, and by
how much the longer
and clearer the Lord
hath threatned moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgements.</p>
            <p>Now for the terror
of the ungodly, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them as repent
onely when Gods hand
is upon them, and then
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12420:106"/>
humble themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
onely, and that
but onely when the
fierceneſſe of his wrath
appeareth, or elſe after
they have eſcaped the
feared judgement, fall
to their wonted wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againe: let them
bee ſure the ſtrong and
juſt God, that conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Nineveh</hi> ſlidden
backe, will overtake
them alſo in wrath, and
for ever turne them
over to ceaſeleſſe woe.
For the greatneſſe, the
beauty, the ſtrength,
and riches of <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
could not withſtand the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12420:107"/>
hand of God, or keepe
it from deſtruction, but
rather furthered and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
it. For with the
more excellent orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that it was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Lord, the
more hainous and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
in his ſight was
the abuſe of them.
Therfore the hugeneſſe,
or the ſtrength of this,
or any other Cittie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſave it from the
judgement of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinnefull in his

            <p>Great <hi>Sodome</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,

till ſhee bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
and theſe were
and ſhall bee puniſhed
for unthankfullneſſe and

Iericho, Sodome,</hi> nor <hi>Rome,</hi>
have had halfe the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that we have had,
yet we are unthankfull
too, then what have
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12420:108"/>
wee to looke for? but
when <hi>Sodome</hi> was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

alwaies provide for his
people, though he make
never ſo great a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and deſtruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his enemies. For
the Lord becauſe of his
covenant doth alwaies
provide for his choſen,
although they be but a
remnant, like the glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after harveſt, or
like a cluſter of Grapes

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12420:108"/>
after the vintage, and
though there be never
ſo great calamity or

Chap. when there was

which either the
World, the Fleſh, or

away from a true faith,
but may lay hold of
thoſe gracious promiſes,

<pb facs="tcp:12420:112"/>
which corrupt my ſoule,
and darken my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and waſh them
away (I moſt humbly
beſeech thee) in the
precious bloud of thy
Sonnes Paſſion, that ſo
I may be acknowledged
for one of thine Elect,
when I ſhall appeare
before thy Iudgement
ſeate. Give mee a will
carefully to follow my
vocation, and let thy
bleſſing bee upon me in
the ſame: bleſſe me in
my body, in my ſoule,
and in whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto mee: lighten
my minde, and inflame
<pb facs="tcp:12420:113"/>
my heart with a love of
thoſe things that are
good; and as my body
(by thy power) is riſen
from ſleepe, ſo my ſoule
may daily be raiſed from
the ſlumber of ſinne, and
the darkneſſe of this
world, and ſo both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
may enjoy that
