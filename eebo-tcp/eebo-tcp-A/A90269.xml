         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I know that your peculiar
Intereſt, as Governors of this
Common-wealth, in the ſeverall ſtations wherein
you are placed of God, is truely stated therein, in
the purſuit whereof, your Peace, and the Peace of
theſe Nations will be found to lye; I crave leave to
adde that conſideration alſo. Being fully acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in, and with what weakneſſe it was compoſed

meerly for the truths ſake therein contained which
is of God, and its ſuetableneſſe through his wiſe

providence, to the preſent ſtate of things, in theſe
Nations, that it found acceptance and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with you, which alſo makes me willing to
be therein your Remembrancer a ſecond time.
From the day wherein I received a command and
call unto the ſervice of Preaching unto you, unto
this iſſue of it, wherein it is cloathed anew with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to your Order, I found mercy with God to
have that caution, of the great Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding
in my heart and thoughts, if I yet pleaſe

leaſt unſuitableneſſe thereunto, with reſpect either

            <p>It was for Sions ſake, that I was willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this duty, and ſervice: rejoycing that I
had once more an opportunity to give publike Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
to the great concernment of the great God,
and our deare Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all the concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Nations in the World, and peculiarly
in his wonderfull providentiall diſpenſations, in
theſe wherein we live. And here as the ſumme of
all, touſe plaineſſe and liberty of ſpeech, I ſay,
If there be any thing, in any perſon whatever,
in theſe Nations, that cannot ſtand with, that
can ſtand without the generall intereſt of the
people of God pleaded for, let it fall and riſe
no more: And the Lord I know will ſend his
bleſſing out of Sion, on what ever in ſingleneſſe of
heart, is done in a tendency to the eſtabliſhment
thereof.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The words of my <hi>Text,</hi> are the reſult of
things, upon Gods dealings and diſpenſations
before mentioned. Uncertain it is, whether
they ought to be <hi>reſtrained,</hi> to the immediate
<hi>prophetie</hi> before going concerning <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> or
whether they relate not alſo, to that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Chapter, concerning the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> which is ſummed up. v. 24,
25, 26. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath ſworn, ſaying, as
I have thought ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, and as I
have purpoſed it ſhall ſtand: That I will break
the Aſſyrian in my Land, and upon my Mountaine
tread him under foot: then ſhall his yoke depart
from off them, and his burden from off their
ſhoulders.</hi> It is the ruining of <hi>Sennacharib</hi> and his
army in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that is foretold.
Yea and <hi>this</hi> ſeems to claim a peculiar ſhare
and influence into this <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or triumphant
cloſe; becauſe <hi>eminently</hi> and <hi>ſignally,</hi> not long
after, meſſengers were thus ſent from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
to enquire of the health, and congratulate the
good ſucceſſe of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> And well had it
been for <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>poſterity,</hi> had he given
thoſe <hi>meſſengers</hi> the returne to their <hi>inquiry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which was here prepared for him, ſome years

before. His miſtake herein, was the fatall ruine
of <hi>Judah's</hi> proſperity.</p>
            <p>Let not then that <hi>conſideration</hi> be excluded,
though the <hi>other</hi> inſiſted on, be principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>The words you ſee have in them, an <hi>Enquiry</hi>
and a <hi>Reſolution</hi> thereof. I ſhall open them
briefly as they ly, in the Text.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What SHALL one:</hi> what <hi>ſhall,</hi> or what
<hi>ought?</hi> what is it their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>doe</hi> or to <hi>ſay?</hi> or
what <hi>ſhall</hi> they, upon the evidence of the things
done, ſo doe or ſay: either their <hi>duty,</hi> or the
<hi>event</hi> is denoted, or <hi>both,</hi> as in ſuch predictions
it often falls out.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>What ſhall</hi> ONE? that is <hi>any one,</hi> or <hi>every one;</hi>
the anſwer ſpoken of is either the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>every
one</hi> to give, or it will be ſo evident that <hi>any one</hi>
ſhall be able to give it. The word <hi>one,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
is not <hi>expreſſely</hi> in the originall, but is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
included in the <hi>verbe</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: what
ſhall be <hi>anſwered,</hi> that is, by <hi>any one</hi> what ever.
There is no more in the <hi>tranſlation,</hi> then is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
infolded in the <hi>Originall expreſſion</hi> of
this thing.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>What ſhall</hi> one THEN? that is, in the <hi>ſeaſon</hi>
when God hath diſappointed the <hi>hopes</hi> and
expectations of the enemies of his people, and
hath <hi>ſtrengthned their rod</hi> to bruiſe them again
more then ever. That is a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> wherein great
inquiry will be made about thoſe things; what
ſhall one <hi>then</hi> anſwer? This word alſo, is includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115351:8"/>
in the <hi>interrogation;</hi> and much of the <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi>
of it, conſiſts therein.</p>
            <p>4. Anſwer the Meſſengers: That is <hi>men</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on ſet <hi>purpoſe</hi> to make <hi>inquiry</hi> after the
State of affairs among Gods people; Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,
Agents, Spies, Meſſengers, Enquirers of
any ſort; or the word may be taken more
<hi>largly,</hi> for any ſtranger that came <hi>to Jeruſalem.</hi>
The ſeptuagint render theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

things are cleare in the <hi>Originall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Of the NATIONS: That is of <hi>this,</hi>
or <hi>that</hi> Nation, of <hi>any</hi> Nation that ſhall ſend
to make inquiry: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of the <hi>heathen</hi> ſay ſome;
thoſe commonly ſo called, or the Nations <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranged</hi>
from God, are uſually denoted by this
word in the <hi>plurall</hi> number: yet not alwaies
under that conſideration: ſo that there may be
an <hi>enallagy</hi> of <hi>number,</hi> the <hi>nation</hi> for the <hi>nations,</hi>
which is <hi>uſuall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall one anſwer them?</hi> they come to
make enquiry after the <hi>work</hi> of God among
his people, and it is <hi>fit</hi> that an anſwer be given
to them: Two things are obſervable in this
interrogation.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Ob. 1.</note> The Nations about will be diligently enquiring
after Gods diſpenſations among his people; <hi>beſides
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115351:8"/>
what reports they receive at home, they will

               <note place="margin">Ob. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. The iſſues of Gods diſpenſations amongſt his
people ſhall be ſo evident and glorious, that every
one, any one though never ſo weak, if not blinded
by prejudice, ſhall be able to give a convincing
anſwer concerning them, to the enquiries of men.</p>
            <p>Something ſhall be ſpoken to theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
in the proceſs of our diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>2. There is the reſolution given of the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi>
made in this interrogation, hereof are 2.
parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What God hath done.</item>
               <item>2. What his people ſhall, or ought to do.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Wrap up at any time, the <hi>work</hi> of God, and
the <hi>duty</hi> of his people together, and they will
be a ſufficient anſwer to any mans <hi>enquiry</hi> after
the ſtate of things amongſt them. As to our
wiſdome in reference unto <hi>providentiall</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
this is the <hi>whol</hi> of man.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt thing in the Anſwer to be given
in, is the <hi>worke</hi> of God, the <hi>Lord hath founded
Sion.</hi> Sion; that is his <hi>Church,</hi> his <hi>people</hi> his
choſen ones, called <hi>Sion</hi> from the place of their
ſolemne worſhip in the days of <hi>David,</hi> The
figure and type of the Goſpell Church. Heb.
12. 22. <hi>Yea are come unto Mount Sion, and unto
the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is generally <hi>uſed</hi> not for the whole <hi>body</hi> of
that people unleſs as they were <hi>typically</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115351:9"/>
in which reſpect they were all <hi>holy.</hi> But for
the ſecret <hi>covenanted</hi> ones of that people, as is
evident from all the promiſes made thereunto,
yet with <hi>ſpeciall</hi> regard to the <hi>Ordinances of
worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This God hath <hi>founded:</hi> founded, or Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
ſtrengthened, that it ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. is a comment on theſe
words: He hath <hi>founded</hi> it; that is in faithfull
promiſes, and powerfull performances, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for its preſervation and eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Now this expreſſion, <hi>[The Lord hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Sion]</hi> as it is an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the enquiries of
the <hi>Meſſengers of the Nations,</hi> may be taken
two wayes.</p>
            <p>1. As giving an account of the <hi>work it ſelfe
done;</hi> or what it is that God hath done, in and
amongſt his people. What is the work that is
ſo <hi>fam'd</hi> abroad, and ſpoken of throughout the
World? That being <hi>attempted</hi> in many places, &amp;
proveing abortive, is here accompliſhed? This is
it, ſhall <hi>one</hi> ſay: God hath <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> his people
and their <hi>intereſt;</hi> it is no ſuch thing as you
ſuppoſe, that <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>ſet</hi> up, and ſome pull'd
downe; that new Fabricks of Government or
Ruling are erected for their own <hi>ſakes,</hi> or their
ſakes, who are intereſted in them. But <hi>this</hi> is
the thing that God hath done; he <hi>hath founded
Sion,</hi> eſtabliſhed his people and their <hi>intereſt,</hi> in
deſpight of all oppoſition.</p>
            <p>2. As giving a Reaſon of the worke done;
whence is it that the Lord hath wrought ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115351:9"/>
               <hi>mightily for</hi> you, <hi>amongſt</hi> you, in your <hi>behalf,</hi>
praeſerved you, recover'd you, ſupported you,
given you <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> and Victory, When all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>conſpired</hi> your ruine? why this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it. <hi>God hath founded Sion,</hi> He bore it good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
hath taken <hi>care</hi> of the intereſt of his
Church and people.</p>
            <p>The words may be taken in <hi>either</hi> ſenſe; the
iſſue of their intendment as to <hi>our</hi> inſtruction,
will be the ſame. This is the Anſwer to be given
to the <hi>meſſengers of the nations,</hi> who perhaps ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have heard of their ſtrength and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,</hi>
of their Councellors and Armies, of their
wealth and their Riches, of their triumphs and
enjoyments; no! <hi>God hath founded Sion.</hi> And
well had it been for <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> had he given this
anſwer prepared for him ſo long before, to
the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of <hi>Babilon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The</hi> great deſigne of God in his mighty works,
and diſpenſations in the world; is the eſtabliſhment
of his people, and their proper intereſt in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
generations.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſay; it is not for <hi>this,</hi> or
that form of government, or civile adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of humane affaires; it is not for <hi>theſe,</hi> or
thoſe Governors, much leſs for the <hi>advantage</hi>
of <hi>one</hi> or other ſort of men: for the Enthroning
of any <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> perſwaſion, <hi>gainfull,</hi> or
helpfull to ſome <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> that God hath
wrought his mighty workes amongſt us. But
it is that Sion may be <hi>founded,</hi> and the <hi>generall
intereſt</hi> of all the <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> of Sion be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115351:10"/>
preſerved; and ſo far as any thing lies in <hi>a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency</hi>
thereunto, ſo <hi>far,</hi> and no farther is it
with him accepted. And <hi>what ever,</hi> on what
<hi>account</hi> ſoever ſets up againſt it, ſhall be broken
in peices.</p>
            <p>What anſwer then ſhould we give to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers?
that the Lord <hi>hath founded Sion.</hi> This is
<hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that alone,</hi> which we ſhould inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and take notice of, as the <hi>peculiar</hi> worke
of God amongſt us. Let the reports from other
<hi>Nations</hi> be what they will, let them <hi>acquaint</hi>
the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of one another, with their <hi>Glory,</hi>
Triumphs, Enlarging of their empires and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>When it is inquired what he hath done in
<hi>England,</hi> let us ſay, he <hi>hath founded Sion.</hi> And
he will not leave untill every man concern'd in
the worke ſhall be able to ſay, we have buſied
our ſelves about things of no moment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
our dayes, and ſtrength, in ſetting up
<hi>ſheaves</hi> that moſt bow hereunto. This is the
<hi>main</hi> of Gods intendment, and whilſt it is <hi>ſafe,</hi>
he hath the <hi>Glory</hi> and end of his diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>2. The other part of the <hi>Anſwer</hi> relates to the
people; <hi>the poor of his people ſhall truſt in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words containe either their <hi>duty,</hi> they
<hi>ought</hi> to doe ſo, or the <hi>event,</hi> they <hi>ſhall</hi> doe
ſo; or <hi>both</hi> joyntly.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The poore of his people. v.</hi> 30. they are cald
the <hi>firſt borne of the poore and needy:</hi> That is,
thoſe who are very poore. Now this expreſſion
may denote either the <hi>people</hi> in generall, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115351:10"/>
had been <hi>poore</hi> and afflicted; and ſo the <hi>poore
of his people,</hi> is as much, as <hi>his poore people:</hi> or
<hi>ſome</hi> in particular, that <hi>partly</hi> upon the account
of their <hi>Low outward</hi> condition, partly on the
account of their <hi>lowlineſſe</hi> of minde, are called
the <hi>poore of his people:</hi> and ſo the words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
<hi>paraphras'd.</hi> Zeph. 3. 12, 13. <hi>I will alſo
leave in the midst of thee an afflicted, and poore
people; and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord:
The remnant of Iſrael ſhall not doe Iniquity, nor
ſpeake lies: neither ſhall a deceitfull tongue be
found in their mouth, and none ſhall make them
afraid.</hi> We may take the words in a ſence <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing</hi>
both theſe: namely for the <hi>poore preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
remnant,</hi> caried through the <hi>fiery</hi> triall, and
preſerved to ſee ſome <hi>comfortable</hi> iſſue of Gods
dealing with them, though yet wreſtling with
<hi>difficulties</hi> and <hi>perplexities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What ſhall they doe? <hi>they ſhall truſt in it;</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>in it they ſhall truſt;</hi> that is, being
<hi>in it,</hi> they ſhall truſt, confide, <hi>acquieſs,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
in the <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath wrought this
work: or in it, that is, either in the <hi>work</hi> of God,
or in <hi>Sion</hi> ſo eſtabliſhed by God.</p>
            <p>The word here uſed for truſting, is ſometimes
taken for to <hi>repaire,</hi> or to retreat to any thing,
and not properly to put truſt, <hi>affiance</hi> or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ſo it is rendred in the <hi>margine</hi> of
your books: they ſhall <hi>betake themſelves to it.</hi>
So is the word uſed <hi>Judges. 9. 15. Pſal.</hi> 36. 7.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>intendment</hi> is, that the poore <hi>preſerv'd
people of God,</hi> ſeing his deſigne to found <hi>Sion,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115351:11"/>
to eſtabliſh the <hi>interest</hi> of his choſen, ſhall leave
of all other <hi>deſignes,</hi> aymes and contrivances,
and winde up all on the ſame <hi>bottome;</hi> They
<hi>ſhall</hi> not, at leaſt they <hi>ought</hi> not (for I told you
the words might denote either their <hi>duty,</hi> what
they <hi>ought</hi> to doe, or the <hi>event</hi> what they <hi>ſhall</hi>
doe) ſet up <hi>deſignes,</hi> and aymes of their owne,
and contend about <hi>other</hi> things! but betake
their hopes to that which is the main <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of God, the Eſtabliſhment of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of his people, and caſt all other things in a
<hi>ſubſerviency</hi> thereunto. The ſumme is,</p>
            <p>It is the duty of Gods poore preſerved remnant
laying aſide all other aimes and contrivances,<note place="margin">Ob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> to
betake themſelves to the work of God, founding
<hi>Sion</hi> and preſerving the common intereſt of his
people.</p>
            <p>Of the Propoſitions thus drawn from the
words, I ſhall Treat ſeverally, ſo farre, as they
may be <hi>foundations</hi> of the inferences inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is this: <hi>The Nations about, will be
diligently enquiring concerning Gods diſpenſations
among his people;</hi> Their eyes are upon them,
and they will be enquiring after them.</p>
            <p>In the handling of <hi>this,</hi> and all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
I humbly deſire, that you would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in what <hi>capacity,</hi> as to the diſcharge of this
<hi>work,</hi> I look upon my ſelfe, and You. As you
are <hi>hearers</hi> of the Word of God, (in which ſtate
alone at preſent, though with reference to
your deſigned employment, I look upon you) as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115351:11"/>
you are not at all diſtinguiſhed from others, or
among your ſelves: but as you are <hi>Believers,</hi> or
not; Regenerate Perſons, or coming ſhort
thereof. And on this account, as I ſhall not
ſpeake of my <hi>Rulers</hi> without <hi>Reverence,</hi> ſo I
ſhall endeavour to ſpeak to my <hi>hearers</hi> with
Authority. I ſay then,</p>
            <p>1. There are certain <hi>Affections,</hi> and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
that are active in the <hi>Nations,</hi> that will
make them reſtleſſe, and alwaies put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this <hi>enquiry.</hi> The people of God, on <hi>one</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or <hi>other,</hi> ſhall be in all ſeaſons a <hi>ſeparated
people. Num. 23. 9. Lo the People ſhall dwell alone,
and ſhall not be reckoned among the Nation;</hi> yea
they are <hi>ſeperated</hi> from them, whileſt they are
in their <hi>bowells,</hi> and dwell in the <hi>middeſt</hi> of
them: <hi>Micha</hi> 5. 7, 8. whether they are amongſt
them, as the <hi>ſpring</hi> of their mercies, or the <hi>riſe</hi>
of their deſtruction, (one of which they will
alwaies be) yet they are not of them. No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then is any <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>portion</hi> of them, thus
dedicated to God; but all the <hi>Nations</hi> about,
and thoſe amongſt them not ingaged in the
ſame way with them, inſtantly look on them,
as <hi>utterly</hi> ſever'd from them: having <hi>other</hi>
ways, ends, and intereſts then they, being built
up wholly on another account and foundation:
They <hi>reckon</hi> not of them as a <hi>people</hi> and a <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The Concluſion they make concerning
them, is that of <hi>Haman: Eſther 3. 8. There is a
certain people ſcattered abroad, and diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people in all the Provinces of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115351:12"/>
and their Lawes are diverſe from all people.</hi>
Not their <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>judiciall Laws,</hi> which
were the ſumme of that perfection, which all
Nations aimed at; on which account they ſaid
of them, <hi>Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and
underſtanding People.</hi> Deut. 4. 6. and the keeping
of thoſe Laws was <hi>their wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among all Nations:</hi> nor yet meerly the
<hi>Laws</hi> of their Religious worſhip: but the whole
<hi>way, intereſt, deſigne,</hi> profeſſion of that people,
is comprized in this expreſſion, they are diverſe
from all people. Looking on them in this <hi>ſtate,</hi>
they have principles (as I ſaid) that will carry
them out to an <hi>enquiry</hi> into their <hi>ſtate</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>1. They are full of <hi>Envy</hi> againſt them; <hi>They
ſhall be aſhamed of their envy at thy people.</hi> Iſaiah.
26. 11. looking on them, as <hi>wholly ſeparated
from them,</hi> and ſtanding on <hi>another account</hi> then
they doe, they are full of <hi>envy</hi> at them. <hi>Envy</hi>
is a reſtleſſe paſſion, full of enquiries and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies;
the more it <hi>finds</hi> of <hi>poyſon,</hi> the more it
<hi>ſwells</hi> and feeds. It will ſearch into the <hi>bottome</hi>
of that which its eye is fixed on. The tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
of the whole buſineſſe between <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> gives light to this conſideration.
See <hi>Neh. Ch.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And ever the <hi>nearer</hi> any nation is to this
people, the greater is their Envy. It was <hi>Edom,</hi>
and <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> the nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
that were moſt filled with <hi>wrath</hi> and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
againſt Iſraell. Yea when that People was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115351:12"/>
divided among themſelves, and the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God remained with <hi>Judah,</hi> and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the <hi>ſeparated people, Ephraim</hi> was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
filled with <hi>Envy</hi> againſt them. Iſaiah. 11. 13.
The <hi>Envy alſo of Ephraim ſhall depart, and the
adverſaries of Iudah ſhall be cut off. Ephraim ſhall
not envy Iudah:</hi> For there muſt be a deſire of the
ſame thing, as ſomething anſwering it (which
befalls in proximity of habitation) that a man is
<hi>envied</hi> for, in him that <hi>envy's</hi> him. This is one
<hi>fountain</hi> of the nations enquiry after your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
            <p>Through the <hi>providence</hi> of God, you <hi>dwell</hi>
alone; that is, as to your main deſigne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
You are not <hi>reckoned among the nations,</hi>
as to the ſtate of <hi>being</hi> the people of God; ſo
far, and under that conſideration, They count
you not worthy to be <hi>reckoned</hi> or eſteemed a
Nation. They <hi>envy</hi> to ſee the men of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<hi>exalted,</hi> bleſſed. The ſame is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Ephraim</hi> amongſt us; men not engaged
in the ſame <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>way</hi> with you, they are
full of <hi>envy.</hi> Wherefore doe they enquire of
your wellfaire, of your ſtate and condition,
of your affaires? is it that they <hi>love</hi> you, that
they deſire your <hi>proſperity,</hi> that they would
have you an <hi>establiſhed</hi> Nation? No, only their
<hi>envy</hi> makes them reſtleſſe. And as it is in
generall: ſo no ſooner doth any man upon a
<hi>private account</hi> ſeparate himſelfe from the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
intereſt of the people of God, but he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
filled with <hi>envy</hi> againſt the managers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115351:13"/>
of it. And notwithſtanding all our <hi>animoſities,</hi>
if this hath not <hi>befallen</hi> us, in our differences
and diviſions; I no way doubt a peaceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
and bleſſed iſſue of the whole. If <hi>Envy</hi>
be not at work, we ſhall have <hi>establiſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A ſecond <hi>principle,</hi> whereby they are put
upon their <hi>enquiries,</hi> is <hi>Feare.</hi> They <hi>feare</hi> them,
and therefore will <hi>know</hi> how things <hi>stand</hi> with
them, and what are the works of God amongſt
them. Hab. 3. 7. <hi>I ſaw the tents of Cuſhan in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the curtains of the land of Midian did
tremble;</hi> I ſaw it; when God was doing the
great <hi>work</hi> deſcribed in that Chapter with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lofty allegoricall expreſſions, of bringing
his people out of <hi>bondage,</hi> to ſettle them in a
new <hi>ſtate</hi> and condition; the <hi>nations</hi> round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
that looked on them, were filled with <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi>
feare and trembling. They were afraid
whither theſe things would grow. Pſal. 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to
be praiſed in the City of our God, in the mountain
of his holineſſe; Beautifull for ſituation, the joy of
the whole earth is mount Sion, on the ſides of the
north, the City of the great King; God is known
in her pallaces for a refuge. For lo, the Kings
were aſſembled, they paſſed by together; They ſaw
it and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and ſo
they haſted away; For feare took hold upon them
there, and pain as of a woman in travail.</hi> The
cloſe of all the conſiderations of theſe Kings,
and their attendants, is, that <hi>feare took hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them.</hi> Feare is <hi>ſollicitous</hi> and enquiring; it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115351:13"/>
will leave nothing unſearched, unlooked into,
it would find the <hi>inſide</hi> and bottome of every
thing wherein it is <hi>concerned.</hi> Though the more
it finds, the more it is <hi>increaſed,</hi> yet the <hi>greater</hi>
ſtill are its enquiries; fearing more what it
<hi>know's not,</hi> then what it know's, what is behind,
then what appear's. This put's the nations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their inquiry, they <hi>are afraid</hi> what theſe
things will grow to. Pſalm. 126. 2. <hi>Then was
our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue
with ſinging, then ſaid they among the heathen,
the Lord hath done great things for them:</hi> They
are the words of men <hi>pondering</hi> their affaires,
and filled with <hi>feare</hi> at the <hi>iſſue:</hi> If God doe
ſuch things as <hi>theſe</hi> for them, what think you
will be the <hi>iſſue?</hi> I dare ſay of the proudeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
of the people of God at this day; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all their anger they are more
<hi>afraid</hi> then <hi>angry.</hi> The like alſo may be ſaid
concerning their <hi>wrath, revenge,</hi> and curioſitie,
all preſſing them to ſuch <hi>Enquiries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>iſſue</hi> of this propoſall. If we are
not a <hi>ſeparated people</hi> unto God, if our <hi>portion</hi>
be as the portion of the men of the world, and
<hi>We</hi> are alſo as they, reckoned among the <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
if we have had only <hi>nationall works,</hi> in the
execution of wrath on men fitted thereunto
amongſt us; woe unto us that we were ever <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi>
in the whole affaire that for ſome years
we have been <hi>intereſted</hi> in. It will be <hi>bitterneſſe</hi>
and diſappointment in the latter end. If wee
be the Lords peculiar Lot, ſeparate unto him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115351:14"/>
the Nations about, and many amongſt our
ſelves, on the manifold <hi>accounts</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
will be enquiring into our ſtate and
<hi>condition,</hi> and the <hi>work</hi> of God amongſt us. Let
us conſider what we ſhall <hi>anſwer</hi> them, what we
ſhall <hi>ſay</hi> unto them, what is the account we
give of Gods dealings with us, and of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
works amongſt us? What is the profeſſion
we make? If we ſeek our ſelves, if we are full
of <hi>complaints</hi> and <hi>repinings</hi> one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If every one hath his own <hi>aimes,</hi> his own
<hi>deſignes,</hi> (for what we <hi>doe,</hi> not what we <hi>ſay</hi> is
the Anſwer we make) if we meaſure the work
of God by its <hi>ſuitableneſſe</hi> to our private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;
If this be the iſſue of all the dealings of
God amongſt us, we ſhall not have <hi>wherein to
rejoyce:</hi> but of theſe things afterwards, The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Propoſition is</p>
            <p>Ob. 2. The iſſue of Gods dealing with, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
among his people, ſhall be ſo perſpicuous
and glorious, that one, any one, every one, ſhall be
able to give an anſwer to them that make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
about them. <hi>What ſhall</hi> one <hi>then ſay; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for</hi> judgement, <hi>or</hi> mercy, <hi>all is one:
He will make the event to be evident and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
He is our</hi> Rock and his work is perfect;
<hi>and he will have his works ſo</hi> known, <hi>as that
they may all</hi> praiſe <hi>him. Be it in</hi> judgement; <hi>ſee
what</hi> iſſue <hi>he will bring his work unto. Deut.</hi>
29. 24, 25. Even all nations ſhall ſay, wherefore
hath the Lord done thus unto this Land? What
meaneth the heat of this great anger; Then men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115351:14"/>
ſhall ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the covenant
of the Lord God of their Fathers, which he made
with them, when be brought them forth out of the
land of Egypt. <hi>MEN ſhall ſay, ordinary</hi> men
<hi>ſhall be able to give this</hi> ſad account <hi>of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the works of God, and his dealings with
his people. So alſo as to his diſpenſations in</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 26. 11. Lord when thy hand is lifted
up, they will not ſee: but they ſhall ſee, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
for their envy at the people, yea, the fier of
thine enemies ſhall devour them. <hi>He will not
leave the work of his</hi> favour <hi>towards his
people, untill thoſe who are willing to ſhut</hi>
their eyes againſt it, <hi>doe</hi> ſee <hi>and acknowledge
his hand and councell therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſay this will hold in every <hi>diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of God, in all ſeaſons, from the <hi>beginning</hi>
to the <hi>ending</hi> of them. In many works of his
power and righteouſneſſe, he will have us bow
our <hi>ſouls</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of his providence, and his
<hi>Soveraignty,</hi> Wiſdome, and goodneſſe therein
when his <hi>footſteps</hi> are in the <hi>deep,</hi> and his pathes
are not known; which is the reaſonableſt thing
in the world.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>generally</hi> is the <hi>way</hi> of his proceedings;
eſpecially in the <hi>common concernments</hi> of his
people, and in the diſpoſall of their publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts;
his Work his Will and Councells there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhall be <hi>eminent</hi> and glorious.</p>
            <p>It is chiefly from our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and our own
<hi>follies</hi> that we come ſhort of ſuch an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the works of God, as to be able to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115351:15"/>
give an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to every one that ſhall demand
an account of them. When <hi>David</hi> was ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar'd
at the works of God, he gives this reaſon
of it, <hi>I was fooliſh and as a beaſt before him.</hi> Pſal.
73. 22. That thoughtfulneſſe and <hi>wiſdome</hi>
which keeps us in darkneſſe, is our <hi>folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſundry <hi>things</hi> that are apt to
cloud our apprehenſions, as to the <hi>mind</hi> of
God in his dealing with his people. As,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Selfefulneſſe</hi> of our own private <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
and deſignes; a private <hi>deſigne</hi> and aime,
in the works of providence, is like a private <hi>by-opinion</hi>
in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>You ſeldome ſee a man take up a <hi>by-opinion,</hi>
(if I may ſo ſpeake) but he inſtantly layes more
<hi>waight</hi> upon it, then upon all Religion beſides.
If that be not <hi>enthroned,</hi> be it a matter of never
ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> importance, he ſcarce cares what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of all other <hi>Truths</hi> which he doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace.
When men have fixt to themſelves, that
<hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> particular, muſt be the product of
Gods providentiall diſpenſations, That alone
fills their <hi>aimes</hi> and deſires, and leaves no room
for any other Apprehenſion. Have we not ſeen
perſons in the days wherein we live, ſo fixed on
a <hi>Raigne,</hi> a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> I know not what, that
they would ſcarce allow <hi>God himſelfe to be wiſe,</hi>
if their minds were not ſatisfied. <hi>Give me this
Child or I dye.</hi> Now is it probable, that when
mens whole Soules, are poſſeſſed with a <hi>deſigne</hi>
and deſire of their own, ſo fully, that they are
caſt into the <hi>mould</hi> of it, are transformed into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115351:15"/>
the image and likeneſſe of it, they can <hi>ſee, heare,</hi>
think, talk, dreame nothing elſe; That they
ſhall be able to diſcerne <hi>aright,</hi> and acquieſſe
in the generall iſſue of Gods diſpenſations, or
be able to <hi>anſwer</hi> the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the Nations,
making enquiry concerning them. <hi>Feare, hope,
wrath, anger,</hi> diſcontentment, with a rabble of
the like mind-darkning affections, are the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
of ſuch a frame. He who knows any
thing of the power of <hi>prejudices</hi> in diverting
the minds of men, from paſſing a right <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
on things propoſed to them, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of diſordered <hi>affections,</hi> for the creating
and confirming of ſuch prejudices; will diſcern
the power of thus <hi>darkning</hi> diſturbance.</p>
            <p>2. Private <hi>Enmities,</hi> private <hi>diſapointments,</hi>
Private <hi>prejudices,</hi> are things of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
Let a man of <hi>a free</hi> and
large <hi>heart</hi> and Spirit, abſtract his thoughts
from the <hi>differences</hi> that are among the people
of God in this Nation, and keep himſelfe from
an <hi>engagement</hi> into any particular deſigne and
deſire: it is almoſt impoſſible that he ſhould
winke ſo hard, but that the <hi>iſſue</hi> and Reaſon of
Gods dealing with us, will ſhine in upon his
underſtanding; ſo that he ſhall be able to give
an <hi>account</hi> of them, to them that ſhall make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.
Will he not be able to ſay to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Nations; &amp; all other obſervers of the
providentiall alterations of the <hi>late</hi> times that
have <hi>paſſed</hi> over us: the people of God in this
Nation were <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> but are now in eſteeme;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115351:16"/>
they were under ſubjection to cruell taſke-Maſters,
ſome in <hi>priſons,</hi> ſome <hi>baniſh'd</hi> to the
ends of the earth, meerly on the accont of the
<hi>worſhip</hi> of their God; the conſciences of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall'd,
and of many defiled and broken on the
ſcandalls laid before them, whileſt <hi>iniqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y and

that which God hath now <hi>done</hi> &amp; accompliſh'd:
the <hi>impriſoned</hi> are at Liberty, the <hi>baniſh'd</hi> are
recalled, they that have <hi>lyen</hi> among the <hi>Pots</hi>
have got doves whings, Conſcience is no more
enthralled, their ſacrifices are not mixed with
their blood, nor do they meet with <hi>trembling</hi>
in the worſhip of God. O ye <hi>meſſengers</hi> of the
nation this is that which the Lord hath done!
Who (J ſay) not <hi>intangled</hi> with one <hi>prejudicate</hi>
ingagement or other, may not ſe this with
halfe an eye? But ſuch is our <hi>ſtate</hi> and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſuch our <hi>frame</hi> and temper, ſo full are
we of our owne <hi>deſires,</hi> and ſo perplexed with
our owne <hi>diſapointments,</hi> that we can <hi>ſee</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
know nothing nor are able to give any
word of accont, that may tend to the Glory
of our God, to them that enquire of us; But
every one vents his owne <hi>diſcontentments,</hi> his
owne fears, his owne perplexities. The Lord
looke down in mercy, and let us not be found

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſers of the work of his power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Ah! how many glorious Appearances have
I <hi>ſeen,</hi> of which I ſaid under the <hi>ſhadow hereof,
ſhall we live among the heathen?</hi> but in a ſhort
ſpace they have paſſed away. Shall we therfore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115351:16"/>
chuſe us a <hi>Captain,</hi> &amp; goe down again into <hi>Egypt?</hi>
The Third propoſition enſues.</p>
            <p>The great deſign of God in his mighty works
and diſpenſations,<note place="margin">Ob. 3.</note> is the eſtabliſhment of his people
and their proper intereſt, in their ſeverall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>To make this <hi>clear,</hi> ſome few things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
to be conſidered, as:</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>proper intereſt</hi> of the people of God, is
to <hi>glorify</hi> him in their ſeverall <hi>places,</hi> ſtations
and Generations; none of us are to <hi>live</hi> unto
our ſelves. It is for this <hi>end</hi> that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a <hi>peculiar people</hi> to himſelfe in this world,
that he might be <hi>glorified</hi> by them, that his
name may be borne forth by them, and upon
them. This is the great end whereunto they
are <hi>deſigned,</hi> and that which they ought to
aime at only, even to <hi>glorify</hi> God.</p>
            <p>If this be not <hi>done,</hi> they fall of from, and are
<hi>beſides</hi> their proper intereſt. Beſides innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Teſtimonies</hi> to this purpoſe I might give <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to this Aſſertion, from Gods <hi>Eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
love</hi> towards them, with his intendment
therin; from their <hi>Redemption</hi> out of every
<hi>Kindred, tribe and family</hi> under heaven, by the
blood of Chriſt, from their <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the
world by their effectuall calling, and the like
conſiderations; But I have the <hi>conſenting voice</hi>
of them all in <hi>generall,</hi> and of every individuall
in particular, crying out, this is <hi>our,</hi> this is <hi>my
proper</hi> intereſt, that we may <hi>glorify</hi> God; faile
we, and come ſhort in this, we come ſhort,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115351:17"/>
and <hi>faile</hi> in the <hi>whole:</hi> ſo that I ſhall not need
further to confirme it.</p>
            <p>2. God is the only proper and <hi>infallible judge</hi>
in what <hi>state</hi> and condition his people will <hi>beſt,</hi>
and moſt <hi>glorify</hi> his name, in their ſeverall
generations. I thinke I need not inſiſt on the
proof of this Aſſertion; <hi>ſhould it be according
to thy mind,</hi> ſaith he in Job. <hi>Cap.</hi> 33. 34. or
according to the minde of God? ſhould the
diſpoſall of things be according to his <hi>will,</hi> or
ours? whoſe End is to be obtain'd in the iſſue
of all? is it not his Glory? who hath the moſt
wiſedome to order things aright, he or we?
who hath the chiefeſt <hi>intereſt</hi> in, &amp; <hi>right</hi> unto the
things contended about? who ſees what will be
the event of all things, hee or we? might men
be judges would they not univerſally <hi>practically</hi>
conclude, that the Condition wherin they
might beſt <hi>glorify</hi> God would be, that they
might have <hi>peace</hi> and reſt from their <hi>Enemies,</hi>
union and a good underſtanding among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
that they might dwell peaceably in the
<hi>world,</hi> without controll, and have the necks
of their Adverſary's under their feet. This in
<hi>generall.</hi> In <hi>particular:</hi> that <hi>this,</hi> or that <hi>perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
that they are peculiarly ingaged in, might
be always <hi>enthron'd,</hi> that their proper <hi>ſheafe</hi>
might ſtand upright &amp; all others bow thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and that nothing is contrary to the <hi>Glory of</hi>
God, but what <hi>diſturbs</hi> this Condition of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
I know not what may be accompliſhed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115351:17"/>
before the <hi>End</hi> of the world, from the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
of it hitherto for the moſt part the
thoughts of God, have not bin as <hi>theſe thoughts</hi>
of ours: He hath judged otherwiſe as to the
condition wherein his people ſhould <hi>glorify</hi> him.
God is <hi>judge</hi> himſelfe, Let us I pray you leave
the determination of this difference to him;
and if it be ſo, as to our <hi>generall</hi> condition, much
more is it ſo, as to our peculiar <hi>deſignes</hi> and
aimes, wherein we are divided.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Providentiall diſpenſations</hi> are diſcoveries
of the wiſdome of God in diſpoſing of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his people ſoas, they may beſt glorify
him. To diſpute againſt the condition wherin
at any time we are caſt by his <hi>providence,</hi> is to
riſe up againſt his <hi>wiſdome</hi> in diſpoſing of things
to his own Glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premis'd, it is eaſy to
give light and evidence to the Aſſertion laid
down.</p>
            <p>I might goe through the <hi>ſtory's</hi> of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with the <hi>Nations</hi> of the world, and his
own people amongſt them, and manifeſt in
each particular, that ſtill His deſign was, the
eſtabliſhment of his peoples <hi>proper intereſt.</hi> But
inſtead of inſtances take two or three Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that occure. Deut. 32. 8. <hi>When the moſt high
divided to the Nations their inheritance, when
he ſeparated the Sons of</hi> Adam, <hi>he ſet the bounds
of the people according to the number of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſraell.</hi> From the <hi>begining</hi> God hath ſo
order'd all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the world that they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115351:18"/>
may beare a <hi>proportion</hi> to what he hath to doe
with his people; that he may ſo order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe
of them, as that his deſign towards <hi>his own</hi>
may be accompliſhed. Amos. 9. 9. <hi>For lo I will
command and will fift the houſe of Iſrael among
all Nations like as corne is ſifted in a ſive, yet
ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the earth;</hi> All
the <hi>ſtir's</hi> and commotions that are in the world,
are but Gods ſiftings of the Nations, that his
choſen ones may be <hi>fitted</hi> for himſelfe, and not
loſt in the <hi>chaffe,</hi> and rubbiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27. Whoſe voice then ſhook the
earth, but now he hath promiſed ſaying, yet once
more I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo heaven;
And this word, yet once more, ſignifieth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of
things that are made, that thoſe things which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſhaken may remain: <hi>All the</hi> ſhakings <hi>of the
Nations are, that the</hi> unſhaken interest <hi>of the
Saints may be eſtabliſhed:</hi> Iſai. 51. 15, 16. <hi>But
I am</hi> the Lord thy God that divided the ſea whoſe
waves roared, the Lord of hoſts is his name. And
I have put my words in thy mouth, and have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee in the ſhaddow of mine hand, that I
may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of
the earth, and ſay unto <hi>Zion</hi> thou art my people.
<hi>Heaven, and earth, and all things therin, are
diſpoſed of, that</hi> Sion <hi>may be built and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.
All Gods works in this world, lye in
a</hi> ſubſerviency <hi>to this end and purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth God at any time <hi>proſper</hi> an evill or a
wicked <hi>Nation?</hi> an <hi>Anti-christian</hi> Nation? is it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115351:18"/>
for their <hi>owne</hi> ſakes? doth God take care for
<hi>Oxen?</hi> hath he delight in the proſperity of his
Enemies? No: it is only that they may be a
<hi>Rod</hi> in his <hi>hand</hi> for a litle moment, and <hi>a ſtaff
for his indignation</hi> againſt the miſcariages of his
people. Iſai. 10. 5, 12. <hi>O Aſſyrian, the rod of mine
anger, &amp; the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
This in ſuch a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> is their proper intereſt,
to glorify God in diſtreſſe. Doth he <hi>breake,</hi>
ruine and deſtroy them, as <hi>ſooner</hi> or latter he
will leave them, neither <hi>roote</hi> nor <hi>branch?</hi> all
that he doth to them, is a <hi>Recompence for the
controverſy of Sion.</hi> Iſai. 34. 9. for it is the day
<hi>of the Lords vengeance, and the yeare of recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the controverſy of</hi> Sion.</p>
            <p>We ſee not perhaps at this day, wherein the
<hi>concernments</hi> of the remnant of Gods people
doth lye, in the great <hi>concuſſions</hi> of the Nations
in the World; we know not what deſigne in
reference to them, may lye therein: Alas! we
are poore <hi>ſhort ſighted</hi> creatures, we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is before us, much leſſe can we make
a <hi>judgment</hi> of the work of God, in the midſt of
the <hi>darkneſſe</hi> and confuſion, that is in the
world, untill he hath brought it to perfection.
All <hi>lyes</hi> open and naked to his <hi>Eye;</hi> and the
beauty of all his works will one day appeare.
The true and proper <hi>intereſt</hi> of his people, ſo
as they may beſt <hi>glorify</hi> him in the world, is
that, which he is <hi>purſueing</hi> in all theſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115351:19"/>
The <hi>Grounds, Reaſons,</hi> and foundations of
this Truth, in the Counſell, from the Love,
and Attributes of God, the Redemption in the
blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> I muſt not now purſue, this one
thing I ſhall only offer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> of the people of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much to depend upon the <hi>diſpoſalls</hi> of
them, whom God by his providence raiſeth up
to rule and Government among the <hi>Nations;</hi>
though ſometimes he ſets up <hi>men,</hi> whoſe
hearts and minds are <hi>upright</hi> with himſelfe, yet
he will not truſt his owne to their mercy, and
the variableneſſe of their Wills in generall: But
will ſo <hi>diſpoſe, alter,</hi> weaken and ſtrengthen
them, ſo ſet them up, and pull down, that it
ſhall be their <hi>intereſt,</hi> to which they will alwaies
abide <hi>faithfull,</hi> ſo to deale with his people, as
he will have them dealt with, that they may
beſt <hi>glorify</hi> him in their generations.</p>
            <p>If it be in the <hi>infinite</hi> wiſe counſell of God,
to give his Saints in this <hi>nation</hi> peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
they ſhall not have it <hi>precariouſly</hi> upon
the wills of men; For he will not leave <hi>moulding</hi>
and diſpoſing of the affaires of the <hi>nation,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it find, that it is its <hi>proper intereſt</hi> to <hi>give,</hi>
and meaſure out unto them, what is to the
mind of God. All that hath been done amongſt
us, all that we are in expectation of, turnes on
this <hi>hinge</hi> alone. But laſtly,</p>
            <p>Ob. 4. It is the duty of Gods preſerved remnant,
laying aſide all other aimes and contrivances, to
betake themſelves to the work of God, founding
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115351:19"/>
Sion, and preſerving the common intereſt of his
people.</p>
            <p>God hath founded Sion, and the poore of
the people ſhall truſt therein, or betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto it.</p>
            <p>We are apt to <hi>wander</hi> on hills and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
every one walking in the imagination of
his own heart, forgetting our <hi>reſting place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God was bringing the power of the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> upon his people, the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
could neither perſwade the whole nation
to ſubmit to his <hi>Goverment,</hi> nor many <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dualls</hi>
among them, to fall to him in <hi>particular.</hi>
And when the time of their <hi>deliverance</hi> from
that <hi>Captivity</hi> was accompliſhed, how hardly
were they perſwaded to imbrace the Liberty
tendered; notwithſtanding all <hi>incouragements</hi>
and advantages, the greateſt part of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in that place of their <hi>bondage</hi> to this day.
So hardly are we brought to cloſe with Gods
<hi>peculiar work,</hi> and our own <hi>proper intereſt,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
his <hi>glory,</hi> and our own <hi>ſafety</hi> lye therein.
The Reaſons of this <hi>frame,</hi> I have in part tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
before, I ſhall adde but <hi>two</hi> more.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Diſcontentment</hi> with our peculiar lot and
portion, in the work of the Lord, and <hi>common
interest</hi> of his people. It is with us, in our <hi>civile</hi>
affaires, as the Apoſtle ſaith it is <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
body, nor ought to be in the <hi>ſpirituall,</hi>
or Church body: The <hi>foot</hi> doth not ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am not the <hi>head,</hi> I am not of the body;
no, it doth not; but is content with its own
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115351:20"/>
               <hi>place</hi> and uſefulneſſe. It is ſo with the reſt of
the members that are more <hi>noble,</hi> and yet are
not the head neither. It is otherwiſe with us:
I enterpoſe not my thoughts, as to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
conſtitution, and the order of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us. I ſpeak no more then I have ſundry
years ſince, ſundry times complained of, to a
<hi>Parliament</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Every <hi>one,</hi>
if not <hi>perſonally,</hi> yet in Aſſociation with them,
of ſome <hi>peculiar perſwaſion</hi> with himſelfe, would
be the <hi>head;</hi> and becauſe they are not, they
conclude they are not of the <hi>body,</hi> nor will care
for the <hi>body,</hi> but rather endeavour its ruine.
Becauſe their <hi>peculiar intereſt</hi> doth not raigne,
the <hi>common interest</hi> ſhall be deſpiſed; and this
hath been the <hi>temper</hi> or rather <hi>diſtemper,</hi> of the
people of God in this Nation now for ſundry
years; and what it may yet produce I know
not. Only for the preſent the work of God in
<hi>founding Sion,</hi> in purſeuing his peoples <hi>common
intereſt,</hi> is deſpiſed, thought light of, and all the
pleaſant things thereof trodden under foot.
Unleſſe God end this <hi>frame,</hi> my expectations, I
confeſſe, of an happy iſſue of the great work
of God amongſt us, will wither day by
day.</p>
            <p>2. The ſuffering of our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Judgements,</hi>
as to the products of providence, to run before
the Will of God. This, the Experience of theſe
daies hath taught us. Thoſe who have a
forwardneſſe in preſcribing to <hi>God</hi> what he
ſhould doe, as to the <hi>modus,</hi> or manner of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115351:20"/>
work, which at any time he hath to accompliſh,
Are ſtubbornly <hi>backward,</hi> in cloſing with what
he doth actually produce. Theſe and the like
things, which might be in large <hi>Catalogues</hi>
reckoned up, one after another, detain the
minds of men, from acquieſcing in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>intereſt of Sion,</hi> whoſe preſervation is the
whole peculiar deſigne of the <hi>great worke</hi> of
God, in any place or ſeaſon. Theſe <hi>foundations</hi>
being laid in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> let us now
ſee what inferences from them may be made,
for our advantage and inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ.</hi> 1. Let us then conſider diligently what
we ſhall <hi>anſwere</hi> the <hi>Meſſengers of the Nations;</hi>
ſome thinke that by the <hi>Nation,</hi> is peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves,
Whoſe meſſengers from all parts came to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
to <hi>enquire</hi> of the work of God, and to
adviſe about the <hi>Affaires</hi> of the whole. In this
fenſe <hi>you</hi> are the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> to
whome an Anſwer is to be returned: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Text ſaith, ONE ſhall doe it, that is,
<hi>anyone,</hi> I ſhall make bold before we cloſe, to give
an Anſwer to your Enquirys; and indeavour to
ſatisfy your Expectations: In the mean time as
the words ſeem more directly to reſpect the
<hi>enquiries</hi> of other <hi>Nations:</hi> So it is in a ſpeciall
manner incumbent on you, who will be eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
enquir'd of, to return an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them.
Be provided then I pray in your own hearts,
to give an Anſwer in this buiſineſs; and Oh
that you could doe it with <hi>one heart</hi> and lip,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115351:21"/>
with one conſent, and judgement. On <hi>whom</hi>
are the <hi>eies</hi> of this Nation and of thoſe round
about? from whom are the <hi>Expectations</hi> of men?
to whom ſhould we goe to enquire what God
hath done in this Nation, what he is doing,
what are the <hi>effects</hi> of his power, if not of you?
<hi>Some</hi> of you have been ingag'd in this work,
with the Lord from the beginning: And I hope
none of you have been engag'd in <hi>heart</hi> or <hi>hand</hi>
againſt it; and you ſpeake ſtill with <hi>living af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
to the old and common cauſe. If you
will be able to <hi>ſteere your courſe</hi> aright, If yon
would take one <hi>ſtraight ſtep,</hi> have in a readineſs
an acquaintance with the <hi>work</hi> of God, what
it is that he <hi>aimes</hi> at, by which you may be
guided in all your undertakings. Suppoſe now
a <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> ſhould come and aſke of you,
what God hath done in theſe Nations? what
he hath <hi>wrought,</hi> and effected? what is brought
forth? Have you an <hi>Anſwer</hi> in readineſſe? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God hath done ſo much as that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
you ſhould be able to give an account of
it. Take heed that every one of you be not
ready to ſpeake the diſquietments of your own
Spirits, and ſo caſt contempt on the work of
God. Something els is requir'd of you. I have
ſometimes in <hi>darkneſſe</hi> and under temptations
my ſelf, begun to thinke, that what <hi>hath been,</hi>
is the thing that is, and there is no new thing
under the Sun. As it hath been among the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
of old, ſo it hath been amongſt us; or as it
was with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 1 Kings 16. 22, 22. <hi>then were the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115351:21"/>
people of Iſrael divided into two parts, half of the
people followed Tibni the ſon of Ginath to make
him King: and halfe followed Omri: But the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that followed Omri prevailed againſt the people
that followed Tibni the ſon of Ginah, ſo Tibni di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Omri reigned:</hi> That a <hi>common thing</hi> and
frequent in the world had befallen us, wherein
God had no <hi>hand,</hi> but that of common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in daſhing one <hi>ſort</hi> of men againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So <hi>fooliſh</hi> have I been, and as a <hi>beaſt,</hi> ſo
ready to condemne the generation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
ſo <hi>unbelieving</hi> and ready to caſt away
the faith and prayer of <hi>ten thouſand</hi> Saints; one
of whoſe <hi>ſighs</hi> ſhall not be loſt. But ſuch <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
effects,</hi> ſometimes trouble diſquietment, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
&amp; carnall feare will produce. But
certain it is, none of the many <hi>cryes</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God ſhall be <hi>loſt,</hi> nor their faith be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
God hath a <hi>peculiar deſigne</hi> in hand,
and we are to find it out, that we may be able
to anſwer them that make <hi>enquiries.</hi> If you
lay not this foundation of your <hi>procedures,</hi> I
ſhall not wonder if you <hi>erre</hi> in your ways; It is
your <hi>Pole-ſtarre</hi> and <hi>will</hi> be ſo, by which your
whole courſe is to be ſteered; your <hi>ſhield,</hi> which
whileſt it is ſafe, though you <hi>dye,</hi> your glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay! what then is this great
<hi>deſigne</hi> of God among his people: Let the <hi>Holy
one of Iſrael</hi> bring nigh his work that we may
know it; what is that true and Generall intereſt
of Zion that he hath founded; let us know it,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115351:22"/>
that we may be able to give an <hi>anſwer</hi> to them
that enquire after it.</p>
            <p>1. Aske themſelves, thoſe who have <hi>prayed</hi>
for it, <hi>waited</hi> for it, <hi>expected</hi> it, are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of it, doe <hi>enjoy</hi> it, live upon it, probably
they will be able to give you an account what
is their peculiar and only <hi>intereſt,</hi> as to theſe
providentiall diſpenſations; ſurely they cannot
but know that which they enjoy, and <hi>live</hi>
upon.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay of all others, this is the moſt
<hi>unlikely,</hi> and irrationall courſe, a way to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex</hi>
and entangle, not to informe us at all. Is
it not cleare, that they are divided among
themſelves? Is not their language, is not their
voyce, like that of the Jewes at the building of
the <hi>ſecond Temple;</hi> ſome <hi>ſhouted for joy,</hi> and
ſome <hi>wept</hi> at the remembrance of the former
<hi>Temple</hi> are not their deſires rather like that,
and thoſe of theirs, who built <hi>Babell,</hi> then of
thoſe who cry <hi>grace grace,</hi> whil'ſt God is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sion? Doe not many of them utterly deny
any <hi>work</hi> or deſigne of God, (I mean what is
peculiar) in the affaires of this Nation; and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
fall away from the ſociety of them, who
are otherwiſe perſwaded? And is it likely that
we can gather any Reſolution from them? doth
not the greateſt danger of our own miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
lye in this? that we may be apt to attend
to their <hi>peculiar deſires,</hi> and ſo to divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, as they are divided.</p>
            <p>And is this the <hi>returne</hi> that indeed is to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115351:22"/>
made! O that mine eyes might run <hi>down</hi> with
water day and night on this account, that my
heart might be <hi>moved</hi> within me, for the folly
of my people. Ah <hi>fooliſh people</hi> and unwiſe, doe
we thus require the Lord?</p>
            <p>It is true, many at all times have deſired the
<hi>day</hi> of the Lord, who when it hath come, have
not <hi>been able</hi> to abide it, it hath conſumed <hi>them,</hi>
and all the principles, whereon they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and upon which they did deſire it; But
that thoſe who have their <hi>ſhare</hi> in it indeed,
ſhould be thus broken among themſelves,
ſhould <hi>bite</hi> one another, <hi>devour</hi> one another,
and ſcarce allow one another to be <hi>ſharers</hi> in
the common intereſt of the Saints, in that day,
this is a <hi>lamentation,</hi> and ſhall be for a <hi>lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet ſomething may be farther preſſed
on <hi>them</hi> in this buſineſſe. When one went to
demand of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of the ſeverall Sects,
which was the <hi>beſt</hi> of them, every one named
his own <hi>Sect</hi> and party in the firſt place; but <hi>all</hi>
of them in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, granted that of
<hi>Plato</hi> to be the moſt eminent. The enquirer
knew quickly what to conclude; ſetting aſide
prejudicate Affections, ſelfe love, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
he ſaw that the judgement of all, run on
that of <hi>Plato,</hi> as the beſt &amp; moſt eminent <hi>Sect,</hi> &amp;
which thereupon he preferred before the reſt.</p>
            <p>May not ſome enquiry of the like nature be
made of the <hi>people</hi> of God amongſt us? Ask
them what is the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of Sion, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115351:23"/>
God takes care of, that he hath founded in the
days wherein we live, in the great tranſactions
of <hi>providence</hi> that have paſſed over us. Say
<hi>ſome:</hi> that ſuch a <hi>forme of Church worſhip and
diſcipline</hi> be eſtabliſhed, ſuch a <hi>rule</hi> of doctrine
confirmed, and all men whatever compelled to
ſubmit unto them: herein lies that Kingdome
of Chriſt which he takes care of, this is <hi>that</hi>
which God will have <hi>founded</hi> and eſtabliſhed:
And what this <hi>Forme,</hi> what this <hi>Rule</hi> is, we are
to declare.</p>
            <p>That that <hi>Diſcipline</hi> be eradicated, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<hi>proviſion</hi> deſtroyed, and the men of <hi>ſuch</hi>
a perſwaſion Enthroned, to rule all the reſt at
their <hi>pleaſure,</hi> ſeeing, that notwithſtanding all
their pretended <hi>Reformation,</hi> they are yet <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian,</hi>
ſay others.</p>
            <p>Say ſome: that a <hi>Kingdome</hi> and Rule be ſet
up in our hands, to be exerciſed in the <hi>name and
Authority</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, taking away all <hi>Law</hi>
and <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> already eſtabliſhed, to bring
forth the Law of <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> conceived in
our minds and therein to be <hi>preſerved;</hi> all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
only in this, that a <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> as unto
adminiſtration of the things of God is to be
theirs.</p>
            <p>Say others laſtly, that the <hi>people of God</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the hands of their <hi>cruell</hi> enemies,
that they may ſerve the Lord without <hi>feare</hi> all
the days of their lives, in righteouſneſſe and
<hi>holineſſe,</hi> that notwithſtanding their <hi>preſent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi>
they may live peacably one <hi>with,</hi> or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115351:23"/>
at leaſt one <hi>by</hi> another, enjoying Rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
as they are fitted for <hi>imployments,</hi> and
as he gives <hi>promotion,</hi> in whoſe hand it is, that
<hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> and the love of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
be <hi>preſerved,</hi> protected, and ſecured, from a
returne of the hand of violence upon it; Herein
ſay ſome lies the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of the people
of God; this he hath wrought out for them,
herein he hath <hi>founded Sion.</hi> Aske now the
<hi>people of God</hi> in this nation, I ſay or any of
them, one, or more, at any time? What <hi>he,</hi> or
they, look upon as the <hi>chiefe</hi> thing aimed at in
the mighty diſpenſations of God amongſt us;
will they not every one <hi>anſwer</hi> in the firſt place,
that is aimed at, that is to be <hi>enthroned,</hi> that ſo
doing is the will of God, the End of his works
among them, wherein <hi>their,</hi> or <hi>his</hi> particular
ingagement and intereſt lies. But ask them
now againe, in the ſecond place, which of the
remaining perſwaſions concerning the <hi>work of
God,</hi> and the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of his people, they
would preferre next to their own: will they
not all <hi>unanimouſly</hi> fix on that mentioned in the
<hi>laſt place,</hi> rather then any of the other. Is it
not then evident that ſetting aſide <hi>prejudicate
affections,</hi> and ſuch determinations, as may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be ſuppoſed to ariſe from them, laying
away all <hi>private animoſities,</hi> and deſire of Rule
and preheminence, with other worldly and
ſelfiſh deſignes; the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the people
of God, doe <hi>anſwer</hi> to them that <hi>enquire,</hi> that
in the laſt perſwaſion lies the <hi>ayme,</hi> and <hi>work</hi>
of God in our generation. For my own parte, on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115351:24"/>
               <hi>this</hi> and <hi>other</hi> conſiderations hereafter to be
mentioned, I ſhall dare freely to give this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>
to the <hi>meſſengers</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> or any <hi>Nation</hi> in
the World, who ſhall make inquiſition after
the <hi>work</hi> of God amongſt us, and his <hi>deſigne</hi> in
reference to his people; and it is no other then
my heart hath been fixed upon for many years,
and which I have ſeverall times, on one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
or other intimated, or preſſed unto the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> which firſt undertook to mannage,
and ſuccesfully carried on that <hi>Cauſe,</hi> in whoſe
protection you are now engaged.</p>
            <p>This I ſay then; God hath <hi>founded Sion,</hi> he
hath taken care of the <hi>generation</hi> of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> however differenced
among themſelves; hath broken the yoke of
their <hi>Oppreſſors,</hi> given them <hi>peace,</hi> ordered the
affaires of this <hi>Nation</hi> ſo, that they <hi>doe,</hi> or <hi>may,</hi>
all of them enjoy quietneſs, one not <hi>envying</hi> the
other, nor they <hi>vexing</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſerving God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>light,</hi> which he is graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to <hi>afford</hi> them, they waite for farther <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations</hi>
of the glorious Goſpell; and that
God hath broken, and will <hi>break,</hi> every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
that either openly, and profeſſedly, or
upon ſpecious pretences of crying, loe here is
Chriſt, or loe <hi>there,</hi> hath ſought, or ſhall ſeek
and endeavour to ſubvert this his work, to the
<hi>preſervation</hi> whereof, he will certainly <hi>mould</hi>
the Government, and <hi>interest</hi> of this Nation,
ordering its <hi>affaires</hi> in a peculiar manner on
that account only: and not that he delighteth in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115351:24"/>
one <hi>way</hi> or <hi>form,</hi> wherein to it hath been caſt, more then
another. And what ever <hi>high minded men,</hi> full of their
owne apprehenſions and wiſdome, may doe, to this
<hi>worke of God,</hi> the <hi>poore of his people</hi> ſhall repaire. And for
my inſiſting on this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and this <hi>only,</hi> I have theſe
further Reaſons to adde for my juſtification.</p>
            <p>1. This is an <hi>interest</hi> comprehenſive of all the Son's of
<hi>Sion,</hi> whoſe <hi>founding</hi> God intends; it excludes none that
can claime a <hi>ſhare</hi> in the <hi>City</hi> of the living God. God
takes equall care of all <hi>the dwelling places</hi> of <hi>Sion;</hi> Every
dwelling place of <hi>Sion,</hi> hath its beauty, hath it's Glory. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
4 5. The Glory of one, may be as the Glory of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
of another as the <hi>Moon,</hi> of others as the <hi>Starrs,</hi> and thoſe
differing from one another in Glory; yet each hath its
<hi>Glory;</hi> and upon <hi>it,</hi> there ſhall be a <hi>defence,</hi> a coveringe, a
protection. This is the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> this hath been the <hi>Worke</hi>
of God.</p>
            <p>2. This compriſeth all them, who have <hi>lived</hi> by faith,
and abode in ſupplications in reference to Gods late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
amongſt us. Who dare deſpiſe any one of
thoſe <hi>little</hi> ones, and ſay, God hath heard <hi>me,</hi> not <hi>you,</hi>
regarded <hi>me,</hi> not <hi>you,</hi> you have no ſhare or portion in
the returns of ſupplications which we enjoy.</p>
            <p>3. This alone preſerveth the <hi>dwellers of Sion</hi> from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<hi>violence</hi> one to another; from taking the work of
<hi>Babylon</hi> out of its hands, and devouring one another.
Let any other apprehenſion what ever, of the <hi>worke</hi> of
God be embrac'd, and the firſt worke that thereby men
will be engag'd in, is the <hi>oppreſſing, perſecuting, ruining</hi> of
their bretheren, which whether it be the founding of
<hi>Sion,</hi> or no, the day of <hi>Judgement</hi> ſhall determine.</p>
            <p>4. This is that which the <hi>common enemy</hi> ſeekes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.
It is not <hi>this,</hi> or that party that he would devour;
it is not this or that perſwaſion he would caſt down; his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115351:25"/>
hatred <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, againſt the whole <hi>race</hi> and kinde; this
is that which he would accompliſh, that all the children
of God, how ever differenced among themſelves, might
be ruined deſtroyed caſt down, and rooted out for ever:
that the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might no more be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
This then is that which God, in their diſsapoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
aimes to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe the <hi>founding of Sion,</hi> doth not conſiſt in
this or that form of the <hi>civile Adminiſtration</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affaires, there being nothing <hi>promiſed,</hi> nor
<hi>deſigned</hi> concerning them, but that they be laid in
an <hi>orderly ſubſerviency,</hi> to the common intereſt of the
Saints; which let men doe what they <hi>will,</hi> yea what they
can, all Government ſhall at laſt be brought unto. And
who is there amongſt us, that in <hi>ſingleneſſe</hi> of heart dares
make ſuch an anſwer to the <hi>Meſſengers of the Nations</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting
after the peculiar worke of God amongſt us; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely,
that it conſiſts in the eſtabliſhment <hi>of this</hi> or that
form of civile Adminiſtrations, though much of the
worke of God lies therin in Relation to this Generall
end. This then is the <hi>Anſwer</hi> which I ſhall give to the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers</hi>
of the <hi>Nations,</hi> and of it there are theſe three
parts.</p>
            <p>1. God hath <hi>broken,</hi> deſtroyed, ruined them and their
contrivances, who made it their <hi>buiſneſſe</hi> to over-throw
<hi>Sion.</hi> And to roote out the <hi>generation of the righteous,</hi> not
under this, or that way or forme, whereby they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced
among themſelves, bnt as <hi>ſuch,</hi> as the Saints of
the <hi>holy</hi> one, and will continue ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>2. He hath given to them, to the <hi>poore</hi> of his people,
peace, liberty, <hi>freedome</hi> from impoſitions on their <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
with much glorious <hi>light</hi> in ſeverall degrees, in
his worſhip and ſervice.</p>
            <p>3. He hath caſt (as he hath promiſed) the <hi>power</hi> of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115351:25"/>
Nation, into a <hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to this common intereſt of
Chriſt and his people in this world, and hath made, or
will make them to underſtand, that as the <hi>peace of Sion,</hi>
lies in their peace, ſo their <hi>peace</hi> lies in the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi>
and what to ſay more to the Meſſengers of the Nation, I
know not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ.</hi> 2. If this <hi>then</hi> be the worke of God, let us <hi>repaire
to</hi> it; <hi>the poore of the people ſhall truſt therin,</hi> or joyne
themſelves thereunto. That you may doe this in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be pleaſed to take theſe <hi>directions,</hi> which with all
humility I offer to you, and I hope from the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. Ingage in no <hi>way,</hi> no Counſels, be the reaſonings
and pretences for them never ſo <hi>Specious,</hi> which have an
inconſiſtency with this <hi>common intereſt of Sion,</hi> in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
If inſtead of <hi>repairing</hi> to the worke of God, you
ſhould be found <hi>contending</hi> againſt it, and ſetting up your
own wiſdom, in the place of the wiſdom of God, it
would not be to your advantage. I know many things
will be ſuggeſted unto you. <hi>Setling of Religion,</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>a diſcipline</hi> in the Church, not to <hi>tolerate errors,</hi> and
the like: from which diſcourſes, I know what Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſome men are apt to draw, if no otherwiſe, yet
from what they have been <hi>doeing</hi> for many yeeres; doe
we then plead for <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>unſetlement?</hi> God forbid!
God hath undertaken to <hi>found</hi> and <hi>establiſh</hi> Sion, to <hi>ſetle</hi>
it, and he will doe it, and I pray God you may be <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi>
therin according to his mind. He will alſo give
his people <hi>one heart</hi> and <hi>one way,</hi> And I pray that <hi>you</hi> by
your <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>union</hi> in love, and by all other good
means may be <hi>inſtrumentall</hi> towards the accompliſhment
of that promiſe amongſt us.</p>
            <p>It is only the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of the people of
God as ſuch, that is pleaded for, &amp; he that ſhall ſet up any
thing inconſiſtent there with as ſo ſet up, will lay the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115351:26"/>
foundation of his building in the firſtborne of his <hi>peace,</hi> &amp;
ſet up the <hi>gate</hi> of it in the <hi>utmoſt</hi> &amp; laſt of his welfaire. In a
word; the people of God may poſſibly in this Nation
<hi>devoure</hi> one another, and waſh their <hi>hands</hi> in the blood
of one another, by <hi>widening</hi> the breaches that are among
them; and <hi>woe</hi> be to them that ſhall be inſtrumentall
herein: but if ever they come to a <hi>coaleſcency</hi> in love and
truth, it muſt be by their mutuall <hi>forbearance</hi> of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
untill the <hi>Spirit</hi> be powr'd down from on high, and
the fruits of peace be brought forth thereby; and herein
the Lord make <hi>you</hi> as the <hi>mountaines that bring forth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
and the <hi>litle hills</hi> that bring forth peace unto
his people.</p>
            <p>There are ſome things that I am <hi>affraid of,</hi> that ly
contrary to what I am exhorting you unto! I wiſh the
event manifeſt that I am <hi>affraid</hi> without cauſe; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
give me leave to caution you of them, Becauſe I
cannot be faithfull to my <hi>call,</hi> if I doe not.</p>
            <p>1. Take <hi>heede,</hi> leaſt that <hi>evill</hi> be ſtill abiding upon any
of our Spirits, that we ſhould be <hi>crying</hi> out and <hi>calling</hi>
for <hi>Reformation,</hi> without a due conſideration of <hi>what</hi> it
is, and how it is to be <hi>brought</hi> about. I wiſh <hi>one</hi> of many
of them, who have <hi>praied</hi> for it, and <hi>complained</hi> for want
of it, had endeavour'd to carry it <hi>on</hi> as they might;
would you have a Reformation; be you more <hi>humble,</hi>
more <hi>holy,</hi> more <hi>zealous,</hi> delight more in the <hi>wayes,
worſhip,</hi> Ordinances of God: reform your <hi>perſons</hi> in your
lives, Relations, <hi>families, pariſhes,</hi> as to Goſpell obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and you will ſee a glorious <hi>Reformation</hi> indeed:
what mean you by a Reformation, is it the <hi>hurting</hi> of
<hi>others,</hi> or doing <hi>good</hi> to our <hi>ſelves?</hi> is it a <hi>power</hi> over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens <hi>perſons,</hi> or our owne luſts? God hath now for
ſundry yeeres tryed us, whether indeed we love <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
or no; have any provoked us, or <hi>compelled</hi> us to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115351:26"/>
defile the worſhip of God, with ceremonies or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and our owne conſciences therewith all? have we
been <hi>impoſed</hi> on in the ways of God, by men <hi>ignorant</hi> of
them? hath not God ſaid to us! you that have <hi>praied</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
perſecution for <hi>Reformation,</hi> you that have <hi>fought</hi> in
the high places of the field for <hi>Reformation,</hi> you that
have covenanted and <hi>ſworne</hi> for Reformation, goe now,
<hi>reforme your ſelves;</hi> you <hi>Miniſters,</hi> preach as often as you
will, as frely as you pleaſe, no man ſhall <hi>controll</hi> you,
live as <hi>holily</hi> as you can, <hi>pray</hi> as often, faſt as often as you
will; be full of <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>good workes,</hi> giving examples
to your flock, none ſhall <hi>trouble</hi> you; be inſtant in <hi>ſeaſon,</hi>
out of ſeaſon, <hi>preach the whole counſell of God</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll;
you <hi>people</hi> be <hi>holy,</hi> ſerve God in <hi>holineſſe,</hi> keep
cloſe to his <hi>worſhip</hi> and ordinances, love <hi>them,</hi> delight
in them, bring forth ſuch <hi>fruits</hi> as men may glorify God
on your account, <hi>condemne</hi> the world, <hi>juſtifie</hi> the cauſe
of God, by a Goſpell Converſation; Take <hi>ſeaven yeares</hi>
peace and plenty, and ſee what you can doe. If after all
this, wee ſtill cry out, give us a Reformation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
not of our owne <hi>negligence,</hi> folly and hatred of
perſonall <hi>Reformation,</hi> to be the only cauſe of that want,
it is <hi>eaſie</hi> to judge what we <hi>would</hi> have, had we our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
            <p>2. Take heed leaſt <hi>any</hi> who have formerly deſired <hi>the
day of the Lord,</hi> conſidering the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holineſſe</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it will be attended, grow weary of it and its worke,
as not being able to abide it; and ſo lay aſide all
thoughts of growing up with it in the will of God: leaſt
any ſay, is this the day of the Lord, that <hi>Holineſſe, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi>
exact obedience, ſhould be prized, exalted, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
that <hi>profaneneſſe,</hi> pride, ſelfiſhneſſe, formallity
ſhould be deſpiſed, conſumed, devoured, we will have
none of this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115351:27"/>
3. Take heed, that there riſe not up a <hi>Generation</hi>
that knew not <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> that knew us not in the <hi>dayes</hi> of
our diſtreſſe, and contending with thoſe who would have
<hi>destroy'd</hi> us; who were not engaged with us, in <hi>praying,
faſting, fighting, in England, Scotland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
were unconcerned in all our <hi>affaires;</hi> who know nothing
of the <hi>cry's, teares, trembling,</hi> and feares, wherewith this
cauſe hath been <hi>mannaged;</hi> can we expect that they ſhould
be <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, or have a due ſenſe of what
they muſt be ingaged in: what know they of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
we have had with God in this buiſneſſe all along,
what <hi>Anſwers</hi> he hath given us, what Obligations he
hath put upon us thereby; the whole buiſneſſe is to <hi>them</hi>
as a ſtory only of that which is paſt, wherin they are not
<hi>concerned:</hi> There are ſuch abiding impreſſions left on
the <hi>Soules</hi> of as many as have been ingaged in the worke
of God in this <hi>Nation</hi> from the beginning to the end, as
will never be <hi>blotted</hi> out. If a Spirit not ſenſible of former
ways ſhould ariſe amongſt us, and <hi>prevaile,</hi> it would be
ſad with the intereſt of Chriſt, and his people in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
To return to my directions.</p>
            <p>2. Make this worke of God your <hi>pole-ſtar,</hi> that you
may ſteere and guide your <hi>courſe</hi> by it? in all your <hi>conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
and actions, what ever is propoſed, what ever is
to be done, let this conſideration attend it; <hi>but how will
it ſuite</hi> the deſigne of God <hi>in eſtabliſhing Sion;</hi> men
ſpeaking of a thing of manifeſt evidence, ſay that it is
written <hi>with the beames of the Sun.</hi> Give me leave to tell
you of a thing, that is written in the <hi>prayers</hi> of the Saints,
the <hi>feares</hi> of your enemies, the <hi>condition</hi> of this nation,
the councels of Princes of the, earth the Affaires of the
Nations abroad in the world, all the iſſues of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in theſe dayes, all which concurring, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
will give as <hi>good an evidence</hi> as any thing in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115351:27"/>
like kind is capable of. What is this you wil ſay? It is in
brief, Let the worke of God as ſtated, be your guide in
all your conſultations, and it will direct you to aime at
theſe two Ends.</p>
            <p>1. To preſerve <hi>Peace,</hi> to compoſe Differences, to
make up <hi>Breaches,</hi> to avoid all occaſions of diviſions at
home.</p>
            <p>2 To <hi>make up,</hi> unite, gather into one common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
the Proteſtant Nations abroad in the World,
that we may ſtand or fall tegether, and not be devoured
one after another. That theſe are the things which God
calls you to mind, and doe, if you will <hi>bear</hi> any regard to
his preſent work, is, I ſay, written with <hi>all the beams</hi> of
providence before mentioned. If the Lord ſhould ſuffer
you to be <hi>regardleſſe</hi> either to the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> know
you not that it would be bitterneſſe in the latter end.
Ask your <hi>friends</hi> what they deſire, your <hi>enemies</hi> what
they feare, the <hi>Nations</hi> abroad what they are doing:
Conſider <hi>Babylon,</hi> conſider <hi>Sion,</hi> and if one and the ſame
<hi>voyce</hi> come from them all; not to attend unto it, would
be, not to attend to the voice of God. It is indeed, an
eaſy thing for you, to gratify <hi>Sathan,</hi> ſatiate the deſires
of your <hi>enemies,</hi> lay a foundation of <hi>troubles;</hi> it is but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the <hi>clamours</hi> of men without, and the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating
of luſts, and carnall wiſdome within and the
whole work is done. But to carry on the <hi>work</hi> of God
in the particulars mentioned, this is not ſo eaſy a task:
<hi>ſelfe</hi> muſt be denied, many glorious <hi>pretences</hi> laid aſide,
contrary <hi>reaſonings</hi> anſwered, mens <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
failings borne withall, becauſe they are <hi>men;</hi> and
which is more then all, our own <hi>particular darling deſires</hi>
it may be let goe unſatisfied, though moulded into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
for many years. The truth is, the combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Antichriſtian party</hi> in the world, are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115351:28"/>
their <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> ſo notorious, their <hi>deſignes</hi> ſo fixed,
their <hi>Advantages</hi> to carry them on, ſo many; that to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
with them, who have <hi>power</hi> for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
to make it their <hi>buſineſſe</hi> to keep <hi>union</hi> amongſt
our ſelves, on all good and honeſt termes, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the <hi>union</hi> of all that call on the name of the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their Lord and ours in the world;
were to caſt a <hi>reproach</hi> upon their <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> foreſight and
zeale; ſo that it ſufficeth me to have <hi>mentioned</hi> theſe
things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Encourage all things that lye in a <hi>tendency</hi> and
<hi>ſubſerviency</hi> to the work of God, unfolded and inſiſted
on. For inſtance.</p>
            <p>1. Where ever you ſee any work of reall <hi>reformation,</hi>
tending to the <hi>advancement</hi> of the Goſpell, diſcarding
of old uſeleſſe <hi>formes,</hi> received by Tradition from our
Fathers, ſeparating the <hi>pretious</hi> from the vile, according
to the ſeverall meaſures of <hi>light,</hi> which God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wiſdome, hath graciouſly imparted; Let not <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi>
objections and hinderances lye in the way, but give
in all due encouragements, to the men of ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Perhaps the buſineſſe of carrying on Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is <hi>grievous</hi> to ſome, who in their <hi>anger</hi> and wrath,
revenge and diſappointment, may make complaints of
it to you, in private or in publique; The Lord give you
<hi>Wiſdome,</hi> that you may never weaken the <hi>hands</hi> or <hi>ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
the <hi>hearts,</hi> of men who are willing to joyne hearts
and hands with you, to ſave a <hi>poore Nation,</hi> and to keep
life in the work of God in the mid'ſt thereof.</p>
            <p>2. What you find eſtabliſhed already in this <hi>kind,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
preſerve, improve, that the work faile not.</p>
            <p>3. Find out what is <hi>wanting,</hi> and purſue it, as God
gives you advantage and opportunity.</p>
            <p>4. Where men under pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> make it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115351:28"/>
their buſineſſe to <hi>defile</hi> themſelves, or diſturbe the civile
peace, and quiet of others, let them know, that the
<hi>Sword</hi> is not borne in vaine. I can but name theſe
things.</p>
            <p>Honourable: my hearts deſire and prayer to God
for you is, that you may be the <hi>repairers of breaches,</hi> and
the reſtorers of pathes for men to walk in; that you
may be the preſervers of the <hi>good old Cauſe of England,</hi>
according to the growth it received in, and under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
providentiall diſpenſations. Many particulars ly
in my <hi>heart,</hi> to propoſe unto you, but on very many
conſiderations, I ſhall name none at preſent of them; but
cloſe all with ſome few <hi>Generall Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Secure your Spirits, that in ſincerity you ſeek the
<hi>publick good</hi> of the <hi>Nations,</hi> and the proſperity of the
good <hi>people</hi> therein, who have adhered to the good
cauſe of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and Religion; if this be in your <hi>eye,</hi> as
that which is principally intended, as you may <hi>pray in
faith,</hi> for the preſence of God with you, and have a
comfortable expectation of his <hi>protection</hi> and favour; ſo
if in the purſuit of it, through humane <hi>frailty</hi> you ſhould
<hi>erre,</hi> or miſtake in the choiſe of <hi>meanes,</hi> paths, <hi>ways</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that end, God will <hi>guide</hi> you, and lead you, and
not leave you untill he hath made <hi>ſtraite</hi> pathes for your
feet: But if at the bottome, there ly ſecret <hi>animoſities,
ſelfe-will,</hi> deſire of <hi>obtaining</hi> greatneſſe or Power, on the
one hand, or other; if every ſuch thing be not on all hands
ſubdued unto <hi>publick</hi> good, Prayers will be <hi>weakned,</hi>
carnall wiſdome increaſed, the Counſell of God reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and you will wander in all your ways without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>2. Keep alive this principle, (which whether any
will <hi>heare,</hi> or whether any will <hi>forbeare,</hi> I know not; but
this I am ſure of, in the latter end it will be found to be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115351:29"/>
true:) according as you <hi>regard,</hi> cleave to, promote, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
on the <hi>one</hi> ſide, or deſpiſe, <hi>contemne,</hi> and oppoſe on
