         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An EPISTLE to FRIENDS</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR Friends every where, who ſuffer Bonds for the Goſpel's-ſake, which is the Power of God.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>It is an Honour which the Lord doth Honour you withal, in that he account you worthy thereof; wherefore rejoyce therein, becauſe God hath Honoured you with ſo high a calling in that it hath been His good pleaſure to call you thereunto, which is for your good, yea, for your beſt good: For theſe things Dear Friends are for the Tryal of your Faith, and Patience, and that you may be purified, and made clean from all Impurity and filthineſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit, that you may be made more precious than fine Gold, which hath often paſſed through the fire, to which <hi>Sion's</hi>-Sons are comparable, and a man comes to be made more precious than the Gold of <hi>Ophire.</hi> God knoweth what is beſt for us, and therefore it will be good for us to bear with Patience what he in his Divine Wiſdom ſeeth meet to ſuffer to come upon us, for the Tryal of our Faith and Patience, that our Faith may be more precious than the Gold which periſheth.</p>
            <p>Let us be content to follow Chriſt whitherſoever it be, and think no ſufferings too much to ſuffer for his Name ſake, who ſuffered Death for us all, yea for the worſt of men, even the Rebellious and ungodly, that he might bring us unto God, in which, ſaith the Apoſtle of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>God commended his love to us, in that while we were yet Sinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> Was not this love indeed? Doth not the Rich love of God appear towards us herein? And if he honours us by calling us to ſuffer Tribulation for his Name ſake; Let us aſſure our ſelves, it is for our profit, and Advantage, and not that thereby we ſhould come to loſs, and be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore lift up your Heads, and be glad in the Lord, and ſtrong in the Power of his might, yea let the weak hands be ſtrengthened, and the feeble knees confirmed; who are of a fearfull Heart, be ſtrong, fear not; for God will cauſe theſe exerciſes to work for good to us in the End, by holding out, and continuing to the End in the Faith and Patience, by our doing as God hath, and ſhall give us to believe we ought to do with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Hereby ſhall we obtain victory over the World, and over him who Rules in the diſobedient ones, who are of this World, by him who is not of this World, &amp; hath Choſen us out of the World, and be made through the great love of God to us in him Conquerors, and more than Conquerors ſuch come thereby to be, who are Redeemed from thoſe who get the better one of another by warring and contending one with another, with their Carnall Weapons; who after they have done all that they can in that way of Warring and contending, do many of them end their days in ſorrow; but who are made Conquerors through Chriſt, who hath loved them, &amp; taſted Death for them; their end comes to be happy, the Peace and joy of God being their portion, in which they are bleſſed forever.</p>
            <p>So <hi>DEAR FRIENDS,</hi> think it not much becauſe of the fiery Tryals which you are come to be tryed withal, as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you, for theſe things are no otherwiſe than it was amongſt thoſe many Ages and Generations ſince, who were the called and Choſen of the Lord, who then rejoyced and were glad in the Lord therein, when they were perſecuted for Chriſt's ſake, yea in that God did reckon, and account them worthy thereof, and for whoſe ſake they ſuffered joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods, knowing that they had laid up for them in Heaven, a better and more Indurable Subſtance, Riches and Treaſures, which far exceeded thoſe Earthly Treaſures they ſuffered the ſpoyling of, which no Robbers nor ſpoilers could Rob nor ſpoil them of, wherefore <hi>rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> and again I ſay Rejoyce, becauſe with them by your being Faithful unto the Lord God your maker unto the death, you ſhall be ſharers and partakers of theſe Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which will never decay, and ſo come to receive a Crown of life which fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>It was by ſufferings Chriſt Jeſus the Captain of our Salvation was made perfect, wherefore being called of the Lord thereunto, as was the Apoſtle of Chriſt Jeſus, Let us therein rejoyce even as he did, when he ſuffered for his Lord and Maſter's ſake Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaid to the Saints at <hi>Coloſs; For whom, for Chriſt's ſake he ſuffered, who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chriſt in my Fleſh for his Bodie's-ſake which is the Church; with whom if we ſuffer with him by continuing Faithfull unto the end, we ſhall come to reign for ever, who is ſit down at the right Hand of Power; wherefore who have ſet your Hands to the plow look not back you that have made a good beginning, continue, and hold on therein, preſſing forward to the ſaving of your Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you who are at Liberty, <hi>viz.</hi> who are not Thrown into Priſons and Holes for the Teſtimony of your pure Conſciences towards God, what ever you may ſuffer, be Faithfull in your Teſtimony for him in your Meeting together to wait upon him; and in making mention of his Name in Righteouſneſs, and in every good word and work; be ye firm, and ſtedfaſt in your Teſtimony for the Lord, that as thereby you have know the Lord preſent with you in the midſt of you, to your Soules great Comfort, refreſhment, and Satisfaction, you may know him ſo unto you even to the end, and ſo be your God forever.</p>
            <p>And you <hi>My Dear Friends,</hi> who are in Bonds for the Goſpel ſake, be patient in your Sufferings, according to his Holy and Heavenly Will, not otherwiſe deſiring your Liberty nor Enlargement therefrom, but pray and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be according thereunto; that ſo in the appointed time of the Father, you may be ſaved, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, out of the Hands of all that hate you; and out of the Hands of all his, and all your Enemys; by that Horn of Salvation, which he hath raiſed up, and ordained, and appointed in order thereunto; that we might ſerve him without fear, in Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life, dwelling in the Love and Goodwill of the Almighty towards all people, not deſiring the Ruin or Deſtruction of any of them, that you may be like unto your Heavenly Father, who is Good and Kind unto all, even unto the unholy and unthankfull, even unto the worſt of men, in ſending his Rain upon them, and in cauſing his Sun to Shine upon them; Oh! Let your Light ſo Shine forth, that by their beholding the ſame, they by your good works which they ſhall behold, may Glorify God on your behalf; So will the Eyes of the Righteous Lord, who Loveth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Truth in the Inward parts, be over you for good, whoſe Eyes run to and fro, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong, for them who believe and truſt in him; according to whoſe holy and heavenly mind and will herein and in all things, my prayers are for you, that you may be found to do, that he may delight in you forever.</p>
            <p>To whom I do commit you, with my ſelf, to be preſerved and kept, as to a Faithful Creator: Hoping, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Deſiring, that we may ſo paſs the time of our ſojourning here, that when Time ſhall come to an end with us, Reſt and Peace in Eternity with him may be the Portion of our Souls forever.</p>
            <p>So deſiring that the Bleſſing of the Moſt High God, Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, may reſt upon you, I ceaſe at preſent from writing unto you, but not from Love, in that which is Pure and Everlaſting; In which I remain</p>
