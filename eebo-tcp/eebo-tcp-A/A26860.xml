            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough the difference between Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> (and Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and such others), and those condemned by them, be very great, I would not have it seem greater than it is. The sum of it is as followeth:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> thinketh that there is no true Ministry, Church-Sacraments, nor Covenant-right to pardon and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but where there is a Ministry delivering the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who were ordained by Bishops (in his sense of Bishops), who had their Ordination from other Bishops, and they from others, by an uninterrupted chain of succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
            <p>We know, that by this Doctrine he condemneth, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churcheth, not only the Reformed Churches, the Greeks and other Easterns, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no certainty of the very being of any one Church on earth.</p>
            <p>And we maintain, that the sacred Scripture is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Law of Christ, in which he hath described and instituted the office and work of the sacred Ministry, and appointed the way of their continuance in the world, by necessary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Election, Consent, and ordinarily regular Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That as Presbyters now lay on hands with the Bishop, so <hi>senior</hi> Pastors are the Ordainers, as the Colledg of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians license Physicians, and the Convocation of Doctors make Doctors (and man generateth man). But to avoid contention and division, the Churches have used to make one of these Presbyters or Pastors a President, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Ruler in each Colledg and Church, and given him a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb facs="tcp:48440:3"/>
voice in Ordinations; against which we strive not, but maintain, <hi>1.</hi> That his consent is not so necessary, as that no one can be a true Presbyter that hath it not. As the Clergy at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s days long governed when they had no Bishop; so if the Bishop be dead, or refuse to ordain, or would ordain none but Here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icks, or uncapable men, or would ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize and impose men not consented to, the Ordination is valid that is made without him. And <hi>2.</hi> That the true chief Pastor of every particular formed Church, is a true Bishop, though Diocesans should deny it. <hi>3.</hi> And that even Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it self is necessary but for <hi>Order where it may be had,</hi> and not to the <hi>Being of the Ministry where it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had on lawful terms,</hi> no more than Coronation to the King, or publick solemnization to Marriage. <hi>4.</hi> And we are assured, that if Regular Ordination were interrupted by death, heresie, refusal, neglect, <hi>e. g.</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Constantinople, Jerusalem,</hi> &amp;c. Christs Charter, or Scripture-Law would presently restore it to persons duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, chosen and ordained by the fittest there that can be had. <hi>5.</hi> If this were not so (as multitudes of schismatical and unlawful Popes Ordinations at <hi>Rome</hi> would be invalid, <hi>e. g. John 13.</hi> and <hi>21.</hi> and <hi>23.</hi> and <hi>Eugenius 4</hi>th deposed as a Heretick by a General Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) so every usurping Bishop that pretendeth falsly, that he was himself lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, would nullifie Churches, Ministry and Sacraments of all ordained by him. And many have falsly pretended to Orders. <hi>6.</hi> And that if men must refuse the Government and Sacraments of all Bishops and Presbyters that do not prove to them a Regular Ordination uninterrupted for <hi>1600.</hi> years, all the Ministry on earth may be refused: and none for so doing should be called Schismaticks. I never yet heard or saw a Bishop prove such a succession, nor ever knew one that would take his Oath on it, that he was a true Bishop on such terms.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:48440:3"/>
               <hi>II.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> thinks that the Presbyters, yea and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, were not given by God. Pag. <hi>60.</hi> saith he, <hi>But where do they find, that God ever gave Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons?</hi> Where note, that it is of the <hi>Office</hi> in <hi>specie</hi> that we speake.</p>
            <p>But we think that God hath made or instituted the Office and its work. And if he did not, <hi>1.</hi> Who did? If men, was it Clerg-ymen or Lay-men? If Lay-men, was it Christians or Infidels? And by what Authority? Do the children beget the fathers, and yet may not Presbyters propagate their <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi> If Clergy-men, who were they? If not Apostles, or Prophets, or Evangelists, they were none. If these, then it seems the Apostles did it not as Bishops; for it is the making of the <hi>first Bishops</hi> that we question. And what the Apostles did (not as Bishops, but) as commissioned Apostles, Christ did by his Spirit. And they that will do the like, must have the like Office, Authority and Spirit. If God gave not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, because the Apostles made them, then God gave us not the Scripture, because the Apostles and Evangelists wrote it.</p>
            <p>And is not this the same or worse Doctrine than that which the <hi>Italian</hi> Iesuits would have had pass at <hi>Trent,</hi> against Gods making Bishops or their Office?</p>
            <p>And if God gave not Bishops or Presbyters, they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, reject no gift or institution of God.</p>
            <p>And if men made them, how come they to be <hi>essential</hi> to the Church? Did not Christ and his Spirit in the Apostles, institute so much as the Church-essentials?</p>
            <p>And if men made Bishops and Presbyters <hi>in specie,</hi> may not man unmake them?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> maintaineth, that the power of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters is to be measured by the intention of the Ordainers who give it them, and not by any Scripture-institution, charter or description.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48440:4"/>We maintain the contrary, that God having instituted and described the Office of Bishops, Pastors, Presbyters, Gods Law in Scripture is the Rule by which the office-power, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>work</hi> in the essentials, must be known. Otherwise, <hi>1.</hi> It would be supposed, that God made not the office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or Presbyters; which is false.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> That Ordainers may make new Churches, Bishops or Presbyters <hi>in specie;</hi> yea, as many <hi>species</hi> of them as they shall intend.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That they may abrogate or change the ancient <hi>species.</hi> They may make one office only for preaching, another only for praying, another only for Baptism, another only for the Lords Supper, and others for new work of their own. The Papists themselves abhor this Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Then no man can know the measure of his Authority, not knowing the intentions of the Ordainers. Perhaps three or ten ordainihg Bishops may have three or ten several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Then the Bishop may put down Gods Worship or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by limiting the Priests power.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> It's contrary to all Ministerial Investitures. The Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Minister is not the <hi>Owner</hi> or the <hi>Donor,</hi> but delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth possession of what the <hi>Owner</hi> and <hi>Donor</hi> contracted for, or gave. If the Archbishop, Crowning the King, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his Prerogative, it's a Nullity, because he is not the Giver of it; nor is his intention, but the Kingdoms constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the measure of it. If the Priest would make the man whom he marrieth to a woman, no governour of her, it's a Nullity: for it is not his intent that makes the power.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> If this were otherwise, I call and call again (but in vain) to Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and all his party, to tell me, how the Bishops and Priests of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8</hi>th, and <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6</hi>th, and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> came to have power to put down the Mass, to set up the
<pb facs="tcp:48440:4"/>
Liturgie, to take down Images, and to reform as they did, when it was certainly contrary to the intention of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers?</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8.</hi> And setting this point together with the other, (that Ordination of <hi>Presbyters</hi> is null) I ask them, (and ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but all in vain;) <hi>1.</hi> Do not Bishops generate their <hi>Species,</hi> and make Bishops their equals? <hi>2.</hi> Who then can give his Office to the Archhishop, if he have no Superior in <hi>England,</hi> unless his Inferiors give it, or you fly to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Iurisdiction? <hi>3.</hi> Whose Intention is it that giveth power to the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he be greatest? Or to the <hi>General Council,</hi> if it be greatest? If there be none above them, either God or Inferiours give them their power? <hi>4.</hi> And what if these Inferiours that make <hi>Popes, Primates,</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> by Intention would take down half their power? Is it then done? What self-contradiction and confusion would some men rather run into, than grant <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>Christ?</hi> that is, the only Vniversal Head and Legislator to the <hi>Church</hi> on Earth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> Accordingly Mr. <hi>D.</hi> holdeth, that there is a supreme Authority in man over the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> from whose intention and sense it is not lawful for us to appeal so much as to the Sacred Scripture, no nor to the Day of Iudgment, for any practice different from them. See his <hi>Reply, p. 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we hold that no unjust Appeal should suspend the authorised Acts of a Governour, this Doctrine seems to me to be worse than Antichristian, and to put down God.</p>
            <p>If God indeed be the Vniversal Soveraign Lawgiver, and the final Iudge; if God be God, and man be man and not above him, to say that we must not obey him before man, and disobey man that commands what he forbids, or that we must not appeal from mans subordinate Law to his supreme Law, nor from mans judgment to his final judgment; and to say, (as
<pb facs="tcp:48440:5"/>
he and <hi>Thorndike</hi> do) that to do so, and practise accordingly, is inconsistent with all Government, are things that I had hoped my ears or eyes should never have seen or heard deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by a sober Christian. Papists most commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly abhor it, save some few Flatterers of the Pope. If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his be so, a man must not only worship Images, swear to the Pope, and do all that Councils command; but also curse <hi>Christ</hi> if the <hi>Turkish</hi> Rulers bid him, blaspheme God if Heathen Rulers bid him, and condemn all the Martyrs as Rebels that did subvert all Government, by practising contrary to it and appealing to God. And then man must be every where of the Rulers Religion, and do whatever wickedness he commandeth, <hi>Dan. 1.</hi> and <hi>3.6.</hi> and the Church for three hundred years and more tell us of other kind of Examples.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> holdeth this <hi>Absolute Destructive Power</hi> to be essentially necessary to the Vnity of the Catholick <hi>Church:</hi> which is the sum of <hi>Thorndike</hi>'s Book.</p>
            <p>I would not go further from them or the <hi>French,</hi> in the point of Vnity, than I needs must. I shall therefore tell you what is our judgment of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> We grant them, that <hi>Christ's Church</hi> on earth is one, and its Vnity is part of its very essence (as the Vnity of the parts of a House, Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> We hold that this essential Vnity consisteth in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Christians with <hi>Christ,</hi> the only unifying Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Head; and that the Vnity described <hi>Ephes. 4.4, 5, 6.</hi> sufficeth to it, viz. <hi>One Body</hi> (of Christ) <hi>one Spirit, one Hope</hi> (of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory) one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father,</hi> &amp;c. And that all this is prescribed in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and every true <hi>Christian</hi> hath all this.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> That all must endeavour to keep this Vnity in the bond of peace, and to be in every lesser matter of one mind, as far as they can: And the Pastors of the <hi>Churches</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:48440:5"/>
beautifie and strengthen the <hi>Church,</hi> by as much concord as they can well obtain.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> But that perfect concord being the fruit of personal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, will never be had on earth: And the differences of the infirm that cannot be cured, must be tolerated in tender Brotherly Love. And to persecute or destroy <hi>Christians,</hi> who unite in <hi>Christ</hi> and the Essentials of <hi>Christianity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not of one size of knowledg, and differ in lesser things, is the work of Satan the Enemy of Love, and the great Destroyer.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> We believe that Synods or Councils are so far good and useful, as they are needful to the foresaid strength and concord of the <hi>Churches:</hi> But that they are for <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and not for direct <hi>Regiment,</hi> as Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Councils are not for Government of the several Bishops by the Majority, but for Consultation and Concord:</hi> And they that cannot in all things consent to them in Accidentals, or lesser matters, are not therefore cut off from <hi>Christ's</hi> Vniversal <hi>Church</hi>: But it is a fault peevishly and causelesly to dissent and be singular, a breach of <hi>Christ's</hi> general Law, of doing our work as much as we can in Love and Concord.</p>
            <p>Plainly, <hi>Reader,</hi> do you know the difference between the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Assembly at <hi>Nimmegen, Ratisbone,</hi> or <hi>Frankford?</hi> The said Senate is <hi>una persona Politica,</hi> though <hi>plures naturales,</hi> and hath the Supreme Government by Vote in Legislation and Iudgment; and it is Rebellion there to disown their Power, and a Crime not to obey it.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Nimmegen, Ratisbone,</hi> &amp;c. many Princes or their Agents meet for Peace and Christian Concord. It is a sin for any of them to be causelesly against any Vote that is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to those ends. But no one of them, nor the major Vote, is
<pb facs="tcp:48440:6"/>
Governour of the rest; nor is any one to be dispossest of his Dominion, that seeth reason to dissent.</p>
            <p>This is plain truth; Though Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> find fault with the Learned and Iudicious Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> for asserting it in his Treatise against the <hi>Papacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it being not Regiment but Concord that is the end of Synods (as over Bishops) there is no more use than possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of an Vniversal Council, or one Vniversal Colledge; But the necessity and aptitude of Councils for strengthning concord, must measure their extent.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>D's</hi> opinion is of the degree of corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which he would have used to his ends, I know not: Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> is against Death and Banishment. For my part, the two greatest things that have alienated me from <hi>Popery</hi> are; <hi>1.</hi> That it cherisheth Ignorance, and I am sure that is the soil of all wickedness; <hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> are Light; and <hi>Satan</hi> is the <hi>Prince of Darkness. 2.</hi> That it liveth like the Leech on blood, hating and destroying the most holy persons who differ from them: To these my Soul is unreconcilable. I hate cruelty to <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> much more to godly faithful persons, that do hurt to none.</p>
            <p>And I think I have convinced Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> himself that I am not inclined for the avoiding of <hi>Popery,</hi> to run into any contrary Extreme; nor to imitate them tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I again and again profess, That if the <hi>Papists,</hi> or such as I now deal with, would but prove, that God ever made or allowed such a <hi>Church</hi> as they plead for in the world, that is an
<pb facs="tcp:48440:6"/>

            <p>These things I have taken the boldness to ask some of the greatest, that on the fore mentioned terms appropriate the name of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to their <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> and I could get no answer from them, viz. <hi>Whether they took the Councils of</hi> Constance <hi>and</hi> Basil <hi>for Papists? And whether they now take the Bishops and Church of</hi> France <hi>for Papists?</hi> And whether they took <hi>Gerson, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus, Cassander, Erasmus,</hi> for Papists, or not?</p>

Let them be <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> I contend not for names. But I wonder not at these Church-men, if they unchurch the <hi>French Protestants,</hi> and condemn their Ministry and Sacraments as none; How else could their Persecution be justified?</p>
            <p>And, O that they would tell us, what <hi>Churches</hi> they be that they live in communion with? Whether the <hi>French, Spanish, Italian, Greeks, Nestorians, Jacobites, Copties,

            <p>O that we could long more for God's righteous final Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (to which we appeal, though Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> be against it) and for the world of <hi>perfect Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Union!</hi>

                     <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Am now in the Country, and as yet in so unsetled a condition, as obliges me to be a Stranger to new Works. However, by the short view I have when I come into Shops, I find you put me off for a Reply to Mr. <hi>Clarksons</hi> little Pamphlet concerning Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Jurisdiction: I have got it and perused it, and the design of my writing at present is, to acquaint you with the reason why I think my self unconcerned in it, if that be all I must expect from you in Answer to my yet unanswered Letters. You must excuse me, if I cannot think that Book an Answer, which as it was written before them by your own confession, so neither doth it foresee the accounts given in those Letters, nor provide against them: Whether it do so, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the account intended, why I cannot think my self concerned in this new Pamphlet of Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi>'s, be pleased to understand, that the excellent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being engaged against you on the same Argument of my Letters, was pleased to put himself to the trouble of perusing my Papers, as they came from the Press, purposely that he might avoid repeating what had been said by me. This being so, you may easily understand how far I am concerned in what is said to him, when it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wholly distinct from mine. Not that I should have been unwilling to serve that great Person, but that I know he is in much better hands already. Mr. <hi>Clarkson</hi> in this Pamphlet, as he has only mentioned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> name, so he hath confined himself to his Arguments, and hath taken notice of nothing in my Letters not considered by the Doctor. If he will be pleased to engage further, I confess I like his temper better than any I have seen of your late Brethren, except Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> Such an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary I should desire, as would confine himself to the Cause, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out digressing to personal Slanders. There is one mistake in him,
<pb facs="tcp:48440:10"/>
which you may be pleased to acquaint him with, and that is his translating <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> thousands more than once, and sometimes where his Argument is grounded on it, that it may appear to be his mistake rather than the Printers. The mistake is small and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the main Cause, but withal is very evident. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his candour in acknowledging it, so I shall see what candour I may expect from him in the main Cause, if he think fit to engage with me in it.</p>
                  <p>As to your Answers to my Objections against your Ministry in our Oral Debates, had they been unproved Assertions, I should then have thought them sufficiently answered with Denials. But you know the Assertions are proved in the body of my Book; and till I see my Principles unravelled, and Answers more distinctly applied to the junctures, where the proof may seem to fail, I am not likely to see any reason to change my minde. Till you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt this, I am content the Reader judg, whether what you have done, or shall hereafter do in the like way, deserve the name of a Confutation. If I must never expect any further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from you for the Slanders you have raised against me, all the return I intend, is my hearty Prayer to God, to qualifie you for your forgiveness, not only of that sin, but of the many others of your late writings, by your re-union to the Church from which you are fallen, on which account alone I have proved that you can expect forgiveness. I am obliged not only on my own account, but to the Publick, to which you have shewn your self an Enemy on this occasion, to reflect on you; but I desire to leave no monuments against you to Posterity. God may yet have mercy on you, and let you see the mischief you are doing, before it be too late. That he will do so, is the most unfeigned request of him, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding your many and great provocations, will still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to approve himself</p>

                  <p>I Received not yours of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 19, 1681. till <hi>Octob.</hi> 21. through the miscarriage of one that should have delivered it. What you have to say to Mr. <hi>Clarkson,</hi> write to himself and not to me: As to your call for more Answer to your Books, you shall have more. I had wrote one long ago, and cast it by: Men are weary of our Controversies, and had rather all of us gave over. But if I should shew the errour and impertinency of every such word in your great Book, it might be a years work; when I look not to live so long; and it might make so great a Volume in Folio, that few I think would buy or read! And what great good will it do the world, to tell them how grossly you abuse the Chuch, and how confidently and voluminously you err?</p>
                  <p>As to your charge of <hi>Slandering you, and wronging the Church, and being unqualified for forgiveness,</hi> I have the same Accusations from Quakers, Anabaptists, Antinomians and Papists, almost in the same words: Within these two hours an ancient Doctor sent me as hard words [<hi>As being a self condemned person, to be forsaken, as opposing the Commands of God, and the Faith of Iesus,</hi>] for not yielding to his [<hi>asserting of the Seventh-day-Sabbath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Lords-days observation.</hi>] I have these thirty six years lived under such Accusations: It is no new thing for Seducers to use affrighting words instead of proof, and to say, [<hi>Except ye be circumcised and keep the Law of Moses, you cannot be saved.</hi> It's the cry of most Sects, [<hi>You cannot be saved but in our way</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Sir, No man living hath more cause to be loath to err, and to be willing to know the Truth. I am as sure, as I can be, if I know any thing of my own minde, that I am not only willing to know the Truth, but to know it at a far dearer rate than it was ever like to cost me in this world. I am sure that I have not been slothful in seeking it: I am sure that I would joyfully recant any Errour that you or any man can convince me of, with hearty thanks for so great a benefit. I have considered your Books; you are confident of my erring and wronging the Church; and I am as confident of yours: that you are a Misleader of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary size, that would set up <hi>an Vniversal humane Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which Protestants have taken for Popery and Treason against Christ; and who falsly unchurch the Reformed Churches, and deny them all Covenant-right to Salvation, while you tol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the Question, Whether you are a Papist, what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lieth on me to decide it? Why should you expect that I should say you are none?

And that this Power is so absolute, that there is no Appeal from it to Scripture, or Gods Judgment. 3. And that this Power doth make universal Laws for all the Church by General Councils. 4. And that the Pope hath the Primacy or Presidentship in those Councils ordinarily. 5. And that he is the <hi>Principium Vnitatis.</hi> 6. And that it belongs to the President antecedently to call Councils, and to him alone; so that they are but unlawful Routs, or rebellious, if they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble without his Call.</p>
                     <p>And that they are Schismaticks, who
<pb facs="tcp:48440:11"/>
dissent and disobey this Supremacy. 8. And that the Reformed Churches, for want of your Episcopal Ordination uninterrupted from the Apostles times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are no true Churches, have no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, or Sacraments, or Covenant-right to Salvation; but by pretending them, do sin against the Holy Ghost. 9 But that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by vertue of an uninterrupted Episcopal Succession, is a true Church, hath a true Ministry, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Covenant right to Salvation. 10. And that the <hi>French</hi>-Church (which we call Papists) are safer than the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants there. 11. And imply, that the said <hi>French</hi> Clergy, and the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> were no Papists. 12. And that the said Protestants being Schismaticks, and sinning against the Holy Ghost, the Magistrates that will not be Contemners of Religion, are bound to punish them.</p>

                  <p>(As if in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> your bellows were needful to blow the fire.) These things asserted among you by Bishop <hi>Bramhall, Heylin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and you and such others, the Protestants have been hitherto used to call <hi>Popery:</hi> But I will not dispute with you a mere question of the fitness of the name.

                  <p>But it's a useful way, to set such an one as you to do mens busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to boast, as Dr <hi>Sherlocke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> do, of your performance, and yet to disown you when their cause requireth it.

<pb facs="tcp:48440:12"/>
I might silently have let you take your course.

                  <p>Sir, when sin groweth crying and common, I am one that dare not <hi>preach impenitency</hi> by hiding it, and saying, it is a <hi>doubtful</hi> or a <hi>little thing,</hi> though I expect that guilt should be impatient, and some Doctors should go on to say behind my back, that less than this is unchristian and intemperate passion or abuse.</p>
                  <p>Methinks you who judg millions of true believers, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God and holiness, to damnation; and by Printing this, go about to have all men think them such, and consequently to love them no better than the damnable should be loved, should never be so partially tender, as not to endure to be but told what you say and do.</p>
                  <p>And will you be angry with sober Christians for startling at such a Doctrine, that <hi>All our other qualifications,</hi> though we <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and love God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>will not save us, unless we have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament from a Minister ordained by a Bishop of your described</hi> spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>and he from such another,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the beginning?</hi> Can Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian ears relish the description of such a <hi>Hell</hi> as containeth the <hi>believing Christian lovers of God and Holiness,</hi> who <hi>call'd upon his name, and sought first his Kingdom and Righteousness, and forsook all for Christ,</hi> but were damned for want of an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Diocesan Ordination of the Priest that gave them the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and all his predecessors? Sure Christians hitherto han't believed that Diocesans Sacraments will make a Heaven of wicked ungodly men, nor the want of them make a Hell of Saints.</p>
                  <p>And will you be angry with me, for not believing that God is such a one, as will for ever hate and damn in Hell the souls that <hi>loved</hi> him above all? Will he take that love from them when they die? Or do they continue in Hell to love him, while he hateth and tormenteth them? Were not that to call him worse than the Devil, whom they do not love? You only tell us, that
<pb facs="tcp:48440:13"/>
they <hi>cannot be saved</hi> for want of your <hi>species</hi> of Sacramenters. But if you meant not by this their <hi>Damnation,</hi> but a <hi>Purgatory</hi> or <hi>Annihilation,</hi> it's meet you should deal plainly, and tell us what it is.</p>
                  <p>They are Articles of our Faith and Religion, <hi>That whoever believeth</hi> (sincerely) <hi>in Christ, shall not perish, but have everlasting life:</hi> And that <hi>there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> And <hi>that eye hath not seen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>

And if the fore-mentioned moderating Doctors, go on to publish me to be a man of <hi>unpeaceable provoking language,</hi> for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that such <hi>doctrines and practices are great sins,</hi> they will seem to me, to take the preaching of Repentance for reviling, and that he is the sinner that tells men of sin; and that the Laity are far hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier men, who may be called to Repentance for their vices, than the Clergy, or Church-corrupters, who are heinously wronged if their sins be named, and they be but intreated to consider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; yea, if we but tell the reason, why we dare not do as they, in a time when we have cause to study such Texts as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4.

            <head>CHAP. I. Of Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi>'s displeasure against me, as if I accused him to be a Papist; and accused unjustly the Councils of Bishops.</head>
            <p n="1">§. 1. WHEN Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> in a tedious Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, did null the Reformed Churches, their Ministry, Sacraments, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-title to salvation, meerly for want of uninterrupted succession down from the Apostles, of Ordination, by such as he appropriateth the name of Bishops to, I aggravated his fault, as being one that <hi>professeth himself a Protestant.</hi> He took this to be an accusation of Popery: I Published, to satisfie him, that I meant no such thing; but <hi>de nomine</hi> will call him what he calls himself, and <hi>de re</hi> will be no judg of any thing but his books and words, to which I leave the Reader to know him: This satisfieth him not, but he continueth so much concerned, that I doubt he will make men think there is some tender place that is so impatient of a mis-supposed touch. I have nothing to do with him, or his Religion, as his, further than he assaulteth us by his Writings: And he is the Accuser, and the Accusation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48440:14"/>
is of no less moment than aforesaid, and sinning against the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and of Schism, and subverting all Government, if we do but practice differently from the Prelates will, and alledg Scripture and Gods Authority for it, and appeal to Christ. I am but on the Defence against all this.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. I profess it is not meer education, prejudices, custom, or worldly interest which keep me from Popery, or his way of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience to Prelates. I have studied what may be said for it as well as against it; and I never met but with Two Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which seemed to me worthy of much further search: One was, that seeing <hi>de facto Popery</hi> and high Prelacy have so far and long ruled in the Church, whether it be credible that Christ would so permit it, if he hated it, and give his Church, <hi>de facto,</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter government? 2. Whether mens great proneness to discord, make not Popery <hi>(Italian,</hi> or <hi>French)</hi> a prudent course.</p>
            <p>And to these, 1. I am sure that Christ came to destroy the works of the Devil, and save his people from their sins, and make them holy, <hi>a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> and gather a Church of such out of the world, and rule them in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, till he bring them to perfection. Therefore I have great reason to suspect those men, and that order and course of government, which cherisheth ignorance and sin in Ministers and People, and hunteth, and silenceth faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and suppresseth, persecuteth, tormenteth, burneth the most conscionable Christians, that for fear of offending God, disobey them, that turn serious Religion and spiriritual Worship of God, into bodily exercises, and meer Conformity to their wills, and outward taking Sacraments, and using commanded Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and words; under the shadow whereof, for 1000. years, piety hath withered, and impiety prospered.</p>
            <p>Christ promised to be with his servants to the end of the world, <hi>Mat</hi> 28.30. And I cannot but think that he is most with those that are most acquainted with his Gospel, and most love him and obey him, and are most holy and heavenly, and walk not after the flesh, but the spirit, rather than with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, fleshly, worldly malignant Persecutors, that set them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst serious godliness and godly men.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48440:14"/>§. 3. And I take not any notices of the time present from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but certain experience; nor of the Ages past, from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or suspected, but of the eldest times from all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Church-history, and of the last 1000, or 1200<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years, as to the worst part of their actions, from their own greatest friends and flatterers, such as <hi>Baronius, Binnius, Platina, Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. And the matter of fact, I confess, hath had much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on my judgment: Had the Popes, and Lording sort of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesans been promoters of love and holiness in the Church, and not the woful scandal of it, and the enemies of good men, and serious piety, I should have been stronglier tempted to own their form of government to be of God; though I am assured that Nature maketh <hi>one man,</hi> or <hi>one Council</hi> uncapable of proper government over all the earth; I should never have opposed that which doth good. But <hi>destruction, silencing, persecuting, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rebellions, worldliness, ignorance, malignity,</hi> and <hi>cherishing sin,</hi> and <hi>suppressing piety,</hi> and the very <hi>word of God,</hi> I am sure are all the work of the Devil, what name or titles soever are pretended for them.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. And the fact being to me past dispute, I quietly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the dreadful providence of God that permitteth it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Church on Earth is no better than the Angels; of Heaven were; and if so many of the Angels kept not their first estate, but fell by <hi>Pride,</hi> what wonder if many Bishops do so?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> both fell from Innocency, and that so soon, it is not incredible that the Serpent should beguile some Bishops to depart from the simplicity that is in Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if the first born man, <hi>Cain,</hi> murdered his righteous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by malignant envy for his true Religion, it's no wonder if some Clergy-men are such.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if the whole world so soon was drowned in wickedness, that only <hi>Noah</hi> and his house were meet to be saved from the flood, what wonder if the Church had too great a deluge of iniquity?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48440:15"/>5. And to be short, if <hi>Noah</hi> himself fall after such deliverance, and a <hi>Cham</hi> be cursed that had been saved, and their posterity proved so bad, that all the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> &amp;c. must be destroyed; if <hi>Sodom</hi>'s flames too, better warned <hi>Lot,</hi> or his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if <hi>Abraham</hi> have an <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> an <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> envious Sons, and two Murderers, and two Adulterers; If <hi>Israel</hi> sin, and die in the Wilderness; if <hi>Aaron</hi> after that he had seen, make them an Idol; if <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> die, as they did; if <hi>Eli</hi>'s and <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Sons proved all so bad; and in the days of the Judges there were so many revolts and ruins; if the first King, <hi>Saul,</hi> so soon revolted; if <hi>David</hi> so fell, and <hi>Absolom</hi> so sinned, and <hi>Solomon</hi> himself: If Ten Tribes so quickly broke off from <hi>David</hi>'s house, and left him but Two; if those Two proved as bad as the Prophets tell us, and went into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: And if the Nation rebelled against Christ, and be cursed and scattered over the Earth, what wonder if the Pope and proudest Prelate did corrupt the Church of God? If Christs chosen Twelve had a <hi>Iudas</hi> among them; if the rest strove who should be greatest; if <hi>Peter</hi> denied him, and they all forsook him and fled; if Heresies swarmed in the Apostles days, and <hi>Iewish</hi> Teachers would have subjected the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law; if all forsook <hi>Paul</hi> in his Tryal, and many accused him before, and such as <hi>Diotrephes</hi> cast out the Brethren, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted maliciously against <hi>Iohn</hi>; if Christ tell us of a little flock, and not many Noble and great are called; if it be as hard for the Rich to be saved as Christ saith; if for Three hundred years the Church was a persecuted people; and if the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and Bishops themselves, for many hundred years after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused one another in Councils, and accused such Councils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of Heresies, and other crimes, as much as is yet visible they did, why should I be scandalized at the <hi>badness</hi> of Bishops and Councils, and the woful corruptions of the Church?</p>
            <p>Especially considering, 1. That it was chiefly but the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud domineering sort that thus miscarried, as the very Angels did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God kept up still a great number of humble and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishops and Presbyters, that joined not in usurpations and pride with the rest.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And that God blest their labours to the saving of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of souls, and propagating true serious Religion to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48440:15"/>
this day. Yea, some of the great Patriarchs themselves have been holy humble men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And when God preserved, by an humble Ministry, so many Christians, as the <hi>Albigenses, Waldenses,</hi> and many among the Papists themselves, from the liking and guilt of the <hi>Roman</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And when God hath raised so learned, humble, and holy a Ministry to reform the Churches, and blest their labours in <hi>Europe,</hi> and specially in <hi>England,</hi> as he hath done; even those that Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> degradeth; yea, many pious Diocesans here and elsewhere, who yet cannot prove their title by his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded way of successive Canonical Ordinations; nor durst have sworn that they had such a call.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. I am sure that the work of Christ is the restoring of Gods Image, <hi>holy life,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>love</hi>; and that the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these, by hiding the Scriptures, unintelligible worships, Imagery, dead hypocrisie, silencing, and persecuting, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gods servants, making dividing engines to tear, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to batter the peace of the Church, and this by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ungodly, worldly Ministry, seeking not the things of God, but of men; all this is the Devils work; and to do the Devils work against Christ, is not a sign of Christs servants; he bids us judg of our selves and others by the fruits; His servants we are whom we obey: If a <hi>Peter</hi> once give Christ such world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleshly counsel, he shall hear worse than I said of Church-Tyrants, <hi>get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men, Mat.</hi> 16.22 hating the good, silencing thousands of faithful Ministers, excommunicating, and sinning against God, in obedience to Prelates, and for using the needful means of their own salvation, and serving God but as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did; this is the Devils work, if he have any in the world. And Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> must trust more to swords than words to keep it up; for there is a spirit in true Christians that will never suffer them to believe that it is pleasing to God, what name soever is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. I will reverence the <hi>Iews</hi> visible Church, to whom were committed the Oracles of God, but will not say, that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48440:16"/>
sinned not in persecuting Christ and his Apostles; nor say, that they are not now under their own curse, and cut off from the Church, who once cast out Christians from their Synagogues. I will give due honour to Primogeniture, and yet not equal <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, Ismael</hi> and <hi>Isaac, Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. but expect, that as he that was born after the flesh did persecute him that was born after the spirit; even so it will be now: And the world was the world still, when it was taken into the Church. The Heathen <hi>Romans</hi> were less Persecutors than the <hi>Iews,</hi> and so are the <hi>Turks</hi> than the <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. I shall, in due place, take notice of Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s confining the Essence of the Ministry to <hi>transacting between God and man, in covenanting, requiring essentially no more skill than any man is capable of, who is but capable of understanding the common deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the world,</hi> p. 73, 74.

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p>Here is Episcopal Communion talkt of, without telling what is the Episcopacy, or what the Communion which he means, and how both are known. Confusion 1. There are usurping Bishops not truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or chosen. 2. There are Heretical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. 3. There may be divers Bishops in one City or County; which of these mean you? 4. He may be one fit for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not for me, nor am I to take him for my Pastor. As the <hi>Greek</hi> Bishop in <hi>London,</hi> and many <hi>Latine</hi> Bishops, that spake not <hi>English</hi> heretofore; or his faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness may make it my duty to chuse a better. 5. What if the King and Law command the contrary? 6. All this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for submitting to sinful conditions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As it is a duty to refuse sinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, so of many particular Churches to chuse the fittest for our communion. The <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> are not Schismaticks for not being subject to this Bishop, or locally communicating with him. 2. You tell us not how a man shall know he is of the Bishops communion among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Parish-Churches that differ in many things, and own the Bishop in some things, and not in others. 3. Few of the Diocess ever locally communicate with our Bishops; and mentally the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists communicate in Essentials at

least. 4. Most Christians on earth are guilty of Schism, and yet are not preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently Schismaticks, but still members of the Catholick Church. 5. The Bishops, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> are more guilty of the Schism than the Protestants. See Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s Defence of <hi>Laud.</hi>

                        <p>The matter and consequences are so weighty, as tell us it is not well done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse dull Readers thus with the deceitful unexplained nature of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Communion.</hi> The love of truth and souls forbid such deceit. 1. If some receive only Parish-bishops (of the old sort) and others also their Archbishops, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers such Diocesans as put down all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-bishops, which of these have Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal communion? 2. When of old, many Ages, Voting, and Fighting, could not tell men which was the true Bishop among many competitors, and when at <hi>Rome</hi> there were oft two or three at once; and when the worst oft carried the possession; and Councils themselves were for divers; whih was the Episcopal communion? 3.

2. Integrals. 3. Accidents of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

the visible Church, nor promise of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; nor the <hi>Iberians, Indians,</hi> and many others that were baptized before they knew, or had a Bishop? Do not baptizing Presbyters (and Lay-men say, <hi>Turtullian</hi> and the Papists) assure men of salvation, though they should not hear of a Bishop? Why was not Diocesan Episcopacy in the Creed, if the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and obedience be necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                        <p>a (1.) 1. Apostles and Evangelists took men into the visible Communion of the universal Church, before they had particular Church-Bishops. 2. Fixed Church-Communion was exercised uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally under Congregational, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Bishops or Pastors, without such as our Diocesans. It must be Pastoral, or true Episcopal regular Communion. 3. Many Individual Bishops, separating from one another, have been, and may be in one City. 4. If <hi>e. g.</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> have many Counties, and one differing from him, were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Clergy at <hi>Leicester, Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> &amp;c. as he was by the King, which of them is the Bishop on the place? If <hi>Gloucester</hi> Clergy and People had chose another when <hi>Goodman,</hi> a Papist, was Bishop, which was the Bishop?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. 1. Salvation is pronounced by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists to be certain upon Baptism, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Sacrament. 2. Popes and Papists are as much as any for tying salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sacraments; and yet a Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> and his Council, at <hi>Benevent,</hi> 1078. decree, that rather than Communicate with a <hi>Simonist,</hi> they should persist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out visible Communion, and in mind join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        <p n="1">1. Wilful neglect of any known means, sheweth wilful disobedience against God. But many means may be ignorantly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected without destroying assurance of salvation. <hi>Turtullian</hi> thought children should stay from Baptism, unless in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death: and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was for some years delay. This ignorance dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the practisers. Apocryphal books, divers Sacraments, Ceremonies, Church-Offices, Doctrines, have been controverted means among true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 2. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10. Christ blesseth them that hear and do it: Thousands are mentioned as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by hearing, and salvation is promised to Faith.</p>

Is a baptized praying believer out of the Communion of Christs Church, though he doubt of Diocesans, or Patriarchs? He is not.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. 1. Ordinarily faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by preaching; and he that truly believeth shall be saved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.16. 2. I think many Score, or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Protestant Divines have proved that Baptism giveth not the first Right to life, but only solemnly confirmeth, sealeth, and by Ministerial investiture publickly delivereth that which true

Faith received before. See <hi>Gataker</hi>'s two <hi>Tracts</hi> on Dr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s and Dr. <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>'s <hi>Theses.</hi> 3. What's Baptism to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy; till King <hi>Iames</hi> alter'd it, Women might Baptize in <hi>England,</hi> and Priests still may. And are men Baptized into the <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> of Diocesans (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, Baptism binds them to the Pope). Prove this if you can.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If Baptism undoubtedly save, at what Age doth the effect cease? 2. The Lords Supper is necessary for corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and for expressing true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and living by Faith on Christ, where it can lawfully be had, and the need and use of it is understood.</p>
                        <p>(<hi>B.</hi>) This is false: If they be given by a Lay-man, falsly pretending Orders, or by one who hath no Authority through uncapacity, or usurpation; yet the receiver loseth not his Right; he taketh it as from God: and if his ignorance be not culpable, there is not so much as disobedience in it. 2. If I prove that Papists have no such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as you plead for, are all their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms and Ordinations null?</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Episcopal Communion</hi> is the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurnus,</hi> the Hose drawn over your ulcer and snare. 1.

And with their Ruling Bishops, at least as Magistrates. 4. <hi>Novatians, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians, Donatists,</hi> and others, in time of Schisms, had all Orders in Episcopal Communion, and so have <hi>Papists, Greeks, Moscovites, Armenians.</hi> 5. Parish-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops have more proof of Authority
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48440:21"/>
from Christ than the Diocesans, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred Congregations that have no other Bishops. 6. Authority may be given by God, without any Ordination, where it cannot be had, or not without sinning.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. No doubt but all true Authority must be derived from God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Those to whom it was first given, were the Twelve Apostles. They are considered, 1. As the Inspired Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Declarers and Recorders of the Laws, and Doctrine, and Promises of Christ. 2. As chief Pastors of the Church, to gather and rule it. All Gods gifts and graces that come to us by the mediation of the Gospel, come by the Apostles mediation in the first sense, as declaring Christs Will, how Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters shall be made in all Ages. And as chief Pastors, gathering, and setling the first Churches, which, by Christs Charter, shall call their Pastors, and so others, to the end of the world; they may be said to be <hi>Mediators</hi> herein. 3. But they mediate not as the Donors of the Pastoral power, as being Pastors themselves, but only as Ministerial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesters. The Sacraments come not to us without the mediation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but they made them not, nor make them effectual, nor make new Apostles to deliver them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This is deceitful confusion. 1. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Administer Sacraments, and Authority to call others to administer them, are different things. 2. And so is succession of Apostolical power, and succession of common Ministry. 3. And so is giving power, as the Donor, and

giving it as an investing servant. 4. And <hi>proper giving it,</hi> and <hi>improper,</hi> which is but <hi>qualifying</hi> the persons to <hi>receive it.</hi>

And the Orthodox, two, or more at once: <hi>Grotius</hi> thought as many as there were Synagogues in a City. 3. Then if I prove the chief Pastor of a Parish, or City-Church, to be a true Bishop by vertue of Gods Law; and if he have better Qualification, and Election, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, to be of surer Authority than the Diocesan, it's his Communion that we must prefer. 4. But indeed Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and Salvation are ordinarily given before Episcopal Communion of any sort. 5. They that thought the Pope Antichrist (as most Protestant Bishops long did), thought it a duty to reject the Communion of the Bishops of the places where they lived: And <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and other Countries set up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against them that were ordained by <hi>Bugenhagius,</hi> and other Prsbyters. 6. Parochial and Diocesan bounds are humane mutable institutions. 7. If the Bishop of the place be a Schismatick, the Communion of a better near is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                           <hi>b.</hi> II. 1. All causleless separation from any Christians, or causleless disobedience to any Pastor, or neglect of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty, needful to the Churches peace and concord, and every opinion and practice that is against them doth make a man guilty of sinful Division, or Schism in some degree. And while every Christian hath many errors and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48440:23"/>
sins, which all tend to some sinful breach (as the least sore is <hi>solutio continui</hi>), I cannot see but every man living hath some guilt of Schism; nor that there is any Church on earth that hath not some such guilt: But every degree of guilt denominateth not the man, or Church a Schismatick, in a predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or mortal sense. And in Charity, I hope that even some of those heinous Schismaticks may be saved, that divide the Churches by their usurpation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion, sinful impositions, and worldly domination; yea, some that in blind zeal put down Parish-Bishops, and smite and silence the Pastors, and scatter the Flocks. And if I must have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with none that's guilty of Schism, with what Church or Bishop should I joyn? And if their Sacraments be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, what a case is <hi>Italy, Spain, France,</hi> yea and <hi>England</hi> in? Must all be baptized again that they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But it's no schism but a duty for the people as far to forsake a sinful Bishop (much more an usurper) as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and that Council advised them to do in the case of <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Basilides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. And after all this deceitful confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, note Reader, that he denieth not our disobedience to be lawful in case of <hi>sinful conditions imposed.</hi> And if we fully prove not this to be our case, let our accusers silence us, and let our guilt be our shame.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And if people that had Parish-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops on the place where they lived, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, shall forsake them to obey a Diocesan that is not on the place, but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48440:23"/>
perhaps Forty, or Fifty, or Sixty Miles off, and never saw them, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded contrary to the ancient Canons, which nullifie such, and sets himself to silence faithful Pastors, and persecute them, and other godly Christians, for not sinning heinously upon deliberate choice and covenant, doth not even this man conclude such to be Schismaticks that are out of the ordinary way and hope of salvation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. The consequence of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s foresaid doctrine.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THOSE that live under the Popish Bishops in <hi>Italy, Spain, France,</hi> &amp;c. must live in their communion, and under their command in all unsinful things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Protestant Churches that have not Episcopal Ordination, are no true Churches, and have no true Ministers or Sacraments, nor any Covenant-right to salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Protestant Churches are in the same unchurched damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble case that have Bishops, if they have not an uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of such from the Apostles canonically ordained.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore the Churches of <hi>Denmark, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. that have Superintendents ordained at the Reformation by <hi>Bugenhagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Pomeranus</hi> a Presbyter, and all the rest whose succession was interrupted, are in the same case.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is Schism, and rejecting Sacraments, and Covenant-right to salvation, in all the people that continue in such Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and communicate with them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is better for the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> to joyn with the Papists, than to live as they do without Sacraments or Church-communion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Yet (by self contradiction) it will follow, that certainly the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all that derive their ordination from that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48440:24"/>
Church, have no true Bishops, Ministers, Sacraments, Churches, nor Covenant-right to salvation; for it's certain their true succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hath been oft interrupted, 1. By such utterly uncapable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as all History describeth, and even <hi>Baronius</hi> calleth <hi>Apostaticos non Apostolicos</hi>; and such as divers General Councils judged Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Infidels, Simoniaks, <hi>&amp;c. e g. Eugenius</hi> 4. who yet kept in. 2. By such whose false ordination the Canons expresly null. 3. By many Schisms, two or three Popes at once, of whom none can tell who had the right, or whether any. 4 By the Popes taking on him to be Christs Universal Vicar, an Office in <hi>specie</hi> usurpt, which he maketh his Episcopacy, and as such giveth his orders. And all his Presbyters have turned the true Ministry into the false one of Mass-Priests; and being no true Ministers, can give no true Sacraments by his rule.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Yea it is certain, that few, if any Churches on earth, can prove such an uninterrupted succession as he and the <hi>Papists</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, and most its known have no such thing.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Therefore if any have such a succession, they cannot know it, it being a thing that cannot be proved; and so cannot be sure that they are true Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. For the certainty of any true Ministry, Church, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Salvation, dependeth on such knowledg of History as is not in the world: <hi>viz.</hi> To know that this Bishop and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer, and his Ordainer, and his Ordainer, and so up to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, were every one true Bishops, and truly Ordained; which no mortal man can know.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Men that by a Prince, against even the Nullifying Canons, can but get possession of Patriarchal and Diocesan Churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Clergy or peoples choice, have thereby the power of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men that fear God, at their pleasure. For, 1. they must pass for the Bishops of the place. 2. They may command any <hi>unsinful thing,</hi> and excommunicate him that doth not obey. 3. He is a Schismatick that <hi>suffers</hi> himself so to be Excommunicate, and so is in a damnable state. 4. He cannot hinder it, not knowing the thing to be <hi>unsinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. For by this whoever will escape damnable schism, must be one that knoweth the <hi>unsinfulness</hi> (as he speaks) of all things in the world that are such, which a Prelate may command; or else he must do any thing which he judgeth sin, if a Prelate command it. But that is wicked Idolizing man.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48440:24"/>13. And therefore by this rule, no man living can be saved that a Prelate hath a mind to damn; or from his damning impositions. For no man living knoweth the lawfulness of all lawful things, and therefore may take a commanded thing for sin that is not: and then if he wilfully do that which he judgeth sin, he rebelleth against God; if he do it not, the Prelate may excommunicate him, and unresistibly make him a damnable schismatick.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And hereby there are as many hundred new Articles of Faith made, as there are things lawful which a Prelate will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For though all is not to be done that is to be believed, yet all must be <hi>believed</hi> to be lawful and duty which must be done as such: <hi>e. g.</hi> We cannot love God, worship him, hear and read his Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by Divine obedience, unless we believe it to be our duty by a Divine command. Therefore when as Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and such others tell us what damning schism it is to disobey such commands of the Bishops, or to suffer our selves to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, it plainly includeth that it is as damning a sin to take any lawful thing to be a sin, and not to believe it to be lawful whatever the Bishop shall command. And so to how many hundred indifferent things may the Articles of our Faith be extended, while it is made ordinarily necessary to Salvation to do them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to believe them to be lawful?</p>
            <p n="15">15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By this he confoundeth <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> I may have communion with many Bishops whom I am not bound to obey: But I cannot hinder them from Excommunicating me without obeying them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Yea, he maketh Communion and Salvation to lye not only on such obedience, but on such <hi>perfection</hi> of obedience as reacheth to every lawful indifferent thing. Whereas God himself under the Gospel accepteth of sincerity, instead of perfection which the Law required of perfect man.</p>
            <p n="17">17. This is the way to make Bishops absolute Lords of Kings and States, and all the world, if they can make them believe that on pain of damnation for schism, all must obey them even in every indifferent thing.</p>
            <p n="18">18. If you would ferret him out of his Burrough, ask Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> what if the Bishop of the place where I live contradict the Archbishop, or the Synod, or most of the Bishops in the land, which must I obey to escape damning schism? Doubtless he will allow me to disobey my Bishop. But what if the National Synod
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48440:25"/>
gainsay the Provincial? He will say, I may disobey the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? But what if a Council of many Nations, called General, gainsay the National? and it be known that our National Church is gainsayed by the far greatest part of the Bishops in the world? which must I obey? If the National, why not a Provincial against them? And why are not they Schismaticks for disobeying a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council? If it be the greater Council that I must obey, 1. What's become then of his doctrine of obeying the <hi>Episcopacy</hi> of the place where we live? 2. And then we are brought under a foreign Jurisdiction. 3. And who but the Pope must call that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, preside, approve, &amp;c.? 4. And among all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and contradicting Councils called <hi>General,</hi> how shall all Christians know which of them to obey? We see whither all will come at last. But saith Bishop <hi>Bilson, To such Councils cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led General, we owe respect for concord, if they abuse us not by error or usurpation; but</hi> subjection and obedience we owe them none.</p>
            <p n="19">19. How hardly will these men ever resolve one's conscience which is to be taken for the <hi>Episcopacy of the place,</hi> when there are in the same place both different species of Bishops, and also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Bishops of the same species, and all pretending to be right. In <hi>Ireland</hi> both the <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishops pretend to just succession; and so they did in <hi>Bohemia, Poland, Transylvania, Hungary,</hi> &amp;c. And doth salvation lye on mens knowledg who hath right?</p>
            <p n="20">20. And how contrary is it to the way of Christ, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church (that made the Baptismal covenant the terms of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) for men to make it necessary for every poor man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that will have Covenant-right to salvation, and escape damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing schism, to be able to decide the controversies between all such pretenders, and to know whether their Bishops be of a true spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and have true Ordination, and to be such rare Historians as to know that all the line of Ordainers down from the Apostles to their Bishops, were truly ordained? O difficult terms!</p>
            <p n="21">21. Doth he not condemn all those Ancient and Modern Christians as Fautors o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> damning Doctrine, who thought that when there were none of the Clergy to do it, lay-men might bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize and give the Lords Supper? <hi>Grotius</hi> told us his judgment for it in <hi>Dissertat. de Caenae administrat. ubi Pastores non sunt:</hi> And he hath vindicated <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s judgment for it, confessed by <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galtius. Anton. Govea</hi> tells us it was the case of the Christians of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48440:25"/>
               <hi>Malabar,</hi> &amp;c. called of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> whose Bishops being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, they caused a Deacon to administer the Eucharist, as the Bishops and Presbyters had done (which <hi>Grotius</hi> also repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth). <hi>Ionan. Antiochenus</hi> magnified by <hi>Socrates, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. when at <hi>Antioch</hi> there were two Churches, with two Bishops, <hi>Meletius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> stuck to <hi>Meletius</hi> till he died, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for three years, would communicate with neither. Did he by this become a damned Schismatick, or lose his Covenant-right to salvation?</p>
            <p n="22">22. Many of old were chosen for Bishops before they were baptized (the cases of <hi>Ambrose, Nectarius, Synesius,</hi> &amp;c. are known): If the Church thought them all to be in a state of damnation, for want of the Sacrament, it's strange that they would choose them to be their Bishops (though it was irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar).</p>
            <p>Indeed it's true that <hi>Grotius</hi> saith (<hi>ibid.</hi> in fine), that <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes, Nazianzenes,</hi> and others cases tell us, that it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in the <hi>Greek</hi>-Church to delay baptizing even the children of the faithful, till at full years (about Twenty). Were they all that while without any promise of salvation, or ordinary hope?</p>
            <p n="23">23. What a task will it be for Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> to tell us what state the baptized are in till they receive the Lords Supper? Baptism saveth them once; but yet till they receive the Lords Supper by a Minister, in successive Episcopal Orders, they have no Covenant-title to salvation, by his way. But some Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate not till Thirty years old, some not till One and Twenty, and in <hi>England</hi> scarce any before Sixteen. Are they all this while the children of God, or of the Devil? And when is it that their Christianity ceaseth for want of the other Sacrament? I believe that if they truly believe, they are Gods children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to the second Sacrament (or the third, as some call it.) Was <hi>Constantine Mag.</hi> in a state of damnation, who was not baptized till near his death? Or the good Emperour, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> who died unbaptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, but taken by <hi>Ambrose</hi> for a blessed man? What absurdities are men fain to use, to get the Mastery of the Christian world, by making men believe that they can save or damn them by the power of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p n="24">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48440:26"/>24. And how is this man for Conformity, by which they subscribe assent to the certain salvation of Infants, so dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Confirmation; and ordain that the Lords Supper be not Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to any till they are ready to be Confirmed, by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catechism, and recognizing the Covenant? &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Doth he not make the chief Bishops and Reformers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be the promoters of the Doctrine which he accounteth so damnable, when Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicon</hi> recites the words of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and others of them, at a Consultation, down-right against not only the necessity of his uninterrupted succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion, but also even of Episcopal Ordination it self? And I have elsewhere cited about Fourteen of them, for the validity of Ordination without Bishops: And Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet,</hi> Bishop <hi>Edw. Reignnolds,</hi> and many more, held that no Form of Government was of Divine determination. Did all these plead for damning Schism, against all title to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="26">26. And what could more directly contradict the main te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Gospel, which tells us of the saving power of the Word Preached, how it converteth souls, and promiseth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all that truly believe and repent? Insomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> thanks God that he baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d few of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> because God sent him not to baptize, but to Preach the Gospel?</p>
            <p n="27">27. But his Doctrine feigneth, that God will damn them that truly believe, repent, love God, forsake sin, for want of the Sacrament: or else that the Word converteth none, but only Sacraments convert men.</p>
            <p n="28">28. And then it will follow, that none but unbelievers, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wicked men should be first admitted to the Sacrament; for if that only converteth, then it is only the unconverted that must first be received to it.</p>
            <p n="29">29 When all's done, he doth but contradict his end; for it's hard to find a National Episcopacy on earth, which imposeth no unlawful thing on Ministers or people: And with all such he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for our Communion.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Either Ordination, and Collation of Church-power, must be given by Superiors, or by Equals: if by Equals, why may not Presbyters make Presbyters? If by Superiors, then who shall give the Pope his Power? Or if you think any other be the highest, who makes them such? Who giveth the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Power?</p>
            <p n="31">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48440:26"/>31. In short, as far as I can understand, these men deny all Covenant-right to salvation to all men living, and all true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Church-Communion, or at least, all knowledg of any such thing; seeing, as it is certain, that in most Churches such Ordination as they describe, hath not had an uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, so no man is sure that any one Church or man hath had such. And they that silence us for not subscribing, declaring and swearing obedience to our Diocesans, and other Ordinaries, are bold men, if they dare <hi>swear themselves, that they are true Bishops, and have any Authority to rule and command us, by an uninterrupted succession of a Canonical Episcopal Ordination down from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have already in my Book of <hi>Concord, Part</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. opened so many palpable, and pernicious absurdities, and ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s Doctrine, which he dare not undertake to answer, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the fruits which are of God, are those which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Divine Nature and Image, <hi>viz.</hi> holy Light and Truth, <hi>holy Love,</hi> and <hi>holy Life</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> and the promoting of these in the world.</p>
            <p>And Christ hath taught me, that the Devil is, 1. Against ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light and Truth, the Prince of Darkness, and a Lyar, and the Father of Lyes. 2. Against holy Love, accusing, slandring,

and rendring as odious the servants and ways of Christ. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst holy, righteous, and sober <hi>living</hi>; and an opposer of it, and a persecutor and murderer of the Saints.</p>
            <p>And those that are likest Satan in these three parts of his Image, and whose works are more certainly the works of these three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical Principles, I am taught by Christ to judg of by their fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So much as there is in Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s labours, of holy <hi>Truth,</hi> holy <hi>Love,</hi> and helps to <hi>holy living,</hi> so much sure is of God.

Either he knew that he wrote falsly, or he did not; if yea, then it seems he thinks that God or his Church needed his lyes: if not, how unfit is he to write against what he understandeth not?

And whether it be from the Lord of love, or the enemy of love, that he goeth so far to the unchurching and damning of so many of the Reformed Churches, besides the Churches of the Southern and Eastern parts of the world (if not of all Churches on earth) let the sons of Love consider.</p>

            <p n="5">§. 5. I so often and fully repeated my judgment of the Calling of the Ministry, as leaveth his Forgeries inexcusable. The sum is this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no power but of God. 2. Gods universal Laws are the prime Laws, and the only universal Laws of the Church or world.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48440:27"/>
3. In his Laws God hath established or instituted the work and the <hi>species</hi> of that Ecclesiastical Ministry which he will have to teach and guide his Church to the end of the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in signified his owning of them as sent by him, and promised them his help and blessing. 4. In that Law he hath told us what men they are that he will thus own and bless, and described the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> and the <hi>Integrals</hi> of their <hi>Receptive</hi> disposition or qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 5. He hath in that Law told us who shall be the tryers and judgers of the personal qualifications; and that <hi>ordinis gratia,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily their approbation, choice, or consent, shall be a relative part of their Receptive qualification. 6. God himself giveth all the personal qualifications. 7 He is ready to help the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and chusers to discern all these, and to judg aright of them. 8. The person being thus made a capable Recipient by personal qualifications and relative (due Approbation, Election and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) God's Donation or Law doth give him <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>oblige</hi> him to the office-work. And the Electors, Approvers, and Consenters, are none of the proper efficient Donors or causes of this <hi>right</hi> and <hi>obligation,</hi> but only efficient causes of his relative receptive capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 9. That therefore the <hi>right</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> is immediately from Gods Law by resultancy, as the established medium of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; but not immediately without any means of his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, to make him <hi>materiam dispositam.</hi> 10. That all this is true both of Soveraign Civil Power, and of Church-power in Bishops and Pastors. 11. That yet besides Approbation and Election, God hath for the publick notice and order of the Church, appointed a Regular Ministerial Investiture, by which the Approved shall be solemnly put into possession (as Kings are crowned, and Ministers instituted): and <hi>Ordination</hi> usually containeth both the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, part of the election, and the investiture. 12 But this Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture being but a Ministerial delivery of possession, proveth not the Investor to be any Donor of the Power to the <hi>King,</hi> or to the Bishop or Pastor. 13. Nor is it necessary save <hi>ordinis gratia,</hi> and <hi>in foro ecclesiae,</hi> to avoid intrusion and confusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not when it is set against the end, or the end may and must be sought without it. 14. Who it is that hath the power of this Ordination (Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Investiture) is much of the controversie of these times: some say it is the Magistrate: but those that say it is the bishops, are not agreed what species of bishops it is; whether the chief Pastors of each particular Parish true Church, or only a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48440:28"/>
that is the sole bishop of many parishes that are no true Churches; or only Diocesans that are Archbishops over many true Parish-churches and bishops. 15. But the <hi>Fundamentum juris</hi> being Christs Statute-Law or Grant, and all that is left to man being but <hi>qualitatively</hi> or <hi>relatively</hi> to make the person an immediately capable Recipient, and ministerially invest him; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if at <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Ierusalem, Cesarea, Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, London,</hi> all the old bishops were dead or hereticks, a just ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may be restored without the ordination of one that had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive canonical ordination; because there needeth no efficient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor but Christ and his Law, and the receptive capacity may be without such ordination where it is not to be had (as among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists that will not ordain one on lawful terms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for Order it self is but for the <hi>thing ordered,</hi> and not against it: And <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice</hi>

               </gap>morals before rituals); and <hi>all power is to edification,</hi> &amp;c. are certain rules. And God never made men judges <hi>in partem utram libet,</hi> whether there shall be <hi>Churches,</hi> and Pastors, and Worship, or none; or whether there shall be Civil Government or none; no, nor of what the <hi>species</hi> the <hi>Church-Offices</hi> shall be. 16. I use to explain this by many expository, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes. 1. If the Laws of God authorize Soveraignty, and the Constitution of the Kingdom say it shall be Monarchy; were it Elective, the Electors are not Efficients of power, but determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Recipient: And if it be Hereditary or Elective, the Investers by coronation, are no efficients of the power; but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial deliverers of possession, and that but necessary <hi>ad ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> and not <hi>ad esse potestatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If the King by a Charter to the University, state the power of the Chancellor, Vicechancellor, Proctors, and all the Masters of Colledges, and then tell them who shall be capable, and how chosen, and how inve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted; here his power is immediately from the Kings <hi>Charter,</hi> as the efficient Instrument; and all that others do is but to determine of the Recipient, and invest him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. So it is as to the power of the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and the Mayors and Bailiffs of all Corporations.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So it is in the essential power of the Husband over the Wife; the woman chuseth who shall have it; and the Parson that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth them, investeth him in it; but God only is the efficient do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his Law.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48440:28"/>17. Therefore it is not in the power of the Electors, Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or Investors, to alter any of the Power established by God. If both the woman and the Priest say, that the man shall be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but shall have no government of her, it is a nullity; Gods Law shall stand. If the City and the Recorder say, You shall be Lord Mayor, but not have all the power given by the Kings <hi>Charter,</hi> its vain, and he shall have all that the <hi>Charter</hi> giveth him. If the <hi>A Bp</hi> crown the King, and say, You shall be King, but not have all the power stated by the <hi>Constitution</hi> on the King, this depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the King of his power, (unless he give away that which God hath not stated on him, but men) so if an Ordaining Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, Patron, or Parish say, <hi>This is a true Parish Church, and we choose, and Ordain you the true Pastor of it, but you shall have but part of the true Pastoral Power stablished on the office by God,</hi> it's null: Gods Institution shall be the measure of his power.</p>
            <p n="18">18. But I confess, that if God had left Church-Officers as much to the will of men as he hath done the Civil, the case had been otherwise; for Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, are all lawful: And the King, or other supreme power may make new <hi>Species</hi> of Judges, and Magistrates, and Officers, and alter them as they see cause. And it would have been so in the Church, if as the <hi>Italians</hi> at <hi>Trent</hi> would have carried it, Christ had immediately Instituted only the Papacy, and left it to the Pope to make Bishops, and to Bishops to make Priests: And yet I would not wrong the worst. I cannot say, that they would have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered the Pope to change the <hi>Species</hi> of Priests or Bishops. But God hath fixed the <hi>Species,</hi> by making a setled Law for all the <hi>work,</hi> and all the <hi>Authority</hi> to do it, though Accidentals may be altered in work and Office.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. This is the clear state of my assertions, which how grosly Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> hath falsified in his forged description, I will not stay to open.</p>
            <p>But it is a great stress and fabrick that he layeth on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary supposition, that his <hi>Species</hi> of Bishops are the givers of the Powers, and so we can have no other, or more than they are willing to give us: And let him that thinks he spoke a sentence of truth and sense, to prove it, enjoy his error. I would quickly prove the contrary to him, if I knew what he denieth.</p>

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will shame him to all that believe, and understand it. 2. And if it be not divinely established, men may alter it; and what is all this stir about, to keep up their Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. II. If he think that God hath only Instituted Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or Rectors, <hi>in genere,</hi> but not in <hi>Specie,</hi> then I give him the same answer as before. Scripture will shame him, and men may make new <hi>Species</hi> of Church-Pastors, and unmake, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; and how many, or how oft, who knows? And who be the men that have this Office-changing-power, that we may know whether, and how far, and how long we are bound to obey them?</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. III. If he think that Gods Law hath not described the Essential Qualifications of the Recipient, then Prelates may make Pastors of <hi>Infidels, Mahometans, Bedlams,</hi> or <hi>Blasphemers,</hi> if not of Horses or Dogs.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. IV. If he think that Gods Law hath determined of no way of <hi>Election, Approbation,</hi> or <hi>judging</hi> who is capable, then every man may make himself a Bishop or Priest, and the <hi>Turk</hi> may make Bishops for Christians, or a company of Lay-enemies and persecutors may do it; and then the Bishops Judgment and Ordination will have no Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. V. If when the Recipient is duly qualified, and chosen, and capable, he does not think that Gods Law, or Grant, is a sufficient signification of his Donative will, and a <hi>fundamentum juris,</hi> and an <hi>obliging</hi> instrument, 1. He must deny the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and force of Gods Law, and Grant. And 2. He maketh it less effective than the Laws, Charters, and Donations of men are; For which he cannot have the least shew of true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

If that which I have named be called <hi>giving,</hi> let him use his liberty, and call it how he will. 1. But as to the <hi>Thing,</hi> what is it more than I have described? It is God, and not man that made the Office <hi>in genere &amp; specie.</hi> Did our Bishops make the universal Law, which stablisheth the Office in the world? 2. And the Bishop never <hi>had</hi> that <hi>power,</hi> and therefore cannot give that which he had not: It's Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s reason against Presbyters ordaining, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="13">§. 13.

In the Civil State some Officers are made without any Investiture (as Constables, Headboroughs, Church Wardens and others), and some the Charter imposeth Investiture on: But whether if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corders, Stewards, Town Clerks, that by Charter are to Invest, be dead, or refuse their Act, the Mayor, Bayliff, or other Officers be therefore none, and the Government be dead, let Lawyers tell you. 6.

by Lay-men, that I say not women. 8. Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> self-condemningly saith, that a presumptuous Ordination of the Priest serves to the validity of Sacraments, though indeed he were not Ordained; and that God is bound to make such Acts to the people good. 9. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> must beg belief instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, if he tell us, that the stated teaching of Gods Word to a Church, is not as truly the work of the Pastor, as is the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper. It is one of the principal of the Jesuits jugglings, to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think, that till they can prove their Teachers the rightly Ordained Ministers of Christ, they are not bound to hear them, or believe them. Our Parents (mostly) were never Ordained Bishops, or Priests: Must not Children therefore hear them, and believe them (<hi>fide humanâ</hi>)? And hath not that God, who appointed Parents to teach his Law to their children, <hi>lying down, and rising up,</hi> and to educate them in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> thereby signified, that <hi>Parents instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the first ordinary means appointed by God for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of saving knowledg, and faith? And if the help of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, though unordained, be <hi>Gods ordinary means</hi> of the <hi>first saving faith,</hi> shall We say with such men as Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> that we have no Covenant right to salvation, till we have the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the hand of a Minister that had a regular Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uninterruptedly down from the Apostles? 10. Did the Three hundred, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. and the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. refuse Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism till they were satisfied by proof, that the Baptizers were rightly called Ministers? <hi>Paul</hi> tells those that questioned his Apostolick power, that <hi>he was an Apostle to them whatever he was to others</hi>; and that they should know first, whether Christ were in them, and so whether he were not a true Minister, and not begin at the trying of the Ministry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. 11. The Acts of the Parliament, called irregularly by General <hi>Monk,</hi> were they that restored King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> and were confirmed by him as valid, through the defect of a Regular Summons, and by necessity. 12. I have fully proved in my Treatise of Episcopacy, that the <hi>Species of</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> pleaded for, is not the same which the Churches had for 200. or 300. years.

He saith also, <hi>p.</hi> 37. <hi>They cannot give an Instance (of any power setled by Charter), whereupon the Acts of any persons, lawfully Invested, though confessedly less qualified, are not thought valid: A plain sign that their Investiture doth properly confer such power.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Words fitted to deceive. 1. <hi>He that is unqualified</hi> is not <hi>lawfully Invested,</hi> and yet the Act of the <hi>Invester</hi> may be <hi>right,</hi> had the Recipient been lawful.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Nor will I believe him, that any Bishops Ordination can make a true Bishop, or Priest, of a Woman, an Infant, or a professed Heathen, Infidel, or proper Heretick, or any uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person, any more than he can make a Woman to be a Husband, or a dumb man the University Orator.</p>
            <p n="23">§. 23. He saith, <hi>They cannot give an Instance of any Power setled by Charter, whereupon a failure of all who are by the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter empowred to dispose of Offices, the power must devolve to those who are not by the Charter empowred to dispose of them and where such a Charter is not thought in Law to fail, by becoming unpracticable, till the supreme power interpose,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48440:32"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Still the same fraud: <hi>If all empowred to dispose of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> is an ambiguous word. The Prince disposeth of them, by giving the Power, and the Electors by choosing the Receivers, and the Minister by delivering the <hi>Insignia:</hi> If Electors, and all die indeed, there are none to determine of the Receiver: And yet if the Plague kill most of the Electors at Age, and leave not a due number, when the rest left come to Age, and choose, the Charter will renew the Office-power. 2. But if it be only the Ministerial Invester that faileth, the sense of the Lawgiver must be judged of by the words, and by other noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the light of common Reason. <hi>e. g.</hi> Whether it be the meaning of the Charter which saith, that the Recorder shall give the Oath, or the former Mayor shall deliver the <hi>Insignia,</hi> that if the Recorder, or Mayor be dead, or sick, or mad, or wilfully refuse, the City shall have no Mayor; or if no Priest will Marry folks, all <hi>England</hi> must live unmarried; or if the Archbishops and Bishops will Ordain none but Hereticks, all the Churches must have no other Ministers. And here Nature and Christ teach us, that the Means is only for the End, and Order for the thing ordered; and God will have us understand his own Laws so, as that Rituals give place to Morals: <hi>I will have mercy, and not sacrifice.</hi> And sure if the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Charter, for the making of Governours at the <hi>West Indies,</hi> should not express, or reasonably imply a Remedy, in case of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of circumstances of meer Order, his Countrey might be lost before they could send to <hi>Spain</hi> for a new Charter or new power.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>D.</hi> saith, <hi>Which is the very case impugned by me of the Nonconformists</hi>: And so judg whether he must not turn a Seeker, and say, that all <hi>Ministry, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments cease, till a new Commission comes from Heaven,</hi> upon the failure of every such circumstance; yea, when almost all the Churches charge each other with failures and intercisions, and the very <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the <hi>Ordainers</hi> is so much altered.</p>
            <p>If the King send his Army into the <hi>Indies</hi> (or his <hi>Navies</hi>), and mention no power but the Generals, as chief, or no way of choosing a new General, but by the Field-Officers choice, and giving him an Oath by the Secretary, &amp;c. yet no man doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but it was his meaning, that if the General die, or turn Rebel, yea, and the major part of the Field-Officers, or the

Secretary, the Army should choose another General, rather than perish, and the Kings service miscarry.</p>
            <p n="24">§. 24. He addeth, <hi>They cannot give an Instance of any humane Charter, that ever allows any person empowered, to extend his own power by a private exposition of the Charter, against the sense of all the visible supreme powers of the society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This opens the Core of the Aposthume.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We deny, as confidently as any <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Italians</hi> affirm, that there is any such thing at a supreme <hi>visible power</hi> over the universal Church, under Jesus Christ; and therefore none such is disobeyed, or contradicted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And we maintain, That by Divine appointment there is no visible National supreme Church-power, but that of the Civil Christian Soveraign; and therefore none such disobeyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And we hold, that no man can extend his own power further than Christs own Law extendeth it. False expositions give no power.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And therefore we prove by your own Rule, that (Christ being the only supreme universal Ruler, and having described and specified the Office of a Pastor, and order of a Church) no Bishops can by their private exposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turn a single Church into a Diocesan, or a Presbyter of Christs description into an half Presbyter of their own making: But if they make a man a Pastor, his power and work shall be what Christ saith, and not what the Orda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ner will. Investing-Ministers Acts are null, if they contradict the Order of the Donor: If the King give you a Parsonage of 300. <hi>l.</hi> a year, and the Instituter say, you shall have but 100. <hi>l.</hi> out of it, it's vain; he instituteth you but as the Donors instrument in the same Benefice, and power given by him.</p>
            <p n="25">§ 25. He addeth, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <hi>Where can they find such a Charter for the power of Presbyters in Scripture as they speak of?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, then we are far from agreeing, if you think that the very <hi>Species</hi> of a <hi>Pastors</hi> Office is not found in Scripture, as of Christs institution. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it seems, the Bishops make the very <hi>Species</hi>: The <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops at <hi>Trent</hi> scarce gave so much to the Pope. Then why may not the Bishops put down Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, if they make the <hi>Species,</hi> or make as many <hi>Species</hi> as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48440:33"/>
they please? Indeed Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thought that there was no evidence of the Order of Subject Presbyters in Scripture-times. And if God instituted none, let us have none. But I have told you before, and often, where in Scripture the true Pastors Office is described.</p>
            <p n="26">§. 26. He adds, <hi>They may find some actual practices; but will they call that a Charter</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This is indeed to strike at our foundation. If we prove not Christ to be King, and Lawgiver, and that his Laws, or Governing-precepts, were partly given by himself, and partly by his Spirit, in his Commissioned Apostles, and these Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sealed, and Delivered in Scripture: If we prove not, that these, as the authorized Agents of Christ, delivered his Will by words and practice, in setling, and describing the Pastors of his Churches, then take the Ministry, and spare not for mans invention. I cited you before, the Texts that are our proof.</p>
            <p>But if the Office, which you call <hi>Priestly,</hi> be of mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>in specie,</hi> I doubt the Diocesans will prove so much more; for many Papists doubt of the Divine right of Prelacy, that doubt not of the Divine unalterable right of the Priestly, or Presbyter-power and work. And will this cure men of Schism, to tell them, that God hath not so much as made, and specified the Parish-Pastors Office, and it is but a humane invention which you forsake?</p>
            <p n="27">§. 27. And I would crave of this confident man to consider, whether he reach not high, and horrid Sacriledg, if he make the Invester to be first the <hi>Owner,</hi> and then the <hi>Donor?</hi> Did we devote our selves to <hi>Patrons</hi> in our Ministry, or to Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans, or immediately to God? If we covenanted only to be Gods Ministers, for the <hi>Churches</hi> good, then let them take heed that claim propriety in us as Priests. And if Tythes and Glebes were devoted to God, and not to Princes, or Patrons, I doubt he that maketh Patrons the Proprietaries, and proper Donors, will prove Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and be convinced at last, that he should only have taken Princes and Pastors for such Trustees as determine of the <hi>Receiver,</hi> but give not the things.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48440:34"/>§. 28. If it be otherwise, Princes, Patrons, and Prelates, are greater and richer than I ever thought them 1. Then, all the Bishopricks in <hi>England</hi> are the King's, till he give them. 2. Then all the Tythes, Glebes, and Temples in <hi>England,</hi> are the Patrons, till they give them; or else the Bishops, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, who investeth men in them by institution and induction. And the Patron and Bishop may have a hard suit to determine which is the Proprietor. 3. And then a Bishop that Ordaineth a thousand Priests, was the <hi>Owner</hi> of all their Relations before; and so as they that are for the pre-existence of souls, dispute, whether they pre-existed individually, or only <hi>in animâ uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versali</hi>; so these that are for the pre existence of Priesthoods in the Diocesans, must dispute, whether they were in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a thousand individual Priesthoods before, or but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Priesthood, that fell into individuals by Ordination. If they say, that they were but <hi>virtually</hi> in the Prelate, that kills their Cause; for then they did not pre-exist (for <hi>existere est esse extra causas</hi>). And this only saith, that the Prelate had an effective vertue that could make them. But the <hi>species</hi> was made before; and so was the obliging, and Donative Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prelate had not power to do what God had done before.</p>
            <p n="29">§. 29. I take it for granted (because I know him), that all this is nothing to Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>; but to me it is moreover some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 1. That the highest esteemers of Diocesans Ordination, make it but a Sacrament. 2 And that the Investing Minister is not the Owner and Donor of the Relation and Gift in any of their Seven Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Baptism God only giveth the Right and Relation, which the Minister by Investiture solemnizeth, but giveth it not as his own: Else every Lay-man and woman by their judgment, should have multitudes of Christendoms of their own to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Confirmation the Priest never pretendeth to be the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Spirit, but by his act to fit the person to receive it: The Holy Ghost is said to <hi>fall on them that heard the word</hi> (before Baptism), <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44, 45 and they were after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: He fell on them, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.15. And <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48440:34"/>
for the <hi>Samaritans, that they might receive the Holy Ghost, Act.</hi> 8.15. and <hi>they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost, v.</hi> 17. but not that they gave the Holy Ghost, though by the laying on of their hands, and their prayers, he was given, as he was on them without, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in Matrimony it's confessed, that the Priest is not the Owner and Donor of the Husbands power, but a Ministerial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And in the Eucharist, even they that think the bread is made God, take not the Priest as the efficient cause, but a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing instrument; nor that he <hi>giveth</hi> God to the Receiver, as the Owner, or Donor, but delivereth him as a Minister.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The same is true of Penance, Extreme Unction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be so also in <hi>Ordination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the King send a thousand Commissions to Captains, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Justices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Messenger is not the Owner, or Donor of them all; nor may make any alteration of them: yea, if he intrust the Chancellor to name all the Justices, he doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by but determine of the person that shall receive the Commission, but altereth nothing of the Office, nor is the Donor of it. All this is plain to us, but not to Mr. <hi>Dodwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">§. 30. Saith he, <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>Are not many actual practices grounded on circumstances? Are not many of those circumstances obnoxious to great mutability? Are not ordinary Governours the competent Iudges of their actual change?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. And did not Christ promise, his Spirit to his Apostles, for the performance of their Commissions? And were not those Commissions to gather, and settle his Churches, and teach them all that he commanded them? And did not Christ by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit make <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as is before proved? And did not the Apostles faithfully perform their trust?</p>
            <p n="2">2. And doth he not see, that by this he also subverteth his foundation of Prelatical power also, as having no better insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution than the Priesthood? And then who are those Governours of the Church that he talks of, that must judg? And how prove they their jugding-power?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it were a <hi>kindness,</hi> if he would tell us what change it is that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Diocesans may make in the Priestly Office and work, and tell us the bounds of their power, if it have any? And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48440:35"/>
whether they may put down the Preaching part, the Praying part, the Sacraments, or which of them? And whether this be the power that hath put out the Sacramental Cup, and made all the changes that are made in the Church. To tell us of these ordinary Governours <hi>changing-power,</hi> is a hard word to us, that took Christs Laws, delivered by his Spirit, to be perfect, and unchangeable; However, some circumstances are changed, which were noted to be but occasional.</p>
            <p n="31">§. 31. To return his Consequence, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>Since it is certain, that the power of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>daining others, was not given</hi> to, nor for some hundred years exercised by that <hi>species</hi> of Diocesans, who were neither the Bishops of single Churches, associated for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal present Communion, nor were the Overseers of such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but the Bishops of Diocesses, that have many score, or hundred unbishoped stated worshipping Assemblies, it will follow by his arguing, that these never had their Office from the Apostles, and much less a continued succession of it.</p>
            <p n="32">§. 32. He next pleadeth the Nullity of the Presbyterians Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 1. Because if they had Ordaining power, it is only in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies where Bishops are Presidents, and Edict them. 2. And because they carry it not by Plurality of Voices. But I am a weary with answering such trifling things, and the later part is a known mistake. I never heard of one contradicting Voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ordination of any that was Ordained in our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</p>
            <p n="33">§. 33. And he hath half disabled me to answer him from <hi>p.</hi> 50. forwards, where he feigneth me to maintain, that <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must necessarily result from true qualifications</hi>: For it is taken for uncivil to give his words their proper name. But if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will pardon the Repetition, I may remind him, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> trusted that his Reader would believe his words without perusing what I wrote; where he might have seen, 1. That I say, that the <hi>Authority resulteth not from the qualifications,</hi> but from Christs Law, Grant, or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 2. That <hi>personal qualifications</hi> (of gifts, or grace) are but part of the necessary <hi>Dispasitio Recipientis</hi>; but that moreover there is needful, 1. Opportunity. 2.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48440:35"/>
3. And to a Bishop the flocks consent, if not election. And <hi>ordinis gratia,</hi> (where moral necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I still distinguish between the <hi>Qualifications</hi> necessary <hi>ad esse,</hi> and those only <hi>ad bene esse,</hi> or integral. If he would perswade the Reader that I null Ordination for want of the latter, his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or designed ill intent is such as warneth his Readers to take heed of believing him. If he mean it only of the former, as I speak, I have before confuted him that dare say that no qualification is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>ad esse.</hi> Then a Pope <hi>Ioan,</hi> or woman-Priest or Prelate, or a professed enemy of God or Christ may be a Priest.

Cannot the best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever go to Heaven, if all your Priests will but deny him the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and yet may a man be validly a Bishop, and the Key keeper of Heaven that believeth not that there is a God, a Christ or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and so professeth? This maketh me remember the old <hi>Roman</hi> Canons, how no Bishop must be deposed for lying with his own Sister, unless a great multitude of Witnesses testifie it; and the Councils that decreed no Layman shall witness against a Clergy-man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But Election, consent, the Ordainers approbation (ordinarily) are part of my Qualifications. And if these be unnecessary, what doth the man plead for? And is a false approbation of a man that wanteth Essentials, more necessary than having them?

            <p n="35">§ 35. <hi>P.</hi> 90. At the end of this insinuated false accusation, he asketh, [<hi>Where do we find that God ever gave Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, (though he gave Apostles, Pastors and Teachers)? those extraordinary Offices indeed seem to have been made neither of man, nor by man, but by God immediately, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Hath he said a word to prove that <hi>Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not ordinary Officers,</hi> contrary to the common judgment of the Church in all ages? 2. Whether he mean [<hi>Bishops</hi>] in the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Case, or the Accusative, I know not. If the later, let him speak out and say, <hi>God gave not Bishops.</hi> But how proveth he that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> (and <hi>Bishops</hi>) are not <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Teachers?</hi> 3. The Text tells you, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. that these offices were given for the continued stated use of the Church: <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, the work of the Ministry, for the edifying the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and the knowledg of the Son of God, to a perfect man, &amp;c.</hi> Was this temporary? 4. It seems he disclaimeth Bishops being made, in making Apostles. 5. Christ by his Spirit in the Apostles ordered the Churches.</p>
            <p n="36">§. 36. <hi>P.</hi> 65. he saith [<hi>They never find any of those Officers to whom succession is at present pretended, made immediately by God, but by the intervention of men, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Still deceiving confusion: 1. <hi>Intervention</hi> is a word of fraud, and may signifie only that act which determineth of, and qualifieth the receiver; and it may signifie the <hi>Donation,</hi> or <hi>making</hi> of the <hi>office.</hi> It is this that we speak of. 2. The Intervention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly inspired men, commissioned to deliver and record Christs own will, hath an efficiency instrumental in making the office, in that the Spirit in them doth it, and they do make instrumentally the Charter or Law which giveth the power; and Christ doth what they did by his Commission and Spirit. If you can prove that our Diocesans have this Commission, spirit and power, if they write new Sacred Scriptures, or make new Sacraments, and Church-forms, and offices, we will obey them. But prove it well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Did any man but Christ send forth the Seventy? Yet most Prelatists hold, that those were the predecessors of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48440:36"/>4. By this it seems he again denieth, that Christ himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Order of Bishops, by making Apostles. And if so, he will sorely shake his standing; for then they must prove all their power from the Apostles (or following persons) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and not make them successors of the Apostles own Office (for they made not their own Office). And Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> thinks there were <hi>no Bishops,</hi> or few made in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks of subject-Presbyters. And if Christs Spirit in the Apostles made not these Offices (who made the Scripture, which is Gods Law), I despair of seeing it proved, that any since them were authorized to make them. And if men only made the Episcopal and Presbyters Office, men may unmake them.</p>
            <p n="37">§. 37. A case put to me within this hour, remindeth me, how much these men prefer Ordination, not only in it self, but in this circumstance of Prelatical uninterrupted succession, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptism, which is our Christning. There are some godly young men that have Communicated in the Lords Supper, that were the children of Quakers and Anabaptists; some were never baptized, and some know not whether they were, or not; and being born near Two hundred Miles hence, cannot learn or come to any certainty. The question is, Whether these that have Communicated, should yet be baptized? which is to make Christians of Christians? Or whether the higher Sacrament do not eminently contain the lower, as making a man a Bishop, containeth making him a Presbyter, and that containeth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently his Deaconship (as some say)? If they must be baptized, yet, it implieth the Nullity of their Sacramental Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And if so, Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> must confess, that Priestly exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or investiture is null to an uncapable Subject. But I think most will say, that he should not be baptized, it being done interpretatively. And if so, is his Prelatical mode of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination more necessary than actual Baptism? Besides, that (as is said) they make Lay-mens or womens baptizing sufficient <hi>ad esse.</hi> And yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> professeth, that only the Two Sacramens, Baptism and the Lords Supper, are generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation.</p>

But he giveth us not one word of proof of it. Was it the <hi>Holy Ghost which was in the imposing Apostle or Prelate</hi> that was given by him, and out of him into the Ordained? No, he was never in Scripture said to be the <hi>Ownor, Donor,</hi> or <hi>efficient conveyer</hi> of the Holy Ghost. But Gods will made the Imposition of the Apostles hand, a conditional act to qualifie the recipient to receive the Holy Ghost immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, as the Texts before cited, and many more prove.

Is it like to signifie more here than in the Doctrine of Justification, when it is so oft said that we are <hi>justified by faith?</hi> And yet faith there, is no efficient instrument conveying or giving us pardon and relative Justification, but only a necessary qualification of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient (called by Dr. <hi>Twisse, Causa dispositiva,</hi> which is part of the <hi>Materialis</hi>) upon which Gods Covenant immediately pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and justifieth the believer; so both there and here it is <hi>by</hi> or <hi>through</hi> the Act of man, as a moral qualification of the Recipient, made a condition by God.</p>

This dealing is so grosly false, that it is neither credit to his cause nor him. Would he make men think that I take him to have most authority or power, that hath the best gifts? As if the wisest and best man had right to the Crown or Church-power? If copious discourses to the contrary will not hinder such busie disputers from such inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane slanders, are they meet to be disputed with? I have over and over said that, 1. Gifts, or the best abilities. 2. And due <hi>election</hi> or <hi>approbation</hi> of the Ordainers. 3. And the peoples election and consent, all set together, do but make up the Qualification or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive disposition of the Recipient. 4.

And that besides all these, Ministerial Investiture for Orders sake, when it may be had, should introduce him into possession; yea, and the Magistrate must be judg whom he will countenance, protect or tolerate. But the case of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Investiture are necessary only where they may be had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and without crossing their end; as <hi>sacrifice was compared with mercy,</hi> and the Rest of the Sabbath compared to works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and necessity.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48440:40"/>
that they have as good an Ordination, and Investiture, as the Apostles ever made necessary to the Ministry: That is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have the Approbation of <hi>senior</hi> Pastors, and many of them of Diocesans. All that were put into any places by the Parliament, when the Bishops were down, were to have the <hi>Westminster</hi> Assemblies Approbation under their hands. And that Assembly, as called, consisted of many Diocesans, with many score grave Eminent Divines, though the Diocesans were not actually present. And a signed Approbation, and Allowance, hath the Essence of all that is of absolute necessity in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were Ordained by true Bishops. 1. All true Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are <hi>Episcopi gregis,</hi> and joyn in Ordination here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> 2 The chief Pastors of City-Churches, having Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates under them, are <hi>Episcopi Eminentes vel Praesides,</hi> such as Ordained for above Two hundred years after the Apostles. And 3. The chosen Presidents of Synods were such Bishops. But all these concurred in the Nonconformists Ordinations when the Diocesans were down. They were Ordained at, and by a Synod of Presbyters in some great Town, or City, where the Moderator, and the chief City-Pastors were part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many of them were Ordained by Diocesans.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Many Ordained, as aforesaid, were after approved by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesans, some by Imposition of Hands, and all by Word, or Writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Archbishop <hi>Vsher</hi> did in my hearing by Word and in Writing more publickly declare his opinion of such Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Ordination as valid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>though he excused not such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Diocesans from the guilt of Schism); and so did the many other Bishops, whom I formerly cited; yea, even <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> himself. And surely all this hath all that is essential to Ordination.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And we know that such a Ministry hath continued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Church and Gospel in the world since the Apostles days.</p>
            <p>But we confess, 1. That we cannot prove, that such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have still succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ded in the same Towns. 2. Nor that no one, from whom their Ordination came down from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, did pretend to have Orders, or Authority when he had none. 3. Or that no one of them in 1660. years was an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, or a Schismatick, or a Papist. 4. Or that no one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48440:41"/>
in wrong words. 5. Or that no one Ordained contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Canons, out of his own limits, or without three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or without the Presbyters. 6. Or that no Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were Ordained by several Bishops. Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> is a great Historian; when he hath proved all this of all, or any of his Clergy-friends, he hath done something more than multiply words.</p>
            <p n="45">§. 45. But on the other side, we can easily prove, and have proved, 1. That our Diocesans are not of the same <hi>species</hi> with those of old. 2 That the Apostles did not make them. I think Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> will say, that the Presbyters first made them by consent (the Children begot the Fathers). 3 And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> will defend it, that there is no certainty, that any Subject Presbyters were made by the Apostles in Scripture times. So that the very <hi>species</hi> of their Clergy hath no such succession, as distinct from ours. 4. And he that will read the Church-History, and Councils, declaring the multitude of doleful intercisions in East and West by Heresies, the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople, Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and most of the chief Seats of Bishops, having been judged Hereticks, Simoniacks, or no Bishops by General Councils; yea, <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops judged some of them Infidels, and Diabolical by the Councils of <hi>Constance Bas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, &amp;c.</hi> I say, he that knoweth this History, must know, that the Diocesans that from these derive their succession, have certainly had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and notorious intercisions.</p>
            <p n="46">§. 46. And this leads me to another part of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s work: <hi>viz.</hi> his proof that <hi>Aidan</hi> and <hi>Finan were Bishops.</hi> As if this had been a great part of his Cause. Such diverting noise is a great part of the art of deceiving. Because I had said, that <hi>Aiden</hi> and <hi>Finan</hi> were not Bishops, but Presbyters, that is, when they came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that some men of his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ius and design, would be willing to mistake me, and therefore Printed an Explication of the Words in the end of my first Answer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet.</hi> But Mr. <hi>D</hi> would have men think that I said, that they were never made and called Bishops at all; and that I read not <hi>Beda,</hi> from whom alone (near Five and Thirty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go) I took almost all that I assert concerning them. Let the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48440:41"/>
Reader see my foresaid Explication. If Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> will give us more than noise and mist about this matter:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let him prove that it was Diocesan Bishops that Ordained these <hi>Scots</hi> before they came into <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>Beda</hi> saith they were sent from those Monasteries that were ruled by Presbyters, and which would not so much as eat or communicate with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Bishops.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let him prove that any Bishops in <hi>England</hi> Consecrated hem, or made them Bishops here, when <hi>Beda</hi> tells us that they were the first in the North, and therefore had none here to Ordain them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let him prove that they were here made true Diocesan Bishops of our <hi>species:</hi> When, 1. they had no Presbyters at first under them, and therefore ruled none, and had but one Congregation; for one man can be but in one place at once. 2. Their Church in <hi>Lindisfarne</hi> was not made of stone, but of wood, covered or thatcht with reeds, and they are not said to have any other Church under them. 3. They went indeed to preach all over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but not as to a Church, but as to Heathens to convert them. 4. Let him prove that ever they took themselves to be of a distinct order from Presbyters. 5. At a Synod (<hi>Bed.</hi> c. 25.) we find no more but the King and his Son, and <hi>Hilda</hi> a woman-Abbess, and three or four of this sort of Bishops, (far below our Ordaining City-Presbyters and their Synods.)</p>
            <p>But unlearned men that value Books by interest and preconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved opinions, may think that by such talk Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> hath done some great matter.</p>
            <p n="47">§. 47. But (saith he, <hi>p.</hi> 81, 82.) <hi>Our Hypothesis obliging inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Governours to prove their title to their office, and the extent of it, from the intention of their supream Governours, does oblige all to a strict dependance on the supreme visible power, so as to leave no place for appeal concerning the practice of such Government (which as it lasts only for this life, so it ought not to admit of disputes more lasting than its practice), &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas for the poor world and Church that will be cheated at so gross a rate!</p>
            <p n="1">1. Did you not know that the grand error that Protestants charge <hi>Papists</hi> with, is the asserting of any such thing <hi>as a supreme visible power over the Church universal besides Christ.</hi> And did you think that your roteing over the name to them that deny the thing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48440:42"/>
would make a wise man change his Religion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. By your Hypothesis then no man can prove his title to his Office, who either believeth not that there is any such universal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or that knoweth not who it is (I know no Competitors but the Pope, and General Councils, unless the Patriarch of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> be one.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. And he that knoweth not the <hi>intention</hi> of this Supreme power, is still unable to prove his office.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And he that knoweth the intention of the Ordaining Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san, is never the better if he know not the intention of the Supreme. And what if the intention of the Supreme, and of the Diocesan are contrary?</p>
            <p n="5">5. But by your <hi>Hypothesis</hi> the Governours may alter the very <hi>species</hi> of the Priesthood as they please; and what ever God saith of it in his Institution or Law, it must be to us no other in kind or extent, than the Governours intend. If they say, <hi>I ordain thee to baptize, but not to teach</hi>; or to do both, but not to celebrate the Lords-Supper; or to do that, but not to pray or praise God; or not to use the Keys of the Church, our power is limited accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; Then if the Prelates make Mass-Priests, their intention is the measure of their power. Answer the <hi>Papists</hi> then that ask, Was it ever the intention of the Pope and his Prelates, that the <hi>English</hi> Bishops should disclaim the Pope, or the Mass, or reform without them as they did?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Seeing the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, by you, derive their succession from <hi>Willfred,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ittest Judg of the extent of their power, as knowing their own intentions? Nay, if they were so blind as to intend them power to pull down themselves, may they not recall it?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Did ever Protestant preach this Doctrine, <hi>That there is no appeal from the supreme Prelates, to God?</hi> O dreadful! what may men come to? and what error so great that a former may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce? Disgrace not the Church of <hi>England</hi> so much as thus to intimate, that they set up themselves so as that there is no appeal to Scripture, or God himself from them? God hath commanded Preaching, Praying, Praises, Baptism, the Lords-Supper, holy assemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if the supreme Prelates interdict and forbid all these, is there no appeal to God? I have told you how much <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Grosthead</hi> abhor'd this Doctrine, and so told Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> What absolute blind obedience to Prelates is this!</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:48440:42"/>8. And what a reason brings he, <hi>That the practice lasteth only for this life, and therefore, &amp;c</hi>? Doth any of our actions here last longer than while they are doing? Praying, Praise, Sacraments, obeying the King, doing good to the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so swearing, cursing, adultery, rebellion, atheism, blasphemy here, last only for this life. Must we therefore obey men without appeal to God, if they forbid us all duty, and command all sin?</p>
            <p n="9">9. And what did the man mean when he said, <hi>That it ought not to admit of disputes more lasting than its practice.</hi> Is this the rate of these mens wise disputations? 1. A murderers practice may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted at the Assizes when his act is past. 2. Shall not all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men in this world be examined and judged of by Christ hereafter? What? no men judged according to their works, or for any thing done in the body? 3. Or did he mean that God will justifie us for any Villany that we shall do in obedience to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Clergy? 4. Or did he think that by appealing to Gods judgment, we challenge them there to dispute with us? What to make of this mans demonstrations, little do I know.</p>
            <p n="48">§. 48. He adds, <hi>P.</hi> 82. <hi>For how fallible soever they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be in expounding Scripture, yet none can deny them to be the most certain, as well as the most competent Iudges of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That's true. And if their intentions may make Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worship, and Priesthood, what they please, it much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth us that they conceal not their intentions! But I would I knew whose intention this must be; whether the supreme Clergies, or the Ordainers; and what to do if divers mens intentions differ; and what bounds are set to their intentions; and how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sorts of Priests Doctrine or worship they may make.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You touch their fallibility tenderly, as a thing that <hi>some may conceive.</hi> But it seems let them never so falsely expound Scripture, their own <hi>intentions</hi> still shall prevail against all the word of God? I would you would answer Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Rational Account,</hi> which confuteth you.</p>
            <p n="49">§. 49. He proceeds, <hi>As certainly therefore as God hath made his Church a visible society, and constituted a visible Government in it, so certainly it is to be presumed that their Hypothesis must be false, &amp;c.</hi>

I will presently be for the Pope, though not <hi>as absolute.</hi> But why answer you not what we have said against it? particularly my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Morning-Lectures against Popery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if by a <hi>visible power in the Church,</hi> you mean not <hi>one over the Church,</hi> the <hi>Independents</hi> deny it not; while every City hath its proper Mayor, (and so every Church its Pastor) it is a <hi>visible power in the Kingdom,</hi> but not <hi>over it</hi> as a Kingdom. All the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace are <hi>visible powers in the Kingdom,</hi> but not <hi>Supreme,</hi> nor as one <hi>Aristocracy</hi> over the whole.</p>
            <p>Seeing all my dissent from Popery, and from you, is founded in my judgment against <hi>any one universal Supreme besides Christ,</hi> (Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, Aristocracy, or Democracy, I seriously intreat you to write your strongest arguments on that subject to convince me, and answer what I have said to Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and you may spare all the rest of your labour as to me. This will do all.</p>
            <p n="50">§. 50. <hi>P.</hi> 83. He adds, <hi>How can subjects preserve their due Subordination to their Superiors if they practice differently? and while they defend their practices, and pretend Divine authority for them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As the three Confessors did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and as the Apostles did, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. And as all the Bishops and Churches did for three hundred years. And as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox did under <hi>Valens, Constantine, Theodosius</hi> junior, <hi>Anasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Philippicus, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They may defend it by proving, that there is a God, who is supreme, and that there is no power but of him, and none against
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48440:43"/>
him; and that man is not God, and therefore hath no power but limited; and that to disobey usurpation, is not to disobey power; and that God must be obeyed before man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is high language, and harsh to Protestant and Christian ears, What! are you serious? Must none in <hi>Rome, Italy, Spain, France, &amp;c.</hi> practise contrary to their Governours? nor in <hi>Turky</hi> neither? Nor in <hi>China, Iapan, &amp;c</hi>? Is it unlawful to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to pray, to worship God, to be baptized, to profess our selves Christians, to speak a good word, or do a good deed, to feed our Children, or relieve our Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if Governours forbid us? This is far worse than to forbid the Scripture in a known tongue, if when we know it, we must not obey it if Governours forbid us, nor so much as <hi>plead Divine Authority</hi> for doing what Gods word commandeth us? Is Gods authority so contemptible in comparison of Prelates. Or doth it so little concern us, as that we may not so much as plead it for any practice forbidden us by superiours? This Doctrine must needs startle a Christians heart. It's far unlike Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Bilsons</hi> of subjection, and such others. If you really mean so, that whatever God commandeth us in Scripture, we must do none of it if the Governours forbid us, or else we overthrow all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, speak it out, and prove it; but Christians will abhor it. And yet this same man calleth the Martyrs Saints, when his argument makes them rebels. <hi>W. Iohnson</hi> would not have talkt at this rate.</p>
            <p n="51">§. 51. And I would fain know, whether he that first saith, that it subverteth all Government, and after nameth [supreme Church-Government] do really mean it of all, or of <hi>Church-Government</hi> only?</p>
            <p n="1">1. If of all, the man is no Papist, I will gratifie him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it; for he is no Christian. He that thinks that men must not plead Gods Authority for doing any thing different from the wills of <hi>Turkish, Iewish,</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> Governours, surely is no Christian: No, nor if he had confined this power to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Governours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if he mean it only of <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> how come they to have so absolute a power more than Civil Magistrates? May we plead Gods Authority against a King, and not against the Prelates? What proof was ever given of this? Then the Prelates is far above the Kings: Then the Prelate is an absolute Governour of the King himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48440:44"/>Let Kings and Parliaments but understand these men, and we fear not their deceits. Are they willing to give over all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and confessing Christ, and all duties of Religion, Justice, or Charity, if the <hi>Supreme Clergy</hi> will but forbid them? See I beseech you, worthy Country-men, what sort of men and Doctrine you have to do with.</p>
            <p n="52">§. 52. And why doth the man talk only against <hi>different pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?</hi> Doth he not know, that Government <hi>commandeth duty, as well as forbiddeth the contrary?</hi> Is not <hi>Omission</hi> against Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as <hi>Commission</hi>? If the King command Taxes, Military service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may we disobey, and call it <hi>Passive</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? What if the Bishops only forbid us to confess Christ, to come to Church, to Pray, to give Alms, to do any good? May we forbear, sobeit we do not the contrary? Doubtless if Gods Word and Authority may not be pleaded for any duty which God commandeth, and the Prelates forbid, neither may it be pleaded for the Omission of any Villany commanded by Prelates (no, not Inquisition, Torments, or Massacres), which God forbids. But this man hath the Gramatical skill to call <hi>Omissive obedience</hi> by the name of <hi>Passive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="53">§. 53. It's like he will next say, that <hi>I make odious suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That the supreme Church-power may command any Villanies, and forbid Christian duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I despair of getting any of these designers to tell me, which is the Supreme Universal Church-power, so as to be well understood. I never heard of any pretenders but Pope, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, and as Bishop <hi>Guning</hi> holds, the Colledg of all the Bishops in the world. And certainly Pope and Councils have set up Heresies, and decreed even the exterminating of all that will not dis-believe all their senses, and deny Bread to be Bread, and Wine to be Wine. They have decreed deposing Kings, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Subjects from their Allegiance, adoring Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what is it that yet they may not do? If they say with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, If all men deny thee, I will not</hi>; how shall I know that they say true? Doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> tell us, that Councils have erred, <hi>&amp;c</hi>?</p>
            <p n="54">
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48440:44"/>§. 54. And be not these very honest Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that affirm it <hi>irreconcilable to Government, to alledg Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of any different practices,</hi> without exception, and at the same time to Subscribe to <hi>Art.</hi> 21.19.6.18. <hi>of the sufficiency of Scripture. That the Churches of</hi> Jerusalem, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, Antioch, Rome, <hi>have erred in matters of Faith; That the Church may not Ordain any thing contrary to Gods Written Word: That General Councils may err, and have erred; and that things Ordained by them, as necessary to salvation, have neither strength, nor Authority, unless it may be declared, that they are taken out of the holy Scripture: And those are accursed that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to say, that</hi> every man may be saved by the Law, or Sect which he professeth. And why not, if he must do all that the Governours require, or nothing divers to them?</p>
            <p n="55">§. 55. My Reason forbids me to trace such a Writer as this any further. To tell men of every vain Harangue, and confident discourse, that's full of gross error, or false report, is work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of time and labour; but I will a little more open the Coar of his deceit.</p>

            <p n="1">§. 1. AS to his Method of disputing, that you may detect his fallacies, he hath got this absurd ptetence, <hi>p.</hi> 90. That <hi>there is but one sense of all Terms, which Causes oblige men to mean; and that every one ought to know, who pretends to have skill in Causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Would you have thought that ever a man should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly use such a <hi>Cothurnus</hi> among the Learned? What a man is <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>mean,</hi> is one thing, and what he <hi>doth mean</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And is there any one that knoweth what humane Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, that knoweth not that almost all words have various
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48440:45"/>
significations? Doth he not know by how good reason the Schools oblige Disputants, first to explain their Terms? And what need there is of Definition to explain them? He instanceth in the words <hi>Bishops, and the Church of England</hi>; And might have added, <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi> And doth he not know that it is the <hi>species</hi> of Bishops that we differ about? and will the general name here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain each parties sense? When we are for one sort of Bishops, and against another? And is it not such fraud as souls should not be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, to refuse wilfully to <hi>define</hi> the Episcopacy that he meaneth, and then plead that all should understand him? And why is it not as much ignorance in him not to understand me, as in me not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him, when I use distinct explication, which he obstinately refuseth?</p>
            <p>And doth not Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s case shame what he saith of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who was hardly brought to explain it, and at last denieth the very being of the Church in Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s sense? which of you was to blame to meddle with the Word till you had <hi>skill in Causes,</hi> to understand it without a Definition?</p>
            <p>And doth not Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> take it as the Introduction of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, to hold a Constitutive Regent Church-Government, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or Catholick? and so he, and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> mean not the same thing by the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> (nor Bishop <hi>Guning,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are all for an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal humane Supreme power). And who is he that hath read Dr. <hi>Challoners Credo Eccles. Cathol. Chillingworth,</hi> Bishop <hi>Mortons Grand Imposture,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> Dr. <hi>White,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sutliffe,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop <hi>Carlton,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chamier, Sadeel, Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> &amp;c. who knoweth not that the Papists and Prorestants, by the name of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> do mean se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, and that we deny the very being of any such Church as they call the <hi>Catholick</hi>? And is this the bold and happy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, that will save the Schools and World the labour of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining Terms,</hi> and <hi>foreagreeing of the sense,</hi> and put men on disputing, where the Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48440:45"/>§ 2. And as to the material fundamental difference between Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s party and us, it lyeth in these following things:
<list>
                  <item>I. We totally differ about the nature of Gods Government of man.</item>
                  <item>II. And about the use of the Holy Scripture, and Gods Laws.</item>
                  <item>III. About the nature and extent of all humane Government.</item>
                  <item>IV. About the form of moral good and evil.</item>
                  <item>V. About the essential form of the Catholick Church.</item>
                  <item>VI. About Gods ordinary means of saving Grace.</item>
                  <item>VII. About the use of Preaching.</item>
                  <item>VIII. About the duty of worshipping God in Sacred Assemblies, or the Communion of Saints.</item>
                  <item>IX. About the difference of Apostles, and the office of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</item>
                  <item>X. About the office of a Presbyter or Parish-Pastor.</item>
                  <item>XI. About the Necessaries to Ministry, Churches, Christianity, and ordinary <hi>title</hi> to Salvation.</item>
                  <item>XII. And about the final Judgment. If all these be little toller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able differences, why may not we be tollerated? If not, judg Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who they be that are intollerable, when you hear them plead against tolleration.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. I. For the first, we judg that there is a God, who is the Governour of the World by an universal Law, which is above all humane Laws or will, and that he is the fountain of all power, and there is none but what he giveth and limiteth, and that no man is above him, nor hath true authority against his Laws.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> saith, <hi>That it is irreconcileable to Government in this life, or to due subordination of subjects to superiours, to practice differently, and defend it by pretending Divine authority, and appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to writings,</hi> (Scriptures is our word by excellency so called). And so God shall be God, and be obeyed, if the Clergy please.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. II. As to the second, we suppose that the Holy Scriptures are Gods Laws, indited and recorded by the Holy Ghost to be the first obliging Rule of Faith, and holy living, which all men are to be obedient to, before and against all contrary Laws of men. But Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> as aforesaid, alloweth no such prime obligation as will warrant an appeal to the Word of God, from the visible Church-Governours that contradict it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48440:46"/>§. 5. III. And for the third, we suppose that all humane Powers are derived from God, and have no authority but what he giveth them, and are more under him and his Laws, than the Justices are under the King and his Laws, and can oblige no man against the Laws of God. But how far Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> thinks otherwise, you have heard. He saith not indeed that <hi>we must break Gods Laws, but we must not pretend them, or appeal to them against our Governours.</hi> In charity I hope he meaneth no worse, but that we must take our Rulers word or exposition, and judg nothing to be in the Scripture, contrary to their commands. And whether he give them the same dominion also over the Law of Nature, let him tell you. <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed dominion over mens saith, and the written Law of God.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. IV. And for the fourth, <hi>We take moral good to be a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moral evil or sin to be a breach of it.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> is for measuring them by the Clergies or Governours will, though Gods Law be against theirs.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. V. And for the fifth, we take the Catholick Church to have no Supreme Government but God, and our Glorified Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer God and man; and that there is no such thing as a Catholick-Church of Gods making under any other Supreme Rulers. But that as God is the invisible King of this visible world, and Kings are subordinate Supremes in their Kingdom, but neither one of them, or many conjunct in an Aristocracy, Supreme over all the earth; so Christ is the partly visible, and partly invisible supreme Ruler of the visible Church of Christians, and each Pastor is under him over his proper flock (bound to keep concord and peace); but none under him Supreme over all, whether Monarch (as the Pope) or Aristocracy, as Councils, Cardinals, or 'others. But Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> is for a visible Society, with a visible humane Supreme. But who the Supreme is, I despair of getting him to acquaint us.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. VI. And for the sixth, we suppose that God sent forth Preachers to convert the world, and turn them from darkness to light, and the power of Satan to God, and that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word preached, and that whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth shall be saved; and the word of God is powerful to this end, and sufficient to make us wise to salvation. But Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> thinks
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48440:46"/>
that it is not Preaching, but the delivering men the Sacraments, that giveth them the first true saving grace and title to Salvation. And that none in the world have this Sacrament or Covenant-title to life, but those that receive it from a hand that had an Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Bishops in his sense, of uninterrupted succession from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by the like Ordination.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. VII. Accordingly we hold that Preaching is for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of souls, and the means of saving faith and holiness. But what he thinks it is good for, I know not well; nor whether he would send the <hi>Indians</hi> the Sacraments instead of Preachers.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. VIII. We take it to be our duty, though men forbid us, to confess Christ, and assemble for Gods worship, to read and hear the Scripture, and to praise God: But he thinks we must not practice differently from the ruling Clergies will, if they forbid us, nor alledg Divine authority for it.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. IX. We suppose that the <hi>office of a Prophetical Ministry bringing new Doctrines or Laws from God,</hi> and the office of the <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> by these Laws, are greatly different, and must necessarily be distinguished. <hi>Moses</hi> was a <hi>Prophetical Mediator</hi> in <hi>Legislation,</hi> and he confirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d his Mediation by uncontrouled Miracles. The Prophets afterward came but on particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory messages. But the Priests and Levites as such were no Prophets, nor had power to make any new additions or alterations of the Law, but only to teach it the people, and as guides apply it to their several cases; so Christ and his Apostles commissioned to deliver and record all his Doctrines and Commands to the following ages, did by the Holy Ghost Prophetically deliver to the world that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Doctrine and Law, which must rule them to the end, and judg them; and thus sealed and confirmed all by a multitude of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled Miracles; but all following Bishops and Pastors are not to do the like, nor add or alter, nor are such Legislators, being not Prophets nor workers of Miracles, but only to teach and apply the Laws already recorded in Scripture, and guide their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in variable circumstances (time, place, translations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) according to the general rules of Gods Law. This is the truth.</p>
            <p>But how much Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> equals the Bishops and Apostles, and sets their words above the Scripture as to obligation, you have seen before.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:48440:47"/>§. 12. X. And as he giveth Bishops power to silence Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and forbid the Preaching of the Gospel, and Gods worship, so how little <hi>knowledg</hi> or <hi>godliness,</hi> or <hi>common sobriety</hi> or <hi>honesty,</hi> he requireth to a saving Sacramenting Priest, who must not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from, you heard before, contrary to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and many a Councils Canons. But we know that <hi>Paul</hi> had no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but only to edification. And they have no more.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. XI. We suppose that we must love, honour, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with all such as true Ministers or Churches, who have true faith and repentance, and sincere obedience to Christs Laws, and are able, godly, willing Pastors, chosen or consented to by the flocks, approved and ordained by senior Pastors, (especially in Synods where City-Pastors preside), and especially if also authorized by the Christian Magistrate.) But he thinks if they have not also suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Ordination from the Apostles by Bishops of his <hi>species,</hi> they are no Ministers, or Churches, and have no Sacrament, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant title to Salvation, but are Schismaticks, and by their Ministry sin against the Holy Ghost. And so destroyeth all certainty of title to Salvation, and of Church-communion, Ministry and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to all the Christian World.</p>
            <p n="14">§. 14 XII. Lastly, we think that men shall be judged by their keeping or breaking Gods Law, and according to what they did in the body. But he would have us obey the Supreme Clergy, and not plead Scripture or Divine authority for our different practice; because the <hi>Government that lasteth but for this life, ought not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of disputes more lasting than its practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. I conclude with a request to him to resolve me these doubts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether Prophets having immediate messages from Heaven, were not differenced from the teaching Priests and Pastors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether false Prophets were not grievously threatened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iews</hi>; and whether Christ did not command us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of false Prophets?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether he be not a false Prophet (worse than a false teacher) that falsely pretendeth to that which is proper to a Prophet?</p>

Whether the General Councils of Bishops and the Pope have not done the work proper to the Prophetical office, when they have made Laws for the unversal Church, and this as by Divine authority, and undertaken to give all the Church the sense of Scripture, which only shall be obligatory to them thereby? For it is the maker of the sense that is the maker of the Law; especially when they pretend to Infallibility, or to be secured from erring in faith, by Divine inspiration, how ignorant or bad soever they be singly. Is not this pretended <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>inspiration</hi> that of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as different from meer Teachers and Guides by Gods Law already made?</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48440:48"/>
of it wherein the disrepect of the Clergy is shewn to have been an Introductory to the Atheism of the age we live in; and that the Conformable Clergy, that is, such as would answer the design of the Church not only as to their exterior demeanor in publick so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Assemblies, but also as to the qualifications of their persons, and the conduct of their whole lives, could not prove either tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling in their Preaching or scandalous in their examples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Church is not responsible for their misdemeanors where they prove otherwise; and that the Laity are in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion obliged to the same duties with the Clergy, and therefore may make use of the advices there prescribed; or where the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our modern School-Divinity are touched, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals made for their reformation; in these things, I say, I can see no occasion of offence, but rather some preservatives against it. The only thing I suppose you aim at, is my taxing some opinions of Nonconformists, and that with as little personal reflection as I was able, which I conceived prejudicial to Church-authority; which because you seem to disown, I do not see why you should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend your self as particularly concerned, especially there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the discourse whereby you could conclude either your self or any of your moderate temper to have been intended. I will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you I intended none but such as were guilty, and with being so, I charged none particularly. But that not only the old Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Separatists of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also very many of ours now are guilty of them, is too notorious to suppose you ignorant of it. I could heartily wish that the number of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principled and more peaceable dissenters were greater than I fear it is. Nor do I see that what is there said can make it unuseful even to the persons truly concerned, that value truth more than any, however beloved party; seeing it may either let them see the ill consequence of their Principles, and their influence on that Athei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sitions; or supposing that my fears were indeed groundless of the introduction of prophaneness by the contempt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of contempt of Government by their disobedience to it, yet might it at least warn them from confining on such dangerous consequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when unwarily managed. I mean it may put them in mind of the greater momentousness of good Government and peace than many of their differences, and consequently of the great engagements incumbent on them for their preservation; and that they would therefore so take care to oppose the particular abusive Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Government, as not to bring their Government into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor to sugg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These are abuses which I believe your self would wish redressed in the Causers of our Church-divisions. But if it could not be useful to them, yet could it not be prejudicial to them, nothing being urged, either invidiously, or imperiously, and therefore no harm being done if I should prove utterly mistaken.</p>
                  <p>That you should marvel how Reviving Discipline could by me be expected from the constitution of our present Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, does seem no less marvellous to me, especially as to the exception you make against it; for if it were impossible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Discipline under a Government so far Monarchical, as to appropriate the Decretory power of the Government of many to a single person, though the execution be intrusted to many; then it would follow, that the secular Discipline under a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Monarch of any extent, were impossible also to be observed, seeing it is as impossible for any such Prince to have a particular cognizance of every particular Cause, much more of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person in his Dominions, as for a Bishop in his Diocess.

                  <p>When I said, that <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles were questioned by the Presbyterians, I never said, nor intended it concerning all (for I knew of <hi>Vedelius</hi>'s Apology for them), much less did I lay it

The new Article of Faith, inserted in the Rubrick, I do not know, nor can I now get the Books that past betwixt you at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to find what you mean.

In brief, I do not understand any of the Six Particulars menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as the Reasons that keep you off, though indeed you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve them, both because you do not undertake to determine what they might be to others, but only what they are to persons of your mind (though I confess, this may be understood as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest declining to judg of others); and because you conceive pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety the most likely means to unite us, which could not be if we imposed any thing on you against your Consciences. So that the only one may be presumed to have been thought sufficient by you to this purpose, seems to have been another, which because you intimate somewhat obscurely, I do not know whether you would

I had the most reformed people (as to sins of commission and omission) that ever I knew in <hi>England.</hi> Our custom being to have each family come by turns to us to be personally Catechised and instructed. I had full opportunity to know them all. Many score of them that came daily to Church, knew not the Essentials of Christianity and Baptism. When I came first to them, I suppose some thousands lived in gross ignorance, open impiety and prophaneness. And even at last some scores I fear lived in gross sin. Some were notorious drunkards, raging weekly twice or thrice in the open streets. Some quieter drunkards. Many profane Swearers. Too many railers, fighters, slanderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Three or four Apostate-Infidels. The Parishes about me were far worse. A great part of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48440:52"/>
the people know not who Christ is, nor what he doth, as the Saviour of the world, nor understand one of many Articles of the Creed, or Petitions of the Lords Prayer; much less do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing like Christians for Children or Servants in their Families.</p>
                  <p>The Diocess that I now live in, hath above 1100 Parishes, some have half as many; some Parishes have 3000, some 10000 People. in <hi>London</hi> some 20000, 30000, and the Country smaller Parishes usually about 400, 500, or 1000. I do warrantably conjecture that in the Diocess where I now live, there may be about 50000 souls that by Christs Law should be admonished and disciplined for gross sin. And about 80000, or 100000 that are grosly ignorant of Christianity. It's ten to one (expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells it me) that five Conventions will scarce serve with each obstinate sinner, to bring the work to the issue of a due Excommunication or Absolution. Some parts of the Diocess that I am in, are about 120 miles from other parts. The Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan then that doth all this himself, (but there is no such) if he sit half the year, must either speak to 10000, or 20000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at once, or in a few minutes, or else he must let all the rest lye and rot in their sins, till he hath done with the first. And indeed (I have tried it) a sober Pastoral course of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and discipline with each one, will take up so much time, that seven years are not enough for him to go over all this Diocess if he did as much in a month as ever I knew a Bishop do in his life, except against Godly Nonconformists, or Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Dissenters.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48440:52"/>
one Bishop be sufficient for all this? And what need we more than common experience? The work is every where undone. Lay the blame where you will, not one common gross sinner of a thousand is disciplin'd or judged as in question. That which can be done, and should be done, some one good Bishop will do But none that ever I knew did ever see the face, and speak to one of a thousand gross sinners of his Diocess, (unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as he preached to one or few Congregations) nor do I know any that take it for their work, (if they could do it), but leave it to the Lay-Chancellor as his part.</p>
                  <p>If you say that Excommunication must not be on many: I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Bishops trying and conviction of gross sinners is first for their Repentance, and not their Excommunication, except in case of the last obstinacy, which cannot be foreknown till tried.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Christ would not have such Discipline at all, there needs no Bishop to do it. If he would, when twenty drunkards, fornicators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are notoriously guilty, is it his will that one of these only be admonished, convinced, excommunicated, and all the rest let alone that are equally guilty? Sure the Law of God doth not so distinguish, but say of all alike, <hi>If any called a brother be a fornicator, &amp;c.</hi> And will such partiality either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form men, or honour Religion, or rather make it a scorn, and make him that is singled out, hate the partial Prosecutor.</p>
                  <p>If you say it's long of Churchwardens that accuse not men: I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And it will be so, while the thing is unfeasable; who will be hated to do no good?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some Churchwardens of late to some Articles have presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Parish without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exception. And so no man heard of it any more.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And whether the Bishop may delegate his Office, or do his work <hi>per alios,</hi> would be no controversie if Scripture were our Rule, or it were known what a Pastors office is. If he may delegate it, either to a Layman in <hi>sensu composito,</hi> or to a Clergy man: If to a Layman, than a Layman and a Clergy-man are all one. For there is nothing but the work to define the authority and obligation by, which constituteth the Office. A Bishop is one authorized and obliged to do the work of a Bishop,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48440:53"/>
and so is a Layman too by this supposition. If to a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, either to one of the same order and office with the Bishop, or of another. If of the same (before or now made so) <hi>datur quaesitum,</hi> then he is not the sole Bishop. If of another <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> then another Clergy man is not another; For he that is Authorized to the same work, is of the same Office.</p>
                  <p>If you say that he may not delegate the whole work, <hi>de specie,</hi> but a part; I ask which part? either the Essential part, or but an Integral common part. If the former? 1 Either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o such as God in Scripture by office authorizeth to that part, or not. If the former, then the Bishop cometh too late to that which God hath done already. And then that is no proper work of Bishops which God hath made common to another Office. If the later, than a man may make new Priestly O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And if a Bishop be but one that may appoint others to do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48440:53"/>
the Episcopal work, then 1. Why is not every King a Bishop, for he may appoint men to do a Bishops work? And why is he not also a Physician, Musician, Pilot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because he may do the like by them? 2. And then the Bishop appointed by the King, is no more a Bishop indeed than one appointed by a Bishop is.</p>
                  <p>But this delegation that I speak against, is a smaller sin than such men choose. To depute others to exercise Discipline, whom God appointed not <hi>de specie</hi> thereto, is but Sacriledg and Usurpation, (by alienating it from the true office, and setting up a false one): But yet the thing might some how be done, if any were to do it. But the almost total deposition and destruction of the Discipline it self, and letting none do it, by pretending the sole authority of doing it, is another kind of sin.</p>
                  <p>Now to your answer from the similitude of Civil Monarchs, I reply, It is no wonder if we never agree about Church-offices, if we no better agree of the general nature of them, and their work. Of which if you will please to read a sheet or two which I wrote the last year to <hi>Ludov. Molinaeus,</hi> of the difference of Magistracy, and Church-power, and also read the Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> Considerations, you will excuse me for here passing by what is there said.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The standing of the Magistrates Office is by the Law of Nature, which therefore alloweth variety and mutations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Orders, as there is cause. But the standing of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is by Supernatural Institution. Our Book of Ordination saith there are three Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore man may not alter them, or make more of that same kind.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Kingly power requireth not <hi>ad dispositionem materiae,</hi> such Personal ability as the Pastoral-office doth. A child may be a King, and it may serve turn if he be but the head of power, and give others commission to do all the rest of the Governing work. But it is not so with a Judg, a Physician, an Orator, or a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; who is not <hi>subjectum capax</hi> of the essence of the office, without personal aptitude.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. God hath described the Bishops office in Scripture as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Teaching, Priestly, (or about Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Sacraments) and ruling; as under Christs Prophetical, Priestly and Kingly Office. And he hath no where made one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48440:54"/>
more proper to a Bishop than another; nor said this is Essential, and that is but Integral. Therefore the Bishop may as well allow a Layman to administer the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as one not appointed to it by God, to Rule by the Keys.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Bishops Pastoral Rule is only by Gods word upon the Conscience (as Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> of <hi>Obed.</hi> sheweth at large, and all Protestants agree), and not by any mulcts or corporal force. If he use the sword, or constraint, it is not as a Bishop, but as a Magistrate. But the Kings is by the sword. And will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that because the King may appoint another to apprehend men, and carry them to prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that therefore a Bishop appointed by God to Preach, Worship and Rule, and therein to draw the Impenitent to Repentance by patient exhortations, and reproofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may commit this to another, never appointed to it of God?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Either it is the Bishops work (as was said) that is delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, or some other. If properly his own, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he maketh more Bishops, (and that's all we plead for), or else a Presbyter or Layman may do a Bishops proper work. And then what need of a Bishop (to pass by the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.)</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. But my chief answer to you is, the King as Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate doth appoint and rule by others that are truly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: They have every one a Judicial power in their several places under him, even every Justice of Peace. But you suppose the Bishop to set up no Bishops, nor no Church-Governours under him at all. A King can rule a Kingdom by Supremo Judgment, when he hath hundreds of Judges under him who do it by his authority. And if this had been all our dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Patriarch or Archbishop can rule a thousand Churches by a thousand Inferior Bishops, or Church-rulers, you had said something? But doth it follow that your Church Monarch can over-see them all himself without any sub-oversees, or rule them (by Gods word on the Conscience) without any sub-rulers? You appropriate the Decretory Power to your Monarch; and communicate only the executive. Hold to that. The whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is but <hi>Legislatio &amp; Iudicium</hi>; Legislation now we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with, (yet our Bishops allow it to the Presbyters in Convocation, for they take Canons to be Church-Laws.) It is a lower power that is denied to them, that they grant the higher
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48440:54"/>
to. Bare execution is no Government. A Hangman is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. A Governour may also be Executioner, but a meer Executioner is no Governour. The People are Executioners of Excommunications, while they withdraw from the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and with such do not eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And the Parish-Priest is an Executioner, while he (as a Cryer) proclaimeth or readeth the Chancellors Excommunication in the Church, and when he denieth the Sacrament to those that he is bid deny it to. I grant you that this is Communicated. But it is the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial power it self which I have been proving the Bishop uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Exploration is part of the Judicial work. I know you include not that in execution (which follows it) If you did, it would be a sad office for a Bishop to sentence all men, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens trial and word. As if the Bishop must Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all that some body else saith he must Excommunicate. This turneth Decreeing into a Hangman-like Execution.</p>
                  <p>And the nature of the cause forbiddeth it. No man is to be Excommunicate for any other crime as such, but for Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in some crime; nor to be absolved after, but upon Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now if it were, but whether a man <hi>de facto</hi> have been drunk, or fornicated, or perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it were hard judging sententially meerly on trust from others; but yet perhaps that might sometimes be done: But when the case is, Whether the man be penitent, Personal trial is necessary to a Rational and Ecclesiastical administration of the sentence. I conclude therefore, that as a King can judg by many hundred Judges, and a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral command an Army by many hundred Commanders, but not without any one by himself alone, having Executioners under him. So is it here.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. And I pray you note one other difference: In the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it is not one subject of an hundred, or many hundreds, that hath Law suits with others once in a year, or seven years, or his life. Nor one of some hundreds (where I have lived) that findeth the Magistrate work as Criminal. And in this we differ even from the Physician, who in a City hath not one of many that is sick, but we are all of a sinning corrupt dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Pastor hath few of his flock that need not some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal applications in one degree or other. And even as to gross sins lived in, and ignorance or heresie against the very essence of Christianity, it is a good Parish where a <hi>considerable</hi> part of it are not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48440:55"/>
guilty; so that it is easier for one Justice of Peace to send two or three thieves in a year to a Gaol, and bind two or three to the good behaviour, than for one Bishop to admonish, exhort, convince and judg 10000 impenitent sinners in a little time, and hear all the Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you should have said, that the Parish Priest is to reprove, exhort, convince them first, till he prove them impenitent, and he is to instruct the ignorant, Infidels and Hereticks: I answer, 1. That is more than an executive power. 2. We desire no more at all from Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or any, and know no other Episcopal power over the people, but thus <hi>personally to convince men, and declare to the Congregation upon proof, the fitness or unfitnss of men for their Communion, by penitence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or impenitence.</hi> But this is it that the Ministers are hindred from, or denied. They have no power to speak with any one ignorant, Heretical, Infidel, or scandalous sinner in the Parish, but such as are willing. And few of the guilty are willing. They will neither come to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor suffer him to come to them, but shut their doors on him if they know that he cometh on such a work, or else they will not be within. Or if they be, will tell him, that they will not answer him. When I came first to <hi>Kederminster,</hi> the rabble multitude curst me in the streets, and rose up against me, but for saying, That Infants Originally have that sin and misery which needs a Saviour; yet such (if they scorn to speak with us) must be our Communicants for want of Pastoral power. There is no Law or penalty that I ever knew of, to constrain any to come to us, receive us, hear us, or answer us, if we had never so much cause to question them of, or fortifie them against infidelity, heresie, ignorance, or wicked lives. And if any other accuse them to us (as few will) we must not judg them without trial.</p>
                  <p>It may be you will say. Would you have them constrained by force to speak with the Pastor, or give him any account of their faith, life, or knowledg, besides coming with others into the Church? I answer, No, we would have no force, as we have none. But then we would not be forced our selves by the Church-Lords and Monarchs to take our selves for the Pastors of such as refuse our Pastoral office, and to give the Sacrament, and all priviledges of Church-Communion, to every one in the Parish, who upon just suspicion of gross scandal, heresie, infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48440:55"/>
or ignorance, obstinately refuseth to speak to us, and give us any account, or to be tried. I that have yearly tried my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by Personal Conference, know that thousands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands among us know not (and therefore believe not) whether Christ be God or man, or Angel, or what; nor who the Holy Ghost is, or why Christ died, rose; nor scarce any supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally revealed article of the Christian faith. And that many that understand them, believe them not. And I desire no Church-power, but not to take those, 1. For Christians; 2. And for my especial Christian flock, 1. Who are no Christians; 2. Who themselves refuse it. Without their consent the Minister is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on them. They a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e forced by the sword to say that they are Christians, and to come to Church and Communicate. The old Christian Profession was, <hi>I will be a Christian, and hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, though I go to prison or death for it.</hi> The Prelatical Christian Profession is, <hi>I will rather be a Christian and Communicate, than I will lye in Gaol, and have all my Estate confiscate.</hi> Seeing then that we have not the due power of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor to deny our Office-administrations in Sacraments to those that refuse us in the other parts aforesaid, we are utterly disabled from so much as preparing men for the Bishops, or Chancellors Examination.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if it were otherwise, that must not satisfie the Church-Monarch, who must judg himself, and therefore must hear by himself.</p>
                  <p>But you tell me, <hi>It is plainly against experience in Ecclesiasticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It's hard then to know any thing. For I dispute all this while, as if the question were, Whether men in <hi>England</hi> speak <hi>English.</hi> And if I herein err, I am uncurable, and therefore I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to despair of me. You say, <hi>The greatness of no City was thought sufficient to multiply Bishops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Gods Institution was, that every Church have a Bishop, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A particular Church then was, <hi>A Society of Neighbour-Christians, combined for Personal Communion in Gods Worship, and holy living, consisting of Pastor and flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For 250 years I think, you cannot prove that any one Bishop in the world, save at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Romr,</hi> had more such Congregations and Altars than one; nor these for a long time after the Apostles; nor in many Churches of ome hundred years longer.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48440:56"/>4. At <hi>Antioch</hi> (the third Patriarchate) <hi>Ignatius</hi> professeth <hi>that every Church had one Altar, and one Bishop with his Presbyters and Deacons, fellow-servants.</hi> And that in this one Church the Bishop must enquire of all by name, even Servant-men and Maids, and see that they absented not themselves from the Church. Why is not <hi>Ignatius</hi> confuted if he erred? Vid. <hi>Mede</hi> on the Point.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> by not multiplying <hi>Bishops</hi> as Churches or Converts needed it, began the grand sin and calamity which hath undone us, and therefore are not to be our Pattern. <hi>Orbis major est urbe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Were Bishops necessarily to be distributed by Cities, the Empires that have few, or no Cities, must have few, or no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; and an Emperor might, <hi>aliud ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This was above Two hundred and Fifty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christs Birth. 2. I never took all the impotent persons,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48440:56"/>
poor, and Widows in the Church, to be Clergy-men, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-women. <hi>Cornelius</hi> his account is, <hi>that there are Six and Forty Presbyters, Seven Deacons, Seven Sub-Deacons, Two and Forty Acolytes, Two and Fifty Exorcists, and Readers, with Porters, Widows, and impotent persons, above One thousand and Fifty souls,</hi> considering, 1. How their Meetings were then obscure, and small, in Houses (as the tolerated Churches in <hi>London</hi>). And in so vast a City, in how many distant places. Besides the sub-ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicarian Assemblies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And how many Presbyters used still to be with the Bishop in the same Assembly? 5. And that here are in all but Seven Deacons. 6. And that many then were Presbyters that used not to Preach, but for privater over-sight, and as the Bishops Assessors. 7. And that the poorer sort most commonly received the Gospel. 8. And that none of these, but the Six and Forty Presbyters, had any power in the Discipline. 9. And that by all this reckoning, the whole Church maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, besides the Officers, near a thousand poor; we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conjecture, that the whole Church of that Bishop was not bigger than some one <hi>London</hi>-Parish (<hi>Stepney, Giles, Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegate, Martins,</hi> &amp;c.) where are about Fifty thousand souls. 10. And when none were Christians but persecuted Volunteers, they were the holiest, and best of men; and I have tryed, that Six hundred such make less work for Discipline, than Ten of the Rabble that are driven into our Churches, and choose them rather than the Goal.</p>
                  <p>But when all's done, Two Cities under the power of great temptation, are not to be our Rule against Gods Word, and the state of all other Churches in the world, and undeniable experience.</p>
                  <p>It's true that you say, that to erect another Altar was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Schism; that is, <hi>Altare contra altare</hi>; because when the Phrase came up, no Church had more than one Altar.</p>
                  <p>Your Instances intimated of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> I believe not; and can give you (had I liberty) a Volume of proof from Antiquity, that for Two hundred and Fifty years, if not much longer, <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Rule was true, that every Church had one Altar, and one Bishop, at least, except the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vlphilas</hi> was but an <hi>Arrian</hi> Bishop, of a few <hi>Goths</hi> newly turned <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the first that translated the Scriptures into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48440:57"/>
the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue; so that no Churches among them had the Scripture, till after his translating; and these few were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently persecuted to rhe death by <hi>Athanarichus (ut socrat. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 32.) You may call these few, a Kingdom, if you please.</p>
                  <p>How few of the <hi>Indians</hi> were converted when <hi>Frumentius</hi> (not <hi>Aedesius,</hi> as you say) was made their Bishop, it's easie to gather by the History.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> used to have each a Bishop, and he lived in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as near them as he durst, as not being tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated usually in their Land. And as few, it's like, <hi>Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the work of these B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shops was to ordain Presbyters, who had the power of the Keys, <hi>&amp; exceptae Ordinatione,</hi> did all that Bishops did, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith. So that then a Diocess had not one sole Church-Governour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where you gather that yet Discipline was not dissolved: I answer:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In all this you leave out a matter of chief consideration: <hi>viz.</hi> That all the Presbyters then were assistants in Discipline, and had a true Church-Government over the people, which now they have not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's strange that we that have eyes and ears must be sent to the <hi>Indians</hi> and ancient History, to know whether one Bishop can hear, and try, and admonish so many thousands at once, as we see by experience are those Objects of Discipline which the Scripture describeth, and when we see that it is not done.</p>
                  <p>And after all this, we have talk't but of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, Nonconformists doubt not to prove, that the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san frame, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And instead of each of these, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up a new <hi>species</hi> of man's invention, wholly different, and inconsistent.</p>

                  <p>Your information about Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and the word, <hi>Vse of all things, &amp;c.</hi> is as the rest, to conquer our sense and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. 1. The words in the Act are most plain, and Bishop <hi>Sanderson de Iuram,</hi> concludeth, That Oaths (and Covenants) must be taken in the plain and proper sense. 2. It is notorious, that after the Lords in a <hi>Proviso</hi> of another Act, would have so expounded the Act of Uniformity, (that it is meant but of <hi>consent to use, &amp;c</hi>) and the Commons rejected it as intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and upon a meeting of both Houses satisfied the Lords by their Reasons, who acquiesced in the rejection of that Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Sir, it is much more (especially about Separation) which your lines invite me to say, and the cause requireth; but I fear I have wronged you by prolixity already; and much more by my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of speech, which is from my inclination to speak of things as they are, and is truly joined with a very great respect and honour of your self, commanded by your excellent Book, and judicious peaceable stile and temper.

                  <head>For the Worthy and much Honoured Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwell,</hi> at <hi>Trinity Colledg</hi> near <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                     <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Thankfully received yours of 28 Pages, from the hand of Mr. <hi>Teate.</hi> That I may not be again guilty of such hastiness in writing as you take notice of, I premise this to acquaint you, That your warning, with my backwardness to such work, and the multitude of Employments in which I am pre-engaged, shall keep me a while from that error, and you from the trouble. And if I take not your concluding counsel to avoid both time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and partiality in this Cause, I shall notoriously contradict mine own interest. I have studied the point as diligently as I could, almost thirty years longer than you have lived in the world, (if the bearer of yours give me a true account of your age.) And yet I truly think it very possible that one of such admirable parts and diligence as your self, (evident in your great reading and accurate stile) may know much more in half that time. But if I can know my own thoughts, I have studied with a desire whatever it cost me, to know the truth. I dare not say, (<hi>Impartially</hi>) altogether. For I have flesh and blood, and who can choose but have a <hi>little partiality</hi> for that way which all his worldly interest pleadeth for? Could I have proved Conformity lawful (not to have contained a Covenant against the Church-form, Church-offices, and Church-discipline of Christs Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for upholding that Church Usurpation and Tyranny which began and still continueth the Divisions of the Christian World; nor the deliberate <hi>Ministerial owning</hi> of the Perjury of many thousands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) I need not have undergone the common <hi>scorn and hatred</hi> that I have born, nor to have been deprived of all <hi>Ministerial maintenance,</hi> and <hi>silenced for eleven years</hi> of that part of my life, which should have been most serviceable (to add no more); my Reputation with those on the other extreme, I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48440:58"/>
did voluntarily cast away, by opposing them (when I could as easily have kept it as most I know) lest it should be any snare or tempting interest to me. I assure you,<note place="margin">This was written long ago.</note> That I have not wanted bread, is a thing that I owe to thanks to any party for, either <hi>Prelatists, Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independents, &amp;c.</hi> I confess I have read what the <hi>Antiprelatists</hi> say, such as <hi>Beza, Gerson, Bucer, Didoclav. Parker, Bains, Iacob Blondel, Salmasius, &amp;c.</hi> But I have more diligently studied, since I was twenty years of age, the chiefest on the other side, <hi>Saravia, Bilson, Downham, Hooker, Burges, Covel, Bridg, Bancroft, VVhitgift, Spalatensis,</hi> and since <hi>Petavius, Hammond,</hi> and multitudes more. And I have now, as you desired, read over <hi>all yours,</hi> that I might see the end, before I past my judgment on the beginning. But our apprehensions are various, as our preconceptions are; I find that we are all forestalled, and readiest to learn of our selves, who are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the happiest Teachers of our selves. What we have first laid in, is usually made the standard of all that followeth; and all must be reduced into a due Conformity and subserviency to our former sentiments. You have shewed great learning, ingenuity and piety, and in a very fluent stile expressed what was in your mind; and made me remember what one answereth him that said, <hi>Hooker</hi> was yet unanswered, <hi>viz.</hi> Reduce what you would have answered, to Argument, and it will soon be done. I find, that it had been much better to have said nothing, than to have begun in such a manner of dispute, in which the further we go, the less we understand one another, and make each other mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, instead of edification: For plainly I find, that (though much may be learned out of so rare a discourse as you have vouchsafed me, yet) it doth very little at all to any dispatch of our pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt controversie, but might easily deceive me by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, if I would forget what it is that I dispute about: For I perceive, 1. That we agree not in our sense of the <hi>terms</hi> which we make use of: And from thence you infer some great and dangerous errors in my judgment. 2. We agree least of all in common and obvious matters of <hi>fact,</hi> which are before our eyes, and the things of which I have had almost an Ages experience. 3. I find, that a very great part, if not the far greatest of all your discourse, is written upon a mis-understanding of my <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>judgment.</hi> And if one were to publish such kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, how tiresome would it be to the Reader, should I set down
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48440:59"/>
a particular account of all your passages that are besides the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and all that proceed from such misunderstanding? I speak not by way of blaming you; for we are not competent Judges of other mens actions, till we know the Reasons of them: that may be laudable, which crosseth our desires. Perhaps you had Reasons to pass by the chief part of my explications of my sense, and of the matter of fact, and say nothing to them: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you had Reasons when I had told you our Country-distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Acts of Government, into Legislative, and Judicial, and Executive, to make use still of the Equivocal word <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and to understand by it (as you saw cause) only the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative power, and to leave out the <hi>Iudicial,</hi> which was all that I controverted: It may be you had Reason, when I talk of a single, or Parochial Church, to say, I supposed in it but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Pastor: You are not accountable to me for such errors, be they never so causless in my opinion. It may be you had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to write against the old Nonconformists that are in another world; and to think, that for the Names sake it concerned us: and to plead, that Conformity to all the present Covenants, and Oaths, and Subscriptions, is necessary, because you could wish the Discipline more Regular, as if we were to Subscribe to what is in your wishes. It may be you had Reason to suppose the Parish-Priests to have the <hi>Government of the People,</hi> even the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Church-Keys</hi> (and yet sometimes to unsay it again), without answering my Proof to the contrary, when I take it for the chief supposition that causeth my Nonconformity: And to prove copiously, that a Bishop may govern a Diocess when he hath a Governor under him in every Parish, without answering my Proofs, that he hath no such under him, but hath, <hi>quantum in se,</hi> half degraded the Presbyters. And when I said, that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is not possible under such Diocesans as are with us, you might have Reason that I know not of, to leave out, <hi>as are with us,</hi> and to prove it possible with other Diocesans that have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Presbyters under them. Perhaps you had Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the <hi>Convincing, Perswasive, Declarative Power of a Iudg,</hi> with that of a private man, and thence to raise the supposition which you raise. Perhaps you know some <hi>Medium</hi> between cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral force, and Mulcts, proper to the Magistrate, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative perswasion, and prevailing on the Conscience by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Gods Laws, though I know none: And you were not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48440:59"/>
bound to teach me what you know. Perhaps you had Reason to think that I may Subscribe, That no man in Three Kingdoms that hath Vowed it, is bound to endeavour to alter our Church-Government by Lay-Chancellors, because you defend it not, but wish it altered: And it may be you have Reasons unknown to me, that none but Irregular endeavours are there disclaimed, and that our Lawgivers spake universally, and would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted particularly, with many such like. But <hi>abscondita &amp; quae supra nos, nihil ad nos</hi>—What I may not pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, I will not presume to censure, but only say, That I am uncapable of being informed by them. This I am satisfied of, that my Schismatical Principles take into Church-Communion such as you, and those that are in knowledg below, not only you, but me, even the weakest true Christians But upon your Catholick terms, no man of my <hi>measure</hi> of knowledg must be tolerated to be a Preacher, or a Christian in Church-Communion, nor live at least out of Goal, or some such penalty. And if one at <hi>Muscovy</hi> can get a Courtier to make him a Bishop, he and such other are the Church (which why you still put it in the feminine Gender when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of Masculine Court-Bishops, I know not.) And if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to do that which we account the most inhumane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, if he think it to be but the renunciation of an unlawful Oath, as I understand you, we are Schismaticks if we obey him not. Whether in cases of commanded blasphemy, and all other crimes, we must accordingly renounce our understandings, I know not. Though there be somewhat of Irony in all this, there is nothing but what is consistent with the high estimation of your extraordinary worth. And I must say, that our different Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, I doubt not, is a great cause of our different sentiments. Had I never been a Pastor, nor lived out of a Colledg, (and had met with such a taking Orator) I might have thought as you do. And had you converst with as many Country-people as I have done, and such, I think you would have thought as I do. My great deceiver is Sense and Experience. I am inclined to look near me, in judging of present matters of fact: As if our Controversie were, Whether one Schoolmaster can govern a thousand Schools without any but Monitors under him, and Teachers that have no Government. And your way is from old Histories, to prove that some body did so 1400 years ago, or a thousand, in some places of the world, if stories deceive us
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48440:60"/>
not; and therefore it may be so now. Though none of those excellent men do it, who are put into the places of the silenced Schismatical Ministers, nor none of the excellent Bishops that are over us, who are so good that one of them no doubt would do it, were it possible. But seriously I take it for a great mercy of God, that honest Christians of little learning have that <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> in the <hi>Practicals</hi> of Religion, which the <hi>studied</hi> accurate plausible Orations of contradictors cannot overcome, though they are not so well skill'd at the same weapons as to answer them. <hi>Sir,</hi> pardon and accept this short and thankful acknowledgment, that I have received your Learned Tractate, till I take the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (if I so long live) to return you an answer suitable to your discourse and expectations.

                  <p>SInce your Speech with me, I have thought again of what you insisted on, and find it consist of these four Points: 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I charge you with Popery, or at least, do not vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate you when so accused. 2. Your reasons against answering <hi>Voetius</hi> and me. 3. Your desire to know my terms of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. 4. Your perswading me to give over Preaching. Lest words
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48440:60"/>
be mis-understood, or forgotten, I send you my Answer to each of these.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I take it to be none of my business, to tell what Religion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are of, till I am called to it: And then I take my self bound to judg every man what he professeth to be, till I can disprove it. 2. I distinguish the Name (<hi>e. g.</hi> of Protestant, or Papist) from the Thing. Accordingly, 1. I am sure you deny your self to be a Papist, and I believe you. 2. What you mean by the word, I refer all men that talk of it to your Books, which are fitter to tell your mind than I am, that know no mans heart: <hi>Grotius</hi> took a Papist to be one that flattered Popes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all to be just which they said and did, and not one that consented to all the General Councils. 3. You shall chuse what Name I shall call you by: If it be <hi>Protestant,</hi> far be it from me to deny it you; But as your Book publisheth your judgment to the world, you will give me leave to tell men what is in it: And to profess my self, that I am no <hi>such Protestant,</hi> as takes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true Church of uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which gave our Bishops their Office and Power; and that all the Reformed that have not Diocesan Bishops, are no Churches, no Ministers, have no Sacraments, no pardon of sin, or hope of salvation, by promise, and known ordinary grounds, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath. Yea, that they sin against the Holy Ghost: Yea, and that this is the case of the Episcopal Protestants, that have not had an uninterrupted succession of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Ordination; and that the <hi>French</hi> Protestants were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turn Papists, than to continue such Protestants as they are. I take all this for your judgment: But I vindicate you so far as to say, that you oft contradict your self, and so possibly may yet come off. If you should say, that neither such Protestants, nor Papists, have Sacraments, and part in the Covenant of grace, pardon, and salvation, you would leave so few for Heaven, and so many for Hell, as I will not imagine you to be guilty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As to the Second, I must tell all, that I take it but for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, to call us to answer the same things again, which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered so long ago, and have no reply from Papists, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And I doubt not, but you know that it is the main charge which the Papists assault the Reformed Churches with, and put their chief trust in, which you also bring against them: And
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48440:61"/>
we still believe, that <hi>Iansenius</hi> did it much stronglier than you; and much more than yours, is by <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tius</hi> against him fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; and your denial moveth us not.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To satisfie your Third demand, I remember a small Script, which I published 1659, or 1660, and therewith send it you; by which (with what I read to you) you may conjecture at my terms, specially if you joyn my <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Cathol. Theologie,</hi> I take it for granted, that it will not satisfie you. But pardon my freedom for saying that, while I perceive your Confidence ordinarily to go quite beyond your Proofs; and while my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples call me to love more as brethren, than yours do, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me not to justifie persecution of men better than my self, I shall think never the worse of them for that.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. As to your judgment for my ceasing to Preach, I dare not obey it: I think if I say, these men forbid me, God will not take it for an excuse, after such charges as Scripture lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down, and such promises as in Ordination I made, and such necessity of souls as I am sure of, and such encouragements as God hath given me. I fear hearing, <hi>Thou slothful servant, &amp;c.</hi> as much as the guilt of other heinous sins: I have not lived idly; and if I silence my self, I invite God by death to silence me, and judg me, as obeying man against him. I am past doubt, that Satan and my flesh give me the same counsel as you do. I have abundant arguments for my Preaching, which I never heard a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOurs of <hi>Oct.</hi> 16<hi>th</hi> I received, <hi>Nov.</hi> 11<hi>th,</hi> which intimateth the Second Edition of your Letters, which I hear not of; your last Letter to me, signifying your purpose to publish your long Letter from <hi>Ireland</hi> to me, caused me to Print an old Treatise of Episcopacy, which I had cast by, and now send you as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that Letter. I thank you for your admonition, and desire of my repentance: It shall make me, if I can, search yet more diligently; but I find no probability of being able; the like lamentations of my sin, and wrong to the Church, I have long had from <hi>Papists, Antinomians, Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> and some <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Seekers</hi>; and I despair of satisfying them; nor can I be of all their minds: and I find here but one Argument to draw me to yours, <hi>(viz)</hi> my taking the Oath of Canonical obedience. And 1. You know not that I took it: Many Ordained men did not. To tell you the truth, I entered so rawly, that though I well remember my Subscription, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that I took that Oath: I remember I took it not for my Ordination, but at the same time taking a License for a School, some Oath the Register suddenly thrust on me, and I remember not what it was (which was, and is my sin). 2. If I took it, surely I never intended to bind my self to any but my true Ordinary. And when he is dead and the very Order for near Twenty years publickly (though culpably) put down, and none existent where I lived, I never saw it proved, that I am sworn to all that after are set up over others, by the King, without the Clergies, or Peoples choice, or consent, contrary to the Judgment of the Church for One thousand years, and that without, and against my own consent: And that he that swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth obedience to his present Ordinary, is thereby sworn, though he never dream't of it to all that ever shall succeed him, what changes soever be made, and though judging them Usurpers, I renounce them. If it be said, that I virtually consent by the Convocation; I deny it, nor did the City of <hi>London</hi> consent;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48440:62"/>
for they had not one chosen Clerk there. They chose Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> and me, and we were both refused by the Bishop, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Dignitaries of the City admitted. What if I had sworn obedience in 1639. to the Presbytery in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or 1649. in <hi>England</hi>; and after they are put down, and I find them to be an unlawful power, and they are restored again, doth my first Oath bind me to the latter stock against my consent? 3. The <hi>English</hi> Ecclesiastical Law-Books, which I have read, do tell me, that the Chancellor, Official, Commissary, Archdeacons, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Iudex Ordinarius</hi> is my Ordinary (whatever you say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it): And some Bishops themselves have judged the Lay-Chancellors Judgment, by the use of the Keys, to be a great sin. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether then an ignorant Oath to obey such U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers, repented of, do bind to obey them still? What if in <hi>France</hi> I had sworn obedience to their Bishops, and after see that it was an unlawful Oath, <hi>quod materiam,</hi> am I bound by it till death? 4. I swore to obey them but in <hi>licitis &amp; honestis.</hi> And I do not know that ever I therein disobeyed those that I sware to; no, nor the latter reduced stock: Either I have proved the degenerate sort, described in this Treatise, to be a heinously sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful depravation of the Church, and its Government, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury against Christ, by deposing his Church Form, Discipline, and Officers, or not: if not, evince it, and I will thank you; if yea, to comply with such sin, or in any calling to forbear detecting it by writing, is an Omission which is not <hi>licitum vel honestum.</hi> An unlawful Oath against a thing indifferent, will not bind me, if the King do but command that indifferent thing; much less will an ignorant Oath to obey Church-Usurpers, and corrupters, oblige me against Christs commands. Nor do I think it <hi>licitum vel honestum,</hi> to renounce my Ministry, sacrilegiously, and perfidiously break my Ordination-Vow to God, and forbear Preaching Christs Gospel to needy souls, because they forbid me.</p>
                  <p>In a word, Sir, I unfeignedly thank you for your desire to save me from dying in sin. I have great reason to make it my greatest care. Constant pain and languor, call to me, neither to dissemble, nor delay: When I cannot know my own heart so well as you do, I may come to believe you, that it is unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pride. Till then I am past doubt, that could any abasement, any labour, any cost, help me to know that you are in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48440:62"/>
right, and I in the wrong, I would most joyfully undertake it: But such warnings as your's awaken my Conscience, so that I dare not die in the guilt of active, or omissive compliance with those men, 1. Whose degenerate state I confidently judg to be the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Malady of the Church, and destructive to a right Church-state, Church-Officers and Government. 2. Whose Canons of Government are such as they are. 3. Who have since I had any understanding, done that against serious godliness in <hi>England</hi> which they did, and these (near) Twenty years, done what they have done, procuring the silencing, and outward ruin of about Two thousand such Ministers of Christ, as I know to have been the most pious, faithful, and successful in true Ministerial work, of any that ever I could know; and such as I am fully perswaded no Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven have Two thousand better. And yours, or other mens accusations, or contrary judgment, cannot make me ignorant of this, which experience, and great acquaintance have told me. 4. And Church-History, which tells me what such have done in former Ages, increase my fear of dying in the guilt of participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their sin. I know of no other Motives that I have. The sum of my request to you is; That instead of telling me what the Pope, or any Usurper may say, that I should <hi>be humble and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> you will but tell me what means I should use, which I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to get my judgment informed, if I err, and to become of your mind, and as wise as you. I again intreat you to tell me the way, and I shall give you most hearty thanks. Did I not know your judgment and mine to be so distant, as puts me out of hope of attaining my end, I would have sent you Nine or Ten Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, for the meer reducing of the Parish Churches to their necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry state, without altering any thing of the Diocesans power or grandure, save only their power of the Sword, which yet as they are Magistrates we submit to. That your former Letters brought me not to your judgment, you may see, by the book which I send you, cometh not to pass by hasty judging, nor without that which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Reason to me after my long and best consideration. I am fully assured, not byassed hereto by worldly interest, which hath long lain on the other side. Accept this Account from</p>

For my much honoured Friend Mr. <hi>Henry Dodwell.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>SINCE the writing of my last to you, your own words have acquainted me, 1. That you take my Principles to have some inconsistence or contradiction. 2. That you think I have not yet told you what Church-Government it is that I would have, or how it can attain its end. 3. That you suppose that <hi>denying men the Sacrament of the Lords Supper</hi> is a coercive power sufficient to force unwilling men to obey Church-Governours. 4. That you hold that all Religious Assemblies not allowed by the Bishops, are unlawful, and therefore that we must rather use none than such.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As to the first, no reason obligeth me to believe you till you prove it; which must be by citing the inconsistent words. How easie is it to tell you or any man, that you speak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions? Is accusing, proving? And you have told me by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that mistaking Hearers and Readers understand not mens words so well as the Speakers or Writers do. When you so widely mistook a speech of mine, when I had told you that as far as I could learn by my own acquaintance, and the report of the Members themselves, there was but one known <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the House of Commons when the Wars began, (I named you a credible witness yet living), and you report that I said, there was but one <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the Assembly of Divines? May not my writing be as much mistaken by you? Prove your Charge, and <hi>I</hi> will confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s my contradictions, and give you thanks.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As to the second I was afraid I had used more words than needs; if all that I have said tell you not what I mean, you may excuse me from adding more, which are like to be no more significant; you must name me the particulars that you are unsatisfied in, before I can know what is needful to be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48440:63"/>
One particular you did name, <hi>viz.</hi> whether I hold a power in the Church to deny men the Sacrament that would have it? I left you no reason to make a doubt of it. If this be it, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the repetitions which you make me guilty of, and I shall renew my account.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I believe that Christ hath instituted the office of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ministry (which the Ancients called <hi>Sacerdotium</hi>), as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to his <hi>Teaching, Ruling,</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotal</hi> office; and that being obliged to Disciple and baptize the Nations, and to teach them Christs commands, and to guide them in holy Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, they are <hi>authorized</hi> to all that they are <hi>obliged to</hi>; and that it is their office-work to administer Baptism and the Lords Supper, and that they have the Church-Keys to judg whom to take in by Baptism, what food to feed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Church with, and whom to cast out of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I believe that this power is limited and regulated by Christs own universal Laws, and that they are not lawless or arbitrary; but he hath bound them by a just description, whom to <hi>take in, what food</hi> to give them, and whom to <hi>cast out.</hi> And that he hath given them no power to cross or violate these his Laws. And if they do it notoriously, it is null and worse, and no act of authority but of sin. <hi>e. g.</hi> If Bishops bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize unconverted Infidels, or give the other Sacrament to such, or to notorious wicked impenitent persons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I believe that if one or many Bishops or Priests do diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey these Laws of Christ, their sin doth not oblige all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to rebel or sin with them, or disoblige them from their duty. <hi>e. g.</hi> If some Bishops should refuse to receive penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed into the Church by Baptism, others are nevertheless bound to receive them, and not all the Bishops in the world to keep them out because some do it sinfully? so if some Bishops would feed them with un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if some Bishops turn Christs sheep out of his sold and pasture unjustly, denying them Communion, others must not do wickedly with them, but must receive such; else one tyrant might oblige all the Churches to tyranny.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48440:64"/>4. But while the power of the Keys is lawfully used, he that is justly cast out of the Communion of one Church, should not be received to Communion with any other that hath just notice of his Exclusion, till the cause be removed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the notice of it concerneth not those that living out of reach, are uncapable of Communion with that person. If a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this Parish be Excommunicated as a Scold, or a man as a Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Bishop is not bound to send notice of their names and case to <hi>Ethiopia</hi> or <hi>Armenia,</hi> nor to all the Christian World; no nor to all <hi>England.</hi> Nor do they use to do it to all the Parishes in the Diocess, but only to that one where the person liveth. But I doubt not but all <hi>that Church should know of it,</hi> of which he was a Communicating member, (by the way, why is not all the Diocess told of it, but that men are consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he hath not Personal communion with them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not be so Excommunicated?)</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Therefore mens limited capacity allowing them <hi>Personal Communion</hi> but in a narrow compass, there needs no Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of all the Christian World for the rejecting of those that one of them hath first rejected.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But in well-ordered agreeing Churches none should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived presently into the Communion of another Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due notice of his aptitude or capacity; which regularly should be by the Certificates of the Church whence he came, called <hi>Communicatory Letters</hi>; or if he was never before admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sacrament because not at age, his own Personal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession giveth him right; and so it doth in the Countries where through neglect such Certificates or Testimonies are not in use, sobeit there come in no proof against him, that he stands Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or deserveth it. A professing Christian hath right to Communion if he travel through all the Churches in the World, till his profession be disproved, or his claim disabled by just testimony. If a man be Excommunicate in, <hi>e. g. Lincoln</hi>-Diocess in one Parish-Church, above a thousand Parishes more of the same Church Diocesan, may receive him for want of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, unless they are bound to receive no stranger of another Parish; and that is a kind of Excommunicating of all Christians from the Communion of all the Christian World, except one Parish.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48440:64"/>8. The Legal Excommunication, which is only a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation that such or such sinners <hi>in specie</hi> shall be <hi>actually excommunicate,</hi> is done already by God himself in his Universal Laws. And no man ought to make Laws to Excommunicate any that Gods Laws do not decree to be Excommunicate, save that when there is a difficulty in discerning whether this or that <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> be indeed the sin so condemned in Gods Laws, mens <hi>Laws</hi> may expound it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to remove that difficulty. If all were excommunicate that Gods own Laws do require to be excommunicate, alas! how great would the number be? So lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle need is there, that Voluminous Councils should excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate many more; and that Councils should be added to Councils to the end of the world, to make new Laws for excommunicating men.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Where God hath commanded all Christians in his Laws, to avoid any sort of wicked men, and with such not to eat, the fact being once notorious, the person is so far, <hi>ipso jure,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, as that all are bound to avoid familiarity with that person, though no Bishop sentence him: But the Pastors having the Church Keys, we must not go out of the <hi>Church,</hi> because such a man is there; for who shall be in the Church, is at his Judgment; but who shall be at my Table, is at mine.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But if the Church it self be <hi>essentiated</hi> of such as God thus commandeth all to avoid, and this be <hi>notorious,</hi> every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must avoid that Church. The Essentials of a Church are the <hi>pars regens &amp; pars subdita,</hi> the <hi>Pastors,</hi> and the Body of the flock. If either be so far corrupt, the Church is corupt: When <hi>any one essential</hi> part is <hi>wanting</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>depraved,</hi> then the <hi>Essence</hi> is wanting, or depraved: Therefore where many Pastors make up the <hi>pars regens</hi> of a particular Church, it is not the heresie, or wickedness of some one only that will warrant a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; because <hi>one</hi> is but an <hi>integral,</hi> and not an essential part: But where <hi>one Bishop only</hi> is the <hi>essential regent constitutive</hi> part, there that <hi>one mans heresie,</hi> or notorious wickedness (such as we are commanded to have no Communion with) will allow us to avoid that Church, as a Church, though not each Member of it, who are parts still of the Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>If I knew what further explication of my thoughts it is that you desire, I should be ready to give it you.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:48440:65"/>III. As to the <hi>coercive power</hi> which you talk of, it is strange if we can differ about the nature of it; but we greatly differ, I suppose, about the extent of it.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now <hi>ad rem,</hi> can we <hi>disagree</hi> how far <hi>this constraineth</hi> the unwilling? Not without some great neglect or culpable defect. I may suppose then that we are agreed of all these particulars: 1. That Gods Laws have told us who must or must not have Sacramental Communion, which we must obey, whatever be the effects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Excommunication is not <hi>only,</hi> nor alway <hi>chiefly,</hi> to bring the person Excommunicated to obedience (no more than hanging) but to keep the purity and reputation of the Church, and the safety of the members, and to warn others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the way by which it is to affect the offender, is, 1. By <hi>shaming him</hi>; 2. By striking his Conscience with the sense of Gods displeasure declared thus by his Ministers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So far as the Sacrament is a means of <hi>conveying grace, to deny it, is not to reform but to destroy.</hi> But when the person hath made himself <hi>uncapable</hi> of the <hi>benefit</hi> of the Sacrament, and apt to receive it abusively to his hurt, then it may possibly humble him to be denied it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the denial of the Sacrament work not on a mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science morally (as threatnings do) it no way compelleth him to his duty, nor saveth him from sin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>De facto</hi> many hundred thousands of ignorant wicked mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Episcopal Churches are so far from being constrained to goodness by being without the Sacrament, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be without it, and loth to be forced to it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The more sin and wickedness any man hath, the less true conscience; and the less conscience, the less doth he regard a due Excommunication.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Bishops themselves are conscious of the insufficiency of their Excommunications alone to compel any to obedience, while they confess that without the Secular power of the sword to back it, they would be but laught at, and despised by the most. Nor durst they ever try to govern by their Church Keys alone among us without the enforcement of the sword. And at the same time while they Excommunicate them from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48440:66"/>
they have a Law to lay them in Gaol, and utterly ruin them if they will not receive it. How loth are the Bishops to lose this compelling Law.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I think few of my acquaintance in <hi>England</hi> do believe that any great number are brought to holy reformation, no nor to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal obedience, by the fear of being kept from the Sacrament, but that which they fear is the Corporal penalty that followeth; lay by that, and you may try.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If you will trust to that spiritual power alone, <hi>&amp; valeat quantum valere potest,</hi> without corporal force, few that I know of will resist you, (but many thousands will despise you, as the Bishops well foresee) bring as many to obedience by it as you can. But if you mean that you must needs have the Magistrate to second you, as your Lictor or Executioner, and to imprison, fine, banish, burn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it would be too gross hypocrisie to call the effects of this coercive power, the effects of Excommunication, and to call it <hi>coercive</hi> power to deny a man the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he feareth the sword.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>De facto,</hi> there are supposed to be in the Parish that you dwell in, above 60000 souls, suppose 10000 of these yearly receive the Sacrament (though some say it is not 5000.) Are the other 40000 compelled to obedience by not communicating.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. All those forbear your Sacrament without any sense of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion or loss, 1. Who believe (as you do) that Sacramental Communion is a sin, where it cannot lawfully be had (that is, say you, where the Bishops forbid it; say they, where Gods Laws forbid it, by reason of adherent sin. 2. And that, take the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who forbid it them to be Usurpers, that have no true call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as all the <hi>Papists</hi> do of our Bishops, and many others.) 3. Who take it to be more eligible, yea a necessary duty to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with purer societies. 4. Besides all those Sectaries that make light of Sacraments in general. What <hi>Papists, Quakers, Anabaptist,</hi> Separatists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are compelled to any good by the Bishops denying them the Sacrament?</p>
                  <p n="13">13.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48440:66"/>
by setting the Christian World in the odious confusion of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating one another. To give some instances how far Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is not coercive.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. When the Orthodox Excommunicated the <hi>Arrians,</hi> did it force them to obey? When they got almost all the Bishops for them, and Excommunicated and destroyed their Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators?</p>

When the <hi>Cecilians</hi> (or Orthodox) and the <hi>Donatists</hi> for so many ages Excommunicated one another, meerly upon the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which party had the true Ordained Bishops, did Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications force them to obedience?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. (To pass forty other Sects) when <hi>Rome</hi> Excommunicated, yea and prosecuted the <hi>Novatians,</hi> did it compel them to obey?

                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. The same that you so much urge on me: Seeing this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact is undeniable, and Excommunication hath done no more than it hath done, Is all Church-Government therefore vain? Or what is your own way of remedy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Seeing it is Bishops themselves, that for so many hundred years excommunicated one another as Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, how shall they, or their flocks be certain which Bishops they be, whose excommunications they must take, as Gods act, and which not? I pray answer it plainly. 1. If any say, <hi>It must be the Majority,</hi> or <hi>greater number,</hi> then so were the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> too long, so were the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> so were the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> so were the <hi>Iconoclasts</hi>; so the <hi>Papists</hi> say <hi>they</hi> are now. If you say, <hi>The Bishops in a General Council,</hi> that's almost all one. What Wars were there between many General Councils; and how long was it the Religion of one side, to be for one, and curse the other; and of the other side, to curse all that did not receive that? How shall we know which Council to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? If you say as <hi>Binnius,</hi> that all Councils have just so much power as the Pope giveth them, how shall we know that this is true? But I suppose that will not be your answer. If you say, we must obey that which is Orthodox, who is the Judg? If every man, then they that judg the excommunicating-Bishops, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, not Orthodox, will not obey them. Truly I know not what answer to expect from you.</p>

Can that man expect, that excommunicating should set all right, and bring men to obedience now in the end of the world, who is constrained (against his will) to be certain, that abused excommunications have been the great means of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Christian world into pernicious Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this day, when the Papal Church unchurches all the Christian Churches that are not Subjects to the Pope; and when the <hi>Greek</hi> Church excommunitcateth the Papal, and most continue damning one another, can you think, that even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating is the remedy to cure these Schisms, and set all right?</p>

If denying men the Sacrament, will constrain men to obedience, why do not the Episcopal Churches through the world, cure the Peoples sins by keeping them from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when so great numbers are prophane, and sensual, and worldlings, and wicked, how easie a means of Conversion were it to forbid them all the Sacrament?</p>

But if you mean not <hi>constraining</hi> to obey God, but only to obey the Bishop, and not God, what good will such obedience do the mans soul, that will not save him?

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="1">I. The just use is, 1. When a scandalous or great sinner is with convincing evidence told of his error, and with seriousness, yet with love and compassion, intreated to repent, and either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, and so absolved, or after due patience, Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively pronounced uncapable of Church-Communion, and bound over to answer it at the Bar of Christ, in terror if he repent not, and this by the Pastor of that particular Church, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther statedly, or <hi>pro tempore,</hi> he belongeth to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And when this is duly notified to such Neighbour-Pastors as he may seek Communion with, and they agree not to receive any justly cast out by others, but to receive and relieve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and falsly condemned.</p>

When they tell Princes, that it is their duty to banish, imprison<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or destroy men, because excommunicate, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; and make Kings their Executioners.

And if Princes must strike with the Sword, all that stand excommunicate, without trying, and judging the persons themselves, it is no wonder if such Prelates, as can first so debase them to be their Lictors, can next depose them. He is like to be a great Persecuter, that will imprison or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all that a proud contentious Clergy will excommunicate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:48440:69"/>As <hi>corruptio optimi est pessima,</hi> I doubt not but a wise, humble, holy, spiritual, loving, heavenly, zealous, patient, exemplary sort of Pastors is the means of continuing Christs Kingdom in the World, and such are the <hi>Pillars</hi> and <hi>Basis</hi> of Truth in the House of God (as it is said of <hi>Timothy,</hi> not of the Church as is commonly mistaken). So an ignorant, worldly, carnal, proud, usurping, domineering, hypocritical sort of Pastors, have been the great plagues, and causes of Schism, confusion, and common calamity: And that when Satan can be the chuser of Pastors for Christs Church, he will (and too oft hath) ever chuse such as shall most succesfully serve him in Christs Name.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not, but such holy Discipline, as shall keep clean the Church of Christ, and keep off the reproach of wickedness and uncleanness from the Christian Religion, and manifest duly to the flock the difference between the precious and the vile, is a great Ordinance of God (which one man cannot exercise over many hundred Parishes, and unknown people). But an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped domineering use of excommunication, to subdue Kings, Princes, Nobles, and people to the Jurisdiction, Opinions, and Canons of Popes, Patriarchs, Prelates, or their Councils, I think hath done not the least part of Satans work in the world.</p>
                  <p>And I must tell you, that I have lived now near 62. (now near 66.) years, and I never saw one man or woman reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or converted by excommunication (and I hope I have known thousands converted from their sin by Preaching, even by some that are now forbidden to Preach). All that ever I knew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, were of two sorts. 1. Dissenters from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Bishops, or conscientious refusers of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And these all rejoice in their sufferings, applying, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are ye, when they cast out your names,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>say all evil of you falsly,</hi> &amp;c. or they take their censure for wicked persecution. The Papists laugh at their Excommunicators, and say, What an odd conditioned Church have you, that will cast us out that never came in, and because we will not come in? 2. Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impenitent sinners: And these hate the excommunicators for disgracing them, and are driven further off from godliness than before: But they will say, <hi>they repent</hi> at any time, rather than go to the Gaol. I never <hi>saw</hi> one person brought to publick confession in the Assembly, by the Bishops Discipline; but I <hi>heard</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48440:70"/>
I was young, of one, or two, that for Adultery stood in a White Sheet in the Church, laughing at the sport, or hating the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers. When there were no Bishops among us, about 1650. many Episcopal, Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> agreed, where I lived, to exercise so much Discipline, as we were all agreed belonged to Presbyters. Hereupon I found good success, in bringing some to repentance by admonition, but never of any one that stood it out to an excommunication (so far as we went, which was only to admonish, and pray for their repentance publickly, and after to declare them unmeet for Christian Communion, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the people to avoid them accordingly, till they repent). After this they hated us more than before (and one of them laid hands on me in the Church-Yard, to have killed me). And I am sure that they reverenced those Ministers more than now Lay-Chancellors (if not Bishops) are by such reverenced: So that experience convinced me, that the penalty of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much more beneficial to others, than to the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
                  <p>And how many thousands in your Parish do now voluntarily excommunicate themselves from the Sacrament, and Church-As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and find no Remorse, or Reformation by it? And if all of both sorts (conscientious Dissenters, and prophane despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, and sinners) were excommunicated now by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without any corporal penalty adjoyned, what do you think it would do upon them? Would they not laugh at you, or pity you? Do not the Bishops believe this, and therefore will not trust to their excommunications at all without the Sword?</p>
                  <p>I cannot magnifie the Discipline of such men as count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Power of the Keys to be but a Leaden Sword, a vain thing, without the annexed enforcement of corporal penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: If it be but <hi>outward obedience to their commands,</hi> which they drive men to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the <hi>heart,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Men of no Conscience will soonest obey them, as forced against their Consciences.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And why do they abuse the name of the <hi>Keys,</hi> as if it were the cause of that which it is no cause of, but is done only by the Magistrates Sword? It is the Writ <hi>De excom. cap.</hi> that doth it, and not the Keys. And they that think <hi>unwilling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> have right to the great benefit of Church Communion;

                  <p>If really your meaning be to set up the power of the Keys by themselves, to do their proper work, and not expect that Magistrates must joyn their forcing power, to punish a man meerly because he beareth the Bishops punishment patiently, without changing his mind; Let it prevail as far as it can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; who will fear it (save for the Schism that it may cause)? But if it be your meaning all this while, that under the name of <hi>denying</hi> the Sacrament, it is Confiscation or the Gaol that must do the work, I should wish for more of the Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and less inclination to the Inquisition-way. Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never yet escaped its due odium, or penalty, by disowning its proper name. I am more of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s mind than of <hi>Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. One word more I add, That I like not your making so light as you seem to me to do, of the <hi>badness</hi> of some <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People</hi> that are in the allowed Churches. I know that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists speak much of the holiness of a Pope, when perhaps a General Council saith, he is a Murderer, Adulterer, Heretick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so call their Church <hi>Relatively</hi> holy. I deny not that <hi>Relative holiness,</hi> which is founded in meer profession: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Christ came to gather a people to another sort of <hi>Godliness,</hi> and by his Spirit to fill them with Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Life, Light, and Love</hi> (to God and man). And I believe, that all that have this (though excommunicate) shall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: And that without this, all the obedience to Bishops that they give, will never keep them out of Hell. And I take it to be no great priviledg to march in an orderly Army to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or to be at peace in Satans power. Hell will be Hell which way ever we come to it. I confess, were these Bishops in the right, that <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> citeth, that say, <hi>The ignorant people might merit by hating God, as an act of obedience, if their Pastors should tell them it is their duty</hi>; then this external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them were more considerable: But I had rather go in the Company that goeth to Heaven (as all do that are true Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God and man) than in that which goeth to Hell (as do the most Regular of the ungodly). And yet I account true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and regularity, a great duty of the godly, and a great help to godliness.</p>

Do you think men can change their judgment, meerly because they are commanded, or excommunicated?

            <p n="1">1. The Principles which I presuppose, are such as these. 1. As God as Creator, so Christ as Redeemer is the Universal King and Head over all things to the Church, which is his body, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. He hath made <hi>Vniversal Laws</hi> to be means of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Universal Laws are in <hi>suo genere</hi> sufficient to their proper use.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is no other Universal King or Ruler of the world, or of the Church, whether Personal or Collective. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none that hath power of Universal Legislation, or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Much less any that hath a superiour power to alter Gods Universal Laws by abrogation, subrogation, suspension, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation. Nor will God himself alter them, and substitute new ones. As <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>We at first believe this, that no more is to be believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. These Laws of our Universal Governour are partly of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation, and partly of Supernatural, <hi>viz.</hi> by himself, and by his Spirit in his Apostles given in an extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to this end, to lead them into all truth, which is delivered to us in their Scripture-records.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Some local precepts, whose matter was narrow and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48440:73"/>
even the mutable customs of that time and place were also narrow and temporary; (as the washing of feet, anointing, vailing women, the kiss of peace, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) which maketh nothing for the mutability of the Universal Laws.</p>
            <p n="8">8. No Pastors since the Apostles, are by office or power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make any Universal Laws for the Church, nor any of the same kind and reason with Gods own Laws, whose rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or cause was existent in the Apostles times, but only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the word of God, and apply it to particular persons and cases, as Ministers under Christ in his Teaching, Priestly and Governing office; nor have the Apostles any other kind of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Christ made not <hi>Peter</hi> or any one of his Apostles Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the rest: But when they strove who should be the chief, rebuked that expectation, and determined, That among them Preeminence should consist in excelling in humility and service.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were sick of the like disease, <hi>Paul</hi> rebuked them for saying, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> and determineth that Apostles are but particular members of the body, of which Christ only is the Head; and not the Lords, but Ministers and helpers of their faith.</p>
            <p n="11">11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Pastors (as such) have forcing power, either to touch mens bodies, or estates, or inflict by the sword corporal penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or mulcts. But only by the <hi>word</hi> (by which the power of the Keys is exercised) to instruct men, and urge Gods precepts, promises and threats upon their Consciences.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Apostles were Bishops <hi>eminenter,</hi> in that they called, gathered, and while they stayed with them, governed Churches. But not <hi>formaliter</hi> as taking any one particular Church for their proper charge: But setled such fixed Bishops over them. And though they distributed their labours about the world prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as the Spirit of Christ guided them; yet we find not any probability that ever they divided the world into twelve or thirteen Provinces, or ever setled twelve or thirteen chief Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical seats in the world, which their proper Successors as such should govern in preeminence. Nor doth any History intimate such a thing; nor yet that any Apostle took any City for his proper Diocess, where another Apostle might not come and exercise equal Power.</p>

            <p n="14">14. As <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks that the Churches were instituted after the likeness of the Synagogues, of which one City had many; so Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> endeavours to evince, not only that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were Bishops of two distinct Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> one of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the other of the Gentile Christians; but also that it was so in other Cities. <hi>Dissertat.</hi>

The Patriarchs were not 12 or 13, but three first, and five afterward; and none of them pretended to any power as espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Successors of any one Apostle, but <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Peter</hi>; (and that was not their first claim or <hi>title,</hi> but an honorary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why men afterward advanced them.) <hi>Alexandria</hi> claimed Succession but from St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from <hi>Iames</hi> (no Apostle, if Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others be not much mistaken) and <hi>Constantinople</hi> from none.</p>

            <p n="17">17. These Emperours having no power out of the Empire, neither by themselves, nor by Councils, gave not any power that extended further than the Empire, or that could by that title continue to any City which fell under the Government of another Prince.</p>

            <p n="2">II. I conceive, that the means of Church-concord, appointed by God, is as follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I premise,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It must be pre-supposed, That no perfect Concord will be had on earth; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there will unavoidably be very many differences, which must be born.

in every particular of the same mind: And every man that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in knowledg, will more and more differ from himself, and not be of the same mind as he was when he knew less.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet must our increase in knowledg, and Concord, be our continual endeavour; and it is the use of teaching to bring these differences, caused by ignorance, to as small a number as we can.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is scarce a more effectual means of Division, and Confusion, and Church-ruin, to be devised, than to suppose a more extensive Concord to be possible, and necessary, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is; and so to set up an impossible End, and Means, and to deny Concord and Peace to all that cannot have it on those terms.

            <p>And how unexcusable these three evils are, and how contrary to Christ, these Texts do tell me: I. <hi>Luk</hi> 22.24, 25, 26 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24.

            </p>
            <p>Some of the Principles which I have heard from your mouth, which I dissent from, are these:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the Church must have some Ecclesiastical Governours that are absolute, from whom no man may appeal to an invisible Power.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That Diocesan Churches are the first in order of Divine Institution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. That Diocesan-Bishops by consent may make other Church-forms, as National, Patriarchal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that such Churches are not made by Princes, but by the consent of Prelates.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That these Church-forms of mans making, stand in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48440:77"/>
Superiority over those of Gods making.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That where by such consent of Diocesans such superior Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions are once setled, it is a sin for any to gather Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies within the local bounds of their Jurisdiction without their consent.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That you cannot see how those that do so, can be saved.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That if I preach on the account of my Ministerial office, and the peoples necessity, to such as else would have no Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor any publick worship of God, (<hi>e. g.</hi> in a Parish where there are 40000 more than can hear in the Parish-Church), though I must conclude that according to the ordinary way of Salvation such could not be brought to Faith, Holiness and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for want of teaching, it is yet my sin to preach to them, and my duty to let them rather be damned, if I have not the Bishops consent to teach them; and that because it is the Bishop and not I that shall answer for their damnation.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That it is disputable with you whether those to whom Church power is given (<hi>viz.</hi> Diocesans) may not change (not only the local temporary circumstances, but) the very Church-forms, and suspend Laws of Christ.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That Baptism entreth the Baptized into some particular Church, and consequently under this fore-described Church-Government.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That in the case of Preaching the Gospel, Ministers may in many cases do it, though Emperours and Kings forbid them, (as in the days of <hi>Constantius, Valens,</hi> yea and better men); but not if the Bishop forbid them, or consent not.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That <hi>circa Sacra,</hi> if the King command the Churches for Uniformity, one Translation of the Bible, one Version or Meter of the Psalms, one Liturgy, one Time, or Place of Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Bishop another, we ought to obey the Bishop against the command of the King.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That the required Subscriptions, Declarations, Rubricks and Canons, are primarily the Laws of the Church, which the King and Parliament do confirm by their Sanction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church is the Expounder of them.</p>
            <p>These are some of your Assertions, which I cannot yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48440:78"/>I. My Reasons against the first are these: 1. Because this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> and so is Idolatry, giving them Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Power and Prerogative.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Then all Villanies may be made Virtues, or Duties, at the will of man: If they command us to curse God, or Blaspheme, or be perjured, or commit Fornication, Murder, or Idolatry, it would become a Duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then the Power, and Lives of Kings would be at the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies mercy; For if their power be <hi>Absolute,</hi> they may make Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Rebellion a Duty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And all Family-Societies, and Civil Converse, migbt be overthrown, while an <hi>Absolute Clergy</hi> may disoblige men from all duty to one another.</p>

            <p>Say not, that I wrong you, by laying all this <hi>odium</hi> on your self. I lay it but on your words: And I doubt not, but (though disputing Interest draw such words from you) on consideration you will re-call them by some limitations.</p>
            <p n="2">II. My Reasons against your second, must pre-suppose, that we understand one another as to the sense of the word, <hi>Diocesan Church,</hi> which being your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erm, had I been with you, I must have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired you first to explain. The word, <hi>Diocess</hi> of old, you know, signified a part of the Empire, larger than a Province, and that had many <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in it. I suppose that is not your sense. Sometimes now it is taken for that space of ground which we call, a Diocess; sometimes for all the people in that space. And with us, a Diocesan Church, is <hi>a Church of the lowest Order, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it, a multitude of fixed Parochial Congregations, which have every one their stated Presbyter, who is no Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Vnum altare, and are no Churches, but parts of a Church, and which is individuated by one Bishop, and the measuring-space of ground, whose inhabitants are its Members.</hi> Till you tell me the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I must take this for your sense; For you profess to me, that you speak of such Diocesan Churches as ours (and they have some above a thousand, others many hundred Parishes), and you say our Parishes are not <hi>Churches,</hi> but <hi>Parts of a Church,</hi> and so Families are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Either you mean, that a <hi>Diocesan Church</hi> is the first in order of Execution and Existence, or else in order of Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so last in Existence and Execution. I know not your meaning, and therefore must speak to both.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That a Diocesan Church is first in <hi>Intention,</hi> is denied by me, and disproved (though it belong to you to prove it).</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48440:79"/>1. <hi>Intentions</hi> no where declared of God in mature or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelations, are not to be asserted of him as Truths. But a <hi>prime intention</hi> of a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church is no where declared of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not to be asserted of him as truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>ultimum rei complementum,</hi> which is first in <hi>intention</hi> (where there is <hi>ordo intentionis.</hi>) But a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church is not the <hi>end</hi> or <hi>ultimum rei complementum: Ergo,</hi> not first intended.</p>
            <p>The Major is not deniable: The Minor hath the consent as far I as know, of all the world. For they are all either <hi>for</hi> the Hierarchy, or against it. They that are <hi>for</hi> it, say that a <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> is above a <hi>Diocesan,</hi> and a <hi>Provincial</hi> above a <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> above a <hi>Provincial,</hi> and a <hi>National</hi> (which hath Patriarchs, as the Empire had) above that; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay the new Catholicks, an <hi>humane universal</hi> above a <hi>National</hi> Church, as the complement or perfection; and therefore must be first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>But those that are <hi>against</hi> the Hierarchy, think that all these are Church-corruptions, or humane policies set up by Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore not of prime Divine Intention.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you should go this way, I would first debate the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you, how far there is such a thing as <hi>ordo intentionis</hi> to be ascribed to God. For though St. <hi>Thomas</hi> (as you use to call him) assert such <hi>intentions,</hi> it is with many limitations; and others deny it, and all confess that it needeth much Explication to be understood.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But if it be a priority of <hi>Existence</hi> in order of <hi>execution.</hi> that you mean, it disproveth it self. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is contrary to the nature of production, that two, or twenty, or an hundred stated Congregations, should be <hi>before ont</hi>; as it is that I should write a page before a line, and a line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a word, and a word before a letter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is contrary to the Scripture-History, which telleth us that Christ called his Disciples by degrees, a few first, and more after; and that the Apostles accordingly converted men; from the number of 120, they rose to 3000 more; and after to 5000, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that ordinarily the Churches in Scripture-times were such as <hi>could,</hi> and often did meet in one place, (though that be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t necessary as I said before) hath so copious evidence, as that I will not here trouble you with it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48440:79"/>3. Either the Apostles Ordained Bishops before subject Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, or such Presbyters before Bishops, or both at once. If both at once as two Orders, it's strange that they called both Orders promiscuously by the same names, sometimes Bishops, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Presbyters, and sometimes Pastors and Teachers, without any distinguishing Epithete or notice. And it's strange that we never find any mention of the two sorts of Congregations, one the Bishops Cathedral, and the other the Parish Presbyters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. If you say that they were the Bishops themselves, and first Ordained only subject-Presbyters under them, that cannot hold. For doubtless there were more than twelve or thirteen Churches (the number of Apostles in their times; nor were they <hi>fixed Bishops,</hi> but <hi>indefinite gatherers</hi> and <hi>edifiers</hi> of the Churches. And either those Elders first Ordained by the Apostles were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or else there were <hi>Churches without Bishops,</hi> for they <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Elders in every City, and in every Church.</hi> And either the Elders first Ordained by the Apostles had the power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, or not. If they had, then either they were Bishops, or else <hi>subject-Presbyters</hi> were Ordained to be <hi>Ordainers</hi>; yea to <hi>Ordain Bishops</hi> (if such were to be after ordained.) And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it would be suitable to your concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that the inferiour order of Diocesans do by consent make superior Metropolitans, Provincials, Nationals, and Patriarchs to rule them; and with <hi>Hieromes</hi> report <hi>ad Evagr.</hi> that the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Presbyters made the Bishops, as the Army doth a General. But this making of Children to beget Fathers, is so commonly denied, that I need not more dispute against it.</p>
            <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I think most of the Hierarchical way will say, that the Apostles first Ordained Bishops, that those Bishops might Ordain subject-Presbyters. And if so, the Churches could be but single Congregation at the first till the subject-Presbyters were Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Yea, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (as aforesaid) asserteth (in <hi>Act.</hi> 11. and in <hi>Dissert. &amp;c.</hi>) that there is no proof there were any of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>subject-Presbyters</hi> in Scripture-times; and he thinketh that most of his party were of his mind; and that the name Bishop, Elder and Pastor in Scripture signifie only those that we now call Bishops. And in this he followeth <hi>Dion. Petavius,</hi> and <hi>Fr. a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Clara de Episcop.</hi> who saith that it came from <hi>Scotus.</hi> And if this be so, then in all Scripture-times there was no Church of more than <hi>one worshipping Congregation.</hi> For we are agreed that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48440:80"/>
Church-meetings were for the publick Worship of God, and celebration of Sacraments, and exercise of Discipline, which no meer Lay-man might lawfully guide the people in, and perform as such assemblies did require. And one Bishop could be but in one place at once. And if there were <hi>many Bishops,</hi> there were many Churches. So that according to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and all of his mind, there was no Church in Scripture-times of more than one stated ordinary Worshipping Congregation, because there were no subject-Presbyters.</p>
            <p>If you say that yet this was a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church, because it had a Diocesan Bishop; I answer, why is he called a Diocesan Bishop if he had not a Diocesan Church?</p>
            <p>If you mean that he was designed to turn his single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation into many by increase: 1. That must not be <hi>said only,</hi> but <hi>proved.</hi> 2. And that supposeth that his <hi>one congregation</hi> was first before the <hi>many.</hi> And I hope you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake not <hi>Infidels</hi> for parts of the Church, because they are <hi>to be converted</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Those that are no members of the Church make not the Church, and so make it not to be Diocesan. One Congregation is not an <hi>hundred</hi> or a <hi>thousand,</hi> because so many will be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>If you mean that such a <hi>space of ground</hi> was assigned to the Bishops to gather and govern Churches in. I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gathering Churches is a work antecedent to Episcopacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Ground</hi> is no part of the Church. It is a Church of <hi>men,</hi> and not of <hi>soil</hi> and houses that we speak of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor indeed will you ever prove that the Apostles measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out or distinguished Churches by the space of ground. So that the first Churches were not Diocesan.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to your Third Opinion, 1. Officers are denominated from the work which they are to do. There are works to be done, <hi>circa sacra,</hi> about the holy Ministerial works, as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental: as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If without Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, no man could be <hi>Episcopus gregis,</hi> and have the power of the Keys over the people, then by parity of Reason, without his institution no man can be <hi>Episcopus Episcoporum,</hi> and have the power of the Keys over the Bishops.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s argument against Presbyters Ordination is, <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet</hi>; which though it serve not his turn on several accounts (both because 1. <hi>They have</hi> the Order which they confer. 2. Because <hi>Ordination</hi> is not <hi>giving,</hi> but <hi>Ministerial delivery</hi> by <hi>Investiture</hi>); yet in this case it will hold; For 1. This is supposed to be a new institution of an Office. 2. And that of an higher power than ever the Institutors had themselves: The King giveth all his Officers their power, but all of them cannot <hi>give</hi> the King his power. The Patriarch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Pope, nor the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> a Patriarch, that shall have a power over them, which they never had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>And what I say of Superior <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> I say of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi>; For whether the power be Monarchica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or Aristocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Democratical, there is need of the same power in the <hi>Cause</hi> that maketh it: No man can give that which he hath not to give.</p>
            <p>If you should fly to such popular Principles, as the Episcopal Champion, <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> doth, and the Jesuites in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, and many; yea, most other Writers of Politicks, and say, That as the people are the givers of power to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, though they are no Governours themselves, so the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops give power to the <hi>Episcopi Episcoporum</hi> (personal, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical), I answer, The Principle is false about <hi>Civil Policy,</hi> as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48440:81"/>
I have proved against Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> in my <hi>Christian Directory,</hi> and as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath proved in the Kings Cause, against <hi>Iohn Goodwin.</hi> The power every man hath over himself, doth so specifically differ from the power of Governing-Societies, that the latter is not caused by all mens Contribution of the former; and much more in Church-Government, which God hath left less the Will of man (as Mr. <hi>Dan. Cawdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> hath proved).</p>
            <p>To conclude, I grant the Superiority of Magistrates, and of their Officers, <hi>circa sacra,</hi> but not that Inferior Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may by consent, make a Superior <hi>Species</hi> of Rulers (or <hi>Episcopos Episcoporum</hi>) by the Keys, <hi>in eodem genere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I confess, that how far <hi>Christ himself</hi> hath made <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Successors,</hi> or <hi>Archbishops,</hi> as to the ordinary part of <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning many Churches,</hi> is a question to me of much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and moment.</p>
            <p>As for the Patriarchal, and other Superior Church-power in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that it was made partly by the Emperors themselves (as the instances of the two <hi>Iustiniana's,</hi> and many others shew), and partly by Councils, Authorized thereto by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, is past all doubt.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. As to your fourth Opinion, I include the reason of my denial of it, in the description of it. Whether you confess par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular worshipping Churches, that have each <hi>unum altare,</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> I cannot tell: but that you take the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan to be so <hi>Divine,</hi> you have told me; and that you take the Superior Ruling-Churches, to be made by them. Now that Churches of <hi>mans making</hi> (Universal, or National, or Patriarchal, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) should be the rightful Governors (by the Keys) over the Churches of Gods making, must be either <hi>jure Divino,</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano</hi>: not <hi>jure humano</hi>; For 1. Man cannot give the <hi>power of the Keys</hi> without God. 2. And mans grant cannot <hi>over top Gods.</hi> Indeed there is no power but of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not <hi>jure divino</hi>; For if God give them the <hi>power,</hi> God <hi>maketh that Species</hi> that containeth that power. For God not to make the <hi>Office,</hi> and not to give the <hi>power,</hi> is all one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At least, what satisfying proof you will give us, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God giveth power to Church-Officers of his own making, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48440:81"/>
to make <hi>nobler superior Officers</hi> or Churches than themselves, I cannot foresee. And till it's proved, it is not to be believed. 4. Yea it confoundeth the Inferiours and the Superiors. For the Diocesans are so far the Superiors to the Provincial, National, Patriarchal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that they make them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or give them their power, and yet inferior in that they are to be subjects to them.</p>
            <p>More <hi>Nonconformists</hi> do deny the power of <hi>men</hi> to make new <hi>Species</hi> of Churches, and Church Rulers, than their power to make new Ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Your next mention'd Opinion, (that it is a sin to preach and congregate people within the local bounds of Diocesan or Provincial, or other superior Jurisdictions without their consent) falleth of it self, if those foregoing fall, which it is built upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it prove true that they that made these superior Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions had no <hi>power</hi> to make them, but gave that which they had not to give, then your foundation faileth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be proved that neither Christ nor his Apostles ever made a Law that Bishops Jurisdictions shall be limited, measured and distributed by space of ground, as our Parishes and Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are, so that all in such a compass shall be proper to one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, much less did ever divide our Diocesses or Parishes; (which me thinks none should deny) then Preaching in that space of ground is no sin against such an Order of Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be proved (as I undertake to do) that this distribution by spaces of ground, is a work that the King and his Officers are to do, (or the Churches by his permission by way of contract, if he leave it to them), and this in obedience to Gods General Laws (of Order, Peace, Concord and Edification), then these things will follow,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That if the King give us Licenses to Preach within such a space of ground, we have good Authority, and break not the restraining Law: And yet such as you accused us of schism as well when the King Licensed us, as since.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this Law of local bounds doth bind us but as other humane Laws do; which is, say many Casuists, not at all <hi>out of the case of scandal,</hi> when they make not for the <hi>bonum publicum.</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48440:82"/>
But say others more safely, not when they notoriously <hi>make against,</hi> 1. Either the <hi>bonum publicum,</hi> which is <hi>finis regiminis:</hi> 2. Or the general Law of God which must authorize them, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against edification, peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 3. When they are contrary to the great, certain and indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pensible Laws of God himself. And that in such cases patient suffering the penalty which men inflict is instead of obedience to the prohibition, (and as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> case, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6 and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in what cases it is a great duty. But to say that it is a sin because that the Clergy forbiddeth it, must have better proof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an I have seen, even, 1. That such Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are truly called by God. 2. And that they have from him the assignation of this space of ground. And 3. are by him em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to forbid all others to preach on their land. 4. And that even when Gods general Laws do make it our duty, that they can suspend the obligation of such Laws, even the greatest: I am ready upon any just occasion to prove to you, that I were a heinous sinner, if I should have ceased such Preaching as I have used upon all the reasons that you alledg against it. And wo to them that make our <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>dearest duties</hi> to pass for <hi>sin,</hi> and our greatest sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.20. Were it but one of the <hi>least commands,</hi> I would be loth to break it, and <hi>teach men so to do,</hi> much less one of the <hi>greatest</hi>; when men whose consciences tell them, that they are totally devoted to God; as Christians and as Ordained Ministers, deny their worldly interest and preferments, and serve him in poverty, beholden for their daily bread, and to the ruin of their worldly Estates, and the hazard of their lives in the Common Goals, endeavour nothing but to Preach Christs Gospel to save mens souls from ignorance, unbelief, sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, worldliness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in case of the peoples undeniable necessity; I say, when such meet with men of the same profession, who think not the Common Goals among Rogues, and the forfeiture of Forty pound a Sermon, as Enacted by Law, to be enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them, but also as in the name of Christ they will charge us with heinous sin unless we will perfidiously break our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Christ, and sacrilegiously alienate our selves from the work which we are devoted to (many of us under the Bishops hands) and unless we will be cruel to miserable souls, and shut
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48440:82"/>
up the bowels of our compassion from them, while we see them in need and in danger of damnation, what fortitude do we need against such kind of Tempters, and such Temptations? If Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and boys in the street only scorn'd me as a Puritan, or Precisian, it were less. If <hi>Turkish</hi> Rulers did persecute me for my Preaching Christ, it were less. If mistaken Christian Rulers made me the scorn of the Nation, and stript me of all my worldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and laid me with Malefactors in Prisons, it were a less temptation, than for a man to come in the name of Christ, to tell me that I sin against him, unless I will forsake my Calling, break my Vows, cease Preaching his Gospel, betray thousands of souls to Satan and damnation, and encourage all that endeavour it by yielding to all their temptations, and giving them success. But as Christ must be accused of sin, as well as crucified, and not allowed the honour of suffering as innocent, so must his servants.</p>
            <p>I will venture upon one argument on the by that may be somewhat by others, though nothing to you for the invalidating of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation. I saw from the hands of a Noble Lord,<note place="margin">The Earl of <hi>Orery.</hi>
               </note> an excellent truly Learned Manuscript said by him to be the Bishop of <hi>Lincolns,</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you who are said to judg it unlawful to subscribe to <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>'s Creed. What else you refuse I know not; but by that much I perceive you are a strange kind of <hi>Nonconformist.</hi> Now if it be unlawful for <hi>you</hi> to subscribe and conform, or unlawful <hi>for me,</hi> (which I here undertake to prove before any equal competent Judges) then it is unlawful for all the Ministers of <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">☜</note> for none of them may do evil that good may come by it. And then all the Ministers in <hi>England</hi> ought to cease Preaching, if I ought to cease, when they are forbidden. The consequence will be denied by others, though not by you. (And by the way, How can you take the Bishops for Absolute, <hi>from whom there is no appeal to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible power,</hi> and yet disobey them, if they bid you subscribe <hi>Athanasius</hi> Creed.) If it be a sin in me not to cease Preaching when I am silenced for Nonconformity, and yet Nonconformity be a duty, then it is a sin in all the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> not to be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, and so not to cease Preaching. But the latter part of the consequent is false: <hi>Ergo,</hi> so is the Antecedent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea, directly your assertion puts it in the power of one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to put down the Preaching of the Gospel, and all Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, in whole Countries or Kingdoms, (if not in the world), and so Christ must be at their mercy whether he shall have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48440:83"/>
any Church, and so whether he shall be Christ; and God, whether he shall have any publick Worship In <hi>Ethiopia</hi> (though <hi>Brierwood</hi> saith that yet after the decay of the <hi>Abassine</hi> Empire, it is as big as <hi>Italy, Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>) they have but one Bishop, called their <hi>Abuna</hi> And if he forbad all Preaching or publick Worship in the Empire, it is a sin to obey him. And it is a great duty to gather Churches within his Church. It is a sin in the Empire of <hi>Muscovie,</hi> that all their Clergy obey their Patriarch and Prince in forbearing to Preach. If all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> should agree to reduce the Kingdom to one only Bishoprick, and one Church, and turn all the rest into Parish-Chappels, it were a duty to disobey them, and gather Churches in that one Church. If the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had forbidden all in their limits to Preach and worship God publickly, it had been a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to obey them. When <hi>Severus Antioch,</hi> the <hi>Eutychian,</hi> forbad the Orthodox to Preach in his Patriarchate, it had been their sin to obey him, (yea or if <hi>Theodosius</hi> or <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Emperours had done it): yea, though a General Council of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. (if not <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.) was on his side. If the Pope (whether as Pope or as Patriarch of the West), Interdict all the Preachers and Churches in <hi>Venice,</hi> or in <hi>Britain,</hi> it were a sin to obey him.</p>
            <p>The reasons are, because their power is derived and limited (to pass by the <hi>no power</hi> of Usurpers) the greatest have it for edification, and not for destruction. None of them have power to make void the least (continued) Law of God by their Doctrines, Precepts or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. All men must take heed of the leven of their false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and must beware of false Prophets, and must prove all things, and hold fast that which is good. There is no true power but of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore none against him. It is better to obey God than men. But of this you may in season have larger proof, if you desire it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Your excluding <hi>us from Salvation,</hi> that will not cease Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel of Salvation, and worshipping God, remembreth us:</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a mercy it is that neither Pope, nor any such condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is made our final Judg.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How most Sects agree <hi>(Papists, Quakers, &amp;c.)</hi> in damning those that dance not after their Pipe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48440:83"/>3. What various wiles of temptations Satan useth to hinder Christs Gospel, and mens Salvation.</p>
            <p>At once I have, 1. A backward flesh, that is the worst of all, that saith, <hi>Favour thy self, and expose not thy self to all this labour, obloquie, hatred, suffering, loss and danger of death for nothing, but that work which thy superiours think needless, and forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I feel Satan setting in with the flesh, and saying the same.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Carnal and worldly friends say the same (as <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.)</p>
            <p n="4">4. Displeased Sinners and Sectaries wish me silent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What Superiors say and do, I need not mention.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And to perfect all, some Preachers in Press and Pulpit, and you in Discourse, declare us in danger of damnation, as Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, unless we will give over Preaching the Gospel. O how easie were it to me to avoid that damnation! And if I incur it, how dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do I purchase it! It is a sad case that such poor souls as we are in, that would fain know Gods will whatever study or suffering it cost us, and after our most earnest search and prayers, believe that if we forsook our trust, and office, and the peoples souls, we should be judged as sacrilegious, perfidious hypocrites, and yet we are told by <hi>wiser</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> men, that our labours and sufferings do but damn us; may not a man be damned at a cheaper rate than Forty pound a Sermon, or the loss of all his worldly Estate, and lying with malefactors, and perhaps dying in a Goal, under the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sacred infamy of being Schismaticks and enemies of the publick Government and peace, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> But this also we must be fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. For Satan is sometime utterly impudent, and will say, <hi>Damn your selves by perfidiousness, and let the people be damned quietly, or else you shall be damned for Schismaticks.</hi> But the long noise of <hi>damning Papists and Quakers</hi> have somewhat hardned or embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened us. It was an early trick, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Except ye be circumcised and keep the Law of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</hi> When lands and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings will not prevail; when profit, pleasure and honour fail; when poverty, reproach and prisons will not serve, then comes, <hi>You cannot else be saved.</hi> How many Sects say, <hi>Say as we say, and do as we do, and follow us, or you cannot be saved?</hi> But saith St. <hi>Paul, It is a small thing with me to be judged of man, or at mans day: I have one that judgeth me, even the Lord,</hi> (to whom we will appeal what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you say against it.) But you must give me leave to think, that to draw men from their great duty, and the saving souls, to heinous
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48440:84"/>
sin, as in the name of Christ, and to frighten men into Hell with the fear of damnation, and the abused Word of God, hath heinous aggravations, which enticing men by sensuality to drunkenness, whoredom or theft, hath not.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. To the next, the matter of fact, and antecedent Suppositions cannot be denied, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That it is probably supposed that there are inhabitants more than can hear the Preachers voice in the Parish-Churches, in <hi>Martins</hi> Parish about 40000, in <hi>Stepney</hi> Parish near as many, in <hi>Giles Cripplegate</hi> 30000, in <hi>Giles</hi> in the <hi>Fields</hi> near 20000, in <hi>Sepulchres, Algate, White-chappel, Andrews Holborn,</hi> and many other Out-Parishes very many thousands. The last Bill of Mortality that I saw, saith there died in <hi>Stepney</hi> Parish as many wanting one, as in all the Ninety-seven Parishes of <hi>London,</hi> and in <hi>Martins</hi> as many within six, and in <hi>Giles Cripplegate</hi> as many within eight, or thereabout.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe if they hear not? and how shall they hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Preacher? If the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: Where Vision faileth, the people perish, even for lack of knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet people by our Church Laws must be presented and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as Recusants if they come not to Church, and so 40000 or 30000 should be presented and punished for want of room; but it is a greater punishment to be strangers unto the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Canon forbiddeth them going to, and communicating in other Parishes, and forbiddeth the Ministers to receive them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Children of Christians are born with no more knowledg than the children of Heathens; and need teaching as well as theirs, to bring them to knowledg when they grow up.</p>
            <p n="6">6. God will not save any adult person that is an Infidel, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unsanctified, because he is bred up among Christians, and Churches, or born of Christians, and Baptized; but it will go worse with such unholy persons in the day of Judgment, that have had the greatest means.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If you can cast the fault on the people, and say that they might remove their dwellings, or (break the Law, and) go to other Parishes, or read at home, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that excuseth us not. For the worse they are, the more need they have of help. If they were faultless, what need had they of us?</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:48440:84"/>8. As to my own case whom you condemn, I have told you, that I have the Ordination of a Bishop, and the License of the Bishop of this Diocess (not nulled or recalled) which by your principles one would think might serve if it had been against Gods own Laws. And yet Gods Law and the Bishops License will not serve.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Some other may say, <hi>What's your case to many others?</hi> I answer: To pass by a great deal not now to be said, Let it be understood that the case is this. Men are first silenced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and so forbidden the publick Churches, and all publick worship of God; and then the Excommunicate are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted and accused for not coming to Church. Divers Canons do <hi>ipso facto</hi> (that is, <hi>sine sententiâ</hi>) excommunicate all that do but say that any thing in the Liturgy or Discipline is unlawful, or may not be done with a good conscience (which all <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> hold). And it is not possible for us to repent of that as a <hi>wicked Error,</hi> which after all means that we can possibly use, appeareth unto us an undoubted truth, that so our Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication may be taken off. Now these <hi>silenced men</hi> are assured, that God disobligeth them not from the duty of Preaching; and these <hi>excommunicate men</hi> are assured that God doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them from the duty of <hi>publick worship</hi> and <hi>Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Therefore they must use it as they can, when they may not use it as they would. Men say the <hi>Papists</hi> should not call us Schismaticks, because they <hi>cast us out,</hi> and <hi>went from us</hi>; and will you silence and excommunicate men, as they undertake to prove, for obeying God, and then call them Schismaticks for not communicating with you, or for worshipping God in such Church-communion as they can?

Epistle, p. 200. and St. <hi>Martin's</hi> Separation from the Bishops, confirmed by Miracle, sometimes sticks in my stomack). But I cannot make so light as you do, 1.

            <p n="3">3. Nor of Christs Law of preferring <hi>Mercy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> necessary Morals before Rituals, Circumstantials or Ordinals, which are all but <hi>propter rem ordinatam.</hi> I remember you have told me, That <hi>if the Bishop forbad all Gods publick worship in the Assemblies, we must forbear.</hi> Such sayings, and this, <hi>That I must let so many souls be untaught though they be damned, because it is the Bishops fault and not mine,</hi> do make me ready to tremble to think of them. If Christs works be saving, whose work is it to make so light of mans damnation? Is it any wonder if such Principles be called Antichristian? I cannot but perceive from whom they come, when the damnation of poor people must be so easily submitted to, if the Bishop do but command the means. Methinks you wrong the Bishops by such odious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and Assertions, as if you would make men believe that they are the <hi>Grievous Wolves that spare not the flock,</hi> and the <hi>thorns and thistles</hi> that are made to prick and rend the people. But I believe that the Bishops faultiness in mens damnation would be no exeuse to me if I be accessory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And I doubt not but if you unjustly <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate men, it neither depriveth them of the right, nor absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them from the duty of publick Worship, and Church-Communion. And I am ashamed to read and hear Preachers publickly reproaching them for not holding constant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Parish-Churches, when it's notorious that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non hath thus Excommunicated them, yea though it were their duty sometime to intrude.</p>
            <p>And I beseech you judg as a Christian or a man, whether you can think such Arguments should draw the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be of your mind: Go to them and speak out, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I confess that while you live in ignorance and sin for want of teaching and publick worship, you are in the way to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but it is the Bishop, and not the silenced Preacher that shall answer for it. Will they not reply, <hi>And shall not the Bishop then he damned instead of us, as well as instead of the silenced Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?</hi>

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:48440:85"/>VIII. Your doubt about <hi>mens power to change Christs setled form of Church-government,</hi> is but a consequent of your first, <hi>of mens absolute power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 1. if they change Gods Laws, or instituted Church-forms or Government, may they not change <hi>their own</hi>? And if so, there is some hope of a Reformation. But why then did the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of 1640. in the <hi>Et caetera</hi> Oath, swear the Clergy <hi>never to consent</hi> to change? And why are we now to swear in the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Oath, That we will <hi>never endeavour any alteration of Church-Government</hi> (tho' the keys be in the power of Lay-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and tho' the King may command us to endeavour it) must the Nation or Clergy swear never (in their own places) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour any alteration of <hi>the Bishops Institutions</hi> (as you take them), and yet may the Bishops alter the very <hi>Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> made by our Universal King?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What an uncertain mutable thing may Christs Laws or Church-Government prove, while mutable men may change it at their pleasure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To what purpose is <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> so much pleaded by Hierarchical Divines, as if that were the Test to know the right Government and Church, if the Bishops may alter it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If thus much of Christs Laws and Institutions may be altered by Prelates, how shall we be sure that all the rest is not also at their will and mercy? or which is it that they may alter, and which not?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doth not this set man so far above God, or equal with him, as will still tempt men to think that more are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian than the Pope? If you say that it is by Gods own grant, I wait for your proof, that God granteth power to any man above his Laws: Those that he made but <hi>Local</hi> or <hi>Temporary</hi> himself, are not abrogated or changed by man where they bind not; for they never bound any but their proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>e. g.</hi> The <hi>Iewish</hi> Laws, as such, never bound the Gentile world; and the command of washing feet, bound only th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48440:86"/>
made it an office of kindness; and so of other Temporary precepts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How contrary is this to the common Christian Doctrine, that we must obey none that command us to sin against God? For by the first assertion, and this, it seemeth that it cannot be a sin which the Bishops command.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I pray you put in an exception for the Power and Lives of Kings, and the Laws of the Land, and the Property and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subjects; and one word for the Protestant Religion. For we <hi>English</hi>-men think God to be greater than the King, or St. <hi>Patrick</hi>; and Gods Laws to be firmer than the Statutes of King and Parliament. And yet I doubt that the King and some Parliament will be angry if you do but say that the Bishops by consent may change their <hi>Statutes,</hi> or lawful Officers and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; And Bishops, if you say that Episcopacy may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Baptism, as such, entereth not the Baptized into any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, but only into the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> headed by Christ; yet a man may at the same time; be entered into the <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and into a <hi>particular Church,</hi> but that is by a double consent, and not by Baptism as such. In this I know none that agree with you but some few of the <hi>Independents</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and some of the <hi>Papists.</hi> I confess <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, That by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism we are virtually obliged to the Pope, being baptized by a Ministry, and into a Church, of which he is the Head. But the contrary is proved,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the express form of the Baptismal Covenant, which only tyeth us to Christ and his Universal Church, and maketh us Christians. But to be a Christian dedicated to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is one thing, and to be a part of the Pastoral Charge of <hi>A. B.</hi> or <hi>N. N.</hi> is another thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What particular Church was the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into? Not that of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for he was going from it, never like to see it more. Not that in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> for there was none till he began it. If you say, of <hi>Philips</hi> Church: 1. I pray you, where was that? 2. And how prove you it? 3. Specially
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48440:86"/>
if it was <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon that had no Church, being no Bishop.</p>
            <p n="3">3. May not men be baptized in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or among other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, or <hi>Indians,</hi> where there is no Church? And is the first baptized man among them, a Church himself? <hi>Paul</hi> thanketh God that he baptized no more of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> lest they should think that he baptized into his own name. And doth every Baptizer baptize to himself, or to his Bishop? A man may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize out of all Diocesses, or in another's.</p>
            <p n="10">X. As to your next Assertion, I grant, that when a Bishop or a beggar speaketh the Commands of God, and a King speaketh against it, we must follow that Bishop or beggar, rather than the King, because this is but obeying God before men. But supposing that it is a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> and but <hi>circa sacra,</hi> and not a <hi>proper part</hi> of the <hi>Agent Pastors Office,</hi> I confess to you, I will obey the King before the Bishop.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is a thing that is under the Power of the King to command; and if so, the King is the Supreme, and not the Bishop.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bishops themselves are Subjects of the King, and owe him obedience. Therefore rule not over or before him in matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his Office.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Bishops are chosen by the King, (for I suppose no man takes the Dean and Chapters choice for more than a Ceremony, that knoweth it); if the King command me to Preach at one hour, or one place, and the Bishop at another, or to use for Uniformity such a Translation, Metre, Liturgy, Utensils, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and the Bishops others, I will obey the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop. But if either or both command me <hi>to sin,</hi> I will obey neither so; and if they would take me off from that which Christ hath made a real part of my <hi>own Office</hi> (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that I shall preach and pray in <hi>no words</hi> but such as they <hi>prescribe, &amp;c.</hi>) I think neither hath power to do this.</p>
            <p>But Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> of <hi>Christian Obedience,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> in his <hi>Tortura Toetis,</hi> and <hi>Buckeridg</hi> of <hi>Rochester, and Grotius de imprrio sum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Potest. circa Sacra,</hi> have said so much of the Power
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48440:87"/>
of Kings about Religion, as that I think I need not add any more.</p>
            <p>And by the same Arguments that you will absolve me from obeying if <hi>the King forbid me to Preach,</hi> by the same you absolve, if the Bishop forbid me. If I may disobey <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> I may disobey <hi>Eusebius Nicomed. Theognis Maris.</hi> If I may disobey <hi>Theodosius</hi> junior, <hi>Anastasius, Zeno, Iustinian,</hi> I may disobey <hi>Petrus Moggus, Dioscorus, Severus, &amp;c.</hi> But you will much cross your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds if you tell the <hi>Londoners</hi> that they may preach and worship God though the King forbid them, but not at all if the Bishop forbid them. For he that exalteth himself, or is sinfully exalted by others, shall be brought low. If the reverence of the King were not greater in <hi>England</hi> than of the Bishops, the consciences of many thousands would stick but little at disobedience. There are so many cases first to be resolved. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether such Diocesans deposing all Parochial Churches (and Bishops) and reducing them to Chappels or parts only of a Church, be not against Christs Law?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether they destroy not the ancient order of <hi>particular Churches</hi> (Bishops) and Discipline?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Who made their office, and by what power?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Who chose and called them to it?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether their Commands be not null, as contrary to Gods?</p>
            <p n="6">6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How far Communion with them that silence hundreds of faithful Ministers, and set up in their stead— <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is lawful? Many such questions the people are not so easily satisfied in, as you are.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. And the three last all set together, look with an ill design: The Preface to Dr. <hi>Rich. Cousins</hi> Tables, tells the King, That the Church-Government here is the <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>derived from him,</hi> and <hi>dependant</hi> on him; and <hi>Grotius de Imperio sum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> potest.</hi> proveth at large the Power of Kings <hi>circa sacra,</hi> as doth <hi>Spalatensis,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; and that Canons are but good counsel, till the King make them Laws. And we know no Law-makers but the King and Parliament. But if the Church be the Expounders of the Liturgy, Rubrick and Canons, Articles and Acts of Uniformity, and out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48440:87"/>
of Convocation-time, the Bishops be the Church, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops be the Rulers of the Bishops, (that swear obedience to them) this hath a dangerous aspect: For then it is in the power of the Bishops (if not of the Archbishops only) to put a sense upon our 39 Articles, Rubricks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> consistent with Popery or Heresie, and so to change the Religion of the Kingdom, without King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or against them at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>And thus Officers of mans making, who become a Church of mans devising, may have advantage by this and the former Articles, to destroy Godliness, Christianity and Humanity.</p>
            <p>Indeed by the Preface to the Liturgy, the Bishop is made the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of any thing doubtful in the Book; and by the <hi>Index</hi> the Act of Uniformity is made part of the Book. But this affrighteth me the more from declaring:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because I must consent to all the Penalties and Impositions of the Act it self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the Bishop, Exposition is limited, so that it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to nothing in the Book.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you the reasons of my <hi>destructive Conference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I had been with you, and we had been to enter upon any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that tendeth to satisfaction, I would have endeavoured to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the common frustraters of Disputes, 1. By ambiguous words: 2. And subjects that are no subjects: Therefore if you desire any such dispute:</p>
            <p n="1">I. I intreat you to write me down your sense of some terms which we shall frequently use, (and I will do the like of any at your desire): As what you mean, 1. By the word <hi>Bishop.</hi> 2. By a <hi>Church.</hi> 3. By a <hi>particular Church.</hi> 4. By a <hi>Diocess and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Church.</hi> 5. By a <hi>National Church.</hi> 6. By the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi> 7. By <hi>Church Government and Iurisdiction.</hi> 8. By <hi>Schism.</hi> I shall dispute no terms unexplained, lest one take them in one sense, and the other in another, and so we dispute but about a sound of words.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I desire that the <hi>denied Subject</hi> of the Question may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted, instead of being proved.</p>
            <p>On these terms (supposing the common Laws of Disputation, especially avoiding words that have no determinate sense) I shall
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48440:88"/>
not refuse whenever you invite me; and I am able to debate with you any of these points that I am concerned in; especially, <hi>whether my Preaching Christs Gospel as I do, be my sin, or my duty?</hi> And if our great distance in Principles put either of us upon r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In Conclusion, remember I pray you, 1. That it is not the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Episcopacy (which was in <hi>Cyprians</hi> days; yea, which agreeth with <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Intimations, and <hi>Petavius</hi> excellent Notes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in Haeres.</hi> 69.) which I deny. And I conjecture that at this day in <hi>England</hi> there are more <hi>Episcopal</hi> than <hi>Presbyterian</hi> silenced <hi>Non-conformists.</hi>
