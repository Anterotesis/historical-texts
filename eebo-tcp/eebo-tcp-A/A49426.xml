            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Pieces of <hi>LUCIAN,</hi> which (as your <hi>Excellency</hi> can beare mee wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) were Translated for your <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Entertainment</hi> above five and twenty yeares since, like <hi>Fugitive servants</hi> broken forth out of your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, do now returne to you in a more <hi>Publike way.</hi> And truly, My Lord, whether it were <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> I know not, but they were here in this place ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>Wanderers</hi>; And when they went to the <hi>Presse,</hi> met the <hi>Whipping-post</hi> in their way, by
<pb facs="tcp:93795:3"/>
the over severe persecution of some needlesly <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell your <hi>Excellency,</hi> that <hi>Translations</hi> compared with their <hi>Originals</hi> are commonly pictures of very differing shapes; Or that the <hi>Conversion</hi> of the meanest Author from one Tongue into another is so hard a Taske, that the undertaker may as well contrive a Marriage between two disagreeing Elements; or beget a friendship between Fire and Snow, as reconcile the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>proprieties</hi> in which the severall. Tongues speake.</p>
            <p>For as the Painter who would draw a man of a <hi>bald head, rumpled fore-head, copper nose, pigge eyes,</hi> and <hi>ugly face,</hi> drawes him not to <hi>Life,</hi> nor doth the businesse of his Art, if he draw him less <hi>deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> or <hi>ugly</hi> then he is; Or as he who would draw a <hi>faire, amiable Lady,</hi> limbes with an erring pencill, and drawes a <hi>Libell,</hi> not a <hi>Face,</hi> if he give her not her just features, and perfections: So in the Translation of Bookes, He who makes a <hi>dull</hi> Author, <hi>Elegant</hi> and <hi>quick</hi>; or a <hi>sharp, elegant</hi> Author <hi>flat, rustick, rude</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> by contrary wayes commits the same sinne, and cannot be said to <hi>translate,</hi> but to <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</hi> Now of all Authours, I know none more hard to be render'd like Himselfe then <hi>Lucian</hi>: whose Greeke is not of one <hi>uniforme</hi> Webbe, like <hi>Plato, Thucidides, Polibius,</hi> or <hi>Eunapius</hi>; but of such a <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> Stile, and Composition, that his best Interpreters into Latine, <hi>Erasmus,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

Moore, Melancthon,</hi> and some others, after all their learned diligence have but made him speake like a <hi>raw Traveller</hi> from one Country to another, and to expresse his mind imperfectly in the <hi>broken language</hi> of the place. The <hi>sharpnesse</hi> of his <hi>wit,</hi> the <hi>salt</hi> of his Expressions, the <hi>humour</hi> of his stile, and the <hi>Ayre</hi> of His conceptions, which in all his Writings have a secret, charming mixture, will require a <hi>pen</hi> dipt often in the <hi>standish,</hi> and the very Soul and Genius of the Author transmigrated into the Quill and Fancy of the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How great a <hi>Rhetoritian,</hi> and <hi>Orator</hi> he was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by his <hi>Orations.</hi> Some of which for the weight of his Arguments, the Distribution, and close pursuit of the parts, the Roundnesse of his <hi>periods</hi>: the rare Art in the choyce of his words, and Transitions, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally sliding into one another, and musically tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a full floud, and torrent of perswasion: and yet like an even, un-interrupted stream, every where like himselfe, without <hi>Inaequalities,</hi> or <hi>swellings,</hi> may, without disparagement to such great Princes in that <hi>Art,</hi> stand in competition with the best <hi>Orations</hi> in <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> or <hi>Isocrates;</hi> And do farre exceed any thing spoken by <hi>Gorgius, Leontinus,</hi> or <hi>Aeschi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who in their Times were called the <hi>Eloquence</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, His <hi>Subject,</hi> like <hi>Quintilian's</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, is sometimes <hi>Poeticall,</hi> and <hi>Fayned.</hi> But so free from <hi>Impossibilities,</hi> both for the <hi>matter,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:93795:4"/>
the <hi>Dresse,</hi> the same skill which made him plead for the <hi>Dis-inherited Sonne,</hi> in any <hi>reall Court</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> would have sent him victorious from the Bar, and have made the <hi>Iudges</hi> side with his <hi>defended Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps some, who (without <hi>Rivals</hi>) do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>great Oratours,</hi> may differ from me in Opinion. But surely more out of <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Kindnesse</hi> to their own <hi>Meteor-compositions,</hi> then <hi>justice</hi> to <hi>Lucian</hi>: who, had he seen a self-conceited Preacher goe up <hi>bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> into the Pulpit, and there in a <hi>Tragicall</hi> stile, and voyce as <hi>Cothurnall,</hi> entertain his Hearers with a <hi>Romantick</hi> showre of words, which promised <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> the great <hi>Mountain</hi> of <hi>Discourse,</hi> but brought forth an <hi>abortive, poor, topicall Mouse;</hi> If he should hear a Text of Scripture transformed into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> pursued without just order, &amp; stuffed with Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bast, &amp; confusion; sometimes flying aloft into a thin cloud of Non-sence, as if the Preacher aymed at some high <hi>preferment</hi> in the <hi>Moon</hi>; or else had stolne his Sermon from <hi>Lucian's true History,</hi> which speaks of <hi>Ants</hi> &amp; <hi>Gnats</hi> as big as <hi>Elephants,</hi> and <hi>Whales</hi>; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes <hi>Battles</hi> fought by two <hi>Armies</hi> in the <hi>Sun</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puft up into such <hi>bubbles</hi> of Expression, as sound big to the <hi>eare,</hi> but are but <hi>bubbles</hi> to the <hi>eye,</hi> he would doubtless send such <hi>Garagantua, tumid</hi> Orators to the <hi>Doctor</hi> who cured his <hi>Lexiphanes</hi> of his <hi>Fustian</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, who upon the taking of a <hi>purge</hi> was deliver'd of a <hi>Tympany,</hi> and made to vomit all his <hi>tuffe, affected</hi> words, his <hi>Anodynes, Efforts,</hi> and <hi>Exertions</hi> up againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93795:4"/>But I do not wonder that such <hi>Opiniators</hi> should be <hi>sick</hi> of this <hi>Disease:</hi> who having succeded a <hi>canting Generation</hi> of men, whose <hi>Rhetorick</hi> was as <hi>rude,</hi> &amp; <hi>mechanick</hi> as their persons, do <hi>defile</hi> the English Tongue with their <hi>Republick words,</hi> which are most <hi>immusicall</hi> to the Eare, and scarce <hi>significant</hi> to a <hi>Monarchicall</hi> understanding. Words which are the meer <hi>Excrements</hi> of Language; which proceeded from the late <hi>Body politick</hi> of this <hi>Vncivilized Nation,</hi> and were not allowed their legitimate <hi>concoxion,</hi> but broke forth into the World with <hi>Brutishness,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> Coyned, &amp; minted by those <hi>Seditious, Rump</hi> Grammarians, who did put their own <hi>impressions</hi> to the Kings <hi>Silver,</hi> and so committed <hi>Treason</hi> against their <hi>Prince,</hi> and their own <hi>rude stamp</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> to their <hi>Goth</hi> and <hi>Vandall</hi> words; and so committed <hi>Treason</hi> against His <hi>good people. Quem penes Arbitrium est &amp;</hi> Ius <hi>&amp; Normaloquendi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it would make a man, who hath a true Taste in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and knowes from what <hi>fountains</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are to be drawn, what <hi>ancient Examples</hi> in that Art are to be followed, and what <hi>just measure</hi> of Oyle is to be powr'd into his <hi>Lamp,</hi> who will speak with success, fall into a fit of Indignation, when he hears a <hi>rumbling fellow,</hi> to whom a <hi>Trope</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> is unknowne, much more the <hi>Laws</hi> which give <hi>power</hi> and <hi>strength</hi> to a Discourse, start up a <hi>Rhetorician</hi> with no other <hi>furniture</hi> but <hi>Face, Impudence,</hi> and <hi>Noyse.</hi> And affront the ears of his hearers with a <hi>lump</hi> &amp; <hi>heap</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:93795:5"/>
such indigested <hi>stuffe,</hi> as hath no other excuse but that he <hi>spew'd</hi> it <hi>unpraemeditated.</hi> Such <hi>fellowes</hi> are only <hi>eloquent</hi> by <hi>faction</hi>; and nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from being like the <hi>tumultuary Orator,</hi> who bespoke a <hi>set</hi> of <hi>friends</hi> still to vote his speeches <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How exactly skiled in all sorts of <hi>Philosophy</hi> he was, and how fit to sit down in the <hi>chaire,</hi> and be the <hi>Iudge</hi> of <hi>Controversies,</hi> your <hi>Excellency</hi> may perceive by his <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>Logicall</hi> examination of all <hi>Sects,</hi> In his <hi>Hermotemus.</hi> From whence I know not whether <hi>Lactantius</hi> did not borrow his <hi>Christian Arguments</hi> to prove, that as they all grosly erred in their <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>true Happiness,</hi> (concerning which there were as many <hi>Opinions,</hi> as there were severall <hi>Schooles</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi>) so they were all no less mistaken in their <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> Both, like the <hi>Oracle,</hi> concluding <hi>Socrates</hi> to be the <hi>VVisest man</hi> for saying, That <hi>he only knew this one Truth, that he truly knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Wit</hi> (a thing never yet perfectly defined) He hath had this previledge beyond most other <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> That as it never wanted a solid <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> in <hi>Matter,</hi> so after so many Ages 'tis still <hi>Fresh</hi> and <hi>currant. Aristophanes,</hi> in a Comicall way, was doubtless one of the <hi>greatest wits</hi> of his Time. And the like might be said of <hi>Menander,</hi> if Time, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours its children, had left us more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his <hi>Fragments,</hi> to judg him by: yet their <hi>wit</hi> being only fitted to the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93795:5"/>
and <hi>Persons</hi> of their own <hi>present Times,</hi> for the most part entred with the <hi>Prologue,</hi> and expired with the <hi>Epilogue</hi> of their <hi>Comoedies.</hi> And is now <hi>wit</hi> to none but those, who have taken the paines to be acquainted with the <hi>Manners</hi> of that <hi>Age</hi>; And can raise Laughter to themselves from the help of a <hi>Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ast,</hi> to tell them, why <hi>Socrates</hi> was made <hi>ridiculous</hi> for being a <hi>grave man,</hi> or <hi>Cleon</hi> for being a <hi>Knight,</hi> and <hi>Senator</hi> of <hi>Athens.</hi>

            <p>The truth is, some kinds of <hi>wit</hi> are like some kinds of <hi>Garments,</hi> which hold fashion for a while, but grow old in the wearing, and are left off in compliance to a <hi>newer mode.</hi> Or as 'tis with <hi>small wines,</hi> which taste <hi>quick</hi> upon the place where they grow, but <hi>pawle,</hi> and <hi>dye,</hi> by the way, if they be transported by <hi>Sea</hi> into another Country.</p>
            <p>Men of vulgar Iudgments, and <hi>sanguine aâry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensions,</hi> think all <hi>wit</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sists in the sudden brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a <hi>Iest,</hi> or the <hi>quickness</hi> of an <hi>Epigram,</hi> or the <hi>Tooth</hi> of a <hi>Satyre,</hi> or the <hi>Newness</hi> of a Saying, which was not heard before: but these are but the <hi>lighter Ingredients</hi> of <hi>wit,</hi> which like <hi>Squibs, flash,</hi> and <hi>blaze,</hi> and <hi>perish</hi> in the <hi>kindling.</hi> To make <hi>wit</hi> last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and long lived, a well weighed mixture of <hi>Reason</hi> is required; A working Invention to <hi>contrive,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> a quick fancy to give the <hi>Edge,</hi> and a <hi>sharpe Iudgement</hi> to apply, and to shape, and square all this to present <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>Occasion.</hi> In all which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was so great a Master, that his <hi>Compositions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93795:6"/>
will be as lasting as the World. And his <hi>Images</hi> have already out-liv'd the Statues of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus,</hi> though to give them <hi>Immortality,</hi> they were carved, and wrought in <hi>Marble,</hi> and <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Brasse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all these <hi>Excellencies,</hi> set off with as great a <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>matter,</hi> as can possibly match <hi>profit</hi> with <hi>delight</hi>; some <hi>Vineger</hi> men, at whose <hi>Births</hi> sure <hi>Saturne</hi> raign'd, and convey'd his <hi>leaden Influence</hi> into their <hi>Morosity</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> are not content in their <hi>dull, pedantick</hi> way to persecute all <hi>wit,</hi> as <hi>vitious,</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> but seem wholy to incline to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn Sucklin's</hi> opinion, who made a <hi>rich Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of London to have the <hi>greatest wit,</hi> for being perfectly well gifted in the Art of <hi>getting Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these are they, My Lord, who have most wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly endeavour'd to change the <hi>fabulous Tradition,</hi> which goeth of <hi>Lucian's Death</hi> into <hi>true story; That returning from a Feast he was torne in pieces by Dogs.</hi> For first, among their other <hi>Ignorant aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> they have not stuck to call him <hi>Atheist</hi>: But is it not strange they should accuse Him of <hi>Atheism,</hi> who so ingeniously drove <hi>Idolatry</hi> out of the World? Before whose <hi>wit</hi> the <hi>Heathen Images</hi> fell to the Ground, as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the <hi>Arke</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Scripture? Who did the business of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> by taking their <hi>Divinity</hi> from God's of <hi>wood</hi> and <hi>stone</hi>? Who stopt the mouthes of <hi>Oracles,</hi> quencht the fires upon their <hi>Altars,</hi> turn'd their <hi>Temples</hi> into
<pb facs="tcp:93795:6"/>
               <hi>Deserts,</hi> undisguised their <hi>Delusions,</hi> and taught the cosen'd World that they payd deare for <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Cheats</hi>? Was he an <hi>Atheist</hi> who would not allow their <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be the <hi>Thunderer</hi> in Heaven, whose <hi>Sepulcher</hi> and <hi>Cradle</hi> were to be seen in <hi>Creet</hi>? Who thought no <hi>Religion</hi> was due to a <hi>Venus</hi> made of <hi>Ivory</hi>; or to an <hi>Aesculapius</hi> which was the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a <hi>Smith</hi>? Who laught at <hi>Gods</hi> made of the same <hi>Materials</hi> with their <hi>Altars</hi>; And thought an <hi>Apollo</hi> hewn out of a <hi>Tree</hi> not fit to be <hi>Worship't,</hi> but to <hi>Kindle</hi> an <hi>Oblation.</hi> If for this they call him <hi>Atheist,</hi> they cannot acquit <hi>themselves</hi> from being <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> They might as well affirme that <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Arnobius, Iustin Martyr,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Austin,</hi> and as many <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as armed their Pens against the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions</hi> of those Times, were bred in <hi>Lucian's Schoole</hi>: and like Him, were <hi>Atheists</hi> too. Since they onely in a <hi>sober</hi> way proved such <hi>Gods</hi> to be no <hi>Gods</hi>: He exposed them to the <hi>scorne</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of those who did adore them. So that for my part, I know not to whose writings wee more owe our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> where the <hi>true God</hi> hath succeeded such a <hi>multitude</hi> of false, whether to their <hi>grave confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or to his <hi>facetious wit.</hi>

            <p>Next, they object That hee is too <hi>Satyricall,</hi> and puts too much <hi>Gall</hi> into his <hi>Inke.</hi> 'Tis much to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected That <hi>They</hi> who thus object, are guilty of the <hi>Follies, Hypocrisies,</hi> and <hi>Crimes,</hi> which he with
<pb facs="tcp:93795:7"/>
so much <hi>pleasant wit</hi> labours to reforme. For if they were <hi>innocent,</hi> why should they read his Workes with such <hi>trembling apprehensions,</hi> as if he were risen from the dead to pluck off their <hi>Disguises,</hi> and say, <hi>Ye are the men I meane</hi>? Why should any man who is not like the <hi>Fantasticke Gentleman,</hi> who thought the bare having of a <hi>great Library,</hi> which hee understood not, nor ever meant to studie, would make him a great Scholar, quarrell with a <hi>dead Author,</hi> and speake hardly of his <hi>Ashes,</hi> for telling a story of one <hi>sick</hi> of this <hi>Disease,</hi> who bought <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus Candlesticks</hi> in hope it would make him a <hi>Philosopher</hi>? Or of one who at an excessive price bought <hi>Orpheus Harpe,</hi> thinking it would enable him to draw <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi> like Him, and without learning of the <hi>Art,</hi> would make him a <hi>rare Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>? Why should they be troubled with his <hi>Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of a <hi>Feast,</hi> where a company of <hi>Wrangling Philosophers</hi> met; who began the meale with a <hi>grave Discourse</hi> of <hi>Vertue;</hi> then <hi>drank</hi> themselves <hi>drunke</hi> in praise of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi>; Then, as their wine inspired them, proceeded to <hi>hard Notions</hi>; Then by vertue of a <hi>bigger Glasse</hi> to a <hi>comparison</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi>; From a <hi>comparison</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> to most <hi>rude, un-manlike Raylings</hi>; which concluded in a <hi>Civil Warre,</hi> where <hi>Platters</hi> were made <hi>weapons,</hi> and were changed to <hi>pewter Syllogismes,</hi> throwne at one anothers Heads? Was he too much a <hi>Satyrist,</hi> who called such a <hi>meale</hi> as <hi>this,</hi> by the name of the <hi>Battle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93795:7"/>
fought betweene the <hi>Lapithae's</hi> and <hi>Centaures</hi>? Or was his <hi>Character</hi> too <hi>Keene</hi> of such <hi>Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pretenders,</hi> for saying, that they were meere <hi>aequivocall</hi> Good men, whose Phylosophy and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue lay in their <hi>sowre lookes,</hi> their <hi>artificiall Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> their <hi>long beards,</hi> and <hi>formall Gownes</hi>? Did he bait his Hooke with too much Gall, who bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with Gold, by which he makes whole Sholes of such <hi>grave dissembling men,</hi> place <hi>Happinesse</hi> in <hi>Wealth,</hi> and swimme <hi>Captives</hi> to his <hi>Angle</hi>? If such <hi>Truths</hi> as <hi>these</hi> deserve the name of <hi>Satyre,</hi> I must confesse hee was the <hi>best Satyrist</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>But can they who thus reproach him with the <hi>sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of his <hi>wit,</hi> say he was an <hi>Enemy</hi> to any thing but <hi>Vice</hi>? Was there ever a <hi>fairer Picture</hi> drawne of a <hi>truly Learned, Vertuous man</hi> then his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monax</hi>?

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ROMETHEUS</hi> am I then? If good Sir, you say so, because my works have <hi>Earth</hi> in them, I allovv the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and confesse my selfe like him; nor refuse to be call'd a potter; though my Clay be much baser, and almost as barbarous and course, as that which lies in the street. But if over praysing my speeches for curious, and artificial, you entitle them to the wisest of the <hi>Titans,</hi> take heed lest some body say, you speak Ironie; and that you attire an Attick flout in a Commendation. But where, I pray, am I so curious? Or in which of my writings perceive you this overpolisht <hi>Promethean</hi> Wisedome? 'Tis enough for me that they are not wholy composed of <hi>Earth</hi>; or fit to be rewarded with <hi>Caucasus.</hi> But with how much more Justice may you be compared to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who are so fam'd for your pleadings, and for making Warres against the Truth? Yours are living, breathing works, and carry a heat with them, which hath flame in it; wherein you truely imitate <hi>Prometheus,</hi> only here's the difference; most of you work not in Clay, but raise golden pieces. I, who addresse my selfe to the Multitude, and glory in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention shew forth only some certain dead Images; And, as I said before, like puppet-makers, and potters, busie my selfe in clay; having neither life nor motion in my doings,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93795:10"/>
but making my Recreation and Play my businesse. I cannot then, but consider, whether you call'd me not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> as the Comoedian call'd <hi>Cleon,</hi> when he said <hi>Cleon</hi> was an after game <hi>Prometheus.</hi> Or as the Athenians call'd all those who made pots and pans, and wrought in clay, <hi>Prometheus</hi>; alluding, I suppose, to their materials, and the baking of their vessels in the fire. If this be the meaning of your <hi>Prometheus,</hi> you have aimed your dart aright, and have tipt it with an Attick sharpnesse, and point. Since my works are as frail, and brittle as their pots, and are ready to shiver and break upon the least dash of a stone. But some man, for my encouragement, will say, in comparing my doings to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> you have praysed their Novelty, as following no Copie, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As he when there were yet none, first invented, and framed Men; shaping and trimming his new Creatures so, as to be quick of Motion, and graceful in Aspect. Wherein though he were the Artificer, yet <hi>Minerva</hi> assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; who inspired the Clay, and breathed a Soul, and life into the Workmanship. Thus may some man say, and give a fair construction to your Words. And perhaps this was your meaning. But this satisfies me not, if I be thought a Broacher of Novelties; since nothing can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more ancient then that Originall by which my works are drawn. Yet if they wanted Gracefulnesse, or Beauty, I should both blush for them, and, would have you know, should tread them under foot. Who am not so taken with Noveltie, as not to despise it, if it come mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen. Since, should I think otherwise, I were worthy to be torn by sixteen Vultures; Not understanding how much the Deformity of things is increased by their strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> therefore the sonne of <hi>Lagus,</hi> having brought two strange things into <hi>Egypt,</hi> a <hi>Bactrian</hi> Camel all over black; And a man equally divided into two Colours, one halfe exactly black, the other exceeding white; and having assembled the Aegyptians in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93795:10"/>
and entertain'd them with many other shovves; at last presented the Camel, and party colour'd man, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raise their wonder by the sight. But they much frighted at the Camel, were ready to runne away in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult: Though he were deckt all over with gold, had trappings of purple, and a bridle inlaid with Jewels; The wealth or Treasure perhaps of some <hi>Darius,</hi> or <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> or <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But at sight of the man many laught: Others turn'd away their faces, as from some Prodigie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Ptolomy</hi> perceiving, that they took not as he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that the Aegyptians were not at all amazed with their strangenesse, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rather preferr'd things comely and well featur'd, caused them to be removed, not having the man afterwards in such value as before: And suffering the Camel to die neglected, he gave the two-colour'd man to one <hi>Thespis</hi> a Minstrell for playing well at a drinking. So I may well fear lest my works show like a Camel before the Aegyptians: However some men may admire their bridle, and purple. For that they are compounded of two excellent things, <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and <hi>Comedy,</hi> is not enough to give them Elegancy, and forme, unlesse there be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and measure, and harmony in the Mixture. For from two Excellencies may arise a disfigured composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is ordinarily reported of <hi>Centaures;</hi> which you will not call an amiable creature, but rather a Creature of Contempt: If we may believe painters, who alwaies limbe them amidst their drunkennesse, and slaughters. What then? may there not spring a well favour'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, from two beauties mixt? As when Wine is mingled with hony, may I not say both are sweetly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered? I will not earnestly affirme my writings to be such; But fear lest their Composition have corrupted their beauty. For <hi>Dialogue</hi> and <hi>Comedy,</hi> have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been friends, and matcht together, Since that kept at home, and delighted in solitary walks, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd discourse but with some few; whereas this wholy

On the other side <hi>Dialogue</hi> held reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend disputes of the nature of things, and of virtues of Philosophers; so that, according to the Proverb of the Musitians, there was twice the distance of all Gamut, from the highest note to the lowest and basest, between them; And yet have I dared to unite things of this distance, and to raise agreement from things disagreeing, and not well enduring fellowship: And from hence have reason to feare, lest I seem to have attempted something like to your <hi>Prometheus,</hi> in mingling a woman with a man, and do therefore undergoe your Arraignment. Nay, lest I have enterprized something worse, and conzened my Hearers by inviting them to bones cover'd with fat, and drest a <hi>Comick</hi> Laughter in the Gravitie of a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher. As for Thee very; of all things you can never charge that upon my writings. From whom should I steal? unlesse there be some one, not yet come to my knowledge, who hath written of Chimaera's, and Gyants. Besides, what would would you have me do? 'Tis good to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue an Enterprize once begun; since to change purposes belongs; to <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> not <hi>Prometheus.</hi>

               <p>Having purposed also, of a long time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a visit upon <hi>Nigrinus,</hi> the Platonick Philosopher, rising early, I went to Salute him, and knocking at his door, a boy carryed in the Message, and I was sent for in. At my first Entrance, I found him with a book in his hand, beset round with the Images of the ancient Wise-men. In the midst of the room stood a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bestrewed with Geometricall Diagrammes, &amp; figures; and a Sphere resembling the Universe. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting me very friendly, he askt me how I did; I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made him an account, for return, askt him how he did, and whether his resolution held for another voyage into <hi>Greece.</hi> He no sooner began to speak, and to open his mind, but his words fell upon me in such a showre of <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> that me-thought (if ever there were any) I was among <hi>Homers</hi> ancient Syrens, and Nightingales. So Divinely he uttered himselfe, when falling into the praise of Philosophy, and the Child thereof, Liberty, he laught at those things which the vulgar esteeme good; Riches, Glory, Kingdomes, and Honour, Gold also, and Purple; and those other things prized commonly by the most, and till then by me. Which I received with an attentive
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93795:12"/>
and open mind, saw not for the present, the thing to which I might compare my selfe: but was cast into a Distraction; sometimes greiving to hear those things most precious to me, Riches, Gold and Glory disproved; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most weeping at their Confutation; now again accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them bale and contemptible. Much joyed, though, that I now began to look through the clouds, and Gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minesse of my former life: wherefore wholy forgetting the cure of my eyes, as a vanity, my mind by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle began to be very sharp sighted, which till then I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with me blind; till passing on, I became the thing whereof you accuse me; a Man advanced, and carried aloft by his discourse, and unable ever since to submit to small contemplations. For that happen'd to me concerning Philosophy, which is reported to have happen'd to the Indians concerning Wine; who being naturally hot, upon their first taste of a liquor so enflaming, presently grew mad, and were twice as much enraged as other men. Just so doe I appear to you, drunk and reeling with all discourses; though this is not to be drunk, but discreet and sober.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lucian.</speaker>
               <p>I would faine, (if it may be without your trouble) hear his discourses reported, securing them from my disdain, being such a hearer as is both a friend to your selfe, and one who hath heretofore spent time in such lofty studies.</p>

               <speaker>Philosoph:</speaker>
               <p>I obey your desires Sir, since according to that halfe verse in <hi>Homer,</hi> you petition One already willing; who, if you had not prevented me, had volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily craved your attention. For I desire to make you a witnesse to others, that I am not mad without reason; it being my delight to exercise, and make repetitions to my selfe, though no body be present; and twice or thrice a day solitarily to revolve what I heard. And as lovers supplie the absence of those they love with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Words or Actions, and fixing their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93795:13"/>
thoughts upon them, couzen their Longings with their memory, as if those they loved were present; framing to themselves imaginarie Dialogues, and takeing pleasure in those things which they then seem to hear, as when they were at first spoken; and applying their minds to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things past, busie themselves as if they lay before them: so I take no small satisfaction in recollecting those absent discourses of Philosophy which I once heard; and like Sea-men, or Travellers in the dark, do steer my Course by this Candle, alwaies imagining that man to be present to my Actions, and as it were still hearing his discourse; sometimes raising my Contemplation, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I have his face in my eyes, and his words in my eares; so truly did he verifie that of the <hi>Comedian,</hi> and left a sting in his Hearers.</p>

               <p>You say true, my friend, and what is fit; But first I pray have you seen an ill Tragick or Comick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; those I mean who are hist, who spoiling good Poems with bad Actions, are at last pluckt off the stage, though the play, perchance, deserve Bayes and Clappes?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philosoph:</speaker>
               <p>Because I fear lest I seem to you to imitate them; whilest giveing no right order to my rehearsall, I corrupt his meaning by my weaknesse, and wrong the Play by repetition. As for my selfe your disallowance will not much trouble me; But I should be sorry a good argument should suffer in my delivery, or grow disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured under my performance. Remember then, that through my whole Narration the Actors faults be not lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Poet, but remove him far from the stage, as not concerned by that which is done in the Theater. I, in the meane time, will give you a taste what a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93795:13"/>
I am for my memory; otherwise not at all differing from a messenger in a Tragedy. Wherefore if I report any thing imperfectly, think that which was left out, best; and that the Poet would have told it with more advantage: and then if you hisse me, I shall not much care.</p>

You would adde now, that you stayed not long with him, and that you come unprovided to speak, and that 'twere better hear him make his own report; and that you brought not away all, but as much as was possible for you at that time to binde up in your memory. Were you not about to say thus? I shall therefore hold you excused, and desire you to think you have Spun a sufficient preface to your Story: Since I, for my part, am ready to give you my applause; whereas if you tire me longer, I shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my vexation by the way, and hisse aloud.</p>

               <p>Surely 'twas in my purpose to say as much as you have past over; and to have added, besides, that to deliver things in this order, and to draw them into the like continued web, is to me impossible; since striving to make him speak with my voice, I should once more be like those players, who sustaining the person of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> or <hi>Creon,</hi> or <hi>Hercules,</hi> and being richly drest, and looking majestickly, and straining to speak bigge, come off in a slender, treble, womanish voice, much smaller then that of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> or her daughter <hi>Polyxena</hi>: least therefore their Accusations become mine, by acting a part too great for me, and thereby disgraceing my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, I will speak in my owne naked person; least where I slippe, that Divine personage, whom I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, should fall with me.</p>

The entrance to this discourse, then, was a Commendation of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the students at <hi>Athens,</hi> who were equally bred to Philosophy, and want; neither vainly delighted with the sight of the Citizens; nor so taken with strangers as by their new fashions to corrupt their education; But if any came among them so disposed, they by little and little transformed him, and untaught him his former manners; and wrought him into a purer kind of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and carriage. I remember he told a story of one of those spanglers, and glittering men, who came to <hi>Athens</hi> very brave, and gallant, numerously attended, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously apparelled; who supposed himselfe to be much ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated by all the Athenians, and thought a Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but appeared to those a man much to be pittied; who presently began to instruct him, not harshly, or openly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him to live in a free Citty, as he pleased. But after he began to be troublesome to their Schooles, and Bathes, thronging all Passengers with his Crowd of followers, one in a concealed low voice, scarce able to reach him, would say, I was affraid least this gallant would have been smoother'd at washing: Another, the Bathes have enjoyed a long peace, what need of such an Army then? He in the mean time over-heard things as they were, and took in Instruction. Again when he took off his Imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, and purple, pleasantly jeering his Flowers, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, some would say, The spring is come: others, From whence flew this peacock? others, Perhaps these feathers were his mothers, and the like. And so passing their scoffes on other things, sometimes they would flout the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his Rings: sometimes the superfluous curling of his haire: sometimes the Luxury of his Diet, till insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he grevv discreet, and being thus publickly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, departed much better then he came. Hovv little they are ashamed to professe poverty, appears by a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage vvhich he recounted to me, vvhich happen'd pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly at the celebration of the Athenian Games;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93795:14"/>
vvhere one of the Town was apprehended and brought before the Judge of the sports, for coming to the shovv in a died suit; vvhich vvhen the rest savv, they pittied the man, and besought his pardon; and vvhen the crier proclaimed, he had broke the Law, which allowed no spectators so apparell'd, as if they had before consulted, they all cryed out with one voice, that liberty should be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one so arrayed, seeing he had no more cloathes. Such passages as these he much extol'd; as also the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the place, the frugality of their Diet, the Calmes, and tranquillity of the people which they possesse un-envied. Assuring me withall, that their life was agreeable to their Philosophie; and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preserve manners in their purity; and that to a vertuous man, and one who had learn'd to despise Riches, and had resolved to order his life by these things which were naturally honest, no place afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such suiteable Conversation. But to a man that loved wealth, and took delight in Gold, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured happinesse by his power, and purple; who never tasted liberty, or made tryall of freedome, or beheld Truth, but was bred up in flatteries, and servitude, vvho sacrificed his soule in obedience to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and loved luxurious feastes, or excesse of wine, or use of women, filling himselfe with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures, Cousenage, and lies: As also to him who took pleasure in light Musicke, or in loose lascivious songs, the conversation of this place was most proper. For here every street, and market place is stored with the things which they most affect; and men are free to take in pleasure at all their gates and senses, their eyes, their eares, their smell, their palate, their Imbracements, and Touch; which running in one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, muddy, troubled stream, drownes and overflowes all passages; Adultery, and covetousnesse, and perjury, and such a tribe of pleasures, meeting there together in one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93795:15"/>
chanell: whence the soule being over-whelmed by a deluge, modestie, vertue, and justice become utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, and lost; leaving the place void and empty, and in their stead a thirst, and spring of vices of severall kinds and formes. This character he gave me of this City, the nurse and mistresse of such vertues. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, said he, no sooner set sail from <hi>Greece,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived neer my owne shoare, when recollecting my thoughts I askt my selfe the reason of my returne; Applying that verse of <hi>Homer</hi> to my selfe, O most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wight, why leaving <hi>Phoebus</hi> light, (<hi>Greece</hi> you must suppose, and the happinesse, and the liberty of those parts) art thou come back? that thou mayest behold the disorder of this place, Sycophants, proud salutes, prolonged suppers, flatterers, murthers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of dead mens wills, and dissembled friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe? or what wilt thou doe, who canst neither reforme, nor yet practice the bad Customes of the place? Reasoning thus with my selfe? as <hi>Iupiter</hi> did <hi>Hector,</hi> so I withdrew my selfe from the pikes, and slaughters, and skirmishes of the World; resolving ever after to keep at home, and proposing to my selfe this womanish, or (as some may call it) dastardly course of life. I hold discourses with <hi>Philosophie, Plato,</hi> and <hi>truth</hi>: And placeing my selfe as if I were in some populous Theater, I look downe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft upon the Carriage of affaires abroad; partly as they are able to stirre recreation, and provoke laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, partly as they are able to prove the Constancie of a resolute man. For if it be seemly to speak in praise of vice, you cannot imagine where the exercise of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is greater, or where mindes undergoe stronger tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, then amid'st the manners of this City. For 'tis no small victory to resist so many temptations, so many charming spectacles, and attracting allurements: But like <hi>Ulysses</hi> to sail by them, not with hands bound,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93795:15"/>
(which were cowardly) nor with eares stopt with wax, but with attention, and loose, requires a mind sublimated, and raised above them. You will admire Philosophie, if you set it in comparison with such mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and contemne the Goods of fortune, beholding, as it were in a Scene, or varying Comedie, a servant sometimes to come forth a master, a rich man to become poor; And on the contrary, a beggar to become a Lord, or Prince; one man to be a friend, another an enemy, a third an exile. But the thing most deplorable is, that though fortune plainly testify that the businesses of mortals are her pastime; and though men daiely see that nothing is stable, and fixt, yet they still itch after riches, and great place, and still walke on in the pursuit of succeslesse hopes. Now whereas I told you 'twas fit to laugh and raise mirth from ordinary Occurrences, so I will give you some examples. Is't not good Comedie to see rich men display their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, brandish their rings, and bewray so much folly? But the great vanity of all is, that they salute those they meet by others mouthes, and account it a great favour to vouchsafe them a look. Others more venerable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Adoration, are not to be saluted a far off, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Persian manner, but are to be approach't with a low obeysance; And in fashioning your addresse before you come neer, you are to signifie the humility of your mind, by the posture of your body; and then are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to kisse their breast or hand: which in those who were never so favoured, stirres a matter of emulation, and regard, whilest you, all the while, deliver your selfe over to be cousen'd. Where I cannot but praise their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, for not saluting us with their mouth. Much more ridiculous are those their retainers, and clients, who rising at mid-night, fetch a Compasse, and walke about the Citty; and after all are excluded by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; and suffer themselves to be called dogges, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and the like. The reward of their tedious Circuit,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93795:16"/>
is a troublesome supper, and the cause of many mischiefes; where eating much, and drinking more then is fit, and speaking many things not to be named, at last finding fault and discontent they depart, either blaming their entertainment, or disrespect, or the basenesse of the invitation: Bespewing the Lanes also, and Allies, as they passe; or quarrelling in vile baudy-houses; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by most of them the next day are fain to keep their beds, and to send for Chirurgeons; others, most absurdly, scarce refrain making visits in their sicknesse. I, in the mean time, hold these who thus flatter, much more miserable and lost, then those who are flattered: as being the principall authors of the others pride. For when they admire their plenty, and extoll their wealth, and every morning beset their doors, and in their ordinary accost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments salute them as their Masters, what must the others think of themselves? Whereas, if by common agreement they would forbeare, though it were but a while, this voluntary servitude, do you not think the rich would come a begging to poor mens doors, and make suit to them not to let their Felicity lie without spectators, and witnesses? or the bravery of their tables, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their Buildings, to stand uselesse and unregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? For none are so enamoured of their treasures, as to think themselves therefore happy because they have them; since possession would give little value to stately palaces, Chests of Gold, and boards of Ivorie, were there not some body to admire them. 'Twere fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the Abatement of their estimation and power, to encounter rich men with contempt; since humouring of them increases their folly. But for men unletter'd, and openly professing ignorance, to doe thus, may perhaps be thought tolerable. That which most deserves a Satyre, is, that those who make profession of Philosophy, doe things yet more ridiculous. How think you, am I troubled in my soule, when I see a man of reverend years
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93795:16"/>
mingle himselfe with a troop of flatterers, and give his attendance to some great officer, and at supper to mix discourse with other retainers, yet the more taken notice of for his habits sake? Though I stomack most that they change not their garb, as well as act all the other parts in the Play. For as for those things which passe at such invitations, to which of the flatterers are they to be compared? Doe they not eate with much lesse modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are they not much more apparently drunk? They alwaies rise last, and strive to carrie away more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And if there be any one of them of a finer educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many times he will offer to sing. These things he observed as ridiculous, particularly also taxing those who taught Philosophy for reward, and sold vertue, as it were, in the market; calling their Schools shops, and shambles; and thinking it most reasonable, that he who taught others to despise wealth, should first render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe above gaine: since it was his owne ordinary course, not only to instruct those who would learne gratis, but if need were to supply their wants out of his generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of riches; being so farre from coveting things which did not concerne him, as not to bend his cares to the preservation of those things which were his owne; for many years not once vouchsafeing to visit a farme which he had neer the City. For first, he made question whether he might call it his owne: proceeding I suppose by this distinction, that by nature we are not Lords of any thing; but that by law, and succession, we obtain an uncertain possession, and use of things; and are for a little time called owners; and when our set terme is expired, that then they passe on to another, who bares that name. Many other exemplary things he had in him worthy of imitation; the plainnesse of his diet, the moderation of his exercise, the gravity of his person, the decency of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, but above all the equall temper, and sweetnesse of his behaviour. His manner was to admonish such as resorted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93795:17"/>
to him, not to deferre their amendment, (as many do; who set themselves certain feasts, and solemne times, from whence to beginne to leave off lying, and to do things which are honest) maintaining that the imbracements of vertue ought to be without delay. He also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned those Philosophers very much, who placed the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of vertue in accustoming their young Schollers to the labours, and hardnesses which they were to resist; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them sometimes to be bound, and whipt; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, somewhat more elegant, used to cut prints in their flesh with a rasour: whereas, said he, 'twere much better to beget an hardinesse and courage in their soules first; that way of education being still to be preferred, which partly regards the minde, partly the body, partly the learners age, and former course of breeding; it being a great fault in Tutors to taske their Schollers beyond their abilities; since many too hard set have died under their impositions. One I knew, said he, who having tasted their cruell disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, at the first hearing of more rationall discourses (as if he had then come to himselfe) irrecoverably forsook them, and lived ever after very contentedly. Here he past on, and speaking of other professions, at last fell upon the disturbances, and Justlings of the Citty; not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Theater, the horse-race, Horsemens statues, names of great horses, and the Crackes made of them in by-Corners. For, said he, there is not a more usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all madnesse then that of Horse-race; wherewith also many who weare the countenance of vertue are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. After this entring, as it were, upon another Act of the play, he toucht upon those passages which fall out at funeralls, and making of wills: Adding, moreover, that the Romans in all their life time uttered but one true word, meaning in their wills; so that the Testator never enjoyes the benefit of his owne truth. I could not refraine laughter, when he proceeded, and said, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans desired to have their ignorance buried with them,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93795:17"/>
and yet proclaimed their stupidity by their wills; whilest some command those cloathes of best value worn by them in their life time to be burnt with them; Others leave so many servants to attend their graves; Others give order for the crowning of their pillars with chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; prolonging their folly beyond their funeralls; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to conjecture what they did alive, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for such monuments after their death. For these are they, said he, who buy only that meat which costs most, who at their entertainments drink wine with musick, and Odours; who in the midst of winter crown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with roses, which they prize from their unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, and scarcity; disdayning those as worthlesse which are of a timely and naturall growth. These are they who drink perfumes: where, by the way, he carp't at those who knevv not hovv to order, and use their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; but sinned by the preposterous shuffling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of them; suffering them utterly to trample upon and vvaste the soule; being, according to that saying of the Tragedy, themselves hurried beyond the mark. This he said, vvas a meere soloecisme in pleasure; Imitating <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> I believe, in his reprehension. For as he found fault vvith God for making a Bull, and not placeing his hornes before his eyes; so he blamed those vvho vvore Garlands, and knevv not their right place; For, said he, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Ayre, or sent of violets, and roses, they should vveare them just under their noses, and neer the place of breathing as may be, that the smell may strike their sense the stronglier. He laught also at those vvho spent their studies in the contrivance of curious entertainments; affecting unknovvn sauces, and variety of dishes, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves to so much charge and trouble for the love of a short transitory pleasure. For he made it a clear case, that all their paines vvere laid out upon the bredth of four fingers, vvhich, said he, is the measure of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest throat; For they cannot enjoy the pleasures of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93795:18"/>
dainties before they eat them; nor differ they in taste, though never so costly, from courser fare after they have eaten them. It remaines, then, that after their great sums, they bought meerly that short pleasure which they took in the passage and going down. And they are justly punisht, said he, for their ignorance, who understand not those true pleasures which Philosophy bestowes on the industrious. He discourst to me, also, many things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Bathes: How vainly they are frequented; what affronts are there offer'd; how some are carried thither upon their servants shoulders, as it were to their funeral. One thing ordinarily practised in the City, but most usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in Bathes, he much inveighed against: That is, to have some servants go before to warne them to look to their footing, as they are to passe over some hole, or by some place which jets out; most absurdly instructing them how they are to tread. A thing in his judgment much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of: that since they did not dine or suppe with others mouthes or hands, nor hear with others eares, yet being in perfect sense they should imploy others eyes to see for them, and be guided by directions scarce fit to be given to men blind or lame; and this at mid-day, in the open street, when as they themselves have the managing of the state. This and much more he briefly past over, and so ended his discourse. I all the while listening to him like one entranced, and still fearing he should give over. For he was no sooner silent, but that befell me which happen'd to the people of <hi>Corcyra.</hi> Long fixt I mine eyes upon him like one inchanted; Then suffering in my selfe a great confusion, and Tumult, first I fel into a cold sweat, next labouring to speak, I sunk down, and was unable: my voice failed, and my tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied its office; and to conclude, for want of other expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, I fell a crying. For his discourse did not lightly raze my skin, or leave in me a casuall impression; but the stroke was deep, and home, and his speech so rightly ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that, as I may so say, it entred, and cleft my very soule.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93795:18"/>
For if, under correction, I may now passe my judgment of Philosophicall discourses, this is my opinion of them: The mind of every ingenious man is like a loft delicate Butt; many Archers there are in the world, who carry quivers filled with discourses of all sorts; yet all doe not hit the marke: But some drawing their Bow too hard, give too much force to their Shaft, which flies home, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but stickes not; but through too much strength passes through the Butt, leaving a great gappe and wound in the Soule. Others again on the contrary through the weaknesse of their Armes, and slacknesse of their Bow, shoot not home; but their Arrowes languishing in their flight, fall down many times in the mid-way: Or if they chance to reach the marke, they doe but superficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch it, and leave no impression; as not being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with might enough. But a good Archer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and like him I spoke of, will exactly consider whether the Butt be not too soft, or too hard for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: (for there are some Markes not to be pierced) and as he makes his discovery, dipping his Shaft (not in poyson, like the <hi>Scythians,</hi> nor in harmfull juyces, like the <hi>Cretans,</hi> but) in poignant, and soveraigne Medicines, he discharges; allowing such just aim to his shot, as to pierce and not passe through, but to remain and stick, till the vertue of the dart, diffusing it selfe, over-spread and season the whole mind. And this is that which at once stirres the delight, and teares of the hearers. As it then befell me, when I felt his Balsam gently creep over my Soule. I applyed therefore unto him that verse:
<q>
                     <l>Still shoot, if unto men thy darts prove rayes.</l>
                  </q>
For as those who hear a <hi>Phrygian</hi> Cornet winded, doe not all run mad; but those onely who are possest with their Goddesse, upon the sound of the charme, fall into their former distractions: so all who hear Philosophers doe not depart astonisht and wounded, but those only between whose Soules and Philosophie, there is some sympathy and alliance.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93795:19"/>
bright Father, when she was yet a Girle, out of extreame love, she much lamented his death; And thereupon, by the power of some God, was put into feathers; and hath ever since in the shape of a Bird flown about the Sea in search of him.</p>

               <speaker>Chaerephon.</speaker>
               <p>A Kings-Fisher call you her? I never heard her before; and therefore to me she seemed some outlandish fowle. Truely she sings in a very mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tune; pray, <hi>Socrates,</hi> what manner of Bird is it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Socrates.</speaker>
               <p>Not great, <hi>Chaerephon,</hi> unlesse it be for the great honour she hath received from the Gods for her love to her husband. For all the while she sits, though in the middest of winter, the world enjoyes Halcyon daies, of a different calmenesse from other times; whereof this day is one. See you not how clear the Heavens are? and how the Sea without wave or billow, resembles for smoothnesse a mirrour, or Glasse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chaerephon.</speaker>
               <p>True. This is, indeed, a Halcyon day; and yesterday was such another. But for Gods sake tell me, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> may I give credit to what you said, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that women have been raised out of Birds; or that Birds have been transform'd into women? It sounds to me altogether impossible.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Socrates.</speaker>
               <p>O my friend, <hi>Chaerephon,</hi> we are but purblind Judges of what is possible, and impossible. For we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce according to the ignorant, faithlesse, dull abilities of men; And therefore, many things in themselves easie, seem to us difficult; and many things in themselves attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, seem to us not to be attained: And this befalls us sometimes through unexperience, sometimes through the infancy of our mindes. For compared to the first cause every man, though never so old, is but a child; And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Aeternity our whole life is but a childhood, and spanne. How then can they who know not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Gods discourse of them, or precisely tell what is possible, and what is not? you saw the storme, <hi>Chaerephon,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93795:20"/>
about three daies since, what lightnings, and Thunders, and tempestuous winds were there? some man would tremble at the thought of them, fearing least the whole world would have fallen to ruine: yet you see it ended in a wonderfull Calme, which lasts yet. Which, then, think you is the harder, and more unlikely, to raise a still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of a blustring tempest, and to cast faire weather over the world, or to change the shape of a Woman into the forme of a Bird? we see children every day raise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall figures, and shapes, from wax or clay. Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to God, who is too great and excellent to be brought into Comparison with our performances, all these things are most familiar, and easy. How much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is the Heaven then you, can you tell?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chaerephon.</speaker>
               <p>No, <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor any man els: such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons are not to be known, or taken measure of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Socrates.</speaker>
               <p>Well then! do we not see the vast dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of some men compared with others, and how they differ in their impotencies, or strength? what wondrous difference is there between a man of mature age, and a child five or ten dayes old, both for their infirmity, and might; as also for all the Actions of life, whither they be the defence of those our walls so often assaulted, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther performances either of body or mind? which things cannot possibly enter into the apprehension of a child? Then, for greatnesse of strength, a grown man carries no proportion, or measure, to a child; vvho vvith one hand can easily overcome millions of them. For naturally men are born of an age at first altogether unexpert, and unfit for action. If, then, one man so much excell another; hovv much the Gods excell us, they may consider vvho have abilities for such contemplations. It vvill, therefore, I doubt not, seem credible to most, that as much as the whole world exceeds <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Chaerephon</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude and space, so much doe they exceed us in power and providence, and wisdom. Many things, therefore,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93795:20"/>
to you and me, and such as we are, seem impossible, which to others are easie. For to winde a Cornet well to those who cannot play, and to read or write to those who are ignorant of Grammar, showes more impossible then to make women of Birds, or Birds of women. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we see, finding in a Comb of Wax a shapelesse worme, without Legges or Feathers, gives it Winges, and feet, and enamelling it with great diversity of fair coloures, produceth a Bee, the wise Architect of Divine honey: out of dumb senselesse egges she formes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall sortes of flying, walking, swimming Creatures, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted (as 'tis thought) by the Sacred influence of the skie. We therefore, poor mortalls and infants, who can neither comprehend great matters, nor understand small, but doubt of most things, even of those which concern our selves, can say little concerning the power of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods, or of their transformations of Kings-Fishers, or nightingales. Onely as the Glory of the Fable hath bin Conveyed to me from my Ancestors, so will I, to the praise of thy songes, O thou bird of mourning, convey it to posterity; and will often repeat thy vertuous love of thy Husband to my Wives Xantippe, and Mirto; not forgetting the honour bestowed upon thee by the Gods: and doe you <hi>Chaerephon,</hi> doe the like.</p>

               <p>It would aske a long speech, <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and much preparation to repeate all your offences: It shall suffice me to recount onely their heads. First, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to cast Lots for a Sacrifice, you kept the best for your selfe, and cheated the King; next, you made men, which was not fit; lastly you stole Fire from us, and bore it to them: wherein, in my opinion, you did very indiscreetly, to provoke <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is such a friend to men. Now if you deny this, for your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convincement, 'twill be fit I enlarge my selfe, and try to make the truth of things yet plainer. If you confesse that you made a false Division of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and that you formed men, and stole Fire, my Accusation will be full, and I should but trifle to say more.</p>

               <p>Whither you have not spoken trifles all this vvhile, vve shall see anon; I, since you think you have made such a full accusation, vvill strive, as vvell as I can, to dissolve it: First, then, lend me your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention concerning the Sacrifice. I call Heaven to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whether in making my defence, I blush not for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to think he should be so poor spirited, and whining, as for one small Bone, which came
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93795:22"/>
to his share, to send hither so ancient a God, as I am, to be crucified; not remembring of what assistance I have been to him, nor weighing how childish the ground of his displeasure is, to be angry, and fret, because he had not the greater piece. Nor do I think, <hi>Mercury,</hi> that cheats of Entertainment are to be remembred, but that all faults committed at feasts are to be reckon'd sport; and that he was to leave his anger behind him at the Table. But to bury his hate till the next day, and to lay up a past injury, and keep it in fresh memory, is neither Kingly, nor like a God. For take away from Banquets wit, breaking of Jests, putting of Tricks, Jeeres, Comicall abuses, and laughter, and nothing will remaine but drunkennesse, surfets and silence; Things dull and unpleasant, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a Feast. I, therefore, could not imagine <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> could have remembred things the next day; much lesse have proved so Cholerick, or taken matters so hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously, if in the division of a little flesh, one should make sport with him, and make triall whither he knew how to choose the better part. But put the worst, <hi>Mercury,</hi> that I gave him not the lesser piece, but deceived him of all; must he therefore (according to the proverb) bring heaven and earth together, and project fetters, Crosses, whole moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and Eagles to devoure my liver? Look if such proceedings as these do not betray great weaknesse, and poornesse of Spirit, and inclination to revenge. If he do thus for a little beefe, what would he have done for the losse of a whole Oxe? Mortall men deal much discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier in the like cases, then so; who should be proner to, wrath then the Gods. For never any yet crucified his Cook, for dipping his finger in the sauce, and licking it; or for cutting a slice of beefe from the spit, and eating it: but rather pardon'd him; or if he were very angry, gave him only a cuffe on the eare, or a blow on the cheek. But never any was crucified for things of this light nature. And thus much be spoken concerning the flesh; a matter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93795:23"/>
unworthy of my defence, but much unworthier of his complaint. I proceed to speak next of my workmanship, and Creation of men: which falling under a twofold charge, I know not, <hi>Mercury,</hi> of which you acuse me most; whither because it was not fit for men to be made at all, but to have laine unformed, and the Earth to have remained unoccupied; or because they should have been made otherwise, and of another shape, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. I shall easily reply to both; and will first endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove that the production of men is no hurt or dammage to the Gods; next that 'tis of much more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and advantage to them, then that the earth should lie desolate, and unpeopled, whereby it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whither I have offended in my gracefull formation of men, the only creature of a divine and heavenly race. For the earth was a rude, shapelesse thing, grown over with thickets, and dark woods: the Gods had neither Altars, nor Temples, nor Images, nor statues; who are now every where adored with much reverence. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (for 'twas ever my care to provide for the common, and to advance the honour of the Gods, and to project things of ornament and beauty) did cast with my selfe, whither I could do better then take a peece of clay, and forme Creatures like us Gods, in visage and figure. For this, methought, was wanting to our Divinitie; that there was not a contrary, or foyle, which set in Comparison with us; might set off our felicity: which neverthelesse was to be some mortall thing, though otherwise most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, understanding, and sensible of the best things. At length, according to that saying of the Poet, mixing earth with water, and working it into a soft mortar, I framed men; requesting <hi>Pallas</hi> to assist me in my work. This is my great offence against the Gods: and how great my punishment is you see, only because, forsooth, I raised creatures out of Clay, and gave motion to a thing which before moved not. And as if the Gods were the lesse
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93795:23"/>
Gods, because there are mortalls on earth, therefore <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is thus displeased, thinking the number of the Gods diminish't by the production of men: unlesse he be affraid least they should attempt a rebellion, and make warre upon the Gods, as the Giants did. 'Tis plain then, <hi>Mercury,</hi> that there is no fault either in me, or my work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship. If you can show any though never so small, I will be silent, and will think I suffer deservedly. But that the Gods are hereby much benefitted, you may easily learn, if you be hold the Earth no longer untill'd or unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured, but adorned with Cities, Agricultures, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous plantations; the Sea navigated; Ilands inhabited; Altars every where erected, sacrifices offered, Temples and solemnities frequented; streets fill'd with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and markets with men. Had I made this Creature for my selfe only, I had bin the wealthiest of all the Gods. But I wrought for the publick, and for the rest; especially for <hi>Iupiter, Apollo,</hi> and you <hi>Mercury</hi>; whose Temples are every where to be seen, but not one for <hi>Prometheus.</hi> Can you, then, at all perceive, that I have considered my selfe, and have diminisht or taken from the Common? Tell me, <hi>Mercury,</hi> can you think possessions desireable without a spectatour; or any peece of workmanship pleasant, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to the owner, if not seen and praised? which I therefore say, because if men had not been made, the beautie of the Universe had lackt a witnesse, and we should have possest riches neither admired by others, nor valued by our selves: Nor should we have wherevvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to comfort our selves, or understand hovv happy vve are, did vve not see others voide of our condition. Thus great things seem great by their comparison vvith lesse. But you, vvho ought to have honoured me for this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick service, have revva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93795:24"/>
the like among us, and that heaven might not be accused as well as the Earth, for producing us. But, you will say, there is a burden cast upon us to take care of their affaires. For the same reason a shepheard may count it a Burden that he hath a flock, because he is troubled to look after it. Though, indeed, this very trouble be season'd with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and this care be delightfull in the exercise. Besides, how should we spend our time, if there were none to busie our providence? Sit idle, and do nothing but drink Nectar, and stuffe our selves with Ambrosia? But that which vexes me most is, that you inveigh most against me for making women, and yet love them, and are still descending to them, sometimes like Bulls, sometimes like Satyres, sometimes like swannes, and are content to make them Goddesses. But, say you, 'twas fit men should be made, but after another manner, and not like us. What other patterne should I propose to my selfe, then that which I knew to be most excellent? unlesse I should have made a witlesse, beastly, rustick creature. Besides, had they not been as they are, how should they sacrifice to us, or give us due honours? You, when you are invited to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catombes, can saile sometimes the whole length of the Ocean, to the faultlesse Aethiopians. But you crucifie the Author of your honours, and sacrifices. And let this suffice to be spoken concerning men. I now passe on to the hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous stealth of fire. Answere me without delay in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Gods, have we lost any fire since it came a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong men? you cannot say we have; since 'tis the nature of this Element not to decrease by communication, nor is one flame extinguish't by the kindling of another. 'Tis plain envy, then, to forbid the necessary use of those things which take nothing from us; whereas it becomes the Gods to be gratious, givers of good things, and free from all envie. But suppose I had stoln all your fire, and conveyed it to the Earth, I had not vvrong'd you much; for you need it not, being neither cold, nor accustomed to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93795:24"/>
boyle your Ambrosia, nor used to the supply of an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall light; but to men fire is necessary, as for other uses, so especially for their sacrifices; not able else to perfume your temples, or to send you up clouds of incense, or burne their oblations on your Altars. Besides, I observe you are much delighted with their smoke, and much pleased with the smell, when a cloud of perfume ascends to heaven; you condemne then what you desire. Lastly I wonder you forbid not the Sun to shine, whose fire is much divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hotter then mine; or that you blame him not for spending your treasure. I have said. If I have spoken amisse, I would have you, <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> correct or disprove me, and I will make a second reply.</p>

teares to his petition, &amp; <hi>Clymene</hi> his Mother with him, I set him fast in the Box, and taught him how to drive; telling him how high he was to mount, and how low he was to fall; as also how to reyne his horses, and curbe their furies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told him also the danger should he drive wrong: But he, child as he was, having mounted so much fire, and beholding such a vast dungeon beneath him, could not choose but be amazed; whilest the horses missing their usuall driver despised the Boy, and fell a wandring, and wrought all this mischiefe.

               <p>Coming home from my stock, I found a great Troop in my Cave, in all likelyhood lurking to steale my sheep: whereupon I bolted my doore, made of a huge rocke, and kindled a fire. No sooner began the wood, which I brought from the mountaine, to cast a flame, but they prepared to hide themselves. But I apprehending some of them, devour'd them as thieves. In the meane time that subtle Companion, <hi>No-body,</hi> or <hi>Vlysses,</hi> which you will, gave me a venemous potion to drinke, very sweet and fragrant, but most treacherous, and turbulent in operation. For I had no sooner drunk, but me-thought my Cave went round, and I was no longer my selfe; and at last fell into a deep sleep: he sharpening a Barre and stirring the fire, put out my eye, and ever since, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune,</hi> I have been blinde.</p>

               <p>Let him live, <hi>Mercury,</hi> ninety yeers more to the ninety he hath lived allready, and longer if it be possible. But fetch hither his flatterers, young <hi>Charinus,</hi> and <hi>Damon,</hi> and the rest.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Rather very just. For why do they pray so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly for his death, but that they may enjoy his estate? But that which is yet most base, is that at that very time when they wish his Death, they grossely observe, and Court him; And when he is sick, all men know what they desire, yet they vow sacrifices for his recovery. In a word, they have severall wayes of flattery. Wherefore let him be immortall, and let them die first, and loose their gapings.</p>

               <p>IS this Justice, <hi>Pluto,</hi> that I should die, who am but thirty yeers old, and that <hi>Thucritus,</hi> who is almost an hundred, should live?</p>

               <speaker>Pluto.</speaker>
               <p>Great Justice, <hi>Terpsion</hi>; For though he lives, yet he wishes none of his friends dead; whereas you all the time you lived, laid nets for his estate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Was't not fit, being an old man, and no longer able to use his riches, he should die, and leave them to those that are younger?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pluto.</speaker>
               <p>You make new lawes, <hi>Terpsion,</hi> that when a man can no longer use his riches with pleasure, he ought to die. Fate and Nature decree otherwise.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Terpsion.</speaker>
               <p>I accuse them, therefore, of disorder. For the businesse ought to run in this succession: The most aged to die first, then those who are next in years; And not to be inverted, or he to live who is decrepit, hath but three teeth left, scarce sees, is supported by four servants, distills at nose, hath eyes filled with rheume, hath lost all sense of pleasure, and is laught at by boyes as a living sepulchre; and the most beautifull, and lustiest young men to die. This is to make rivers run backwards. At least 'twere fit we knew the date of old mens lives, that they might not cousen us as they do. But now the old Proverb is brought to passe, the Cart leads the Oxe.</p>

               <p>These things are wiselier carried, <hi>Terpsion,</hi> then you are aware of. For what ailes you, that you yawne after other mens fortunes, and enslave your selves to child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse old men? you do, therefore, but make your selves ridiculous, and they bury you first; which to many is met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great pleasure; for just as you pray'd for their deaths, so much delight is it to others to have you die first. For you have introduced a new Art, to make love to old women, and old men, especially to those who have no children neglecting those that have; whilest many of those who are courted by you, well acquainted with your aimes, if they chance to have children, pretend to hate them, that they may have observers. At length those who had for a long time wasted themselves in gifts, are shut out of the will, and the sonne, as there is good reason, enjoyes all: the rest cheated of their hopes gnash their teeth.</p>

               <p>You speak truth. <hi>Thucritus</hi> hath almost quite eaten my estate; still making me believe he would die. And as often as I came to visit him, he would groan, and sob inwardly, and counterfeit a noise like an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chick in the shell; wherefore by how much the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer I thought him to his grave, so many gifts the more did I send him; least his other flatterers should exceed me in presents: many nights have my cares taken my sleep from me, numbring and disposing my fortunes. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed care, and watching were the causes of my death: whilest he having swallowed my bait, assisted at my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and went before my beer laughing.</p>

leakes in many places; And therefore if it be not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trimmed, 'twill overturne. And yet so many of you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are come hither, every one with a great burden; which if you bring in with you, you will repent it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those who cannot swimme.</p>

               <p>Ile tell you, you must enter naked, and leave your carriages upon the shoare. And tis well if the Boat receive you all so. Be it your charge, <hi>Mercurie,</hi> to admit none but such as are slender, and cast away their Luggage: stand therefore at the ladder, and receive them with choice, and compell them to enter stript.</p>

               <p>Lay aside your gown, Sir, and all things else.

Besides gold, and pleasures, and impudence, and choller, and wantonnesse, and luxurie. These things scape not my knowledg, Sir, though you should strive to conceal them. Cast off your lying, also, and your pride, and your conceit that you are better then others. For if you enter thus burdened, a pinnace will scarce carry you.</p>

               <p>Marry, because he can be no more invited to costly suppers; and cannot steale forth by night unespi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and muffling himselfe in his gown, go over his circle of whore-houses, and in the morning cheat his pupils, with his lecture of wisedome, and take their money.

               <p>Yes, for their estates: being both alike aged, they publish't their wills.

               <p>They were rightly served.

               <p>I am glad <hi>Minos,</hi> that I have here learnt the Greek Tongue, that herein also <hi>Alexander</hi> may not excell me. I say, then, that those men are most worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, who from small Originals, have arrived to great Atchievements, and by their own power have made themselves worthy of Empire. With a small Troope I made an inrode into Spain at first, as Lievetenant under my brother; where I was held fit for the greatest imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and counted the best souldier. For there I conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Iberians, and overcame the Gaules, and Hesperians; and having march't over great mountaines neer the <hi>Po,</hi> I over ran and demolish't diverse cities, wasted all the Champion Countrey of Italy, and led my army to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of Rome; and slew so many Romans in one day,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93795:40"/>
that we measured their Rings by Bushels, and made Bridges over rivers with dead bodies: And all this I did, neither call'd the sonne of <hi>Ammon,</hi> nor faining my selfe a God, nor telling my mothers dreams. But confessing my selfe to be a man, I fought against tryed, experienced Captaines, and joyned battle with stout and warlike soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; not with <hi>Medes,</hi> or <hi>Armenians,</hi> who flie before they are pursued, and yeeld the victory to any man of a bold spirit. Whereas <hi>Alexander,</hi> succeding his Father in his Kingdome, enlarged it, indeed, but by the current of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; who when he had overcome, and taken the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Darius</hi> in the plaines of <hi>Arbela,</hi> contrary to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of his Ancestors, would have been adored: And corrupting himselfe with the <hi>Persian</hi> Luxury, he slew his friends at Banquets, and assisted at their murthers. I had the rule of my Countrey too; yet when they called me home, because a great fleet of enemies sailed towards <hi>Lybia,</hi> I spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obeyed, and render'd my selfe a private man: and when I was afterwards condemned, bore the sentence contentedly. And this I did, being but a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and not bred to the Greek Discipline: who never read <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> like him, nor was instructed by <hi>Aristotle</hi>; but was led by my own excellent Genius. And these are the things wherein I pronounce my selfe better then <hi>Alexander.</hi> But if he think himselfe my superiour, because he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled his head with a Crown: perchance such ornaments may seeme venerable to his <hi>Macedonians</hi>; but it followes not that therefore he should be preferred before a valiant and Warlike Captain, who still went more by Counsell then Fortune.</p>

               <speaker>Alexander.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis fit, <hi>Minos,</hi> I should make no reply to such a bold fellow: since fame can sufficiently instruct thee how great a Prince I was, and how great a Thiefe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93795:40"/>
he: Yet consider how farre I excell him, who began my Atchievements, with my youth; when succeeding in a troubled and distracted State, I tooke revenge of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Murtherers. Afterwards, striking a terrour into all <hi>Greece</hi> by my conquest of <hi>Thebes,</hi> they chose me their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: nor was I content to straighten my selfe within the Kingdome of <hi>Macedonia</hi> left me by my Father, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the victory of all the world. Thinking it poor not to raigne over the Universe, with a small Army I entred into <hi>Asia,</hi> and in a great battle wonne <hi>Lydia, Ionia,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia.</hi> And conquering all as I march't, I came to <hi>Issus,</hi> where <hi>Darius</hi> with an Army consisting of <hi>Myriads</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. After this, <hi>Minos,</hi> you may remember how many thousand shades I sent you in one day: The Ferry-man saies his Boat was not sufficient, but that he was faine to joyne boards together, and waft them over upon planks. And this I did, still exposing my selfe first to danger, and offering my selfe to wounds. And that I may not recount to you, what I did at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and in the fields of <hi>Arbela,</hi> I went as farre as <hi>India,</hi> and made the Ocean the period of my empire; tooke their Elephants; and brought away <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> Captive. Passing over <hi>Tanais,</hi> in a great horse fight I vanquish't the <hi>Scythians,</hi> a people not to be contemned: Rewarded my followers, and revenged my selfe of my foes. If men thought me a God, they are to be pardoned, being perswaded from the greatnesse of my Actions. After all, I died a King. Whereas <hi>Hanniball</hi> died Banish't in the Court of <hi>Prusias</hi> the <hi>Bythinian</hi>; A fit death for so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, and perjured a fellow. For I forbeare to tell how he overcame the <hi>Italians,</hi> not by valour, but by cousenage, perfidiousnesse, and stratagems. There being nothing just, or cleare in all that enterprize. But whereas he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to me my Luxury, he forgets what he did at <hi>Capua;</hi> where he had his Mistresses, and like an admired soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier voluptuously squander'd away the opportunities of warre. Had not I, out of my contempt of the Westerne
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93795:41"/>
parts, turned my march to the east, what great matter had I atchieved? Have taken <hi>Italy,</hi> perchance without bloud, or have subdued <hi>Lybia,</hi> to the utmost coasts of <hi>Africk.</hi> These were Countries below my Conquests, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy terrified by my fame, and acknowledging me for their Lord.

            <head>A Discourse of <hi>Followers,</hi> and such as are imployed for Reward.</head>
            <p>HOw shall I, my Friend, describe to you the First and the Last, as they say, of those miseries, which they are fain to suffer and undergo, who are in pay, and retain to the Friendship of Rich men? if I may call Servitude, Friendship. For I know many, and almost all the evills
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93795:42"/>
which befall them. Not from my own experience, (for I was never forced to make tryal, nor may I ever, O ye Gods) but many who have been cast upon that course of life, have made descriptions to me: some, whilst they yet felt the thraldome, deploring the many and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities they endured: others, as if they had broke pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, recounting with some pleasure what they had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, much rejoycing to repeat the mischiefs they had escaped. These are the more to be credited, having been admitted into the secrets and mysteries of the Course, and seen all from the beginning to the end. I hear them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not carelesly, or without attention, but as men who report an unlookt for deliverance from some Shipwrack; like those Saylers, whom we see in our Temples with shorn heads, who will tell you of waves, and billows, and steep swellings of the Sea, and tossings, and broken Masts, and torn Tackling; but above all of the Twinne Brothers, <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> (two necessary persons in the Tragedy,) or some other God unexpectedly sitting on their Sayles, or standing at the Sterne, who guided their Ship to some peaceable Shore, where it no sooner arrived, but by easie and gentle degrees sunk, whilst they by the favour and protection of their God, safely landed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Many such Tragical passages will they report to raise your Charity, presuming to receive the more, if they appear not only distrest, but affected by the Gods. But they who speak of their Domestick tempest, and waves, and, as I may say, of their third, fift, and tenth Billows: and how they first launcht into a calme Sea, and what they suffer'd in their voyage; Thirsty, Sea-sick, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the salt water: lastly, how their unhappy Ship dasht against an hidden Rock, or some sharp Promontory; and how they, wretches, were miserably fain to swimme to land naked, with the losse of all they had. When I hear such complaints as these, they seem to me to conceal many things for shame, as men willing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93795:43"/>
to have them forgotten. But I, framing my conjectures from such and the like discourses, have found out the discommodities of such Attendances, which it shall be no trouble to me, my Friend <hi>Timocles,</hi> to decipher to you. For, me thinks, I have perceived you of a long time ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that course of life. For when not long since we fell upon this Argument, one of the company praised this Mercenary course, calling them thrice happy who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on great persons at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they might feast shot-free, lodge magnificently, travail with all accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and pleasure, and lie along if they please in an Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sedan. Moreover, to be paid for their friendship and well-being, is no small felicity; so that without Sowing or Tillage, all things spring to them voluntarily. At this, or the like Discourse, I saw how you gap't, and presently held open your mouth for the Bait to drop in. Least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you should hereafter blame me, or should say, that when I saw you about to swallow the Hook with the Bait, I saved you not, or pluckt not out the hook before it was fastend in your throat; or did not forewarne you, but staid, till it stuck and were fixt in you; and when I saw you intangled and caught without any redresse, stood by only and wept: least, I say, you should make these objections, not by me to be answered, should I not give you some premonitions, take with you this brief Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and consider at your leisure, before you be wrapt and infolded in it, into what a mouthlesse Net you are to enter. Feel the tongue and point of the hook with your fingers, and apply for tryall the sharp Trident to your cheek; which if you find not sharp, and not to be escaped without wounds, but forceably attracting and irresistably holding what they catch, reckon me among Cowards and Beggars: and take you the boldnesse to be caught, and like a Sea-cob swallow the whole bait. Now though this discourse be intended for you, yet 'twill concern not only Philosophers, and as many as propose to themselves
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93795:43"/>
a life of Virtue, but Grammarians also, and Orators, and Musitians, and as many as live by their Learning, and teach for reward. Since all are of condition alike, then, and the same things happen to all, 'tis plain that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are not exempted, but are of worse condition, if they endure the same things which others do; and if these who have them in pay, hold them but in equal reverence. But vvhat discoveries soever my discourse make by the vvay, they are first in fault vvho offer such indignities, next they vvho endure them. But I am blamelesse, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Liberty and Freedome of narration be a fault. As for those of vulgar quality, as unskilful Flatterers, men of poor and abject spirits, 'tis belovv me to dehort them from such courses; or if I should, 'tvvere to no purpose. Nor is it fit I should condemn them for not forsaking their Hire, though much affronted by them; being made and cut out, and formed for such Imployments. Besides they have no other course to turn themselves to; so that if any man should take it from them, they vvould present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be void of businesse, turn slothfull, needy, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. To such no Imployment seems base or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull, though it be, as they say, to hold a Chamber-pot. For they are at first entertain'd to bear contempts, and 'tis their art to dissemble, and wink at what they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. But I cannot but distast such submissions in men of Learning and parts, and am to endeavour their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and restitution to Liberty: which I shall be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to effect, if I examine the reasons why some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave themselves to that kind of life, and shew their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; infirmity; whereby they will be disarmed of their Defence, and of the ground on which they build their voluntary Bondage. Most men then, if they can pretend poverty, and the want of things necessary, think they have got a sufficient colour and veile for their entrance into that life; and think it excuse enough to say they do nothing which deserves not pardon, if they seek to free
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93795:44"/>
themselves from poverty, a thing to the life of man most intolerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pressing upon all occasions that piece of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognis, Want kills all men</hi>; and such other affrightments from poverty, as the most obscure and abject Poets have delivered. And truly if by such dependances I should see them releas'd from their necessities, I would not so earnestly dispute with them about Liberty. But as the Orator said, being of Sick mens diet, how can they possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clear themselves from having given themselves ill counsel, the reason of their course still remaining? For they still suffer want and need supplies, unable to lay up, or keep any thing over: but when they are paid their wages, (if yet they be paid) 'tis spent presently, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defrayes their ordinary charges. 'Twere good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to invent such refuges, as cherish and assist po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, but such as take it away: which perchance was the meaning of <hi>Theognis,</hi> when he said, <hi>Poverty was to be cast headlong from a steep Cliff into the Sea.</hi> But if any man who serves for wages, and is still needy and poor, think this the way to avoid Poverty, he deceives himself. Others, say they, would not at all fear Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if like other men they could sustain themselves by their labours; but having bodies weakned either by age or sicknesse, they are fain to betake themselves to the easie life of Serving-men. Let us see then whither they say truth; and whither their wages come to them easily, and not through harder tasks then other labourers. 'Twere indeed to be wisht, that without toil or sweat Silver would flow upon them. But this is so far from Truth, that no imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fuller of labour, and sweat, and require more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour &amp; strength of body; which is every day wasted by a thousand businesses, and tired to the utmost. But of this I will treat in due place, when I come to speak of other grievances. For the present it shall be enough to have shown, that their pretences, are false. I come next to speak of the true cause (but unacknowledged) which makes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93795:44"/>
men enter themselves into great families, that is, that they may enjoy pleasure, cherish large and ample Hopes, admire the abundance of Gold and Silver, fare deliciously; and partake the other happinesses of life, and without controule drink Gold. These are the things which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice men, and make them of freemen slaves; not the want of necessaries, as they pretend, but the thirst of superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and itch of abundance: much like slie, and cheating mistresses, who entertaine their wretched, and unfortunate lovers and inflame them with a pretty disdaine, to Court, and observe them, and yet after their long service scarce allow them a short kisse, well knowing that Love is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by fruition; which they therefore keep lock't up, and impart sparingly, cherishing in their lovers some faint hopes, least despaire should lessen their flame, or unedge their desires; They therefore are alwaies affable, make faire promises, that they will performe, and be thankfull and acknowledge their costly presents. 'Till at length both grow old, ere they be aware, and become unfit; the one to Court, the other to be Courted; so that their whole life hath vapoured away in hopes. But to undergoe any course for the love of pleasure is not altogether blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, but someway pardonable in him who is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it, and pursues all waies to compasse it; Though I must needs say, 'tis both base and unmanly to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for it: For the pleasure which arises from libertie, is much greater. Yet as I say before, They deserve pardon, if they attaine the pleasure they aime at; But for the bare expectation of pleasure to undergoe so many incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is, in my judgement, ridiculous: especially seeing how certaine, manifest, and unavoydable, their pains are; and how the thing they expect, which is pleasure, after a long attendance flies from them; And, if they shut not their eyes to truth, is never likely to approach them. <hi>Ulysses</hi> companions having tasted of the inchanted bowle, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all things els, and preferd their present delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93795:45"/>
vertue; having some little reason to forget what was decent, their soules being possest by pleasure. But should some thirsty man stand by when another drinks of such a bowle, out of meere hope to get a tast, and yet get none, and fo forget what is fit and decent, He were most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and worthy Homers whipping-post. These, or the like, are the Causes which carry men into dependances, and suffer rich men to put them to what imployment they list. To which we may adde, that some think it a glory to retaine to illustrious persons, and persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; as being thereby advanced above the condition of the Vulgar. For my part I would not belong to the greatest prince, or be seen in his retinue, if no other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accompanied my neernesse to him. This, then, being the foundation of servitude, let us consider next, what they feele, and endure, before they compasse their ends; and what are the calamities of their life; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is the Catastrophe of their Tragedie. First they cannot say that though their imployments be burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, they are made easy by custome, and require no great trouble; or that to a willing minde businesse doth it selfe: many wearisome walks are to be made, their doores every morning to be visited, you the saluter to attend, though you are lock't out, or thrust from the doore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if you grow bold, or pressing, by the Porter, who speaks broken <hi>Syriack,</hi> and are faine to bribe a <hi>Lybian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menclator to remember your name. Then you must weare Cloathes above your Abilitie, for the credit of him you serve, and make choice of such colours as he delights in; and which differ not in <hi>Lyverie</hi> from his. Lastly, you must alwaies follow, or goe before, thrust and justled by the other servants, and as it were make one in a show, or Triumph; Whilest your Patron for many daies not once lookes upon you: or if it be your good fortune to be seene or call'd by him, and that he by chance speak to you, then you beginne to sweat, your eyes dazell, your joynts shake,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93795:45"/>
the standers by laugh at your confusion; especially when he shall aske you who was king of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and you make answere he had a Thousand ships: which good natures will call modesty; bold men, cowardlinesse; unbred men, ignorance; whereupon you, having made a dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of his Familiarity, depart much accusing your bashfulnesse. And when you have lost many nights sleep, and past over many bloudy daies, not to recover a <hi>Helen,</hi> or to Conquer a <hi>Priamus,</hi> or <hi>Troye,</hi> but for the hopes of five groats; if by chance you light upon some assistant God in a Tragedy, you are examined whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be skill'd in the Mathematicks, a question frequent in the mouthes of rich men, who are, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, much praised, and celebrated: whilest you out of astonishment think he gives sentence upon you, and calls your life in question. This thought comming crosse your minde, that no man will receive you, if you be disallowed or rejected by him, you must needs be cast into a thousand distractions, out of envy to those who are examined with you, and who stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with you for your place: imagining you have answered imperfectly, and tost between your Hopes, and feares, you watch his countenance, and if he show any dislike of your Replies, you are undone; If he hear you with approbation, you take heart, and revive your hopes. Besides, it cannot be but that many should withstand your desires, and should strive to remove you, and place others in your Roome, and should dart at you underhand. Consider too what a sight 'tis to see a man with a long beard, and a white head ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined what a Scholler he is; and to some to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to have profitted, to others not. In the mean time your former life and age past is curiously searcht into. And if any acquaintance, or neighbour, upon some light provocation, shall accuse you of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or the like, he is heard as a witnesse produced
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93795:46"/>
from <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Table-book. If all report well of you, they will be suspected, thought vain, and hired by you: you must therefore have great luck, and meet with no rubs, or you will never compasse your aims. But put the case that fortune be your friend, and that your Lord approve of your parts, and that his best friends, upon whose authority in such tryals he most relies, strive not to divert him: suppose too you have his wives allowance, be not thwarted by the Steward, and that no man blemish your former Behaviour, but that, as they say, all things concurre to make a gratefull Sacrifice; you have conquer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, happy Sir, and have won the Garland; you have taken <hi>Babylon</hi> as soon, or the Castle of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and may as well possesse <hi>Amalthae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> Horn, or milk the Fowls. For suppose the time now come, that you receive recompence answerable to your Service; and that your Garland prove not a Garland of fraile Oken leaves, nor your wages contemptible, but that it be seasonably paid you without much suit, and that you be preferr'd before your fellow attendants: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that you be releas'd from your troublesome visits, attendances in the dirt, and watchings, and, according to the common Proverb, be allowed to sleep with your feet stretcht out, and for the future be imployed only in those easie businesses, for which you were at first hired, and taken in; which is but reasonable, <hi>Timocles</hi>; nor would a man grudge to bear an easie yoke, which were portable, and guilt; yet will you faile much, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of your expectation. For there are a thousand things in such dependances, which mis-become an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man: which, as you hear from me in order, judge whither they be to be born by any man who hath but tasted of Learning. I will begin from your first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, from whence you may make a judgment of your future usage. First, a neat Serving-man is sent to invite you to Supper; whom you are to fee, and, least you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93795:46"/>
be thought uncivill, are to clap into his hand at least a Crown: which he refuses with, Pray excuse me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take it, <hi>Hercules</hi> forbid; but is at length perswaded, and being gone laughs at you. You presently put on your best cloaths, trimme, and wash your self; and fear to be the first commer: for that is clownish, as to come last is troublesome. Having watcht therefore for fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, you enter; and you are honourably bid welcome. Then comes one to you, and bids you sit down above the rich man that invited you, between his two old friends: but you, as though you were newly entred into <hi>Iupiter's</hi> Temple, admire all things, and are astonisht at every thing you see done, which appears strange, and unusuall to you. In the mean time the eies of all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are upon you, and the other Guests observe how you carry your self. Nor are you unwatcht by the rich man, who before hand charged the waiters to mark what by-glances or looks you cast upon his Wife, or Boies: whilst the rest that are invited seeing you for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience amazed at what passes, smile at you, and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that you were never invited before; and that you were never till then used to a Napkin. Whereupon you out of distraction fall a sweating, and though you be thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty dare not call for Drink, lest you be thought a Tipler: and of all the variety of dishes which stand in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, know not to which you are first or last to move your hand; but are fain to observe him that sits next to you, and to learn in what order you are to cut; and so pass over your meat distracted in your mind, and struck at all that's done. Sometimes you admire the rich man for his Plate, and Ivory, and pleasures; then again you deplore your own unhappinesse, in that you possesse nothing, and yet live: another thought presently flatters you, what a desirable life you shall lead to have the fruition of all those pleasures, and equally to enjoy them; and how all your Suppers will be Bacchanals. Besides, the wayters
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93795:47"/>
laughing at you in private, will make pleasant descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to you of the sweetnesse of your future conversation, and tell you that you will be alwaies singing those verses in <hi>Homer</hi>:
<q>
                  <l>No marvaile if the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> strong</l>
                  <l>Did their laborious war and siege prolong</l>
                  <l>For so much happinesse.—</l>
               </q>
At length you are invited to drink a Health: and one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great Bowle begins to you, by the name of Tutor, or some such like compellation; you receive the cup of him, and know not what answer to return, and so for want of experience are thought rustick, and unbred. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that drinking to you stirs the envy of all the inviters old retainers, who are gall'd at your sitting down before them too; that being but a new commer, you should be preferr'd before men who served a prentiship: presently therefore they begin thus to mutter among themselves. This only was wanting to other Indignities, that we should be placed after those who are newly entred into the family. None but <hi>Grecians</hi> are respected at <hi>Rome</hi>; and what is there in them why they should take place of me? Is their Service more then ours, because they can prate? Did you not mark, sayes another, how much he drank? how he devoured all the meat that stood before him? an unbred, famisht fellow, who never dreamt of white bread, or Pheasants, or Partridges, and yet he left us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the bones. Peace, Fools, sayth a third, within this week you shall see him esteemed no more then one of us. He is now prized and valued like a pair of new Sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; but when he is worn a while, and hath been in the dirt, he will be neglected and cast aside, like us, and make a dinner for the Rats. These and the like speeches are tost among them, who from that time project com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and accusations against you, and all the Discourse of the meal is of you: who not used to such meetings, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overdrunk your self in sweet, loosning wine, find
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93795:47"/>
your belly work, and are not well. Neither can you in good manners depart before the company, nor can you with safety stay. In the meane time, while the drinking is continued, and one discourse falls into another, and one show is presented after another, (for you must stay to see all) you are not a little tormented, and neither marke what is done, nor heare what is sung, or plaid by one of his Ingles. But are to praise all out of necessity, though you wish the house would fall with an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, or that some body would proclaime it to be on fire, that the feast might be dissolved. You have the Character, my friend, of your first and most pleasant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: which to me is not so pleasant as Onyons, and bay salt, of which I may eat freely, and as much, or little as I please. I omit to tell you of the rawnesse, and crudities of your stomach, and of your vomits in the night. Next morning you are to bargain what wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges you are to have by the year, and Covenants are agreed upon in the presence of two or three of your masters friends. Before whom he first bids you sit down, and then thus begins. You see what my estate is, how free from pompe, which I enjoy without any ostentation, in a moderate and vulgar way; I would have you, therefore, believe that all things shall be common between us. For 'twere ridiculous that I should trust you with the best part of my possessions, my life, or children, (if he have any) and not in an equall measure make you master of my Fortunes. But because we are to come to certainties, I shall complie with your moderation, and frugalitie. For I understand no desire of gain drew you to my house, but other considerations, as your affection to me, and the honour of your Relation, yet something I will allow you; and I should be glad your selfe would set the proportion: but consider first the gifts I shall bestow upon you at good times, which shall not be omitted, though they fall not within our bargaine; and you know there are many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93795:48"/>
in the yeer; These therefore consider'd, set to your selfe some reasonable price, or hire; For I know you men of learning despise money. By this Prologue he besieges you with Hopes, and renders you pliant, and flexible to his ends. You, who before fancied to your selfe Talents, and Millions, and whole Farmes, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, secretly perceive his sordidnesse: yet believe and think his promises, that all things shall be common, are unfayling Oracles; not discerning that they proceeded meerly from his lippes, and not from his heart. At last out of Modesty you referre the summe to him, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to name; But desires one of his friends, there present, to deal between you, and to designe a price, neither too great for him to spare, out of his other necessary disburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor yet too small for you to receive. Here his old friend, bred up with him in flatttery, askes you, if you think not your selfe the most happy man in the Citty, that you have lighted upon the good fortune, so much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted by others, to be admitted into dependance by such a person? To have the use of one of the greatest Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Rome?</hi> which, if you have your modesty, is more then <hi>Croesus</hi> wedges, or <hi>Midas</hi> wealth. I know some, sayes he, of good quality, who would give money, only for the credit of the Relation, to belong to him and to be seen about him, as his followers or Friends. I cannot, therefore, sufficiently extoll your happinesse, who are to have pay to your good fortune. In my Judgment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unlesse you be a spendthrift, so much is enough; And then sets some small price, farre below your expectation; which neverthelesse you must accept contentedly, since there is no escape for you now out of the Net. Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, therefore, you thrust your head into the bridle; yet carry your selfe gentle, not being much troubled, or gall'd, till you be a little accustomed to him. They abroad, in the mean while, emulate you, seeing you within the pale, and making your entrance without controule, and made
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93795:48"/>
one of the Family; whilest you know no reason why you should appear so happy in their eyes, but only that you flatter and rejoyce your selfe with the hopes and amendment of your fortune, which every day lessens and goes backward. At length as it were in a doubt, full light, you begin to perceive that all your wealthy hopes were but golden bubbles; but that your Toyles are reall, unavoidable, and perpetuall. But you will ask me what those toyles are? and tell me, that you discerne no such troubles in such dependances, or such intolerable imployments as I speak of. Heare, therefore, Gallant Sir, and weigh not only the trouble, but the basenesse, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and servilitie of such imployments. For first from the time you are entertained, you are to forget your liberty, and parentage; and are to resolve, when you enter into such relations, to leave your descent, freedome, and Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors at the doore. For Liberty cannot have admission with you, who are received into such low and ungenerous imployments. A servant, therefore, however you are troubled at the name, a servant you are necessarily to be, not of one, but many; and are to wait uncover'd from morning to night for contemptible wages. Besides, not being bred of a child to service, but coming to the trade late, and well stricken in years, you will hardly please, or be much valued by your Master. For the remembrance of your former Liberty will corrupt you, and prompt you to a relapse sometimes, and make your Thraldome much the heavier: Unlesse you think you are at liberty because you had not <hi>Pyrrhias,</hi> or <hi>Zopyrio</hi> for your Father; or were not sold, like a <hi>Bithynian,</hi> by some big voiced Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But, good Sir, to stand every new Moon with <hi>Pyrrhias,</hi> and <hi>Zopyrio,</hi> and hold out your hand like other servants, to receive what shall be given, is sale. For he needs no Crier who is his own Cryer, and of himself makes long suit for a Master. If therefore, you base fellow, (for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but say so to one who professeth Philosophy) a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93795:49"/>
should take you at Sea, or if some Robber should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave you, you would deplore your self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unfortunate beside your merit. Or if one should apprehend you, and say you are his Servant, you would invoke the Lawes, use all endeavours to free your self, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse great disdaine, and in a loud voice call the Earth and Gods to your assistance. And yet for all you are of an age, in which had you been born a Slave, 'twere time for you to look towards Liberty; and though you have been bred to virtue, and wisdome, for a few far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things you sell your self; never regarding the excellent Discourses utter'd by <hi>Plato, Chrysippus,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in the praise of Liberty, and dispraise of Servitude: nor are you ashamed to be reckoned with Flat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erers, Hirelings, and Buffoones; or among so many <hi>Romanes</hi> to go attired like a stranger, or to speak Latine barbarously, or to go to tumultuous, promiscuous Suppers, where the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is mixt and troublesome; and there to passe ridiculous praises, to drink immoderately, and next morning at the sound of a Bell to rise, break your sweet sleep, and trudg up and down with yesterdaies dirt yet about your heels. Do you feel such a penury of Beans, or Herbs, or have fountains left off to run, that despair should drive you to this course? No such matter, neither want of beans or water, but your desire of Juncats, and delicate fare, and odoriferous wines drew you, and like a Pike your gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse justly fasten'd a hook in your Gills: &amp; so you suffer the reward of your licorousnesse; and like a <hi>Monkey</hi> chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a post by the neck, make sport to the Beholders; whilst you are much pleased to have Figs and Comfits thrown to you. But Liberty and Freedom, Stock or Pedigree, are vain, empty names, and of which you keep no remembrance. Yet the course were to be liked, if it had only this inconveniency of basenesse, to make a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a Slave, and brought not other servile Imployments with it. But consider whither your taskes be more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

then those which are enjoyn'd to <hi>Dromo,</hi> or <hi>Tibius.</hi> As for your Learning, for which you say he took you in, he little regards it: for according to the Proverb, <hi>what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement can there be between an Asse and an Harp?</hi> Do you not observe how they are possest with the desire of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s Wisdome, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> Eloquence, and <hi>Plato</hi>'s high Discourses? and yet should a man take out of their minds their thoughts and cares of Gold, and Silver, nothing would remain but Pride, Effeminatenesse, Luxury, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousnesse, Cruelty, and Ignorance; to all which you are uselesse. But because you have a large Beard, and are of a venerable aspect, and weare a decent <hi>Greek</hi> Mantle, and all men know you to be a Grammarian, or Orator, or Philosopher; he thinks it is for his reputation to mingle such a one with those who go before him, to grace and set out his traine: And from hence gains the opinion of a Patron of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Arts, and of a Friend to Learning, so that you are not hired for excellency of parts, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but for your Beard and Gown. And therefore are alwaies to be seen in his company, and never to be from him, but are to rise early every morning to present your self, and appear in your attendance, and not break your rank. He sometimes laying his hand upon you, prates any thing by chance, and makes shew to those he meets, that in passage through the streets he forgets not the Muses, but imployes the small leisure of his walke in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest conferences: whilst you most wretchedly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times going apace, sometimes softly, sometimes up, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times down, (for such you know are the passages of the City) sweat, and put your self out of breath. At length he strikes into a house, to talk with some friend, whom he went to visit; where, for want of a place to sit down, you are fain to read a Book, to passe away the time. After this, having neither eaten nor drunk that day, discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously washt, and at an unseasonable hour, about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night perhaps, you go to supper; and are no longer
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93795:50"/>
reverenced, or regarded by the rest. But if there be a new comer, you are set below him, and thrust into some obscure Corner, where you sit as a Spectator only of what is brought to Table; and like a dog gnaw the bones which descend to you, or out of hunger suck some withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sallet, refused by those who sit above you. Nor is this all your disgrace; you are not allowed a whole Egge to your self, nor is it thought fit that you should be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded still like the other Guests, and Strangers, (for that was your fond conceit) nor is the same Fowl set before you and others. But before your Lord stands a crammed, juicy one; before you, a young starved, tastlesse one: which is indeed no fowl, but an affront and reproach. Many times, if another want meat, one of the wayters takes away that which was set before you, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon you, tells you, you are one of the house. If at any time a Pigge be cut up, or a Venison pasty, you had need have the Carver your friend, or you will divide with <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and nothing but bones will come to your share. For that a dish should stand before him who sits above you, till he be cloyed, and should passe by you in an instant, it is not to be endured by one that hath any ingenuity, or but so much Gall as an Hart. I have not told you, that when the rest drink the oldest and best, you are to drink the fulsome, pall'd Wine: and therefore are carefull to drink in a Silver, or guilt Bowle, lest the colour should betray what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Guest you are. Yet this were also to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, might you drink your full: but if you call often, the wayter will not hear you. There are many other things which will vex you; but especially to see an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngle or Dancing-Master, or an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Jester, who writes Farces, preferr'd before you. For how can you expect to take equall place with them whose qualities are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, &amp; who carry love-letters in their bosoms. You, therefore, sit in some hole at supper, &amp; hiding your self for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93795:51"/>
shame, secretly sigh, as 'tis fit, &amp; bewaile your selfe, &amp; accuse your fortune, for not allowing you a sprinkling of their favours; and could gladly wish your self a Poet to write amourous Ditties, or had the gift to sing those which were made by others; seeing for what qualities others are prized and esteemed before you: nor would you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse for a need to act a Magician, or Fortune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teller, and presage, like them, great Fortunes, Empires, and mighty Riches. When therefore you see men of such condition esteemed, and much made of, you could even find in your heart to be one of them, to preserve your self from disesteem, and contempt. But because you are not so happy as to be framed for such Arts, you must of necessity give way, and silently mutter your grievances, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to your self. For if some whispering Tell-tale Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant complaine of you, that you praised not your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses Page for dancing, or singing well, you are in no small danger. You are therefore like a thirsty Land-frog, to cry aloud, that you may appear the most forward, and remarkable in your commendations. And sometimes when the rest are silent, you are to have in a readinesse some fained Panegyrick, well powdered with Flattery. Next, tis a thing most ridiculous, that hungry, and thirsty, as many times you are, you should anoynt your self, and weare a Chaplet: for then me thinks you look like a Pillar erected over some ancient Carcasse, adorned with Offerings to the Dead; who though they be anoynted and crowned, yet neither eat nor drink the viands set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Besides, if you light upon a Master who is jealous, and who keeps handsome Boies, or hath a young Wife, and that he find you no stranger to <hi>Venus,</hi> or the <hi>Graces,</hi> tis matter for a Quarrell, and your danger is not contemptible. For Kings have many eares and eyes, and do not only see Truths, but alwaies adde something over, least they be thought to connive. You are therefore to sit as if you were at a <hi>Persian</hi> Supper, with a downcast
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93795:52"/>
look, and to beware, lest some Eunuch catch you darting glances upon one of your Master's Concubines; or lest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eunuch holding a bent Bow shoot an arrow through your Cheeks, whilst you are drinking, for casting your eyes aside. After you are risen from Supper, you are no sooner asleep, but at the first Cock-crowing you awake, and say to your self, O me most unfortunate wretch, what conversation have I left, what friends, what a quiet life, what untroubled sleeps, and free Walks, to cast my self headlong into a Dungeon! And wherefore, O ye Gods, have I entred into this course? or what splendid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doth it bring me? 'Tis not possible the commodities of this life should countervaile those I forsook, when I enjoyed my liberty, and had all things in my own power. Now, as they say, I am led like a tame Lyon up and down in a string, neither knowing (which makes my case most miserable) how to give content, or able to make my self gratious; being ignorant, and unskilfull, compared to those men who make the Arts of pleasure their businesse. Besides, I am distastfull, and not fit for great Feasts, being unable to raise laughter; which makes my Master look discontentedly upon me because when he would be very merry, I carry my self tetricall, and grave; in a word, I shall never be able to piece with him. For if I endeavour to preserve my reverence, I am thought severe, and to be avoided: If I laugh, or strive to shew a cheerfull countenance, he presently grows dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull, and spawles at me; so that, me thinks, I act a Comicall part in a Tragicall dresse. Lastly, what kind of life shall I leave for my self, after I have spent my present age in the service of another? In the midst of this Soliloquie, the Bell rings, and you are to return to your former task of walking and waiting, Having first anointed your thighes, and knees, to enable you for your race. Then you have the same supper, and at the same houre; Till at length your unaccustomed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93795:50"/>
diet, watchings, and tirings by degrees undermine you, and introduce a Consumption, or Ptissick, or paine of the Bowells, or some excellent Gowt: which you valiantly resist, and many times when you are to keep your bed, cannot be allowed; but your sicknesse is thought a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to avoid businesse. Hence it comes to passe, that you are alwaies paler then others, and look like one ready to die. And thus much be spoken of your sufferings, in the City. When you are to Travel any where, among other things, which I omit, you are by your place, and lot, to tarry for the waggon, and to come wet, and last into the Inne; where for want of Room you are lodged with the Cooke, or your Mistresses barber upon the straw. I'le tell you a passage which <hi>Thesmopolis</hi> the <hi>Stoick</hi> told me of himselfe, very ridiculous, but not incredible, or such as may not happen to any other. He lived with a wealthy delicate, proud Lady, in the Citty, who had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to take a journey; where he said the first contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible accident, he ever suffer'd, was, being a Philosopher, to sit next in the Coach to her page, whom she kept sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both chinne and thighes, and carried with her (it seemes) for her Credit. He told me his name was <hi>Chelidonius,</hi> or swallow. Now judge you what a sight it was for a severe, grave, ancient man, with a white beard (which you know <hi>Thesmopolis</hi> wore at full length) to be placed next to an effeminate Boy, whose eyes were painted, and lasciviously roll'd in his head, and his neck wantonly bent to one side; who more deserved to be call'd Vulture for his naked chinne then swallow; and who, had he not been at his entreaty disswaded, would have worne his head in a bagge. Innumerable he said were the disturbances which he suffer'd from the page, who all the way sung, and prattled, and, if he had not restrained him, would have danced in the Coach. He told me, also, of a certain charge, laid upon him by the Lady; who calling to him, <hi>Thesmopolis,</hi> quoth she, if you love
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93795:51"/>
me, you must not deny me a favour, which I shall ask of you, nor expect I shall ever request a greater. He, as 'twas fit, promised to obey her request. Then, quoth she, I pray, because I take you to be an honest, carefull, good natured man, take my little bitch <hi>Myrrhina</hi> into the Coach, and keep her for me, and see she lacks nothing; For she is very bigge with puppies, and is even ready to whelp, and my other servants are such Knaves, that upon the way they have neither care of her, nor indeed of me: you shall therefore not a little obliege me, if you will take care of a dogge so deare and pretious to me. <hi>Thesmopolis,</hi> at her earnest entreaty being almost ready to crie, received the Bitch. Here, then, was a spectacle most ridiculous, to see a little dogge peeping under his gown, just below his Beard, and bepissing him sometimes (Though <hi>Thesmopolis</hi> dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it) and barking in a small voice (for such dogges are most in fashion) and licking the yesterdaies fat which stuck upon the Philosophers chinne. The Page, who sate next him, having not unwittily at supper played upon others of the company, at last broke a jest upon <hi>Thesmopolis</hi>; All I can say, quoth he, of <hi>Thesmopolis</hi> is only this, that of a <hi>Stoick</hi> he is become a <hi>Cynick.</hi> For I heare when the little Bitch pupp't in his Gown. These are the Mockeries, or rather the affronts, which they fasten upon those who live with them, rendring them by little and little tame and patient of contempts. I knew a <hi>Carcharian</hi> Orator, who being commanded at a supper to make an Oration, declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not by an houre glasse, but by a Rundler of wine, very eloquently, gravely, and roundly, and with the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those who in the mean time drank, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved two hundred Drachmes for his performance. Now such impositions are some way tolerable; But if he to whom you belong, be either given to Poëtry, or History, and be accustomed to repeat his own works at supper, how are you troubled to praise and flatter, and invent new waies of commendation? There are some, who
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93795:52"/>
will be admired for their Beauty; whom you must call <hi>Adonis,</hi> and <hi>Hyacinthus,</hi> though they have a nose a Cubit long. For if you commend them not, presently you are committed to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Dungeon, as one who wish them ill, and carry plots against them. You must call them Sages, and Orators too; who though they utter solecismes, yet they will be thought to make speeches full of Attick flowers, and <hi>Hymettian</hi> Honey, which ought to become patternes afterwards for men to speak by. But perhaps the carriage of the men is to be born with; but then the women affect too to have learned men in pay, who shall retaine to them, attending upon their <hi>Sedans</hi>; And think nothing conduceth so much to their other bravery; and pompe, as to be called Learned Philosophers, and better makers of verses then <hi>Sappho.</hi> And for the raising of such an opinion, they are still accompanied by pensionary Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians, Grammarians, and Philosophers, who most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously read to them, either while they are dressing themselves, or curling their haire, or at meale time; for at other times they are not at leasure. Sometimes, whilest the Philosopher is in the midst of his Discourse, the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermayde enters, and delivers a letter to her Lady from her Lechour-servant; whereupon the learned discourse of chastity breaks off, till she have wrote an answer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to her Lecture. After a long time, at the Feast of <hi>Saturne,</hi> perchance, or <hi>Minerva,</hi> if some thread-bare Cloak, or motheaten garment, be sent you, you must recieve it as a great present; And the servant first privy to his masters intention, who runs and acquaints you with his bounty, is not to be sent away without a reward for his newes. The next morning, at least thirteen more bring you the same message; every one reporting what he said to his Master, how he put him in mind of it, and that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the businesse he chose the most advantagious; who though they all returne fed, yet grumble that you gave them no more. Next, your whole pension comes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93795:53"/>
not to above six Crownes, which if you demand you are thought impudent, and troublesome, and, therefore, before you can receive it, you must insinuate and flatter, and court the steward; which is one step of servitude more; nor is he to be neglected who is your patrons friend, and of his Counsells. And when you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received your salary, you are presently to pay it again to your Taylor, or Physitian, or Shoomaker; so that your rewards not only come late, unseasonable, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but great envy is kindled upon you, and by degrees the servants begin to hatch complaints against you; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially finding their masters eares open to entertaine them: who by this time, perhapps, sees you worne out with bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, and unfit for imployment, and troubled with the Gowt; And having gotten the most flowry and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part of your age, and wasted your bodily strength, and worne you out like a torne garment, he looks about for some dunghill where to cast you, and entertaines another more able to drudg; accusing you with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of his page, or alleaging that being an old man, you defloured his maid, or laying some such crime to your charge; for which in the night time you are thrust out of doores by the neck, forsaken of all, poore, and carry nothing away with your age but an incomparable Gowt; And having by length of time forgotten your first course of life and made your belly as large as a sack, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an insatiate and never to be contented mischiefe. Your stomach will expect it's usuall repletions, and grow enraged at denials. Besides no bodie will afterwards entertaine you, being of a spent age, and become like an ancient decaied horse, whose very skinne is of no use. The pretence, also, for which you were put away, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some possibility, will brand you for an adulterer, or a poysoner, or the like: So that your accuser, though he say nothing, will be believed against you, who are a <hi>Greek,</hi> of a light behaviour, and prepared for any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93795:53"/>
For such they account us all, and not without good cause. For if I be not deceived, the reason why they hold such an Opinion of us is, because most of us who are taken into Families, for want of better knowledg, profess Magick, and Charms, and the Art to provoke Love, and to reconcile Enemies; which we call Learning, and set it off with a grave Gown, and a venerable Beard. Hence it comes to passe, that they have the like esteem of all, as they have of those whom they judg to be the best; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they observe our Flattery, both at Feasts, and in our Carriage at other times, and our extream basenesse, to submit our selves to waies of gain. And therefore, not without cause, when they have turned them off, they mortally hate them, and seek all the waies they can to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them: as men who are able to divulge all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their life, having inwardly known them, and seen them naked; a point which pricks them to the quick: For as you have seen some fair Books, whose Covers are enamell'd, and guilt without, but contain within <hi>Thyestes</hi> eating his children at a Banquet, or <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> lying with his mother, or <hi>Tereus</hi> deflowring two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: so these men are very glorious, and sightly without, but within hide many a Tragedy under their purple; whom if you rip open, and unwrap, you will find them lined with much Tragicall stuffe, not unlike that of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> or <hi>Sophocles.</hi> However without, they shew guilt and enamell'd. Their Consciousnesse therefore breeds their hatred, and makes them seek the ruine of those who fall from them; as men who are able to represent them on the Stage, and give their true description. For a Conclusion then, like <hi>Cebes,</hi> I will draw you the picture of this kind of life in a small Table; that by looking towards it, you may know whither it be to be entred into or no. I could wish some <hi>Apelles,</hi> or <hi>Parrhasius,</hi> or <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93795:54"/>
give you a slender Image and Draught of it. Let there, then, be drawn a high guilded house, not situated on any low place, but aloft on a hill; and let the ascent to it be so steep, inaccessible, and slippery, that those who many times hope to aspire to the top, tumble down, and break their necks. Within, let Riches dwell, of a bright and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aspect. Let their Lover, having with much adoe climbed up, and attained the door, at first sight grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed. And let Hope (whom you may also imagine to be well favoured, and diversly drest) take him in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment by the hand, and lead him in, and from his first entrance go before him: then let other women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, namely, Deceit, and Servitude, and deliver him over to labour. And let Labour after long exercise deliver the Wretch over to Old age, diseased, and wittherd in his face, and colour. Lastly, let Contempt hurry him to Despaire; &amp; from that time let Hope vanish, and forsake him, &amp; fly away. Then let him be cast out, not at the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Porch, at which he entred, but at some Back-door, or dark Out-let, naked, hungry, pale, aged, with one hand covering his shame, with the other choking himself. At his ejection let helplesse Weeping and Repentance meet him, and double his misery. And let the Picture here end. Now do you, <hi>Timocles,</hi> having well weighed my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, consider, whither you be content to enter at the Golden Door, and be dishonourably thrust out at the Postern. And what course soever you undertake, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the saying of a Wise man; <hi>God is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but your own Choice.</hi>

            <head>A Defence of those who are imployed for Reward.</head>
            <p>I Have long considered with my self, Excellent <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> what you thought or said, when you read my Book, concerning those who are imploied for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For I am verily perswaded you could not forbear laughing in the perusall. Though you made some obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by the way, which I will now answer agreeably to my writings. If my Divination faile me not, me thinks I hear you say; Is this he who wrote those things, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed so bitterly against this course of life, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of his own Satyr, upon the turning of the shell, as they say, hath voluntarily put himself into an eminent and illustrious Service? What <hi>Midas,</hi> or <hi>Croesus,</hi> or streams of Gold, could once tempt him to forsake his dear Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bred up with him of a child? Yet though he be not far from <hi>Aeacus,</hi> and have one foot in <hi>Charons</hi> boat, now submits he himself to be tost, and drawn, as if he were fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the neck with a golden Collar, or some great mans chain of Corral? Surely there is a wide difference between this new course and his writings. Rivers me thinks do now run backwards, and the order of things is inverted. Recantations are made for the worse; and all this change is not for the fruition of a <hi>Helen,</hi> or the conquest of a <hi>Troy,</hi> but meerly that a good discourse may be subverted by an ill choice. Thus, in all likelihood, do you say to your self; and are, it may be, ready to give more seasonable and friendly counsell, and such as becomes an honest man, and a Philosopher. If therefore I personate you right, I shall think my self happy, and will sacrifice to Eloquence: if not, do you supply my defects. 'Tis time then we shift the Scene, and that I be a Mute, and patiently for my cure submit my selfe to be lanced, or if you
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93795:55"/>
think fit, feared by you; and that you apply your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and have your knife, and burning Iron in readiness. Taking your Cue, then, to speak, thus you accost me: Heretofore, my friend, your Book (as it well deserved) was much valued, and, as the report goes, was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived both by the multitude, and by as many of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as read it, or took it into their hands. For your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is faultlesse, your narration various, and such as both shews your experience in businesse, and your perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity in the delivery. But above all, as your writings are generally usefull, so especially to Schollers, who from hence are taught not to enter themselves rashly into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. But when you shall alter your opinion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the contrary course, and bid a long farewell to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and practice that ignoble Iambick, <hi>That where gaine may be had, you are to serve against nature,</hi> take heed no man over hear you reading your own works, or meeting with them compare your present life with your writings. Pray also to Infernall <hi>Mercury,</hi> to besprinkle those who have heretofore heard of them, with the water of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion: lest, like <hi>Bellerophon</hi> in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Tragedy, you prove to have written a Book against your self. For my part, I cannot see with what face you can defend your self against your Accusers; especially if they should mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily praise your writings, and the liberty of them, and see you the Author waiting, and voluntarily submitting your neck to the yoke: since they might probably enough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title some more generous person to your Book, and say you are but the <hi>Iay,</hi> who triumph in borrowed feathers; or if it be yours, that you have done like <hi>Salaethus,</hi> who imposing a sharp Law upon the <hi>Crotonians</hi> against Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, for which he was much reverenced, was not long after caught in the Act of incest, with his brothers wife. So some man may not unfitly compare you to <hi>Salaethus</hi>; But that he was more excusable, who (as he urged for himselfe) was drawn by his affection, and did voluntarily
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93795:55"/>
cast himselfe into the fire: upon which reason the <hi>Croto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> out of pitty gave him his choice of Banishment. Whereas you much more absurdly, having written an exact description, and inveighed against the servile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those, who retain to great persons, and cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into fetters, where they act and suffer a thousand Calamities, in your extreame age, when you are almost beyond the threshold, have made choice of an ignoble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and are ready to triumph in it. By how much, therefore, the more eminent, and advanced you shew, by so much the more are you laught at, as one whose life contradicts your writings. Nor shall I need to urge any other complaint against you, then that of the excellent <hi>Tragedian; I hate that wise man who is not wise for himselfe.</hi> Your Accusers, perhappes, will not lack other examples to compare you to. Some will liken you to Actors in a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> who are <hi>Agamemnon</hi> or <hi>Creon,</hi> or <hi>Hercules</hi> upon the Stage; but in the Tiring house when they have put off their properties, are <hi>Polus,</hi> or <hi>Aristodemus,</hi> fellowes hired to act, and many times hist, whip't and pluckt off the stage at the mercy of the Theatre. Others will resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to an Ape, which they say <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had; which being taught to dance, a great while footed it very comely, and gracefully, and maintained her postures with great admiration, and kept time and measure with them who sung, and plaid a Hymenaeall galliard: Till at length perceiving a Fig, or an Almond a farre off, she tore of her vizard, and leaping to the Fig bid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arewell to the fiddles, and dances, and fell to eating. So you, may some man say, who are no player, but a learned Author, and excellent Lawgiver, at the sight of a Fig have shown your selfe an Ape, and a Philosopher but from the teeth outward; who conceale some things, and speak other; and leave it to mens suspicion to conjecture, that what you say or are praised for, hath but only touch't your lipps, and never wet your Palate. Your punishment hath followed you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93795:56"/>
who, when you had audaciously insulted over other mens wants, not long after as good as sold your own Liberty by a Crier. And <hi>Adrastia</hi> was at your back, laughing at your Brags, and contempts of those indignities which you despised in other men: Because she foresaw, being a Goddesse, that you would in time fall upon their course; and because you did not first spit in your own bosome, before you blamed those who through the many changes of fortune have been cast upon that condition. Suppose <hi>Eschines,</hi> after his accusation of <hi>Timarchus</hi> should have offended and have been questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the same fault: would it not have stird the Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Spectators to see him inveigh against <hi>Timarchus,</hi> for a crime of youth, and being an old man commit the same himselfe? Lastly, you are like the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> who boasted much of his medicine against the Cough, and promised to cure men at one taking, and was all the while shaken with a Cough himselfe. This and much more, may such an Accuser, as you, say, in an Argument so spatious, and replenish't with objections. 'Tis time then, I now turne my selfe to my Apology, and Defence, wherein my best way (who suffer voluntarily, and have submitted my back to the whippe, nor deny it to be a disparagement) will be, perhappes, to flie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon excuse, and pretend Fortune and Fate, and with their pardon to desire my reprehenders to consider that we are not our own Lords, but are swayed against our inclinations by some superior power, or one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies, and are therefore excusable in all things which we either do or speak. But this way of defence is too Vulgar for you, my friend, to allow of; Though I have <hi>Homer</hi> for my Advocate, and those Verses from him,
<q>
                  <l>No man could ever yet his fate eschew:</l>
                  <l>Assoone as we are borne fate rules our clue.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93795:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Laying aside, therefore, an Apology so unreasonable, if I say, that I was neither inticed by gaine or any such like expectation, to undertake my present attendance, but that meerly out of my admiration of the wisedome, valour, and noblenesse of the person to whom I belong, desired to be imployed in his affaires; I fear least to your former accusation you will think I flatter, and catch me, as they say, driving one naile with another, or a lesser fault with a greater<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> since flattery of all vices is the most servile, and therefore the worst. What remaines, then, if neither of these Defences be allowable, but that I confesse my selfe unable to make any sound defence at all? One An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor more, perhappes, I have never yet cast, or wet, which is to pretend old age, sicknesse, and beyond both these poverty, vvhich persvvades men for it's avoydance, to do or suffer all things. And here I might seasonably call in <hi>Medea</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> to my assistance, and vvith a little detorsion make her speak for me in lambicks, and say,
<q>
                  <l>The things I am about to do are ill,</l>
                  <l>But that my poverty withstands my will.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As for that peece of <hi>Theognis,</hi> 'tis knovvn vvithout my quotation; vvho saies, <hi>They are not to be blamed, who, to avoid poverty, cast themselves into the deep sea, or fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from a steep rock.</hi> These are the colours vvhich ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in my case would bring into his Apology; of which not one, I confesse, is specious, or well favoured. But be confident of me, my friend, that I will not make use of one of them. For <hi>Argos</hi> was never so opprest with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as to consult about the ploughing of the sands of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi>; Nor am I so utterly unprovided of an answer, as to flee to such poore starting holes, for my defence. Consider, therefore, I pray, the great difference between one hired into a Rich mans family, to serve, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the drudgeries, set down in my book, and one who
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93795:57"/>
receives pension from his Prince to look after publick affaires, and imploies his parts in the service of the state. Consider this, I pray, and weigh these two conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and you will find that they differ, as the Musitians say, the whole <hi>Gamut</hi>: And that there is as much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between these two courses of life, as between lead and silver, brasse and Gold, wild poppy and a rose, a man and an ape. 'Tis true both receive pay, and are under another; But then there is a vast disproportion in their imployments. The one undergoes a downright servitude, and is no better then a Mercenary houshold Drudg: whereas the other who handles publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and bestowes his Labour upon Citties, and whole nations, is not to be blamed, or to be drawn into resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or made sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er with the other in accusation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both receive pay. For then all great officers are to be deposed, nor should the Governors of Provinces, Rulers of Citties, and Captaines, or Generalls, of Troops, and Armies, be honourably thought of, because there is a reward set to their imployment. One exception, there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, ought not to have the force of a generall disgrace; nor are we to place all those who take reward in equall rank. Briefly, I said not in my book, that all that took payment were of a miserable condition, but only pittied those who under the pretence of their Learning were entertained, and enslaved by great Families. My imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my friend, is utterly different. For though we be equall in our Domestick dependances, yet abroad I share in Government with the Emperour, and cooperate my part. For, if you mark well, no small portion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is under my government: who ordain their formes of Judicature, and impose orders upon the people; and take records of what-ever is done, or spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and judge of the pleadings of their Lawyers: and not only keep the Decrees of my Prince with all fidelity, after the safest and exactest manner, but deliver them to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93795:57"/>
the people to be a perpetuall rule to their obedience. Nor is my reward private, but from the Prince; nor contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, but paid by talents. And hereafter if matters hit right, I cherish no vain empty hopes to be made Ruler of some Province, or to have some Princely Imployment cast upon me. I will yet take the liberty to clear my self from the Accusations thrown upon me by a more ample Defence; And dare tell you that No man doth businesse unrewarded, no not those of highest imployment: I will not except Princes themselves. I speak not now of their Customes, and Tributes, which are yearly paid by their Subjects; but of their greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, their Praises, publick Reverence, and veneration for their good Deeds. As also Statues, Temples, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, erected to them by their Subjects: all which are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the providence and care, which they sustain in looking after the Publick, and studying the common good. So that if you will compare small things with great, and beginning at the top of the Heap, descend by all the Grains whereof it is composed, you will see, that we below differ from those aloft, but as the lesse from the greater, being all Mercenaries alike. If therefore I had enacted a Law that none should suffer themselves to be Imployed at all, I might very well seem my self a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor. But if there be no one such passage in my whole Book, and that it becomes every vertuous man to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, how can he better busy himself, then in assisting his friends in the best Imployments, &amp; in giving some clear publick tryall of himself, with what fidelity, care, and sweetnesse, he can discharge those affaires which are put into his hands, lest he fulfill the saying of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>be an unprofitable load to the Earth?</hi> Besides, I would have my Reprehenders remember, that when they blame me, they accuse not a wise man, (if yet there be any wise man to be found) but one from among the people, who hath applied himself to learning, and therein attained some lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93795:58"/>
proficiency, but never was practised to those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime vertues, approachable only to great Schollers. Nor am I sorry for it, since I never yet met with the person, who in all things answered the Character of a Wise man. In the mean time I cannot but marvaile, if you should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like my present course of life; who long since know what great gains came in to me, when I was a pleader; at that time when you went to see <hi>France,</hi> and the Western Ocean, and met with me, who was then reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the most high priced Orators. This Apology, my Friend, have I, amid'st a thousand Imployments, made to you, as one who shall not slightly value your favourable and full acceptance. For as for others, though they all should conspire in their Accusations, my protection shall be the old Proverb; <hi>Hippoclides cares not.</hi>

               <p>One got into a Fortresse, where a Tyrant lived, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to kill him. But, not finding him, kill'd his Son, and left the sword in his body. The Tyrant coming in, and seeing his Son dead, with the same sword kills himself. He that slew the Son demands the reward of a Tyrant-slayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THough, O ye Judges, I have in one day slain two Tyrants; one aged and feeble, the other young and vigorous, and so the more apt to succeed in his Fathers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; yet I stand here to demand but one recompence for both. Of all those that ever kill'd Tyrants, I am the first who have freed you from two with one wound, and have slain the Son with my Sword, the Father with his Affection to his Son: who hath made us ample satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for those things he hath done, in living to see his Son
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93795:58"/>
first murthered, and then (a thing till now strange) forced to be the Tyrant-slayer to himself. His Son dyed by my hand, and being dead, became my Engine to a second Murther: who in his life time partaked with his father in his Injustice, and at his death, as well as he could, became his Parricide. 'Tis I then, who have put an end to his Tyranny; and 'tis my Sword which hath wrought your deliverance. However I inverted the order of my slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and atchieved their murthers an unusuall way; killing him who was the stronger, and ablest to defend himself with my own hand, and leaving my bare sword to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch the other. I expected therefore from you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary, and that my rewards should in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber equall those I have destroyed: seeing I have not only freed you from your present calamities, but from all fears of future, and have establisht you in a firme liberty; there being no heir left of your mischiefs. But on the contrary, after such glorious atchievements, I am not only in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be dismissed by you unrewarded, but am the only man who am denyed the recompence designed me by those Laws I have preserved. He, therefore, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands my demand, in my judgment doth it not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the publick, but out of sorrow to those who are slain, and revenge to him who was the author of their death. Afford me therefore your attention, Judges, whilst I decipher to you (though you know them already) the miseries of a Tyranny: for thereby you will both discern the greatnesse of my benefit, and increase your joies from the apprehension of those calamities from whence you are releast. First then, we felt not a single Tyranny (as it many times befalls others) nor were enslaved in a single bondage, nor subjected to the desires of one Master; but of all others, who ever suffer'd the like, in stead of one Tyrant had two over us, and were miserably distracted by severall oppressions. The Father indeed was the more moderate, and hardlier to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93795:59"/>
enraged, slacker in his punishments, and slower in his lusts; his age having at length mitigated his violence, and cast a bridle on his desires. Nay at the very first, as it was said, he was contrary to his own inclination put upon his unlawfull practices by his Son; being not himself Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, but only in complyance with him: for how extreme dear his Son was to him, appeared by his death. His Son was to him all things; him he obeyed, oppress'd whom he commanded, punisht as he appointed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him in all things. In a word, the Son was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant over the Father, and the Father was but an Officer to his Sons lusts. And though the young man, by reason of his age, let the old enjoy the Honour, and esteemed not the name of the Kingdome; yet he, in truth, was the head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tyrant. And though the Father fortified and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his power by him, yet the Son alone enjoyed the fruits of the others Injustice. He it was who ordered the Guard, appointed Garrisons, cut off those who affected the Crown, and feared Conspirators. He it was, who made Eunuchs, violated Wedlocks, and deflowred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. All Slaughters, Banishments, Exactions, Torturs, and Injuries, were his bold Contrivances: whilst the old man only obeyed, and countenanced, and applauded the wicked enterprises of his Son. This made our calamities insupportable. For when the desires of the mind are backt by supream power, they admit no limits of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. But that which grieved us most, was, that we foresaw a perpetuall Slavery growing upon us, and the common wealth likely to descend in a succession, from one Master to another, and the people in a direct way to be made the Inheritance of a wicked Tyrant. Whereas it hath been no small comfort to men in our case, to be able to discourse, and say among themselves, This Tyrant will not alwaies live, he will dye in time, and we shall ere long be free: vvhich fell not under our hopes. For vve had in our eyes a Successor in the Tyranny, vvhich made
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93795:59"/>
none of our Citizens dare to put in practice my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though they were valiant, and had my attempt in their designe, and wishes: But Liberty was despaired of by all, and the Tyranny seemed inexpugnable, though many had inclinations to the enterprize. This daunted me not, nor was I dishearten'd by the difficulty of the Action, nor frighted with the danger. But unassisted, and single, I went against a strong and numerous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; or rather not single, but assisted by my sword, which shared in my slaughter of the Tyrant. Having death before my eyes, and the publick Liberty purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by my death before my apprehension. First then encountring the outer Guard, and not easily putting the keepers to flight, and killing him that came next, and offered to make resistance, I reacht at length the toppe of my adventure, the only strength of the Tyranny, and the spring head of all our miseries. And rushing into the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Castle, after a valiant defence, and resistance of many thrusts, and wounds I slew him. At which instant the Tyranny ceast, and my enterprize had an end. And from that time we recovered our Liberty. No impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remained but an old, solitary man, unarmed, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his Guard, especially of his great Protector, and unworthy to fall by a valiant hand. I, therefore, most equall Judges, made this discourse to my selfe; All things are fallen out succesfully, I have atchieved my enterprize, and accomplish't my designes. But how shall he that survives be slain? He is unworthy of me, or my hand, and if after my other glorious, valiant, and generous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, I should kill him, he would shame my victory: we must, therefore, find out some publick executioner for him. But let him be first tortured, least he gaine by his punishment; let him see, and be rackt at the sight of my sword, to which I leave the farther accomplishment of my designe. Having thus consulted with my selfe, I left the place. He, just as I presage, kill'd himselfe, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93795:60"/>
put an end to the Tragedy. Hither, then, am I come, and have brought a <hi>Democracy</hi> with me, and do bid you take courage, and proclaime a generall Liberty to all. From henceforth enjoy the benefit of my performances. The Fort you see is dispeopled of Tyrants; There is none left to bare sway. 'Tis in your power now to preferre, sentence, or contradict, according to the Lawes. All which you are to ascribe to me, and my valour, and that one slaughter which the Father could not possibly survive: I cannot, therefore, but in Justice require a reward, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to my attempt: not that I am covetous of gain, or sordid in my desires, or one who would obliege my country to pay, but because I am willing to confirme by my reward, and not suffer my enterprize to die and passe away ingloriously, as imperfect and unworthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. But here my adversary may reply, and say, 'tis not reasonable I should be honoured, or rewarded, who have not slain a Tyrant, nor accomplisht the Lawe, since something is imperfect in my atchievement, which should make me capable of recompence. Let me ask him, what more he can require of me? Was it not my plot? Enter'd I not the Fort? Did I not kill? procured I not your Liberty? Doth any man rule or domineer over you? are you threaten'd by any Master? hath any one of your oppressors escap't me? You cannot gainsay me, but must confesse, that you now enjoy a full peace; your lawes are restored; your liberty is apparent; a <hi>Democracy</hi> is setled; your marriages are unviolated; your sonnes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prostituted; your Virgins safe; and the Citty free to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the publique felicity. And who is the cause, and contriver of all this? who removed your Calamities, and procured your welfare? If there be any who deserves to be honoured before me, I will decline my satisfaction, and resigne to him my reward. But if I alone did all, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, put my selfe in hazard, scaled the Castle, slew, tormented, and made one the engine to kill the other;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93795:60"/>
why should he detract from my atchievement? or stirre the disaffection of the people against me? But I slew not the Tyrant, and therefore have no right to the reward provided by the law. Tell me, what difference is there between killing him, and being the occasion of his death? Certainly, none at all. Nor was the intention of the Law-maker any other, then meerly to aime at Liberty, popular goverment, and the removall of Usurpers; And thereunto to propose honours, and rewards: which you cannot deny to have been by me atchieved. For I slew him, without whom the other could not live; the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was mine. I gave the wound, he only lent the hand. Question not then overcuriously the manner of his death, nor examine how he died, but whither he be dead, and whither dead by my meanes. Otherwise by your inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries you may detract from one who deserves well of the state, because he slew not the Tyrant with a sword, but with a stone, or a logge, or some other way. What if I had besiedged the Tyrant, and starved him to Death? Had it not been a legall murther, because I slew him not with my own hand? or would you say I had not satisfied the Law, though I slew him a more cruell vvay? The only thing, therefore, you are novv to make enquirie of is this, vvhat usurper is left? What seeds of fear? What impression of Thraldome? If all be clear, and calme, 'tis a peece of envy and detraction in any man, for vvant of one slight circumstance in an Action, to deny vertue, and valour its revvard. I remember the Lavves distinguish (if I have not forgot their vvords through a long bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage) of a double cause of Death; if one man kill another vvith his ovvn hand; or if he kill him not himselfe or vvith his ovvn hand, but be the contriver, or occasion of his Death. And hath equally provided a punishment alike for both. Decreeing very justly that in such cases the attempt shall be equall to the Fact; and passing by the manner of the Murther as superfluous. You think fit,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93795:61"/>
then, that he who shall thus kill another, shall be punisht as a manslayer, and not have his pardon: and will you not allow me, who have in like manner saved my country, the rewards agreeable to one of such desertes? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say I slew him unwittingly, and that my successe was fortunate beyond my expectation. For what could daunt me having slaine the stronger? Why did I leave my sword in the wound, but because I presaged what would afterwards come to passe? Unlesse you will say that he who is dead was no Tyrant, nor carried the name of one; and that you would not have awarded me any great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the exploit, if I had kill'd him. But you cannot say so. A Tyrant, then, being slaine will you not reward the Author, and occasion of his Death? O sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety! Do you possesse your Liberty, and yet question hovv he vvas slaine? Or do you yet require more of him, vvho hath restored your popular government? But the Lavv, say you, enquires precisely vvhat is done, and considers not curiously the manner and means of the Action. But vvhat? shall not he that but expells a Tyrant be revvarded? He ought in Justice, having introduced Freedome instead of Bondage. But my fact is not a bare expulsion, or banishment, nor have I left them any hopes of future recovery, or restitution; But an utter taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay, and destruction of the vvhole Linage; and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall extirpation of all our miseries. Examine then, if you please, my whole enterprize from the beginning to the end, and see whither any thing required by the Law have been omitted, and wherein I have come short of being the killer of a Tyrant. First, to such an attempt is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red boldnesse of courage, and such an affection to ones Country, as refuseth not to encounter dangers for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, or to purchase the publick safety with the losse of a private life. Have I failed hitherto? was I daunted, or did I sluggishly break through the perills, with which I foresaw I was to skirmish? You cannot
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93795:61"/>
say I did. Here, then, stay a little and consider, whither barely to intend, and project such an exploit were not glorious; and whither for my meer designe, I may not justly claime the recompence of a good Patriot; or if I had failed of my will, and another comming after me had killd the Tyrant, tell me, had it been unreasonable for you to reward me? or if I should say, My dear Countreymen I purposed, intended, attempted, show'd my good will, and am only worthy to be rewarded; what would you answer? But this is not all I can say; I scaled the Fort, Countreymen, and encircled my selfe with a thousand dangers, before I slew the Prince. For I would not have you think it an easy, or slight adventure, for one man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly to break through a Troop, to vanquish a guard, and to put such a multitude to flight: But to account it the Toppe, and pinnacle of the exploit. For a Tyrant is no hard thing to be encountred, and overcome, but those who guard, and defend the Tyranny; which who so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers hath finisht his enterprize, and left little else to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved. I, then, had never approacht the Tyrants, had I not first vanquish't and overcome their Guards, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. Upon which part of my adventure, before I go farther, let me dwell a little. I vanquisht their guards, I say, and overcame their attendants, and left the Tyrant naked, disarmed, and undefended. Am I yet, think you worthy of Honour, or do you require his slaughter too? if you do, I can satisfie your expectation. Behold the Bloud with which I am yet sprinkled, since the valiant, and stout murther of a youth of flourishing age, feared by all, by whom the Tyrant was secured from Treasons, and who was his confidence, and a greater protection to him then his Guards. And am I not yet, think you, worthy of reward, but shall I after all my great Actions, be sent away dishonourably? what if I had slaine but one of his Guard, or an attendant on his person, or some favourite servant? Had it not been a glorious Act to ascend
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93795:62"/>
a Fort, and in the midst of a Garrison to kill a near friend of the Tyrants? Consider next him who was slaine. 'Twas the sonne of the Tyrant; or rather the crueller Tyrant of the two; A master more insufferable, to revenge proner, in his injuries more furious; and above all the only heire of his father, and like to prolong our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by his succession. Suppose I had only slaine him, and that the Tyrant had saved himselfe by flight. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a reward for that Action. What say you? will you deny me? was't not he you dreaded? was not he your cruel, intolerable master? If I have not yet done enough, consider the heart and utmost of my exploit; that which my Gainsayer requires of me, I have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously atchieved, and through anothers vvound have slaine the Tyrant; not at one single blovv (vvhich perhaps after so much injustice he could have vvisht) but by a slovv, and lingring griefe, prostrating before his eyes the thing most deare to him, his sonne, I meane, vitious, but in the spring of his age, and flourishing, and, like his father, wallowing in his own bloud, and Gore. These are the right wounds of parents, these the swords of him who would truely kill a Tyrant; And this is the death which cruell Tyrants are to suffer; and this is a revenge fit for so many oppressions. To die presently, as it were in a short swoone, and behold no tormenting spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, is a punishment too unworthy of a Tyrant. I was not ignorant, Judges, I was not ignorant, nor any man else, how passionately he was affected towards his sonne, and how he resolved not to survive him a minute. All parents are affectionate to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; But he had a stronger and juster reason, having but him only to uphold, and preserve the Tyrannie; To ward, and shield him from conspiracies, and fix the scepter in his hand. 'Twas in my foresight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that if his affection did not, his despaire would presently kill him; assone as he consider'd, that having
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93795:62"/>
lost his safety with his sonne, he had no encouragement to live longer. In one Troope I presented to his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension his naturall affection, griefe, despaire, feare, and terrors for the future. These were the forces I raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and drove him to that fatall execution of himselfe. In revenge to you he died childlesse, tortured, lamenting, and shedding teares. His sorrow indeed was not long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but enough for a father. But that which is yet most cruell, he fell by his own hand: A death much more miserable, and bitter, then if another had been the author. Here is my sword, who claimes it? whose wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ever was it but mine? who carried it into the fort? who ever used it before the Tyrant? or who sent it to him? O Blade? thou partner, and successor, in my great exploits, after so many perills, and so many slaughters, are we neglected, and held unworthy of reward? should I demand a recompence for my sword only, and should say, Countreymen, when the Tyrant had a mind to kill himselfe, and for the time wanted a weapon, my sword supplied him, and became the instrument of all your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; you would certainly decide some honour, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Blade. Nay would you not have been thankfull to the master of so publick an instrument, and have enrolled him among those who have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to their Countrey? would you not have laid up my sword in your Temples, and have sacrificed to it as to the Gods? Consider, with me, I pray, what in likelyhood the Tyrant did, or said before he killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. After I had stabbed his sonne, and thrust him through with many wounds, in the most open, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable places of his body, the more to torment his father, with the spectacle, and rack him with the sight, he pittifully cried out and invok't his father, unable to assist, or rescue him, being both old and feeble, and having but just sight enough left to behold the Calamities of his house. I, in the meane time, the contriver of the whole
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93795:63"/>
Tragedy, conveyed my selfe away, and left him a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded body, stage, sword, and all things else for the fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of my part. He entring, and seeing his only sonne gasping, and welring in his bloud, strugling with death, having received wounds all over, and many of them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, fell into this exclamation: O my dear sonne! we are destroyed, butcherd, and slaine as Tyrants. Where is the Murtherer? For whom reserves he me? or what intends he to do with me, who am already slaine in Thee? doth he despise to kill me by reason of my age? or is it to prolong my punishment, and lengthen my death, and spinne out my slaughter? Thus saying, he lookes about for a weapon, (being himselfe unarmed, as still having his sonne for his defence) which was there ready for him, prepared before, and left by me for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Tragedy. Having drawn forth the sword out of the wound, Thou hast halfe slaine me already, said he, now kill me outright. Be thou the reliefe and succour of a forlorne father; assist my decrepit hand with thy-edge, and stabbe me, whilest I am yet a Prince, and deliver me from my sorrowes. Would I had received thy first stroke, and had died first: Though I had died as a Tyrant, yet I had left a revenger; whereas now I die not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sonne, but without one to kill me. Having thus said, he stabbed himself, trembling and unable to thrust home; having a desire, but not strength enough for the attempt. How many punishments were here? how many wounds? how many deaths? how many slaughters? how many Garlands due?

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>A Dis-inherited Son learnt Physick, and caring his Father of a Phrenzy, after he was given over by other Physitians, was restored to favour. Afterwards being commanded to cure his Step-Mother of the like Phrenzy, and refusing, he is dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the second time. He defends himself.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat which my Father hath now done, O ye Judges, is neither new nor strange; nor is this the first time he hath been carried away by his displeasure; but hath heretofore made use of this Law, and is practised in his proceedings against me at this Tribunall. All that is new in my present Misfortune is, that having committed noe offence, fit to be brought into Accusation, I am in danger to be punisht for my Art; because it cannot in all things obey his impossible commands. Then which what can be more unreasonable? For he requires that my Skill should be as great as his Injunctions, and that I should work Cures, not as my Profession is able, but as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to impose. I could, therefore, wish there were not only Receipts in Physick to recover people distracted, but those also who are without cause inclined to passion: that so I might cure my Father of one disease more; who being perfectly freed from one Distraction, is carried by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93795:64"/>
into another. And to make my c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se the more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, he is recovered to every body else; only against me, who recover'd him, he still retains his fury. You see how I am rewarded for my Cure, who am cast off by him, and made a Stranger to his Family the second time. As if he had only restored me for a while, that to my greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy he might often banish me his house. To those cures which fall within the compasse of my skill, I expect not to be commanded; who voluntarily, and unsent for, wrought his recovery: but where the Malady carries de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair with it, I would not willingly be an undertaker. Of all others I have good reason not to attempt the cure of this woman: considering what I am likely to suffer from my Father, if I miscarry; who, for not daring to adventure upon her, am dis-inherited. I cannot therefore, O ye Judges, but bewaile my Step-Mother in the case she is in; for she was a vertuous woman: next my Father, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in her Madnesse; but especially my self, who am thought disobedient, because I cannot effect what I am required, both for the greatnesse of the disease, and the smallnesse of my skill. To be dis-inherited, then, for not undertaking a cure, which I am not able to effect, I hold most unjust: and desire you to judge from these present proceedings, upon what grounds I was cast off hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Though I doubt not but for the clearing of them, my Behaviour and life have long since been my Defence. To those things whereof I am now accused, I will answer as well as I can; having first briefly acquainted you with the state of my case. At that time, when my Father ceas'd not to proclaime me for a stubborn, rebellious, disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Son, the disgrace of my Parents, and infamy of my house, I thought it best, not to make only a short Defence, but leaving his house, thought my best remedy and appeal would be to my future carriage, and life; when it should appear how free I was form his aspersions, and in what honest studies I imployed my self, and what vertuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93795:64"/>
I kept. For I then foresaw, and had it in my suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that my Father being of no very sound mind, would at some time or other without my desert grow furious, and hatch false accusations against me. And some there were who construed those proceedings, as the beginning of his Distraction; and judged his causelesse hatred of me, his froward carriage, his meditated railings, hard censures, clamorous fits of anger, and extreme inclination to Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as so many threats, and forerunning darts of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Phrenzy. Wherefore I thought it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me to learn Physick with all speed: and thereupon went to Travell, and acquainting my self with the most approved Physitians of other Countries, with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and diligent study I learned the Art. At my return I find my Father plainly distracted, and given over by other Physitians, who do not sound, or make any exact judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diseases. I, therefore, as it became a pious Son, neither remembred my Abdication, nor staid to be sent for; having, indeed, nothing personall to lay to his charge, since his ill dealings with me, were not his own, but the faults of his disease. Offering, therefore, my self, as I said, unsent for, I proceeded not presently to his cure; which had been to depart form my usuall practice, and from the lawes of our Profession, by which we are taught first to examine whither the disease be cureable, or incureable, and exceed the limits of our Art. And then if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeable, we apply remedies, and imploy our whole stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies about the recovery of the Patient. But if we find the Malady too strong, and not to be conquer'd, we forbear to prescribe at all; but observe their ancient Rule, who were the Inventors and Fathers of the Art, who forbid us to medle with overgrowne diseases. Finding, therefore, my Father nor past hope, nor his distemper past cure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first weighed all circumstances, I undertook him, and confidently gave him Physick. Many of the standers by suspecting my prescription, spake in disparagement of the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93795:65"/>
cure, and were ready to call me into question: my Step-Mother also was present, fearfull, and distrustfull, not of hate to me, but care to him; whom she perfectly knew so ill disposed, having long converst, and been a witnesse to his Distemper: yet I not at all discouraged (knowing his Symptomes did not lye, and that my Art could not deceive me) at fit times stole a cure into him. Though some, who were my friends, disswaded me from undertaking; lest miscarrying in my attempt, I should draw a fresh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation upon my selfe, and be thought to have poisoned my Father, in remembrance of my Injuries. In a word, in a short time he recovered, and grew sober again, and had the perfect use of his understanding. His neighbors and friends marvelled, my Step-Mother applauded me, and publickly congratulated, me, for my good successe; him, for his recovery. He also (for so much I can witnesse for him) without any delay, or consultation with any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, no sooner understood things from those who were present, but cancell'd his Abdication, made me his Son againe, calling me his Preserver and Benefactor? confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he had now received an exact T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yall of me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing himself for what had formerly past. This much rejoyced many of the company, those especially who were honest. Though it grieved others, for whom the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Son made more then the Reconcilement: so that all were not a like affected. But I could see some change colour, and appear troubled in their looks, and angry in their countenance, the sure marks of Envy, and discon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tent. We in the mean time, as 'twas fit, enterchanged joyes and embraces, being now reconciled to one another. Not long after, O ye Judges, my Mother in law fell sick of a cruell and desperate Distemper. For, as I observed from her first surprize, it was not a slight, or superficiall kind of Madnesse, but an ancient and inveterate, which had long lodged in her soule; and having got the victory, then broke forth, and discover'd it selfe. We have many
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93795:65"/>
other signes to know who are incurably madde, but the common one I observed in her, which is this; that to all others she is quiet, and calme, and as long as they are present falls into no ragings: But if she see a Physitian, or but hear his voice, she presently falls a raving at him, which is an infallible signe that she is irrecoverably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd. All I could do, was to bemone and pitty her, as it well became me, who without her merit became thus distracted. Yet my father out of his want of skill (for he neither knowes the spring nor cause, nor growth of the distemper) commands me to cure her, and to prescribe her his potion: supposing it to be the same kind of madnesse, and the like disease to his, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction of the same nature, and the same way cureable. And when I tell him, that which is most true, that 'tis not possible to restore her, and confesse my selfe overmaster'd by the disease; he fumes, and chides, and saies I refuse of purpose, and deny her my help, and so makes the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my Art a Crime. Agreeing herein with all others opprest with sorrow, that they grow angry to hear truth plainly and freely told them. I, then, as vvell as I can, vvill make my defence, and ansvver both for my selfe, and profession: and vvill take my beginning from the Lavv, by vvhich he vvould disinherit me; vvhere it shall appeare, that his povver is not the same as 'tvvas before. For the Lavvgiver, my good father, hath not given this povver to all, nor intended that all sonnes should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, as oft as the father list, or upon vvhat discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents he lift. But as he hath allowed parents in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to be displeased, so he hath provided that children without their Desert shall not be rejected. And for this reason, he permits not punishments to be Arbitrary, or without judiciall Trials; but hath appointed a Tribunall, and Judges, to determine things without prejudice, or passion. For he saw that many men were many times moved to anger upon unjust grounds: one out of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93795:66"/>
to a false report, another upon the misinformation of a servant, or a malicious wife: He thought it not fit, therefore, that matters should passe without Legall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, or that children without any defence should presently be condemned; But the houreglasse is set up, reasons are shown, and nothing is left undiscussed. All the power, therefore, which a father hath, is to appeal to you, O ye Judges: The power to Judge whither his complaint be reasonable belonges to you: Consider not then, yet a while, what my crime is, for which my Father is displeased; but consider, first, whither he have authority to disinherit me again, having once cast me off; used the power of the Law; accomplish't the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a parent; and after all this received me into his family, and cancell'd his Abdication. For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think it most unreasonable, that the punishments of children should be numberlesse, or that their Doomes should be infinite, and their fears perpetuall: Or that the Law should permit parents, sometimes to Cashiere, afterwards to recall their Act, then again put it in force; and so shuffle and tosse the Law up and down as they see occasion. 'Twas fit, indeed, the Law for the first time, should make the parent Lord of his childes punishment, and should give authority to his displeasure. But when the parent hath once spent his authority, and sufficiently used the law for satisfaction of his anger, and hath once again restored his sonne, out of his perswasion of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; he ought to be constant to his pacification, and not fall back, or alter his resolutions, or make void his Act. At Nativities, whither he that is born will prove well or ill, I suppose cannot fall under any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And for that reason 'tis permitted to parents, to cast off those who degenerate from their descent. But when a Father, not constrained, but out of his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and choice, shall approve, and restore his sonne, what device can he have for his inconstancy, or what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93795:66"/>
use is there of Lawes? For thus will the Lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker say; If your sonne were vitious, and worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, why did you restore him? why did you receive him again into your house? why did you frustrate the Law? You were free, and Lord of your own Actions. You are not to play with the Lawes, as you list, nor are statutes to vary with your Changes; nor Acts of state to be sometimes of force, sometimes invalid, or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to sit as witnesses only, nay as officers of your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to punish or absolve at your Discretion. You begat your sonne once, and gave him education once; and, therefore, 'tis once permitted you to reject him, provided you do it upon just reasons. But to assume an endlesse, perpetuall, frequent, and arbitrary power to your selfe, is above the Commission of a father. Wherefore, O ye Judges, be it farre from you to grant, that having made a voluntary reconciliation, and dissolved his first sentence, and made voyde his displeasure, he should have Liberty to revive his past punishment, or have recourse to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a Father, which is longe since expired, unpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged, forcelesse, and spent. Consider, also, the practices of other Courts, where Judges sentence by Lot, which if any man think unjust, the Law allowes him to appeal to another Court. But if any voluntarily assigne their own Judges, and referre their cause to Umpires, 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For their Decisions, which at first might have been refused, after they are once chosen Arbitrators, are in Justice to be stood to. So you, my father, (in whose choice it was whither you would have restored me, till I had been thought worthy of my Ancestors) out of your beliefe of my reformation, having once restored me, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not again disinherit me. For by your own Testimony I have been judged unworthy of the like rejection, and acknowledged worthy of your favour. You are not, therefore, to repent of your restitution, but to confirme your reconcilement, after your severall judgments and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93795:67"/>
two sentences: one when you ejected me, the other when you revok't your purpose, and took me again into your Family; Cancelling your former Decrees, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing future. Be constant then to your own Acts, and make good your own Ordinances. Since your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, profest, and oblieged your selfe to be one, be still a Father. Were I not a naturall, but an adopted sonne, I should think 'twere not lawfull for you again to disinherit me. For what was once in your power to do or not do, being once done, is not in your power to be recalled. How can it, then, be reasonable to expell often, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive a naturall sonne of his relation, having by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary election and decree calld him back from expulsion? Suppose I were your servant, and you upon your suspicion of some misdemeanors should cast me into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etters, and afterwards out of your perswasion of my innocence should make me a free man. Do you think 'twere Lawfull the next time you are displeased to make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine your servant? Tis not in your power. The Lawes decree that such Acts shall be firme, and for ever inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Though, then, I have many reasons to prove that a father having once cast off his sonne, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd his rejection, cannot again cast him off, yet what I have said is sufficient. Next, consider, I pray, what kind of sonne he disinherits. I forbeare to tell you, that he did cast of one unletter'd before, but a Physitian now, (for I seek not refuge from my Art;) or that I was then a youth, but am now a grown man, and have given proof that I have done nothing unbeseeming my age. For these would seem slight pleas. For heretofore when I was cast off, as I had committed no offence, so I had deserved no great favour. Now I am expel'd a preserver and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. And what greater peece of ingratitude can there be, then for one newly saved by my skill, and delivered from a dangerous distemper, to reward his cure with such dealings; and without any reckoning at all to forget his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93795:67"/>
recovery, &amp; to banish him who dutifully obeyed, when he was unjustly cast off; &amp; not only forgot his expulsion, but cured the expeller, &amp; setled him in his right mind again? For 'tis no small or vulgar benefit, O ye Judges, I conferred upon him, yet am thus ill rewarded. And though he were senselesse of his distraction, yet you all know what he did, and suffer'd, and how ill he was affected when I undertook him; and when other Physitians gave him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his own Servants fled from, nor durst come near him, I recovered him as you see, and inabled him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, and discourse of the Laws. Or if you require an Example, My Father, when, not long since, you were just crazed, as your wife is now, I reduced you to your Wits again. 'Tis not equall then, that my Duty should be thus recompenced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that your Recovery should be my Ruine. The greatnesse of my Benefits will clearly appear from those things whereof you accuse me. For if you hate me, because I do not cure your Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e extremely crazed, and at the point of Expiration, why do you not much rather love me for releasing you of the like Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and confesse your self obliged for your delivery from such Distractions? But you, against all equity, no sooner come to your self, but presently question me; and are no sooner recover'd, but you fall to your old punishments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to your former hatred, and proceed by the same law. Is this your fair Requitall of my Skill, or meritorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of my Administrations, to recover only for the undoing of your Physitian? Will you permit him, O ye Judges, to punish his Preserver? to expell the Author of his safety? to hate him, who gave him his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? and to take Revenge of his Recoverer? you will not, if you be Friends to Justice. Had I at this present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted some heinous Offence, yet my former obligations upon him were such, that the memory and apprehension of them ought to have excused me, and have gained his pardon: especially vvhere the benefit is so great, as to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93795:68"/>
put in Ballance with all after Accidents: as mine was to him whom I saved, and who owes his whole life to me; whose gift it is that he is, is sober, and understands; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when all other Physitians despaired of him, and confest themselves too weak for his Cure. And to raise the merit of my benefit yet one story higher, at that time when I was not his Son, and had no necessary tye upon me, but was free, and a stranger, and discharged of my naturall obligation, yet I neglected him not, but came vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, unsent for, and of my own accord; succoured, relieved, cured, restored, observed him as my own Father; purged my self from my Abdication, allayed his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by my application; abrogated the Law by my piety, purchased my readmission into his family by the greatness of my Benefit; declared my Fidelity towards my Father in a time of perill; insinuated my self into him by my Art, and shewed my self a naturall Son in the midst of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. What travailes, and toiles, think you, did I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, who continually visited, attended, watcht my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities; sometimes giving way to my Fathers ragings, sometimes applying my skill according to the pawses, and intermissions of the disease? 'Tis the hardest and most dangerous part in Physick, to cure, or be neer men so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, who many times as they are inraged by their Fit, discharge their Fury upon the standers by. Yet I, not at all daunted, or affrighted, attended him; and after a long and various conflict with his disease, at last I vanquisht it by Physick. Nor let any man who hears me, presently say, What a great piece of work 'tis to administer a Purge? Many things are first to be done: way is to be made for the Potion, the Body to be prepared for the Reception, and to be carefully ordered; sometimes taken down and macerated, sometimes raised by fit diet; sometimes to be put into gentle motion and exercise; sometimes to be cast into a reposednesse, sleep, and left solitary: to which cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in other diseases the Patient in many times obedient.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93795:68"/>
But men distracted by reason of the liberty of their minds, are unruly, and intractable, dangerous to their Physitian, and obstinate against his prescriptions: whereby, many times, when the Cure is almost finisht, and we are almost Master of our Hopes, some small error gives new force to the distemper, perverts all our former proceedings, sets back the Cure, and defeats our Art. After all these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings then, after my wrestling with an enragement so dangerous, and my conquest of the most invincible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of all other, will you yet give him power to disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit me, and permit him to interpret the Lawes, as he pleases, against his Preserver, and suffer him to make war with Nature? I, out of obedience to Nature, O ye Judges, have cured &amp; saved my Father, when his Injuries were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me. If he, therefore, taking the advantage of the Law, as he saies, ruine a Son so deserving, &amp; cut him off from his Family, he is a Child-hater, I a Lover of my Parent: I fulfill &amp; imbrace the laws of Nature, he breaks &amp; violates them. O Father unjustly displeased! O Son more unjustly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant! for I cannot but, compell'd by my Father, blame my self, that being in his hatred, I love him undeservedly, and beyond his merit. Nature commands Parents to love their Children, more then Children to love their Parents: yet this man wilfully shuts his eyes against the Lawes, which forbid the expulsion of faultlesse children; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns Nature, which hath planted in Parents such strong affection to those whom they beget. For notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I have the greater Title to his affection towards me, yet he neither makes the greater return, nor yet (which is lesse) takes example by me, or imitates the expression of mine to him: but rather (which is the height of calamity) hates me for my affection, expells me for my piety, injures me for my Merits, disinherits me by those Lawes which were made for my relief. O war, where the Lawes are made to combate Nature! Things are not as you suppose, my Father, you misinterpret just Laws, which are not to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93795:69"/>
fight with naturall affection. They conspire, and are of mutuall assistance in their protection from Injuries. In wronging one that deserves well, therefore, you commit an offence, both against Nature, and the Lawes, which of themselves are equall, just, and favourable; but that you draw them from their institution, and arme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one Son as against a multitude of Offenders, and presse fresh punishments from them, which are willing to exact no more then the obedience of Children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; nor were at all made against the Innocent. But, certainly, they allow men to sue others, who are not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Benefactors. In stead of thanks, then, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish for benefits received, is worth your consideration, whether there can be a greater piece of Injustice. By this time, then, I hope 'tis clear, that 'tis not in his power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit the second time, who hath once exercised that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and taken the full advantage of the Law; nor is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to cast off one, to whom he is so much engaged for courtesies; or to deprive him of his family. Let me now proceed to the cause of my expulsion, and examine the quality of my Offence: where 'twill be fit I once more have recourse to the Intention &amp; mind of the Law-maker. Here, should I a while grant it to be in your power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherit as often as you please; nay should I grant you this authority over me, from whom you have received great Benefits: you cannot simply, and for every light cause pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Expulsion. For the Law-maker doth not say upon whatsoever complaint of the Father let the Son be expelled; as if his bare will, or accusation were enough. For then what need were there of your Tribunall? but it bids you, O ye Judges, enquire whether the Fathers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure have any weighty, or just ground, or no. And this for the present I desire you to consider. I will begin from what hapned upon his recovery. He no sooner, then, came to himself, but his first act was to cancell his Abdication; acknowledging me for his Preserver, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93795:69"/>
and what not? There was no Offence, I suppose, in all this. Afterwards, what can he complaine of? what respect, or observance of a Son did I omit? when did I ever lye abroad? what unseasonable meetings, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings can you object? who ever complain'd of my Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, or quarrell with a Pimp? No body. Now these are the chief disorders for which the Law permits Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But my Step-Mother fell sick. Was that my fault? or am I to be punisht for her Phrenzy? No, say you. Why then? Because being commanded to cure her, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused; and therefore deserve to be cast off for your disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to your Father. Give me leave a while, Judges, to open to you those things wherein I could not obey him, and for which I am undutifull. First, then, let me in short tell you, that the Law allowes him not to enjoyne what he list, nor am I bound in necessity to obey all his Impositions whatsoever. For some Commands may be refused, though others are allowed their punishments. As if my Father should be sick, and I should forsake him; or should commit the businesse of his house to me, and I should neglect it; or enjoyn me to look to his country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and I should refuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These, and the like, were just colours and pretences for the complaints of a Father. Other things, concerning their Arts, or the exercise of them, are left to the liberty of the Children, especially where the Parent is not endammaged. If a Father should say to his Son, who is a Painter, Limne this piece, and not that; or being a Musitian, should bid him play one Lesson, and not another; or should say to him being a Carver, Worke me this Statue, and not that; would any man think it fit he should dis-inherit his Son for denying to submit his Art to his Directions? I believe not. By how much then Physick is more honourable, and usefull for the life of men, by so much ought the Professors to be the more free. Since 'tis but Justice, that an Art for its Exercise and use, should be priviledged, and not inforced, or commanded, being
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93795:70"/>
a thing sacred, profest by the Gods, and studied by wise men; and therefore not to be prostituted to the Law, and made lyable to the fear and punishment of the Magistrate, much lesse to the pleasure, threats, or anger of an illiterate Parent. If then I had boldly, and openly said to you, I will not cure her, though I can; I have learnt my skill on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for my self, and you my Father, to all others I will be unexpert: what Tyrant is so cruell as to force me against my will to use my Art? Offices of skill, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, are to be obteined by Courtship, and intreaties, not by Lawes, Quarrellings, and Courts of Justice. A Physitian is to be perswaded, not compell'd; to come vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, not to be drawn by terror; nor to be forced to a Cure, but willingly to undertake it. An Art, then, is free from the Authority of a Father, or the payment of Tribute; Common wealths having decreed Honours, Precedencies, Immunity from Taxes, and priviledges to Physitians. Thus might I say in defence of my Art, though you had taught me, or had spent much care, and cost in my study of it; and though this cure were possible, and yet I should refuse it. Consider, then, the Injustice of your dealing, who deny me the liberty, and use of that, which is purely my own. I learnt this Art when I was not your Son, nor subject to your lawes; yet I learnt it for your cure. You were the first, who reap'd benefit by it, though you contributed nothing to the Acquisition. What Tutor had you in pay? what laid you out in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts? nothing at all: but poor, and distressed as I was, only by the pitty of my Teachers, I attained my skill. All the allowance I had from you towards my studies, was Sorrow, Solitude, Poverty, Hatred of my Acquaintance, and avoidance of my Kindred. For these good deeds you would have me imploy my skill, and would be Master of that Knowledge which I got when you were not my Master. Let it suffice, that heretofore I have voluntarily and no way obliged, bestead you; when I could not, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93795:70"/>
I had done, demand so much as Thanks for my pains. 'Tis not fit my Benefit should ever after prove my neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: or because I once befriended you with my Will, you should from thence take occasion to enjoyn me tasks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; or that it should be drawn into a custome, that when a Physitian hath wrought one Cure, he should for ever be bound to cure as many as the party cured should enjoyn. For then we should make our Patients our Lords, and enslave our selves, and our reward should be to serve and obey them in all their Commands. Then which, what can be more unequall? Because I recovered you from a dangerous distraction, do you therefore think you have authority of my Skill? Thus might I plead for my selfe, had my Father commanded me something possible, and I had not precisely, and necessarily obey'd him. But now, I pray, consider the nature of his Imposition. Because sayes he you cured me of my Lunacy, and my Wife is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the same Distemper, (for so he thinks,) and is given over by other Physitians, as I was; and because you have given a clear Tryall, that you can heal all Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, cure her also, and ease her of her distraction: which being barely so spoken, especially before a man unlearned, or unskilld in the profession, would sound very reasonable. But if you will give me leave to speak for my Art, I shall desire you to consider that we are not om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, nor are the natures of all Diseases alike, nor their cure the same; nor have our Prescriptions in all the like powerfull successe. And then the difference will appear between an unwillingnesse to cure, and a disability. Wherefore lend me a while your attentions, whilst I play the Philospher, and present you with a discourse of things, neither unpleasant, fruitlesse, or impertinent to my profession. First then, the Natures and tempers of all Bodies are not the same, though plainly arising from the same elements. But some partake more one element, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome lesse: which I speak with application to the Bodies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93795:71"/>
of men, which are not alike, or the same in all, either in Temper, or Constitution; but differ both in magnitude, and forme. Whence it necessarily falls out, that the diseases bred in them sometimes are slight, and meet their Cures, sometimes are desperate, especially in those bodies which easily take in Infection, and are afterwards as strongly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd by it. He, therefore, who thinks all Feavers, or Consumptions, or Ptifficks, or Distractions to be alike in all bodies, is neither of those who are wise, nor discursive, nor experienced in these matters. That which is easily cureable in one, is not so in another. For example, the same Corn sown in severall grounds; in a champion, deep, moist, sunny, windlesse, and well manured field, springs up in a full eare, and yeilds a glad and abundant harvest. But 'tis otherwise in a mountanous, rocky, sunless, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lly country, according to the diversity of Soyles. So diseases, according to the soyles where they are received, prove ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruitfull, and grow; or wither, and pine. Yet my Father passing all this over without consideration, thinks all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions in all bodies alike, and their cure the same. But for an addition to all, I have yet said, that a womans body differs much from a mans, both for diversity of distemper, and hope or dispaire of Cure is not hard to be known. For the bodies of men are well knit, and sinewy, accustomed to labours, motion, and exercises abroad: but the bodies of women are washy, loose, bred in the shade, pale for want of bloud, scarcity of heat, and superfluity of cold hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; and are therefore more lyable to diseases then men, more impatient of Physick, and more disposed to phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies. For having in them much cholerick, light, provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter, and small strength of body, they eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly slide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to distempers. 'Twere unreasonable, therefore, to require of a Physitian the same Medicine for both, seeing how much they differ from their very births, both in their whole manner of life, all their actions, exercises, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. When you speak of madnesse, thefore, adde withall,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93795:71"/>
that 'tis a womans madnesse. And confound not severall distractions under one and the same name; But distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them, as nature hath: and then consider how farre they severally admit cures. We Physitians, as I said before, have first regard to the complexion, and temper of the patient, and do examine what humour he most partakes of; whither he be cold or hot; young, and vigorous, or decayed and acient; of great, or little stature; grosse or slender; and the like: which he that shall exactly consider, is worthy to be credited, either when he despaires of a cure, or undertakes it. For there are numberlesse kinds of phrenzies, springing from numberlesse causes, of diverse compellations. To dote, and to be beside ones selfe, is not the same; And 'tis one thing to rave, 'tis another thing to be crazed. Though all these names be but higher or lower degrees of the same distemper. Besides, men have one cause of their distraction, women another. Again, among men, the cause in young men is different from that in old: their ragings spring most commonly from su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fers; the others from their importunate spleen, and frowardnesse, which they many times discharge upon their family; and which first makes them disquiet, then by degrees converts into distraction. But infinite are the distempers in women, which makes them so easily runne madde; Though the chiefe be their extreame hatred, or envy at the successe of their enemy; sometimes griefe, and for the time anger: Any of which, after a long growth, and nourishment, end in madnesse. This, my father, is your wives case; who in likelihood hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted her phrenzye, from a long sadnesse. For she showes no signes of envy, no not in her fits. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is not to be cured by the skill of any Physitian. If any will undertake, and recover her, my disobedience will deserve your hatred. Though thus much I must tell you, that though her distraction were not quite so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but that there were some hope of recovery, yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93795:72"/>
would I not willingly meddle with her, nor venture to give her Physick; for fear of my successe, and the ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of people. You see 'tis the generall opinion, that all children are odious to their stepmothers, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so good natured; who are thought peculiarly to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the distemper common to all women kind: which might breed a suspicion in some, if the disease should prove incurable, and my prescriptions faile, that I jugled, and dealt treacherously in my Administrations. But with your wife, my father, thus stands the case, and I speak from my experience, she will not be better, should she take a thousand purges. 'Twere, therefore, folly to undertake her: unlesse you be earnest with me to loose my labour, and have a mind to pull disgrace upon me. Let me still be the envy of those of my profession. And if you will again expell me, though I be forsaken of all, yet shall there be duty in my wishes. But suppose, (which the Gods forbid) your distraction should return, (for distempers of that nature upon the least provocation grow again,) what am I to do then? You know well I would cure you then also; nor will I ever neglect the obligation imposed upon me by nature, nor forget my Originall, and descent. But whither after you are again recover'd, I may believe your reconciliation, Judge you. In the meane time doing as you do, you invite your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, and refresh your madnesse. You were but yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or the day before recover'd from your distemper, and you now rage againe, raise clamour, and, which is worst, fall into choller, give way to your Hatred, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the Lawes. O, my Father, these were the entrances to your former madnesse.</p>

            <p>PErhaps, my dear <hi>Celsus,</hi> you think you have set me a light, and easy task, when you enjoyn me to send you <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Abonwall,</hi> the impostor's life, Trickes, Adventures, and cousenages, written in a book. But he, who shall exactly describe them all, shall find it an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize as hard as to write the deeds of <hi>Alexander</hi> the sonne of <hi>Philippe</hi>: the one being as eminent for his villanie, as the other for his valour. Yet upon condition you will read me with pardon, and supply the defects of my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with your own Additions, I will undertake the work: and will endeavour to purge, if not all, yet as much of <hi>Augea's Oxstall,</hi> as I can, by carrying forth some few Baskets full of filth; that from thence you may guesse how great and unmeasurable the Dung was, which three thousand Oxen were able to make in so many years. Though I cannot, in the mean time, but blush both for you and my selfe. For you, who think fit a person so wicked should be committed to memory, and writing: For my selfe, for imploying my labour in the History and Actions of a fellow not worthy to be read by Schollars, but to be seen in some populous and ample Theatre dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by Apes, and Foxes. Yet if any shall accuse us, we can defend our selves by example. For <hi>Arrianus, Epictetus</hi> Schollar, a man much reverenced at <hi>Rome,</hi> who spent his whole life in study, shall in like case be our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology. For he refused not to write the life of <hi>Tilliborus</hi> the Thiefe. But I am to speake of a Thiefe much more famous, and cruell: who robbed not in woods, or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, but in Cities; nor made <hi>Mynia</hi> only, or <hi>Ida</hi> his walk, or beset some few wild places of <hi>Asia,</hi> but (as I may so say) overspread the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire with his Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries. First, then, I will give you a draught of his person, and dravv his picture to you as vvell as I can; though I be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93795:73"/>
no very skilfull Painter. For his Bodily character, he vvas tall of stature, vvell set, of a goodly aspect, and, to say truth, of a Divine presence: vvhite of Complexion, his Beard not thick: his Hair partly native, partly artificiall, but so resembling the naturall, that many took it for his ovvn. His eyes sparkling, and expressing a Divine pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, or rapture: his voice svveet, and clear. In a vvord, for his Lineaments, Shape, and Figure, he vvas every vvay faultlesse: but for his Soule and Mind, Let me, O <hi>Hercules,</hi> thou expeller of mischiefs, and thou, O <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> preventer of sad Accidents, and <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> ye Tvvin-Protectors fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Shipvvrack, rather fall into the hands of Enemies, then have to do vvith him.

All vvich he imployed to the vvorst; &amp; furnish'd vvith those naturall helps, quickly became the Top of all the famous Rogues that ever vvere, &amp; excell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But let any man summe, and compute the vvorst, and most reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things vvhich passe in slander of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (to vvhich I cannot give any credit as Truths) they vvill not make the least part of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Impostures. For you are to present him to your Imagination as one; the temper of vvhose Soule vvas various, compounded of Lyes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, Perjuries, and Juglings; active, daring, flexible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious to pursue projects, persvvasive, apt to gaine be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liefe, and to act vertue, and to professe that vvhich he had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93795:73"/>
least in designe. No man, therefore, but at first acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance departed with this opinion of him, that he was of all men the most excellent, just, severe, and farthest from Tricks. Then his aimes were alwaies high, not petty, or poor, and his mind alwaies bent to great enterprizes. When he was yet a Boy, being, as I have heard, and as far as I can judge of the Springe by the Stubble, of very beautifull lineaments, he prostituted, and let himself out to as many as would hire him. Among others, he was entertained by one of those Impostors, who professe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and Inchantments, the Art to provoke Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch Enemies, find Treasures, and obtein Inheritances, who, perceiving him Toward, and apt to act a part in his Imployments, and as much enamoured of his devices, as he was of his Feature, taught him his Art; and from that time used him as his Officer, Prentice, and Servant. His profession in publick was Physick, having learnt of <hi>Thoon</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi>'s Wife, many Receipts to cure, many to kill, all which he afterwards bequeathed to the other as his Heir. This enamoured Doctor was by birth a <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> and one of those who accompanied, and converst with <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> through all the passages of his Tragedy. You see, then, what man I describe to you, for his School, and Company. After his Masters death, <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose Beard was now grown, being reduced to great poverty, and unable by his handsome shape, which now began to wither, to maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, betook himself to no small designes: but joyning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with a certaine <hi>Byzantine</hi> Chronographer, (naturally the greatest Impostor that ever yet entred upon the course) whose name, if I be not deceived, was <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conas,</hi> went about with him, practising Cheats, and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Grosse men; for so do these Juglers in their Canting language call the Vulgar. Among the rest, lighting upon one <hi>Macetis</hi> a rich woman, well stricken in years, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be thought lovely, they pickt a maintenance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93795:74"/>
from her, and attended her from <hi>Bithynia</hi> into <hi>Macedonia.</hi> For she dwelt at <hi>Pella,</hi> a flourishing Country under the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, now inhabited only by a few obscure Villagers. Here beholding Dragons of a wonderfull greatnesse, and yet so gentle, and tame, that they were fed by women, lay with Children, sufferd themselves to be trod, and crush'd without reluctancy, and like Infants suck'd milk from the Brest, (for many such there are in that country, from whence in likelyhood sprung the fable, that when <hi>Olympias</hi> conceived <hi>Alexander,</hi> she had copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Dragon) they for a small summe bought one of the fairest; And, in the expression of <hi>Thucidides, From hence began the war.</hi> For these two most wicked, adventrous men, and prepared for any mischievous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, entring into Conspiracy, easily perceived that the two great Tyrants over the life of man were Hope, and Fear. And that he that could imploy them to advantage, might suddenly grow rich. For they savv, that both to him vvho vvas troubled vvith Fear, and him vvho nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht Hopes, Prophecie, and Presage, vvas most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and desireable. Thus <hi>Delphos</hi> anciently increased its riches vvith its fame. Thus <hi>Delos</hi> also, and <hi>Claros,</hi> and the Priests of <hi>Apollo</hi> grevv vvealthy; men being dravvn to their Temples by the forementioned Tyrants, Hope, and Fear, vvith desires to foreknovv future events; for vvhich they sacrificed Hecatombes, and offered golden plates. Having vvell discours'd, and tost the Plot, they resolved to erect an Oracle; confident, that if their designe pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, they should in short time enrich, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy: vvhose successe vvas aftervvards far greater then they at first expected, and indeed beyond their hope. Their next consultation, therefore, vvas, vvhere they should lay their Scene, and hovv they should begin their enterprise. <hi>Cocconas</hi> thought <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to be the fittest place; being a country of Merchants, and bordering upon <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and not far from <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:93795:74"/>
and other neighbouring people. But <hi>Alexander</hi> rather preferr'd his own country: affirming (as the truth was) that the first broaching of such an Adventure required dull, simple men, and easie of entertainment: such as are the <hi>Paphlagonians,</hi> who dwell at <hi>Abonwall,</hi> who for the most part are superstitious, and grosse, that if but a Sive-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet appear among them, with a Fidler, Trumpetter, or one that plaies on a Cymball in his company, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flock together, and gape at him, and admire him, like some Divine person dropt from Heaven.
<q>After some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, at last <hi>Alexander</hi> overcame: yet to <hi>Chalcedon</hi> they went (a City, as they thought, conducible to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe) where, in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s old Temple they buried some brazen Meddals, which prophesied, that <q>ere long <hi>Aescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> and his Father <hi>Apollo</hi> should come into <hi>Pontus,</hi> 
                  </q>and dwell at <hi>Abonwall.</hi>
               </q>
These Meddals thus purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, presently cast a rumor throughout all <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> but especially among the people of <hi>Abonwall</hi>; who presently decreed to build a Temple, and began to lay the foundation. <hi>Cocconas</hi> was left at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where he wrote ambiguous, doubtfull, crosse Oracles: and shortly after dyed of the sting of a Serpent. Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> was sent for, who came in curl'd haire, clad in a changeable Cassock of Purple, and white; over which was cast a white Ephod, holding a Sickle, like <hi>Perseus,</hi> from whom he derived himselfe by the Mothers side. The stupid <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> in the meane time, though they knew both his Parents to be of obscure and base quality, yet gave credit to an Oracle which said,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Phoebus</hi> friend, <hi>Podalirius</hi> bloud you see,</l>
                  <l>One who from <hi>Perseus</hi> draws his Pedigree.</l>
               </q>
This <hi>Podalirius</hi> was naturally so lecherous, and given to women, that he was enticed by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s mother from <hi>Tricca</hi> into <hi>Paphlagonia.</hi> There was another Oracle, as if written by some <hi>Sybill,</hi> foretelling,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93795:75"/>
               <q>
                  <l>That neere <hi>Sinope,</hi> on the <hi>Euxine</hi> sand,</l>

                  <l>One, thrice ten, five, and twenty three times told.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A while after <hi>Alexander,</hi> with his puppet-play, in great bravery, and pomp, arrived in his owne Country; where he sometimes counterfeited him selfe possest, and foamed at mouth; which was easie for him to doe, having first chewed sope weed roote, with which wooll is scoured. His foaming shew'd to the spectators both divine, and terrible. Before his arrivall he made a linnen head to his Dragon, visaged like a Man, and painted like one, which open'd, and shut the mouth, with horse haire: having also, like other Dragons, a blacke forked tongue, which was also stir'd, and moved by haire. This Dragon he had in readinesse, and fed secretly, with a purpose, when he saw occasion, to produce him; and to assigne him his part in the play; or rather to make him the chiefe Actor. When 'twas almost time to begin, he contrived this plot: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by night to the foundation of the Temple newly digged, where stood water, either risen from some spring, or fallen in some shower, and bringing with him a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low goose egge, which held a little serpent, newly hatcht, he sanke and buried it in the mudde, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Next morning running naked into the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, with only a golden towell about his soynes, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also his sickle in his hand, and shaking his loose bayre, like one possest by the mother of the Gods, he got upon an Altar, and proclaimed the happinesse of the Citty, which was presently to discover the foretold Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The spectators, which were all the men, women, and children of the Citty drawne together, were amazed, fell to their prayers, and adored him, whilest he uttering some unsignificant words, in Hebrew perhaps, or the Phoenician Language, much more astonisht them who
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93795:75"/>
understood nothing he said, but onely that he often named <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> From hence he distractedly ran to the newly begun Temple, and to the pitt, and spring, digged there to lay the foundation; and descending into the water, in a lowd voyce, sung the praises of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and invited the God to enter with good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune into the Citty. Demanding also a shovell, which was reacht him, he no sooner dipt it in the water, but brought up wrapt in water, and mud together, the egge, which inclosed the God; indiscernably stopt, and cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with white waxe, and chalke, which taking in his hand,, now, quoth he; I will show you <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> They stupidly wondred, what would be the event, and much admired the egge found in the water. Till he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it in the hollow of his hand, tooke out the young snake. Which when they saw stirre, and ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He speedily ran home againe, carrying w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hatcht, I say, not by some <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or Daw (which was his mothers name) but by some Goose. All the people followed, divinely inspired, and distracted with their hopes. He for some dayes kept at home, hoping as indeed it came to passe) the same would draw great confluence of <hi>Paphlagonians.</hi> When the Citty began to be filled with people, voyd both of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and braines, and no way resembling men who lived by bread, nor differing at all from beasts, but onely in shape; he, sitting in a little roome, upon a Couch, attired like a Priest, held his <hi>Pellaean Aesculapius</hi> in his bosome; which was, as I said before, of a faire, and goodly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. For winding him sometimes about his necke (which he patiently suffer'd) and letting onely his tayle
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93795:76"/>
hang downe, and hiding his head under his arme, he trayled upon the ground: sometimes from under another part of his Cassock, he would let the linnen head peep out, which was verily thought to be the Serpent's. For you are to fancie the house where he made his presentments, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stately, nor over lightsome: then the presse of people, which thronged to see him, squeezing and crowding one another, and anticipating the show with their asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. For comming with rais'd expectations, it must needs seem a miracle to them, to see a little, small serpent, in a few dayes become a great Dragon; faced like a man, and withall so gentle. No spectators stay'd long, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had an exact view, were thrust out by new commers, who continually resorted. Just against the doore, where they entred, stood open another doore, to let them out. In imitation of the course practiced by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> when <hi>Alexander</hi> lay sick, and ready to dye, and great troops prest into the Pallace to see him, and take their last farewell. 'Tis reported of this Cheater, that he many times made these presentments, especially to strangers which were rich. And to say truth, my deare <hi>Celsus,</hi> you are to pardon those dull unletter'd <hi>Paphlagoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> if they were cousen'd when they touch't the Dragon, (which <hi>Alexander</hi> permitted to as many as would) and saw a head by a false doubtfull light, so artificially open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and shutting the mouth, that <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>twould require a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> or <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> or some other of a hard, flinty faith towards such things, not to believe, or to make a true conjecture of what he saw. And if he could not find out the mystery, yet to come with a perswasion that the wayes, and secrets of the Imposture, were above his discovery, though all he saw were a Delusion, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be done. In short time, <hi>Bithynia, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> were drawne to the spectacle, upon the report of those who confidently affirmed, they saw the God newly hatch't, and touch't him after he was in few
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93795:76"/>
dayes growne very great, and that he had the face of a man: Pictures also, and Images, and Statues were taken of him, some carved in Silver, others in Brasse. At last they gave him a name, and call'd him <hi>Glycon,</hi> warn'd in a verse by a divine Oracle, thus utter'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>I <hi>Glycon</hi> am from <hi>Jove</hi> Third, Mortalls light.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It now began to be time (which was the great hinge of the Plott) that he was to give Oraculous answers, and to Prophecy. <hi>Alexander,</hi> therefore, taking his pattern from <hi>Antilochus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who after the death of his father <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> at <hi>Thebes,</hi> being banish't his Countrey, went into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he lost not by his change, but prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed to the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> and tooke monyes for his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Taking I say, his coppy from him, he told all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers that his God would shortly give Oracles, and assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day, bidding every one write, what they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to learne, or know in a little booke, and to winde it about with thred, and seale it with wax, clay, or the like: And that he taking the bookes, and presenting them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Tripod,</hi> (for by this time an Oracle was built, and a Curtaine hung up) would call them in order by a Cryer, or Priest, and as he was instructed by his Deity, would restore to every man his scrowle, sealed, as it was, with an exact answer subscribed by his God, to every pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion. Which Device, to such a man as you, or (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ostentation) as I am, were palpable, and easy to be found out, but appeared to blunt men, and as they say, to such as blew not their noses, a very prodigie, and wonder. For having invented severall wayes to open the Seales, he read the contents, and framing agreeable answers, bound up the papers againe, and returned them sealed, to the great admiration of the receivers: who thus reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with themselves. How could he know what I gave him, lockt under seales so impossible to be counterfeited, if he were not a God, who knowes all things? You will aske mee now what art he used. 'Tis worth your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93795:77"/>
that you may be instructed against such juglings. His first way, my deare <hi>Celsus,</hi> was to heat a needle, with which melting the waxe under it he tooke off the seale; and having read the inside, with the same needle melted the waxe which was upon the outside of the thred, and clapt on the seale againe entire. His next way was by Collyrium, a thing Compounded of Berytian pitch, lime, specular stone pounded, waxe, and masticke; which he warming at the fire, and applying to the seale, first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with tallow, brought away the impression; and as soone as it was cold and hard, having nearly open'd the paper, and read it, applying his stamp to fresh waxe, gave it a print, as it were, with a stone seale, exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the Originall. His third device was, to mingle chalke, with the ordinary glue, with which letters are sealed; which he wrought into a waxe, and applying it soft to the print, presently tooke it off; which aftervvards grovving as hard as horne or Iron, he used for a seale. Many other contrivances he had, vvhich I cannot stand to report, lest I seeme tedious; especially since you in your Commentaries concerning Magicians, vvhich are excellent usefull, and able to make their Readers vvife, have delivered many more passages of this nature. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, then, he gave and Divinations; vvhich vvith great Art, and Subtlety he still drest in probable colours. Giving to some Questions Oblique, and intricate ansvvers. To others, ansvvers darke and unintelligible. A course, as he thought, most suitable to an Oracle: some he fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and encouraged others, as he found it made for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. To some he prescribed Medecines, and dyets, being (as I said before) variously skill'd in receipts. Among vvhich he chiefly extold <hi>Cytmides,</hi> vvhich is the fayn'd name of a playster made of Beares grease. The ansvver to hopes, successes, and successions in Inheritances, he still put off to another time; Adding though, that they should accomplish their expectations, vvhen he thought
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93795:77"/>
fit, and when his Priest <hi>Alexander</hi> should pray or petition for them. The rate set upon every Oracle was a Drachme &amp; two pence: which you are not, my friend, to call a small gaine, rising yearly to 70. or 80. thousand Drachmes. Some men out of their greedinesse, and thirst of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, paying for ten, some for fifteen Answers. What he received he kept not wholly to himselfe, or treasured up, but maintained many associates, and servants, some were emissaries, some projected Oracles; some subscribed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; some made and applyed the Seales; some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; all were more or lesse sharers according to their place, or imployment. His Emissaries he sent into farre Countries, who did spread the fame of the Oracle among the Nations; and reported that he foretold future events, recall'd fugitive servants, discover'd Theeves, and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, revealed where treasures were to be digg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon followed great resort, and confluence from all parts; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were offer'd, and double presents made to the Priest, and Disciple of the God. For now an Oracle to this purpose was divulged:
<q>
                  <l>Honour my Priest and Servant, I you charge;</l>
                  <l>Gayne I despise, yet let his gaynes be large.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At length, when many recovering their wits from a deep intoxication, conspired against him, especially those who were of <hi>Epicurus</hi> sect, and the whole cheat and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant by little and little began to be open'd, he threatned them with terrible misfortunes; and sayd, that <hi>Pontus</hi> was now overspread with Atheists, and Christians, vvho vvere not afraid to speake blasphemies of him, charging those, vvho came to consult him, as they expected the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the God, to drive them avvay vvith stones. Upon <hi>Epicurus</hi> himselfe he past this Oracle, vvhen one enquired vvhat he did in Hell; <hi>He sits in mire</hi> (said he) <hi>in leaden

His quarrell to <hi>Epicurus</hi> vvas ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable, and not vvithout cause. For vvith vvhom in reason should a Jugler, Friend to Monsters, and enemy to truth, make vvarre, but vvith <hi>Epicurus,</hi> a man perfectly studied in the nature of things, and alone able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish vvhat vvas truth in them?

But endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a time to give an Oracle to the Proconsul's brother, he vvas ridiculously disappointed, neither able to invent a fit one himselfe, nor any for the present to compose one for him. For intending to bid him, for the cure of a paine in his stomacke, eat a hogges foot drest vvith Mallovves, he thus utter'd the prescription;</p>

And that he might the more astonish the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he promised they shoud heare his God speake, and give Oraales vvithout an Interpreter. For that purpose vvithout much difficulty, he so order'd the vvind-pipe of a Crane, that being dravvne through the Artificiall head, another stood behind the curtaine, and speaking through the Artery, gave ansvvers to the Questions; conveying the voyce through the linnen <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> These vvere call'd <hi>Selfe-Oracles,</hi> and vvere not spoken to all promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93795:78"/>
but onely to those who were rich, bravely clad, and offer'd well. The answer which <hi>Severianus</hi> received concerning his expedition into <hi>Armenia</hi> was a selfe-Oracle, who was encouraged to make an Invasion after this manner,
<q>
                  <l>Thou <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> with quick war shalt waste,</l>
                  <l>Then back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Tybers</hi> streams shalt haste,</l>
                  <l>Wearing a Chaplet, which bright beames shalt cast.</l>
               </q>
Vpon which perswasion, after the studpid <hi>Gaule</hi> had made an incursion, and was with his army slaine by <hi>Othryades,</hi> that Oracle was dasht out of the Catalogue, and this other insetted;
<q>
                  <l>Make no warre with <hi>Armenians,</hi> 'Tis best,</l>
                  <l>Lest a man, in a womans garments drest,</l>
                  <l>Thee with his bow, of life and light devest.</l>
               </q>
His plot herein was by after Oracles craftily to heale the former which miscarryed. For many times a little before their death he promised recovery to sick persons; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose deaths he had this recanting Oracle in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<q>
                  <l>Henceforth aske no cure for thy helplesse paine,</l>
                  <l>Death is at hand, to thinke to scape is vaine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Learning by intelligence that some at <hi>Claros, Didymae,</hi> and <hi>Male,</hi> were famous for such divinations, he made friendship with them, and sent many thither, saying;
<q>
                  <l>To <hi>Claros</hi> goe, and heare my Fathers voyce.</l>
               </q>

            </p>
            <p>Thus much of the Scene lay within his owne Coasts, though in it <hi>Ionia, Cilicia, Paphlagonia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> had parts. But when the fame of the Oracle once pierced <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93795:79"/>
and arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> every one strived to be first. Some presently went in person, others sent; especially Senators, and such as bore great offices in the State. The first of note, and reputation, was <hi>Rutilianus,</hi> a man otherwise honest, and prudent, and approved in many <hi>Romane</hi> battles for his valour: but indiscreetly superstitious towards the Gods; of whom he had taken in such improbable perswasions, that wheresoever he saw a stone anointed, or crowned, he fell downe, and worshipt, and made long prayers to it, and petitioned for good fortune. He, therefore, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was reported of this Oracle, almost resolved to leave his Army, and make a voyage to <hi>Abonwall.</hi> But however sent thither messengers after messengers. They who were sent, being servants of small capacity, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived, at their returne reported what they had seene; and some things which they feyned to have seene, and heard; much enlarging their relation, the more to endear themselves to their Master. Much was the unfortunate old man enflamed, and cast into a violent phrenzy, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to all his friends (of which he had store, and powerfull) told what he heard from his messengers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some additions of his owne. The report presently fill'd, and astonish't the Citty; especially many of the Court, who presently sent to be instructed in their affaires <hi>Alexander</hi> received the messengers very affably; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them with presents, and gifts of great value: who not onely reported their answers, but sung the prayses of the God; telling prodigious lyes, both of him and his Oracles. One plot he had in ordinary practise, too inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and subtle for a vulgar Cheater: which was to open the Tickets which were sent, and if, in the reading, he found any thing unsafe, or dangerous, he kept, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver restored them, with a purpose to keep the Inquirers obnoxious, and to awe them with their owne feares, when they reflected upon their enquiries. Foreseeing that men of great riches, and quality, would aske the most
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93795:79"/>
dangerous questions. From these, therefore, he exacted great rewards, knowing themselves caught in his net. I will repeat to you some of the Oracles he gave to <hi>Ruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> who consulting the Oracle what Tutor he should choose for the education of his sonne by his first wife, who was now growne ripe for the Arts, was thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and he who Battles sings.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A few dayes after the child dyed; and he was much troubled to defend himselfe to those who accused him of an Oracle so apparently confuted. But <hi>Rutilianus</hi> being a religious man, prevented him, and excused the Oracle; Interpreting the meaning of the God to be, that no living Tutor should be chosen, but <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> long since dead, with whom his sonne in hell probably held conversation: and who now can blame <hi>Alexander</hi> for cheating such men? Inquiring another time whose soule he possest; 'Twas replyed:
<q>
                  <l>First thou <hi>Achilles,</hi> then <hi>Menander</hi> wast,</l>
                  <l>Next thy selfe; shalt a Sun-beame be at last;</l>
                  <l>An hundred fourescore summers once being past.</l>
               </q>
But he died of Melancholy at threescore and ten, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed not for the promise of the God; though this were a selfe Oracle. Another time enquiring about his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, he received this answer:
<q>
                  <l>VVed <hi>Alexanders</hi> daughter borne o'th' Moone.</l>
               </q>
For there went a stale report, that the daughter he had was begotten of the Moone, who grew enamoured of him, as he lay asleepe. A thing usuall with her to love beautifull men in their slumbers. <hi>Rutilianus,</hi> like a wise man, presently sent to the wench, and proceeded to a wedding, though he was a Sexagenary Bridegroome,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93795:80"/>
bedded her, and sacrificed whole Hecatombes to the Moone his Mother-in-Law. Reckoning himselfe now among the Gods. <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the mean time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intelligence how the report tooke in <hi>Italy,</hi> applyed his mind to greater matters: and dispersed Emissaries through all the Romane Empire; who scatterd Oracles; forewarning Citties to take heed of Plagues, Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Earth-quakes: For the eversion whereof he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised infallible remedies. In the time of Pestilence, the Oracle he sent to all Nations, which was a selfe-one, was comprehended in this one verse;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Phoebus</hi> th' unshorne infectious clouds expells.</l>
               </q>
Which was every where written upon doores, as a charme against the Plague. But the successe was contrary. For it happened that those houses which had the Inscription were most depopulated: which I bring not into obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as if the verse encreased the Infection, but so it fell out by chance; and many, it may be, relying on the Charme, were carelesse and negligent of their dyet, using no remedies against the Plague, but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Oracle; but thought the Syllables would protect them, and unshorne <hi>Apollo</hi> with his dart would dispell the Contagion. At Rome he had many Spyes, who were of the conspiracy, who certified him of every mans purposes, what doubts, and enquiries they would propose, and what resolutions they desired: which, before they came, gave him time to provide Answers. And these were his plots upon the <hi>Italians.</hi> Lastly, he instituted certaine ceremonies and rites, especially the carriage of Tapers in solemne proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for three dayes successively. The first day, in Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> was made this proclamation; If any Atheist, or Christian or <hi>Epicurean,</hi> become as a Spye to these solemnities, let him depart: But let such as reverence the Gods be initiated in our mysteries: whereupon divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93795:80"/>
was presently made; And <hi>Alexander</hi> in front cryed out, away with the Christians, and the whole multitude in a lowd Acclamation ecchoing him, cryed, Away with the <hi>Epicureans.</hi> Then was Acted <hi>Latona</hi>'s Delivery, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>'s Birth; then his mariage with <hi>Coronis,</hi> and the birth of <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> The second day was Acted <hi>Glycons</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany, and Birth. The third day <hi>Podalirius</hi> mariage with <hi>Alexander's</hi> mother; whose name was <hi>Dadis</hi>; and the Tapers were then lighted; the whole Solemnity ended with the Moone's and <hi>Alexander's</hi> love, and the nativity of <hi>Rutilianus</hi> Bride. In which <hi>Alexander's</hi> part was to hold a Torch, and, like another <hi>Endymion,</hi> to personate himselfe asleep; Then from the roofe, as from her orbe, descended to him one <hi>Rutilia,</hi> representing the Moone; A beautifull woman, and wife to a great Officer about <hi>Caesar,</hi> who courted <hi>Alexander,</hi> and was courted by him againe; openly, and before her besotted husband's eyes exchanging kisses, and embraces; and had the Tapers been away had perchance acted out the whole part. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, putting on his properties of a Priest, in deepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence he enter'd, and then sang in a loud voyce, <hi>lô Glycon.</hi> To which many <hi>Paphlagonians,</hi> well throated, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, in high shooes, and stunk of Garlicke, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>lô Alexander.</hi> Many times, as he danced in Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Cassock of purple flew open, and revealed a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thigh; covered, I believe, with some gilt skinne, which glitter'd against the Torches: which raised a great dispute between two foolishly wise, whether he were informed by <hi>Pythagoras</hi> soule, since he had a golden thigh, or by a soule like his. The doubt was brought to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and was thus decided by Prince <hi>Glycon;</hi>

Which hee keeping in a kind of Seraglio, like so many bought Captives, variously abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and prostituted to his lust. He made a Law, also, that none above the age of eighteene, should touch his mouth, or salute him with a kisse. To such, therefore, he onely vouchsafed his hand, reserving his lips only for those who were handsome: who from thence were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the admitted within the kisse. In this manner he cousen'd simple people, corrupted their wives, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted their children: who accounted it a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and much to be wisht, if he would cast a glance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wives. But if he would vouchsafe them a kisse, they thought deluges of good fortune would flow into their houses. Some there were who bragg'd they had conceived by him, which was confirm'd by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their husbands. I will report to you a Dialogue which past between <hi>Glycon,</hi> and a <hi>Tyanean</hi> Priest, whose wisdome you may perceive by his Questions. I read it in golden letters in the Priests house at <hi>Tion.</hi> Tell me, sayd he, Prince <hi>Glycon,</hi> who art thou? I am, answered he, the lesser <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> Distinguisht from the former? Speake 'Tis not lawfull for thee to know. How many yeares wilt thou stay among us, and give Oracles? A thousand and three. Whither wilt thou goe then? To <hi>Bactra,</hi> and the Regions about it. For 'tis fit the <hi>Barbarians</hi> should should enjoy my presence. Have the Divinations at <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymae, Clare</hi> and <hi>Delphos, Apollo</hi> for their Author, or are they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93795:81"/>
false, counterfet Oracles? 'Tis not lawfull for thee to know. What shall I be after this life? First a Camell, then a Horse, then a wise man, and a Prophet equall to <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander.</hi> This was the Dialogue between <hi>Glycon</hi> and the Priest: whom at last, knowing him to be a friend to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus,</hi> he sent away with this Oracle wrapt up in this verse,
<q>
                  <l>Believe not <hi>Lepidus,</hi> his fates are dire.</l>
               </q>
For (as I said before) he much feared <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-plotter, and Anti-juggler to his cheats. A certaine <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean,</hi> therefore, not a little endanger'd himselfe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing him in a publique Assembly: where setting upon him in a loud voyce, he said, Thou <hi>Alexander</hi> didst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a <hi>Paphlagonian</hi> to accuse his servants before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>Galatia,</hi> for the suspected murther of his son, who went to schoole at <hi>Alexandria</hi>; yet the young man lives, and is safely come home, but the servants are executed, and by this meanes have bin cast to wild beastes. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion was this. The youth, sayling a good way up into <hi>Aegypt</hi> against streame, was perswaded from thence to sayle on to <hi>India.</hi> After a long stay, his unfortunate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants supposing him either drowned in the <hi>Nile,</hi> or slain by theeves, (of which there was then store) returned home, and reported he was lost; whereupon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was consulted, and they condemned: presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter return'd the youth, and reported his voyage. He had scarce done speaking, but <hi>Alexander,</hi> much provok't by his confutation, and unable to heare truth longer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the multitude to stone him, as they meant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the wicked name of Atheists, and Epicureans: which they presently attempted. But one <hi>Demostratus,</hi> who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in <hi>Pontus,</hi> interposed himselfe, and rescued him from Lapidation; who had else bin deservedly slaine: for why would he offer to be the only discreet man among so many distracted, and expose himselfe to the madnesse of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93795:82"/>
the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi>? you see what he got by it. <hi>Alexanders</hi> custome was, the day before he gave Oracles, to call in order those who had given in their Inquiries, and a cryer standing without the curtaine, ask't him if he were pleased to answer them. And if he gave this reply from within to any man's name, <hi>To the crowes with him,</hi> none after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards received such a one into their house, or admitted him, as they say, <hi>either</hi> to their <hi>fire</hi> or <hi>water.</hi> But he was forced to wander up and downe forreine Countries, as an Atheist, a man hated of the Gods, and an Epicurean, which was the height of infamy. He did one thing very ridiculous. Having got <hi>Epicurus</hi> select Sentences, which, you know, is his best Booke, and the Abridgement of his whole Philosophy, he carryed them into the middest of the Market place, and burning them, in stead of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, cast the ashes into the Sea, with this Oracle, <hi>The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind old man's workes</hi> I <hi>doome to the flame.</hi> Not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what use, and instruction that booke was to the Readers; and how it quieted, settled, and freed their minds from vaine feares, phantasmes, prodigious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, empty hopes, and swelling desires, and planted vertue in their stead; truly clearing, and purging the soule, not with a Taper, or Brush, or such other trifles, but with right reason, liberty, and truth. Among his other Pranks, you shall heare now one of the greatest the Rascall ever play'd. Having, by <hi>Rutilianus</hi> procurement, gain'd no small reputation in <hi>Caesar's</hi> Court, in the heat of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> warre, when <hi>Marcus</hi> was to joyne battle with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> he divulged an Oracle, which commanded two Lyons to be cast alive in <hi>Danubius,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and perfumes, and magnificent sacrifices. But 'tis best to repeat the Oracle as 'twas deliver'd;
<q>
                  <l>Into <hi>Danubius,</hi> when most swolne, and vast,</l>
                  <l>Let two of <hi>Cybel's</hi> wood bred Teeme be cast,</l>
                  <l>VVith fragrant flowers crown'd, which in <hi>India</hi> grew,</l>
                  <l>Then Conquest, Peace, and Triumph shall ensue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93795:82"/>All things being performed as the Oracle directed, the Lyons swamme over to the enemies shoare; which the barbarous people tooke for forreine dogges or wolves, and chased them away with clubbes. But a great defeat, and slaughter befell us, to the losse of twenty thousand men: presently after, the like befell us at <hi>Aquileia</hi>; where we had almost lost the Citty. He coldly vvrested the <hi>Delphicke</hi> Oracle, vvhich vvas delivered to <hi>Croesus,</hi> to this Accident, and said, the God did indeed foretell a great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but explain'd not himselfe vvhether it should befall the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the enemy. When the Citty of <hi>Abonwall</hi> began at length to be so surcharged vvith the great conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and resort of people, which came to consult the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; that it was not able to supply them with victuals, he invented a new kind of Oracles; which were call'd night Oracles. For taking their Tickets, and sleeping with them, he gave such answers as he said his God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him in his dreame; which, for the most part, were darke, ambiguous, and confused; especially if the Ticket were exactly sealed. For then, without the danger of opening, he subscribed any thing by chance, which was obscure, and agreeable to an Oracle. To these kind of Answers belonged certaine Interpreters; who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no small rewards, from those who askt their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and farmed their places of <hi>Alexander</hi>; to whom they every one paid yearly an Attick Talent. Sometimes, when none came, or were sent to enquire, he gave vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Oracles, to astonish the simple people, of which this was one;
<q>
                  <l>The page, to thee most deare, at home unspyed,</l>
                  <l>Commits adultery with thy faire cheekt Bride.</l>
                  <l>'Tis but a just revenge of sinne with sinne,</l>
                  <l>He Cuckolds thee, who hath thy pathick bin.</l>
                  <l>Drowsie Charmes, also, they in secret places,</l>
                  <l>To make thee stupid to their loose Imbraces,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:93795:83"/>Under thy bed, neere to the wall have laid,</l>
                  <l>Assisted by <hi>Calypto,</hi> thy wives maid.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Democritus</hi> would not be troubled to have names, and places thus punctually discribed? And yet would not smile assoone as he knew the plot?</p>
            <p>He many times gave answers to barbarous people, though they enquired in their owne language; in <hi>Syriack,</hi> perchance, or <hi>French.</hi> But his manner vvas, vvhen he could not easily find one of that Country, to take the Tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and to keep it, till he met vvith an Interpretter; vvhich made a long space sometimes betvveene the Inquirie, and Ansvver; A <hi>Scythian</hi> once received this Oracle;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Morphi Ebargulis,</hi> into the shade,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Chnenchichranc,</hi> his light shall fade.</l>
               </q>
Another time, vvhen no body appear'd, or vvas present, he gave this ansvver in Prose; <hi>Returne, he that sent thee is this day slain by his neighbour</hi> Diocles, <hi>assisted by three theeves,</hi> Mangus, Celer, <hi>and</hi> Bubulus, <hi>who are caught, and fetter'd.</hi> Novv heare some of the Oracles vvhich vvere given to mee. One of my questions vvas, (vvhich I sealed openly and exactly) vvhether <hi>Alexander</hi> vvere bald. To vvhich this night ansvver vvas subscribed; Sabar, Dalachi, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach, <hi>he was another</hi> Attis. Another of my Questions vvas, (vvhich I vvrote in severall Tickets) and sent under seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall names, vvhere <hi>Homer</hi> vvas borne. In one paper, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by my Boy, vvho, being askt for vvhat he came, told him, he came for a cure of the paine in his side, he vvrote;
<q>
                  <l>Take <hi>Beares</hi> grease, mingled with <hi>Latona's</hi> Dew.</l>
               </q>
In another paper, being told by the Messenger, he came to enquire vvhether I vvere best goe into <hi>Italy</hi> by land or sea; He gave this ansvver, nothing at all to <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Returne borne by thy feete, not by thy sayles.</l>
               </q>
Many such tricks I put upon him, inclosing sometimes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93795:83"/>
the same enquiry in eight severall notes; to which I feined as many names, and sent them by eight severall messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with as many groates, and what more was to be paid: he perswaded by his gaine, and the Inscription of the notes, to this one Question, in which I ask't when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Impostor should be discover'd, gave eight severall answers, as farre distant as heaven and earth, senslesse withall, and hard to be understood: which comming afterwards to his knowledge, and because I formerly disswaded <hi>Rutilianus</hi> from marriage, and from giving any credit to his Oracles, he hated mee, as he had reason, and accounted me his mortall enemy. Vpon a time, therefore, <hi>Rutilianus</hi> enquired of the Oracle some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning me, and was thus answered;
<q>
                  <l>He spends his night with whores, in obscure stewes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And, to say truth, he deservedly hated mee. Afterwards, having intelligence of my comming to the Citty, and that I was <hi>Lucian</hi> (now I brought two Souldiers in my company, one armed with a Lance, the other with a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, lent mee by the Governour of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> my espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend, for my sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e conduct to the Sea) He with much civility, sent for mee: when I came, I found many with him, and by good fortune brought my Souldiers with mee. He, as his manner was, reach't me out his hand to kisse; which I respectfully taking, and offering to kisse, gave it such a bite, as almost maim'd him. The standers by presently attempted to beat, and choke mee, as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious person; having before taken it very ill that I did salute him by the name of <hi>Alexander,</hi> not of a Prophet. But he very generously interposing himselfe, appeased them, and promised by the help and power of his God to heale my distraction, who, said he, is able to asswage, and winne those who are most tempestuous against him. Then putting them all out of the roome, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate with mee, telling mee he knew vvhat counsell
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93795:84"/>
I had given to <hi>Rutilianus</hi>; and asking mee how he had deserved such carriages from mee, seeing it was in his power to contrive great matters for mee? I was much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with his friendly behaviour; considering in what danger I was; And after some small stay went out with him reconciled. The sudden alteration strucke deepe astonishment into the beholders. Not long after, I resolved to take ship; and being alone with <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and having sent my father, and my other company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Amastris,</hi> he sent me great gifts, and presents, and offer'd to provide me a ship, and marriners to row mee, which I accepted as proceeding from a cleare, and honest intention. But when we came into the middle of the Sea, I saw the Pilot weepe, and earnestly contest with the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; which were no very good presages of my safety. The truth is, they were hired by <hi>Alexander</hi> to throw us over board: which had they done, he had amply revenged himselfe upon mee. But he that wept prevailed with them not to execute their designe; who in these words addrest himselfe to mee, I have lived, as you see, to the age of threescore yeares, a religious, innocent life; and will not now at this great age, having wife and children, defile my hands with murther. Intimating for what purpose he tooke us into the ship, and what plot <hi>Alexander</hi> had layd. Having set us ashore at <hi>Aegiali,</hi> made so famous by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> he sayled backe againe. Not long after sayled by the <hi>Bosphoran</hi> Embassadours, sent by their King <hi>Eupater</hi> with the Tribute mony which was yearly paid into <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia</hi>; To whom after I had told our danger, and escape, they courteously tooke us into their ship, and transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us safe to <hi>Amastris.</hi> So neare my death was I. From that time I tooke Armes against him, and raised all my forces to revenge my self; who before this Trechery hated him, and accounted him my enemy for the wickednesse of his life, and manners. Nor had I failed to question him, and joyned vvith others in his accusation, especially vvith
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93795:84"/>
the Schollers of <hi>Timocrates</hi> the <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>clean</hi> Philosopher, had not the Governour of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> vvith much intercession, and intreaty dissvvaded us, vvho out of his respect to <hi>Rutilianus</hi> profest he could not punish him, though his Impostures vvere never so plainly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: vvhereupon I supprest, and suffer'd my revenge to coole, dispairing of my successe before a Judge so partiall. Of vvhom, to his other bold attempts, <hi>Alexander</hi> adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to aske leave, that <hi>Abonwall</hi> might change its name, and be called <hi>Ionople</hi>; and obtained povver also to coyne mony, stampt vvith the Image of <hi>Glycon,</hi> on the one side, and of <hi>Alexander</hi> on the other, holding the Badge of his Grandfather <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and <hi>Perseus</hi> sickle, from vvhom he derived himselfe by the mother. At last he publish't this Oracle concerning himselfe; <hi>That 'twas decreed by the Fates that he should live an hundred and fifty yeares, and that then he should dye miserably struck with lightning.</hi> But he dyed under seventy of a Gangrene, (as it became <hi>Podali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> sonne) vvhich did eate from his foote to his thigh; and almost devoured by vvormes. At vvhich time hee vvas discover'd to be bald, by permitting his head to be bathed by Physitians, for the head-ache: vvhich they could not do, and not pluck off his Perivvigge. Thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Tragedy of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and this vvas the Catastro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of the vvhole play. Through vvhich there seemed to run a Thred of Providence, but all vvas casualty, and chance. That vvhich follovved vvas an Epitaph upon him, expressing the vvorthinesse of his Actions, and Life, and a contention among his principall Camerades, and fellovv Cheaters, vvho referr'd themselves to <hi>Rutilianus</hi> vvhich should be preferr'd, and chosen to succeed in the Oracle, and vveare the Propheticke Crovvne, and Robe. In vvhich number vvas one <hi>Paetus</hi> of that Citty, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession a Physitian; vvho by such a competition disgraced both his profession and vvhite haires. But <hi>Rutilianus,</hi> the Master of the Game, dismist them all vvithout Gyrlands,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93795:85"/>
and reserved the Propheticke place for himselfe, after his departure thence.

Or, if for this you worship not <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> but for some other good confer'd upon you, why, holding them not anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for Gods, do you now give them divine honours, as if they were? and why doe you sacrifice to them, who themselves had like to have beene made sacrifices?

               <p>These, which you have repeated, were their generous exployts, <hi>Mnesippus.</hi> Who being but two durst put themselves upon such a bold attempt, as being so farre distant from home, to sayle the <hi>Pontus,</hi> a sea not tryed before by any <hi>Graecians,</hi> but those who made the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>Colchos</hi> in the <hi>Argo</hi>; neither daunted, nor affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fables which goe of it, or with those names which call it Inhospitable, from the savagenesse, I believe, of those rude nations which inhabit the Coasts. And when they were apprehended, to take courage from their misfortune, and not to thinke a bare escape enough, but to revenge their wrongs upon the King, and to sayle away with our <hi>Diana,</hi> how can such valiant Atchievements but raise Admiration, and deserve divine honour from all men who have any taste of vertue? Though we hold not <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> for Demi-gods, and worthyes from those reflections.</p>

               <p>Heare, then, admired Sir, and consider how much our opinion of good men, who are <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is nobler then yours. For no famous monument of <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> is to be seene at <hi>Argos,</hi> or <hi>Mycenae.</hi> But wee can show a Temple equally, as 'twas fit, built to both, as they were friends; where sacrifices are offer'd, and other rites of honour are performed. Nor do vve thinke them good men the lesse, because they vvere forrainers, and not <hi>Scythians</hi>; nor do vve examine, so they be vertuous, and honest, from vvhence they are, nor repine at great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though vvrought by men not our friends: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applauding their adventures, entitled them to our selves by their deeds. But that vvhich in those men vve do vvith most admiration extoll is, that they appeared to us a paire of unequall'd friends; and made their example a Lavv to others, Hovv, vvith their friendship, to partake in all fortunes too, and thereby gaine the veneration of the best <hi>Scythians.</hi> Whatsoever, therefore, they mutually suffer'd for, or with one another, our Ancestors engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a pillar of Brasse, which they erected in <hi>Oreste's</hi> Temple, and made a Law that their childrens first lesson and peece of education should be to remember what was there carved. So that it is easier for them to forget the name of their father, then be ignorant of the deeds of <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pylades.</hi> In the porch of the Temple, also, is to be seene shadowed in Antique Imagery all that is written on the pillar. <hi>Orestes</hi> sayling with his friend, then their ship broken, and wrack't against steepe rockes; then he apprehended, and drest for Immolation, and both consecrated by <hi>Iphigenia.</hi> On the opposite wall he is drawne freed from his shackles, slaying <hi>Thoas,</hi> and many other <hi>Scythians</hi>; Then hoysing sayles, and conveying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93795:87"/>
                  <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> and our Goddesse. Then the <hi>Scythians</hi> vainly striving to stop the floating Barke, by laying hold on the Sterne, and labouring to get aboard. Lastly, Failing in their attempt, some wounded, others for feare returning to the shoare. But the most remarkable passage is the mutuall friendship they show'd in their Skirmish with the <hi>Scythians.</hi> For the Painter hath limbed them both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally carelesse of his owne assaylers, and solicitous only to encounter those who beset the other, and to divert his darts; not at all weighing his owne slaughter, so he might save his friend; and interposing his owne body to receive those strokes which were directed to the others. This their mutuall assistance, and communion in misfortunes, Their fidelity in friendship, ruth and constancy of affections, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us no mortall vertues, but endowments of a mind advanced above the vulgar: who in prosperous times will take resentment at their friends, if they share not in their successes; But let the wind blow a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly, they fly away and leave them solitary in their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For you must know, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> prize no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as friendship, nor will a true <hi>Scythian</hi> think any thing so glorious as to succour his friend, and partake in his distresses: And therefore among us no infamy is so great, as to be held a Traytor in Friendship. The reason, then, why wee honour <hi>Orestes,</hi> and <hi>Pylades,</hi> is, because they excell'd in <hi>Scythian</hi> virtues, and were approved in friendship, a thing most in our admiration. From these proceedings of theirs we have given them a name, and call'd them <hi>Coraci</hi>; which in our Language is as much as to say, the Gods of friendship.</p>

For though I once thought otherwise, yet now, methinkes, 'tis but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice that you have placed <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> among the Gods.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93795:87"/>

But I thought friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship had not beene so sacred among the <hi>Scythians</hi>; but that being a people barbarous and wilde, they had nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht mutuall strifes, quarrels, and disagreements, and had not held friendship with their neerest Alliances and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks; Being led to this opinion by that report, which among others I have heard, that they eate their departed Ancestors.</p>

               <p>Whether, as in other things, so in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Ancestours we be more religious, and pious then you <hi>Greekes,</hi> for the present I dispute not. But that <hi>Scythian</hi> friends are much faithfuller, then <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that friendship is more regarded among us then you, I shall easily make appeare. By the Gods of <hi>Greece,</hi> therefore, I desire you not to heare mee impatiently, whilst I recount what I observed during the large time of my conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here. You, indeed, seeme abler then others to talke of friendship; but, contrary to your high discourses, doe so neglect the works of it, that you hold it sufficient to praise it, and to show what an ample vertue 'tis. But when you should come to use it, you fall from your words, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wing, I know not how, shift your selves from the practice. And when you see such rare friendships pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented on the stage in a Tragedy, you applaud, and clap hands; and when you see them mutually engaged in one anothers dangers, many of you shed teares: yet you your selves attempt nothing praise worthy for your friend. But if he chance to be distrest, presently, like dreames, all the Tragedy you saw flyes away and vanishes; and leaves you like those hollow, and dumbe vizards, which broadly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stend their mouth, and gape widely, but speake not the least word: whereas wee, by how much we come short in our discourses of Friendship, by so much we excell you in the practice. If you like the motion, therefore, let us
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93795:88"/>
passe over those ancient friends which lived heretofore, and which either you, or we are able to muster up: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause herein you overcome us, being fortified by many authenticke authorities, especially Poets, who have sung the friendship of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Patroclus, Theseus</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithous,</hi> and others in most excellent Poem and verse. And let us select, and produce some few among our selves, and report the deeds, I of <hi>Scythians,</hi> you of <hi>Greekes.</hi> And let him that overcomes, and produces the best examples in friendship, be Conquerour, and divulge his conquest, as having vanquisht in a most glorious combate. For my part, if I be worsted in the Duell, I had much rather have my right hand cut off (the punishment among us of the vanquish't) then be thought inferiour to any <hi>Grecian</hi> in Friendship, being my selfe a <hi>Scythian.</hi>

First, I will relate the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and <hi>Dinias,</hi> famous among the <hi>Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> This <hi>Agathocles,</hi> by birth a <hi>Samian,</hi> lived not long since. A man unequall'd in friendship, as he gave good Testimony, though in other things, as Pedigree, and greatnesse of fortune, he nothing differ'd from the other vulgar <hi>Samians.</hi> He was from his childhood friend to <hi>Dinias,</hi> the <hi>Ephesian,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Lysio.</hi> This <hi>Dinias</hi> was left exceeding rich. And as it falls out with men newly come to greatestates, had many acquaintances about him fit to associate him in Potations and Drinkings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations of Pleasure; but were mere strangers to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Among those was <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who converst and drunke with them, not pleased with the course. Nor did <hi>Dinias</hi> value him more then his other flatterers. But at length became offended with his frequent reprehensions, and held him troublesome, for remembring him of his Ancestours, and counselling to keepe what his father, with much industry possest, and left him. So that hee no longer admitted him to their Revellings, but continued
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93795:89"/>
his disorders privately with them; though with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment from <hi>Agathocles.</hi> It happen'd that the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man was perswad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by his flatterers that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of <hi>Chariclea,</hi> the wife of <hi>Demonax,</hi> a man of great Quality and Office, among the <hi>Ephesians</hi>; letters, also, were brought to him from the woman, and chaplets halfe wither'd, and apples just tasted, and whatsoever Bawdes usually project for the enticement of young men, when they would insinuate affection into them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them with an opinion that they are first beloved. For such Arts prevaile much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially with such as think themselves handsome, till unawares they fall into the net. This <hi>Chariclea</hi> was a Courtly woman, but extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a whore; alwaies his, who approach't her upon the least suite. If any man but glanced at her, she presently returned a consent; so little feare was there of her denyals. But withall, she was more artificially cunning then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whores, to allure her servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and to keepe him doubtfull, till she had wholly vanquisht him. And when he was once caught, to whet him on, and enflame him sometimes with quarrels, sometimes with enticements, soone after with disdaine, and jealousie, of her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another. In a word, she was every way expert, and practiced in the arts how to deale with her Lovers. Her, then, <hi>Dinias</hi> flatterers projected for the youth, and laid many traines to kindle his love towards <hi>Chariclea.</hi> She, who had already beene the ruine of many such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had acted innumerable affections, and like a changeable, and exercised mischiefe, had subverted many families, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got into her hands a youth, simple, and unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in such stratagems, suffer'd him not to escape her clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but inclining, and ensnaring him on all sides, when she had wholly caught him, she herselfe seemed taken in the snare, and became to miserable <hi>Dinias</hi> the originall of numberlesse mischiefes. For, first, she sent him letters, which were frequently seconded by her maid, who told
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93795:89"/>
him how her Mistris wept, and broke her sleepes; Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how she, wretched woman, meant to strangle her selfe for Love. Till hee became perswaded that he was most happy, amiable, and beyond measure affected by the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> wives. At length, with much intreaty, he gave her a meeting, and from that time you may guesse how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily he was to be caught by a woman beautifull, of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant behaviour, skill'd to weepe when shee list, and to mingle compassionate sighs with discourses, to twine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him at his departures, and to meete his approaches; to adorne herselfe in Dresses of most enticement, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to sing, and play on her Lute; All which arts shee imployed upon <hi>Dinias.</hi> But when shee perceived him once perplext, and sufficiently steept, and melted in Love, that shee might utterly ruine the wretch, shee contrived this plot: she fained her selfe with child by him, (a sure device the more to inflame a besotted Lover) and forbore farther visits, out of a pretence that she was observed by her husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had some Jealousies of their Love. He unable to beare the separation, and impatient when he savv her not, vvept, and assembled his flatterers, and dolefully invok't <hi>Charcilea's</hi> name, and embracing her statue made of Alablaster, made pittifull lamentation. At last, he cast himselfe downe, and rould himselfe upon the floore, and fell into a perfect distraction. Hereupon gifts vvere sent to her, not in value like her Apples, or Chaplets, but entire houses, farmes, servants, embroyder'd garments, and gold as much as she desired. What shall I say more? In short time <hi>Lysios</hi> family, the most renovvned among the <hi>Ionians,</hi> vvas vvasted and spent. She having thus dravvne him dry, forsooke him, and layd her engines for a certaine rich <hi>Cretan</hi> young Gentleman, to vvhom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and made Love, vvhich he believed. <hi>Dinias</hi> thus neglected not onely of <hi>Chariclea,</hi> but of his flatterers, vvho also applyed themselves to the <hi>Cretan</hi> Lover, addrest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to <hi>Agathocles</hi>; vvho all the vvhile vvas a spectator of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93795:90"/>
the miscarriage of his affaires. After some expressions of shame, he told him the passages of his Love, wants, the womans disdaine, and his <hi>Cretan</hi> Rivall; and in briefe, how he could not live without <hi>Chariclea's</hi> conversation. He, holding it at that time unseasonable to expostulate with <hi>Dinias,</hi> why of all his friends he excluded him, and preferr'd his flatterers before him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>old the onely house he had, left him in <hi>Samos</hi> by his father, for three Talents, and brought him the price: which he no sooner received, but he left off to be obscure to <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and became once more amiable. The maid was againe sent with letters, and a complaint for his strangenesse. His flatterers also resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, with much insinuation, seeing he had yet something to give. <hi>Dinias</hi> promised to come to her, and came about the time of the first sleep. But, whither by his voluntary foreknowledge, or by designe with his wife, for both are reported, <hi>Demonax, Chariclea's</hi> husband was within: who rising, as it were, from an Ambush, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to shut the doores, and to take <hi>Dinias</hi>; threatning fire, and whips, and drawing his sword as against an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer. He seeing in what danger he was, snatcht up a barre which lay neare, and slew <hi>Demonax</hi> with a blow on the head, and next <hi>Chariclea</hi>; but not with one blow, but iterated strokes which he gave her, partly with the barre, lastly with her husbands sword. The servants in the meane time stood speechlesse, and astonish't at the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of the enterprize. But endeavouring at length to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, he no sooner made resistance with the sword but they all fled. <hi>Dinias,</hi> after his great atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conveyed himselfe privately away, and lodged till morning with <hi>Agathocles,</hi> where they discoursed what had happen'd; and considered what might be the issue. 'Twas no sooner day but souldiers beset the house, (for the fact was by this time divulged) and tooke <hi>Dinias</hi>; whom, not at all denying the murthers, they brought before the then Governour of <hi>Asia</hi>; who sent him to the great
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93795:91"/>
King, who not long after doomed him to <hi>Gyarus,</hi> one of the <hi>Cyclad</hi> Ilands, there to remaine banish't during his life. <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who had assisted at his other mis-fortunes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him also into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was the onely friend that stuck to him at his arraignment, and failed him in no good office. Nay after <hi>Dinias</hi> was banish't, he was not forsaken of his friend; who voluntarily sentenced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, associated him in the Isle, and shared in his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At length wanting all necessary sustenance, and supplyes, he hired himselfe to certaine purple dyers, to dive for them, and nourisht <hi>Dinias</hi> with his gaines; and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him also in a lingring sicknesse; and after his death he refused to returne into his owne Country, but tarried still in the Isle; holding it a reproach to forsake his friend though dead. These were the Acts of a <hi>Graecian</hi> friend, not of any ancient performance; For I know not well whether it be more then five yeares since <hi>Agathocles</hi> dyed in the Island.</p>

Being almost stifled, he cryed out, and vvith much labour raysed himself above the flood: vvhich <hi>Euthydocus</hi> no sooner heard, vvho by good fortune vvas then naked on the deck, but he cast himselfe into the Sea, and laying hold on <hi>Damon</hi> then gasping, (for by the moone-shine vve beheld the vvhole adventure) he svvamme by him, and held him up. They in the Ship stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to succour them, out of pitty to their mutuall distresse; but could not, being ravish't away by the violence of the winde. All they could doe, was to throw many Corkes, and poles to them, on which if they could lay hold, they might support themselves; and after all they let downe a Ladder of no small length. Consider, now I pray, what stronger testimony of affection could any man show to his friend, then by night to cast himselfe into a Tempestuous sea, and to partake in his death. Lay, I say, before your imagination, the swelling of the waves, the horrid murmure of the Billowes rolling together, the foame boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling round about, the night, and dispaire; then the one beginning to be choakt, and hardly able to beare himselfe above water, or to reach out his hand to his friend, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther presently leaping overboard, and swimming by him, and fearing lest <hi>Damon</hi> should perish before him; and you will perceive that this <hi>Euthydicus</hi> whom I have reported to you was no degenerous friend.</p>

               <p>Take courage <hi>Toxaris,</hi> they were both saved, and do now study Philosophy at <hi>Athens.</hi> All that <hi>Simylus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could report was, what he saw by night, the one tumbling over-board, the other leaping after him, and both swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together, which was all the spectacle he could have of them in the darke. The rest of the escape is told by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thydicus</hi> himselfe; As first, that having lighted on some Corkes, they supported themselves by them, and with much difficulty kept themselves floating; At last, towards morning, when they saw a Ladder let downe, they swam to it, and ascending the vessell, they safely sailed on to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus.</hi> Next to these examples, not vulgar, as I suppose, lend me your Attention to a third, not at all inferiour to the other two. <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> held straight friendship with <hi>Aretaeus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Charixenus</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian</hi>: being himselfe as poore as they were wealthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At his death he left a will, in the judgement of others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ridiculous, though I know not whether it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare so to you, who are a good man, and value friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and therein deserve to be rankt with the foremost. The purpose of it was this. I bequeath to <hi>Aretaeus</hi> my mother, to be maintained, and cherisht in her old age. And to <hi>Charixenus</hi> my daughter, to be bestowed vvith as great a dovvry as he can possibly give vvith her. Novv he had a mother very aged; and a daughter ripe for marriage. And if, said he, either of them shall die in the meane time, let the other take his burden. When his vvill vvas read, they vvho knevv onely his poverty, and knevv not vvhat friendship vvas betvveene <hi>Eudamidas</hi> and these tvvo men, made it matter of sport: and there vvas no man vvho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not smiling at the Legacies bequeathed to rich <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus,</hi> and <hi>Charixenus</hi>; and saying, that they vvere to pay Legacies to <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> and that the survivers vvere to give inheritances to the deceast. But the heires, vvho vvere thus left, came assoone as they heard of the vvill, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it in all the particulars. Onely <hi>Charixenus</hi> survived
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93795:91"/>
him five dayes, and dyed. Whereupon <hi>Aretaeus,</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successor of both, tooke upon him both his ovvne, and the others charge: and maintaines <hi>Eudamidas</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not long since matcht his daughter; and of the five talents vvhich he vvas vvorth, he gave tvvo vvith his ovvne daughter, and tvvo vvith his friend's, and caused their marriages to be celebrated upon the same day. And novv <hi>Toxaris</hi> vvhat thinke you of this <hi>Aretaeus?</hi> Hath he not given a noble instance of friendship, to inherit such Legacies, and not to frustrate his friends will?

               <p>He is a rare example. Yet I much more admire the confidence of <hi>Eudamidas</hi> in his friends: whereby he gave proofe that he would have done the like for them, though charged by no will, and had prevented others, though hee had not beene written heire to such Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes.</p>

               <p>You say well. The fourth, then, of whom I shall speake is <hi>Zenothemis,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Charmoleus,</hi> borne at <hi>Marcelleis.</hi> He was showne to mee in <hi>Italy,</hi> when I was there Ambassadour for my Country. Hee seemed to be a man of goodly presence, bigge, and wealthy. By him in Coach as he travelled sate his wife, every way deformed, especially lame of her right side, blind of one eye, a Hagge perfectly loathsome, and not to be approacht. I wondring that one so proper, and beautifull, should have the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to wedde a woman so mishapen, hee who show'd him to mee told mee the occasion of his marriage; exactly knowing all passages, being himselfe of <hi>Marcelleis. Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themis,</hi> said he, was friend to <hi>Menecrates</hi>; this ill-featured womans father, whom he equall'd in wealth and honour; though he abounded in both. It came to passe that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necrates</hi> was ruined in his fortune, and made uncapable of honour by the sentence of the sixe hundred, as one that had given Judgement contrary to Law. For so, said he, do wee of <hi>Marcelleis</hi> punish those who pronounce cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93795:92"/>
                  <hi>Menecrates</hi> was much grieved, both for his doome, and that in an instant of a rich man hee was made poore, and of a great man dishonourable. But above all his daughter troubled him most, now marriageable, being eighteene yeares old, whom not with all fortunes which her father before his sentence possest, any, either rich, or poore, would vouchsafe to marry, of such affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lineaments: was she. She was said too, to have the fits of the falling evill, at every increase of the Moone. When <hi>Menecrates</hi> layd all this open to <hi>Zenothemis</hi> in one complaint: hee bid him take heart, and told him that he should neither want accommodations, nor his daughter a husband worthy her descent. And so saying he tooke him by the hand, brought him to his house, divided his estate, which was very great, with him, and made a feast, where he entertained his friends, and among them <hi>Menecrates,</hi> as if he had prevailed with one of them to accept the wench in marriage. The meale being ended, and grace said, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to him a full bowle, Take, said he, <hi>Menecrates</hi> from thy sonne in law a pledge of Alliance; for to day I will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Cydimache</hi> thy daughter: I have formerly received five and twenty Talents as her dowry. The other replyed, the Gods forbid, It must not be <hi>Zenothemis,</hi> nor must I be so mad to suffer you, a young man, and amiable, to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a deform'd, opprobrious girle. Thus saying, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tooke his bride, led her into his chamber, and a while after brought her forth unvirgin'd, and from that time lives most affectionately with her, and carries her every where, as you see, about vvith him; And is so farre from taking shame at his match, that hee makes it his glory to shovv hovv much he contemnes the beauties, or deformities of the body; Riches also, &amp; opinion, and reflects onely on <hi>Menecrates,</hi> his friend: vvhom he thinkes not the lesse capable of his friendship for being sentenced by the sixe hundred. Though fortune have for this requited him. For a very faire sonne hath been borne to him of a very fowle
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93795:93"/>
mother. 'Tis not long since his father tooke him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into the Court crown'd with a green chaplet, and clad in mourning, the better to winne pitty to his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. The Infant smiled upon the Judges, and clapt it's hands: whereupon the Court was so taken with him, that they forgave his Fine, and restor'd him to his honours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by such an advocate. Thus much the <hi>Marcilean</hi> affirm'd <hi>Zenothemis</hi> to have done for his friend: wherein you find nothing ordinary, or done like you <hi>Scythians</hi>; who are said to choose onely the most beautifull your Mistresses. I passe on to the fift. Nor thinke I it fit to speake of any other and to omit <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Sunian.</hi> This <hi>Demetrius</hi> sayled in company into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> of <hi>Alopece</hi>; who was his friend of a child; and with whom he grew up, and was bred to the study of Cynicke Philosophy under <hi>Rhodius</hi> the Sophister; <hi>Antiphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to Physicke. But at this time <hi>Demetrius</hi> went into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to see the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> and <hi>Memnon's</hi> Statue. For he had heard that from their great height they did cast no sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and that <hi>Memnon</hi> at every Sun rising was vocall. Drawne, therefore, with the desire of those spectacles, in August hee sayled up the <hi>Nile,</hi> and left <hi>Antiphilus</hi> tyred with travell and heat; who, in the mean time, fell into a misfortune, which required the assistance of a generous friend. For one <hi>Syrus</hi> his servant, so stiled from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by conspiracy with certaine sacrilegious thieves, broke into <hi>Anubis</hi> Temple, and stole the God, two golden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, a guilt Cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ceus, diverse dogges heads of silver, with other things. All which they left to be kept by <hi>Syrus.</hi> Soone after being apprehended selling some things, they confest all upon their first torture upon the wheele. And being carried to <hi>Antiphilus</hi> lodging, they produced the things stolne, secretly under a Couch. <hi>Syrus</hi> was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound, and his master <hi>Antiphilus</hi> ravisht from his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as he was then at Lecture. No man assisted him, but they who were but till then his friends, shunned him as a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93795:93"/>
robber of <hi>Anubis</hi> Temple, and thought it Impiety either to drinke or to eate with him. His other servants, who were two, rifling all that was in the house betooke themselves to flight. Long time lay miserable <hi>Antiphilus</hi> in shackles, of all the malefactors there imprisoned held the greatest. The Goaler, also, an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> a man superstitious, thought he pleasured and revenged his God by being harsh to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphilus.</hi> If at any time he defended himselfe, and denyed the Fact, he was held impudent, and became so much the more odious. This drew on a sicknesse, and cast him into a disease. And no marvaile, lying nightly on the ground, and not able to extend his legges lockt up in the stocks. For by day he was inclosed in a cage, and but one of his hands manacled, but by night he lay wholly in fetters. Adde to this the stinke, and ill ayre of the house, arising from so many close prisoners, thrust into a narrow roome, and scarce able to breath; Then the sound of Irons, and broken sleepes, all which were grievous, and intolerable to one unpractised, and unaccustomed to so hard a kind of usage. As hee thus languisht, and refused to eate any meat, <hi>Demetrius</hi> return'd, ignorant of what had happen'd. But assoone as he knew how things stood, he presently ran to the prison, but was not permitted entrance. It being then night, and the Goaler having long before lockt the doore, and gone to sleepe, and commanded his under keepers to watch. In the morning, after much intreaty, he was let in; and comming neere, 'twas long before he could finde <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> so much disguised was hee with his misfortunes. In search of him, therefore, hee viewed every prisoner, like those who seeke the wither'd bodies of their dead friends after a slaughter. So that had he not aloud revealed himselfe to be <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> the sonne of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenes,</hi> he had beene long unknowne who he was; so transformed was he by his calamities. But assoone as he answered to his Friends voyce, and, as he came near, strokt aside his hayre, which hung fowle, and knotted over his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93795:94"/>
face, and discovered who he was, both fell downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at the strangenesse of the spectacle. After a while, both comming to themselves, <hi>Demetrius</hi> enquired of him exactly how he fell into that mishap. And bid him take courage, divided his mantle, and wore one halfe himselfe, the other he gave to him; and stript him of his owne tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd ragges. And from that time giving him his best as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances, he tooke care of him, and attended him. For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himselfe out from morning till noone to certaine Merchants, who then lay in the Haven, his gaines were not sma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l which he earn'd by carrying burdens; and still when he returned from his labour, part of his gaines he gave to the Goaler to mollifie and make him gentle, the rest plentifully serv'd to supply his friend. By day, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he kept <hi>Antiphilus</hi> company, and comforted him; and when night came, he reposed himselfe not far from the prison gate upon a bed made of grasse and boughes. Thus a while they lived; <hi>Demetrius</hi> had free accesses, which much mitigated the afflictions of <hi>Antiphilus</hi>: Till at length, upon the death of a certaine thiefe in the prison, it seemes, poyson'd, the gates were strictlier kept, and no man was any more permitted to enter into the house, whereat <hi>Demetrius</hi> much perplext, and troubled, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other way to relieve his friend, went to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and accused himselfe for one of those who broke into <hi>Anubis</hi> Temple. Upon which confession he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently carryed to the prison, and brought to <hi>Antiphilus</hi>; and with much petition obtained of the Keeper that he might be chained next to him in the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ives. Here, then, was a rare expression of friendship, to dispise his owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and though he were himselfe sicke, yet he tooke care that the other might sleep quietly, and undisturbed. Thus lessen'd they their misfortunes by communion; Till not long after an Accident happen'd which did almost put a period to their sufferings. For one of the prisoners, having, I know not from whence, got a file, and made most of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93795:94"/>
the other prisoners of the conspiracy, filed asunder a chain to which they were fasten'd by a row of shackles, and let them all loose. They having easily slaine their Keepers, being but few, issued forth in Tumults, and presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed themselves severall wayes as they safeliest might, though many of them were afterwards taken. <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Antiphilus</hi> remain'd, and stay'd <hi>Syrus,</hi> ready to follow the rest. Next morning, the Prefect of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> knowing what had happen'd, sent pursuers after them; and sending for those who were with <hi>Demetrius</hi> releast them of their shackles; much praysing them that they onely refused to make an escape. They were not at all pleased with their manner of dismission <hi>Demetrius,</hi> therefore, proclam'd both himselfe &amp; friend much injured, if being taken for malefactors, they should be thought worthy of pitty, or praise, or releasement, because they did not breake pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. To conclude, therefore, they compelld the Judge more exactly to reexamini the business; who finding them innocent, with great praises of both, and admiration of <hi>Demetrius</hi> acquitted them. And as a recompence for the punishment, and shackles, which they unjustly suffer'd, he gave them large gifts; ten thousand drachmes to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> and twice so many to <hi>Demetrius. Antiphilus</hi> is now in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But <hi>Demetrius</hi> bestowing his twenty thousand Drachmes on his friend, went into <hi>India</hi> to the <hi>Brachmans</hi>; saying onely thus much to <hi>Antiphilus</hi> at his departure, that he hop't he was excusable if he then left him; and that he needed not mony as long as he was of a composition to be content with a little; nor that hee any farther wanted a friend, whose affaires were so well accomplish't. These were <hi>Graecian</hi> Friends, <hi>Toxaris.</hi> And here, had you not in the beginning noted us for high talkers, I could repeat to you the many excellent Orations spoken by <hi>Demetrius</hi> at his Arraignment, where he made no defence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but spent teares and supplications for <hi>Antiphilus</hi>; and tooke the whole offence upon himself, till <hi>Syrus</hi> urged
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93795:95"/>
by scourging acquitted both. These few examples of many famous, and constant friends, as they first offer'd themselves to my remembrance, have I reported to you. 'Tis now time that finishing my Narration, you should begin yours, whom it will concerne to produce <hi>Scythians</hi> not of inferiour, but of much more eminent example, if you intend your right hand shall not be cut off. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to your selfe therefore; For 'twill show most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in you, having, so like a Sophister, extoll'd <hi>Orestes</hi> and <hi>Pylades,</hi> to show your selfe a bad Oratour for your Country.</p>

               <speaker>Toxaris.</speaker>
               <p>You do well, <hi>Mnesippus,</hi> to invite me to speake, and not to show your selfe afraid, that vanquisht by my narrations, your tongue shall be cut out. I begin, then, not like you, with Trappings of speech, (a thing unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to <hi>Scythians</hi>) since the realities of my stories shall be more eloquent then the Historian. Nor are you to expect from me stories like yours, who have magnified a man for wedding a deformed woman, without a portion; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for giving two Talents in Marriage with his friends daughter; a third for casting himselfe voluntarily into shackles; knowing he was shortly after to be releast. All which are slight passages, and have nothing high, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them. I will recount to you slaughters, warres, and deaths undergone for Friends; whereby you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how childish your undertakings are compared to ours. Yet it is not without cause that you admire your own small adventures, since living in a firme, establisht peace, you want those Heroick opportunities, by which friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships are to be tryed. As you cannot judge in a calme of the Abilities of a Pilot, which are best discovered in a storme. Whereas we have continuall warres, and do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invade others, or are invaded our selves; or joyning battle do fight for pastures, or prey. Hence stand we most in need of good friends, whose Armes become uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, and impregnable from the strictnesse of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93795:95"/>
First, then, let mee tell you, that the Ceremonies by which wee initiate friends, are not, like yours, perform'd in Bowles, and Potations; or with our equals, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but when we see a man valiant, and able for great Actions, wee all presently affect him; and the same course which you take to win your wives, do we take to beget friends. We court them much, and omit no application, which may defeat us of their friendship, or render us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised. And when choice is made of a friend, articles are next entred into, and a solemne oath taken, that they shall mutually live, and, if need be, die, for one another. Next, having open'd a veine in our hand, we receive the blood in a cup, in which wee dippe the points of our swords; then both drinke, nor can any thing afterwards divide us. These leagues at most consist of three: wee account of him who is a friend to more, as we do of common adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate wives, and never thinke his a firme lasting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which is divided among many. I will begin, then, with the late Deeds of <hi>Dandamis.</hi> This <hi>Dandamis</hi> seeing his friend <hi>Amizocas</hi> taken prisoner in a skirmish with the <hi>Sarmatians</hi>— But first I will take my oath as we agreed in the beginning.

               <p>The fourth day, then, after <hi>Dandamis,</hi> and <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zocas</hi> had joyned friendship, and confirmed it with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall draught of blood, the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> entred our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with ten thousand Horse, and thirty thousand foote. We, surprized with their invasion, were put into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction: some, vvho made resistance they slevv; some they led avvay alive; none scap't, but such as svvam crosse the River, vvhere lay halfe our Army, and a great part of our vvaggons. For our Commanders, I knovv not for vvhat designe had at that time lodged their Troopes on both sides of <hi>Tanais.</hi> They, therefore, easily made their prey, led avvay captive, ransackt our Tents, tooke our Chariots vvith the men, and ravisht our vvives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines before our eyes. The accident much troubled us. But <hi>Amizocas,</hi> as he vvas led captive, and manacled, loudly invok't his friend, and remembred him of the cuppe, and blood. Which <hi>Dandamis</hi> no sooner heard, but vvithout delay in the sight of all he svvumme over to the enemies, vvho cast shovvres of darts at him; and had vvith one assault thrust him through had he not cryed out <hi>Zizis</hi>: At the pronuntiation of vvhich vvord they slay no man, but receive him, as yielding himselfe to be ransomed. Being brought to their Generall, he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his friend, and he demanded his ransome, and refused to give him liberty but at an excessive price. Then said <hi>Dandamis,</hi> all my possessions and fortunes you have taken from mee. If naked, as I am, I can make you satisfaction, I am ready. Make your demands. Take mee, if you please in exchange, and abuse mee as you list. 'Twere needlesse, replyed the <hi>Sarmatian,</hi> to keepe thee who didst voluntarily yield thy selfe. Give something which thou now possessest in ransome of thy friend, and take him.

                  <hi>Dandamis</hi> bid him aske what he would. He required his eyes; which the other presently submitted to be pluck't out. Which being done, and the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> allowing it for a ransome, hee returned, leaning on his friend, and swimming with him back againe safely arrived at us. This Action struck spirit into the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who now thought themselves not vanquisht, since the thing by us most valued was not conquered by the enemy; but that our courage, and Constancy to our friends, was still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subdued. The <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> on the contrary, were much terrified, when they consider'd what men they were to encounter upon preparation; though they then overcame them by surprize. 'Twas therefore, no sooner night, but leaving most of their spoyles behind them, and burning our Chariots, they betooke themselves to flight. <hi>Amizocas</hi> in the meane time, disdaining the use of his eyes, after his friend had lost his, made himselfe blinde. And now sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as they are, they are observ'd, and kept with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at the publicke charge of the <hi>Scythians.</hi> I doubt, <hi>Mne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sippus,</hi> whether you could equall this example, though I should allow you to joyne ten more to your five; or if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne you should have liberty to use what fictions you list.

                  <hi>Basthes</hi> from his Jawes, till the Lyon leaving him halfe dead turned upon <hi>Belitta</hi>; and griping him in his pawes kill'd him, who dying, had onely the power to thrust his sword into the Lyons paunch, and so all three expired. Whom we have buried, and erected two neighbouring monuments, one to the two friends, the other just oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the Lyon. My third relation shall be of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Macentes, Lonchatas,</hi> and <hi>Arsacomas.</hi> This <hi>Arsaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> became enamoured of <hi>Mazaea,</hi> daughter of <hi>Leucanor,</hi> who raigned in <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> at that time when he was sent Embassadour thither to demand the Tribute, which the <hi>Bosphorans</hi> are obliged to pay us; but were then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind three months beyond their accustomed day. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sight of <hi>Mazaea</hi> at a feast, a goodly, and amiable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he was enflamed, and much struck with her. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of the tribute was now transacted, and the King having given him his answer, and entertained him at a banquet, was ready to give him his dispatch. 'Tis the custome in <hi>Bosphorus</hi> that suiters wooe openly at Table, where they declare their Quality, and to what fortunes they can bring those they desire to marry. It happened that there were many suitors then present, both Kings, and Kings sonnes; Among whom were <hi>Tigrapates,</hi> Prince of <hi>Themiscyra,</hi> and <hi>Adyrmachus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Maclyna,</hi> hand many others; every wooer having revealed himself, and showne upon what confidence he came thither a suiter, is to feast with the rest, and to sit silent. The Feast ended, he is to take a cuppe, and to powre wine on the Table, then to addresse himselfe to the Bride, and to enlarge his owne praises, by declaring his Pedigree, wealth, and power. Many having perform'd the Ceremony, and extoll'd their Dominions, &amp; estates, at last <hi>Arsacomas</hi> requesting the cup, spilt no wine (for we hold it reproachfull to the God to spill him) but taking it off at a draught, give me thy, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Mazaea,</hi> O King, said he, to wife, who for my riches, and possessions am much to be preferr'd before these; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at

                  <hi>Leucanor</hi> wondring, and knowing <hi>Arsacomas</hi> to be but a poore vulgar <hi>Scythian,</hi> ask't him, How many head of Cattle, and wagons have you, <hi>Arsacomas?</hi> for herein you <hi>Scythians</hi> are onely rich. I have, said he, neither waggons nor flocks; but I have two rare, and excellent friends, such as no <hi>Scythian</hi> hath besides, which raised their generall laughter, who contemned and thought him drunke. In the morning <hi>Adyrmachus</hi> was prefer'd before the rest, who shortly after purposed to carry his Bride into <hi>Maeotis</hi> to his <hi>Machlyans.</hi> At his returne <hi>Arsacomas</hi> reported to his two friends how dishonourably he was refused by the King, and laught at in the banquet for his poverty. Though, said he, I told him what great Treasures I had in you <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates,</hi> and <hi>Macentas,</hi> and in your friendship, which is much more pretious, and powerfull then all the <hi>Bosphoran</hi> forces, whereat he laught, and dispised us <hi>Scythians,</hi> and gave his daughter in marryage to <hi>Adyrmachus</hi> the <hi>Machlyan,</hi> for boasting himselfe to have ten golden Cuppes, eighty four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seated Chariots, besides sheep and oxen in abundance; preferring before valiant men heards of Cattle, wrought bowles, and massie Chariots.

I accept the division, ansvvered <hi>Lonchates</hi>; and do you, said he, <hi>Arsacomas</hi> in the meane time (for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize must in likelihood engage us in a vvarre) stay here, and raise vvhat Armes, Horses, and Forces you can:

Now our custome of the hide is this; when any man is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by another, and would redresse himselfe, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to wage warre, he sacrificeth an oxe, whose flesh he divides into parcels, and roasts it; then spreading the hide upon the ground, sits on it, holding his hands behind him, like those who are pinion'd. And this with us is the most passionate way of petitioning. Then the flesh of the oxe roasted being set to the publike accesse, his neere acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and whosoever else will, assemble to him, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every one a piece, and treading on the hide with their right foote, promise ayd according to their abilities; one to find five horse at his owne charge, another ten, another more, another as many Armed foote souldiers, as he can; and he that is poorest, himselfe: so that sometimes great troopes are gather'd to the hide, and an Army thus raised is of firmest combination, and as inviolable to the enemy, as if they were knit by Sacrament; for to tread upon the hide is with us an oath. Thus did <hi>Arsacomas</hi> order mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; to whom repair'd about five thousand horsemen, and promiscuously armed twenty thousand foot. <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates,</hi> in the mean time, passing unknowne into <hi>Bospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> got accesse to the King then busie in affaires of State; and told him that he came publikely sent by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> but that the greatnesse of his message requir'd to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in private.

And this I have commission to tell you from them. But from my owne private Intelligence I do informe you, that <hi>Arsacomas,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Mariantas,</hi> who was lately embassadour here, will shortly make a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion upon you, the cause, I guesse to be your refusall of him when he desired your daughter, which he takes as a dishonour, and hath already sate seaven dayes upon the hide; and contracted an Army not contemptible. I have heard, sayd <hi>Leucanor,</hi> that forces were assembled to the hide, but knew not that they were raised against us; or that <hi>Arsacomas</hi> ruled the expedition. Against thee, said <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates,</hi> is the preparation made. But <hi>Arsacomas</hi> is my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and takes resentment that our Elders should preferre mee before him; or that I should in all things eclipse his reputation; If therefore, Thou wilt contract thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daughter <hi>Barcetis</hi> to mee, who am not unworthy of the Alliance, ere long I will returne and bring thee his head. I do here promise said the King, exceedingly fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, knowing the cause of <hi>Arsacomas</hi> quarrell to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of his marriage. Besides, the <hi>Scythians</hi> had ever been dreadfull to him. Sweare, said <hi>Lonchates,</hi> to keepe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and never to deny them, which the King preparing to do, and being ready to sweare with his hands lift up to heaven, forbeare thus openly, Sir, said the other, lest some of the beholders make interpretations of your Oath. But let us enter into this Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> and shut the doores, that none may overheare you: for if the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation be made to <hi>Arsacomas,</hi> I feare, he will begin the warre with my sacrifice, being already fortified with no small Regiments. Let us enter, said the King; and keepe you distance, nor let any approach the Temple whom I shall not call. Being enter'd, and the guard farre removed,

                  <hi>Lonchates</hi> drew his Sagar, and stopping his mouth with the other hand to suppresse cryes, stabb'd him in the brest. Then cutting off his head, and carrying it under his cloacke, he went forth, making as if he spoke to him all the while, and saying he would presently come againe, as if he had beene sent by the King upon businesse. And so returning to the place where hee left his horse tyed, mounting he rode back into <hi>Scythia.</hi> But no pursuit was made after him, because 'twas long before the <hi>Bosphorans</hi> knew what was done; and when they knew they grew factious for the Kingdome. Thus accomplish't <hi>Lonchates</hi> his atchievment, and fulfilled his undertaking by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of <hi>Leucanors</hi> head to <hi>Arfacomas.

But the people, said he, call on you, <hi>Adyrmachus,</hi> being his sonne in Lavv, to accept the Crovvne; By vvay of Anticipation, therefore, things favouring you by their distraction, shovv your selfe unexpectedly, and assume the Empire. Let your vvife by Coach follovv after: vvhose presence, being <hi>Leucanors</hi> daughter, vvill give you a quick interest in the vulgar <hi>Bosphorans.</hi> As for me, I am both an Aliance, and of affinity to your vvife by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For <hi>Leucanor</hi> married <hi>Mastera</hi> from my Country: from vvhose brothers at <hi>Alania</hi> I am novv sent vvith commission to exhort you to make all hasty dispatch into <hi>Bosphorus</hi>; and not to suffer the Crovvne to fall on <hi>Eubia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Leucanors</hi> base brother, a long friend to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and disaffected to the <hi>Alanes.</hi> Thus said <hi>Macentes,</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling that people both in his habit, and speech. for there is onely this difference betvveene them, that the <hi>Alanes</hi> vveare not their haire so long as the <hi>Scythians</hi>; vvhich <hi>Macentes</hi> having nevvly cut, past easily undistinguish't, and gained credit to his disguise, under vvhich he vvas taken for <hi>Mastera's,</hi> and <hi>Mazaea's</hi> kinsman. And novv, said he, I am ready, <hi>Adyrmachus,</hi> as you please to command mee;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93795:99"/>
either to accompany you into <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> or to stay, and as occasion serves to conduct your wife. I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, replyed <hi>Adyrmachus,</hi> that being of her alliance you would convey my wife. For by accompanying mee into <hi>Bosphorus</hi> you shall but adde one horseman more to the Troope: but in conducting my wife you will serve in stead of many. Things thus resolved, he presently began his journey, and left <hi>Mazaea</hi> yet a virgin, to be brought after by <hi>Macentes</hi>; who by day carried her in a coach. But when night came, by designe with one of his servants, who followed him with horses, he set her on horse-back, and mounting himselfe, kept not any longer the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Moeotis,</hi> but turning aside to the Mediterranean, and leaving the <hi>Mitraean</hi> mountaines on his right hand, appeasing the young Lady the best hee could, in three dayes passage through the <hi>Machlyans,</hi> he arrived in <hi>Scythia</hi>: where his horse no sooner finish't his course, but after a short stand expired. But <hi>Mecentes</hi> delivering <hi>Mazaea</hi> to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacomas,</hi> Receive, said he, from mee my promise; and when the other much astonisht at the unhop't for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle prepared to thanke him: Forbeare, said <hi>Macentes,</hi> to make me any other then your selfe, For to acknowledge your selfe obliged to mee for what I have done, is as if my left hand should give thankes to the right, for curing it wounded, and affording it friendly attendance. Twere, then, most ridiculous in us, if after a long conjunction, wee, who as farre as 'tis possible became one, should put great values upon any thing adventurously atchieved by a part for the whole. Since being but a part, the good wrought for the whole, was wrought for the part too. Thus said <hi>Macentes</hi> to <hi>Arsacomas,</hi> preparing to give him thankes. But when <hi>Adyrmachus</hi> heard of the plot, he broke off his journey intended for <hi>Bosphorus</hi>; for there <hi>Eubiotus</hi> was Crowned, called home from <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> where hee sojourn'd, and returning to his Country rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

upon <hi>Scythia.</hi> Shortly after he was seconded by <hi>Eubiotus,</hi> who led a promiscuous Army of <hi>Greekes, Alanes,</hi> and choyce <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> consisting of 20000 of each, which joyned to <hi>Adyrmachus</hi> Troopes, made an Army of ninety Thousand; whereof the third part were Horse Archers: we on the contrary, (I bearing a share in the expedition, to which I with others assembled to the hide contributed an hundred well appointed horsemen) having gather'd a body, little lesse then thirty thousand, with our Cavalry attended their assault, having <hi>Arsacomas</hi> for our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. As they made their approach, we march't Counter, placeing our forces of Horse in front. After a long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine battle, we were put to the worst, and our Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons routed; And at last the <hi>Scythians</hi> being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two bodies, one part fled, as if apparently vanquish't, but in a kind of retreat, so as the <hi>Alanes</hi> durst not pursue them farre, but incircling the other part which was the weaker, with help of the <hi>Machlyans,</hi> made great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their showres of Darts, and Arrowes: so that our men thus besieged were very much distressed, and many of them threw away their Armes; in which number by chance were <hi>Lonchates,</hi> and <hi>Macentes</hi>; who more forward then others to put themselves upon dangers, were both wounded, <hi>Lonchates</hi> with a poyson'd dart which burnt his thigh, <hi>Macentes</hi> with a stroke of a Battle axe on the head, and a halberd on the shoulder, which when <hi>Arsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comas</hi> understood, who was then with us in the other part of the Army, holding it dishonourable not to relieve his friends, putting spurres to his horse, with loud cryes and his sword drawne he broke through the enemy, nor could the <hi>Machlyans</hi> resist his fury, but gave him passage.

Heare then what a friend of mine call'd <hi>Sisinnes</hi> did for mee. When I tooke my voyage for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> out of my desire to the <hi>Greeke</hi> education, I stroke in at <hi>Amastris,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Pontus,</hi> lying just in passage to those who saile from <hi>Scythia,</hi> and not farre distant from <hi>Carambe. Sisinnes</hi> bore mee company, my friend of a child. Here wee saw certaine Merchandizes brought into the Haven, which carrying ashore we bought, not suspecting any mischance. In the mean time, some theeves broke open our trunkes, and stole all we had, and left us not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93795:101"/>
enough to supply us for that day. At our returne from our Lodging, understanding what had happened, we thought it not fit to question the neighbours being many, or our Hoste, out of our feare to be taken for Braggarts, if wee should have complain'd that foure hundred Daricks, diverse suits of rich apparell, and hangings, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver else we had, had beene stolne from us. Wee consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore, what men thus impoverisht were to doe in a strange place my resolution was to kill my selfe, by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my sword, before I was cast upon base wayes of reliefe, either by thirst or famine. But <hi>Sisinnes</hi> by his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter counsels diverted mee from such a fact: And said hee had found a way to sustaine us. That day his gaines for carrying wood from the wharfe supplyed us with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. Next morning, as he walkt in the market place, hee saw (as he tells the story) a gallant show of stout young Gentlemen, who man by man were chosen for a prize set, to enter combate the third day following. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well instructed himselfe in the conditions, hee came to mee, and said, <hi>Toxaris,</hi> hereafter call not your selfe poore, for three dayes hence I will enrich you. Wee passing the time in miserable reliefes, at the day of the show came thither as spectators. Inviting mee abroad he carried me to the Theater, as to some delightfull spectacle of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> Having seated our selves, we saw first some wild beasts peirced with javelins, and hunted with dogges; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers let loose upon certaine men bound, whom wee guessed to be malefactors. When the combatants entred, the cryer produced a young man of vast size, saying, if any man will enter duell with this Champion, let him stand forth, and as the reward of the fight he shall receive ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Drachmes. <hi>Sisinnes</hi> presently rising up, leapt our, undertooke the combate, and required armes; and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the mony deliver'd it into my hands; saying, If I overcome, <hi>Toxaris,</hi> when we depart this shall be our <hi>via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum.</hi> If I be slaine, bury mee, and returne to <hi>Scythia.</hi> The
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93795:101"/>
words drew sighs from wee, whilst hee taking the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, put it all on but the helmet, and fought bare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the first encounter he was wounded with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verst blow in the hamme; at which much blood issued, which halfe slew mee with feare; but hee stoutly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his adversaries assaults, ran him through the brest, whereupon hee fell presently at his feet. And hee faint with his wound was forced to sit downe upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; so neere was he expiration. I running to him, rais'd him, and gave him heart. And after hee was declared victor, tooke him upon my backe, and carried him home: where he lay a while under cure, but is now recover'd, and lives in <hi>Scythia,</hi> marryed to my sister, onely he is still lame of his wound.

One night as they lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an upper chamber, and were all asleepe, a great fire happen'd, which shut them in, and surrounded the house. At which <hi>Abauchas</hi> awaking, left his children crying, and thrusting away his wife, who cleaved to him, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her save her selfe, taking his friend upon his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he carryed him downe, and broke with him through the flame untoucht. His wife bearing the little infant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved, and bid her daughter follovv her, but halfe burnt she vvas constrained to cast the child from her armes, and yet hardly so escap't the flame; her daughter also

After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when one objected to <hi>Abauchas,</hi> that he betray'd his wife, and children, and saved <hi>Gyndanes,</hi> 'Twill not be hard for mee, said hee, to beget more children; besides 'tis doubtfull how they will prove: but it must be a long time before I can find such another friend as <hi>Gyndanes</hi>; of whose affection I had so many tryalls.

               <p>VVHat Custome is this among you, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon?</hi> some of your young men mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally closing, trip up one anothers heeles; others take their companion by the Throat, and tosse him; others tumble, and rowle themselves in the mire like swine. But first I observed that unclothing themselves they shave and annoint one another very peaceably; and presently, I know not upon what quarrell, they fall to pushing, and to dash foreheads like rammes. Looke, yonder one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lift his fellow up by the thighs, hurles him to the ground, and falling on him, suffers him not to rise, but drawes him into a puddle, and screwing his legges up to his belly, and infolding his neck with his arme almost stifles him; another beats him on the backe; requesting him, I suppose, not to be chok't; nor care they to loose their oyle, or to be fullied; but bemiring, bedaubing, and putting themselves into a great sweat, make mee sport, like so many Eeles slipping away betweene the holders fingers. In like manner, others here in the Court yard, rowle not themselves in puddle, but in the deep sand, and tumble together into a pit, where like so many cocks they bedust one another, to hinder dis-imbracements, I suppose, &amp; to avoyd slipperynesse; and by drying his body, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his hold on his adversary. Others, keeping posture, and dusted all over, beat and kick one another. See how
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93795:103"/>
yonder poore wretch sprinkled with sand bleeds with a blow on the face, and is ready to spit out his teeth; nor doth their Captaine (for so I guesse him by his purple) offer to part them, or compose the quarrell, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them, and praises the striker: others, farre off, with much speed seeme to runne races, yet keepe the same place, and kicke up their heeles into the ayre. I would, therefore, know to what end they doe thus. For to mee these agitations seeme plaine madnesse; nor shall any man easily perswade mee that they, who do thus, are not distracted.</p>

But censure fairely, I pray, These are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of distraction; nor doe they beat, or rowle in the mire, or besprinkle one another with dust out of quarrell, but out of a delightfull necessity, to encrease the strength, and vigour of their bodies: nor doubt I but, when you have stay'd a while in <hi>Greece,</hi> you will be one of those who tumble in the mire, and sand, and will take both pleasure and profit in the exercise.</p>

For Apples, then, and Parslye, they toyle, and endanger themselves, thrusting and beating one another: nor, though they should long, may they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much contention eate Apples, or be crown'd with Parslye, or Pine; unlesse they bedaube their faces with mire, or receive kicks in the belly from their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.</p>

And, therefore, they who seeke Reputation from their dangers, thinke it honourable to be kickt.

               <p>You are still unexperienced in our Customes: ere long you will change your opinion, when you have beene once at our Games, and there see a numberlesse multitude gather'd, to the spectacle, the Theatre fill'd with thousands, the exercisers shouted, and the Conquerour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd to the Gods.</p>

               <speaker>Anachar:</speaker>
               <p>This makes their case the more deplorable, <hi>Solon,</hi> not to suffer such indignities before a few, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many spectatours, and witnesses of their affronts, who pronounce them not happy till they see them stream with blood, or throttled by their Antagonists. And this you call the felicity of their conquest. But among us <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> if any strike a Cittizen, or justle him out of the way, or tare his garment, the Elders fine him very deeply, though the injury were offer'd but in the presence of few, and not in such publique Theatres as <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and <hi>Olympia.</hi> Nor doe I onely pitty your exercisers for their sufferings, but your spectators; who, you say, being of great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, resort from all places to the show. For I cannot but wonder that they should neglect their serious affaires, and find leasure for vanities. Nor can I understand how it can be a spectacle of pleasure to them, to see men strucke, and beaten, and throvvne downe, and trampled by one another.</p>

For no man by my descriptions can so instill the pleasure of those sights, as when you your selfe making one of the spectators, behold mens valour, the goodlinesse of their persons, their admirable dexterity, prodigious skill, invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible strength, courage, emulation, unavoidable sleights, and indefatigable desire of victory, which I know you would incessantly praise, shout, and clap.</p>

Of all the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> therefore, and forreiners, I chose you by your fame for my acquaintance, after I heard you were a giver of Lawes, and an inventer of excellent customes, and an introducer of usefull institutions, and fashioner of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. You cannot therefore, more desire to teach, and to make mee your Scholer, then I shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, without eating or drinking, to sit as long as you

               <p>To give you a just account in a briefe narration were not easie. You shall, therefore, by degrees and steps, know what opinions wee hold of the Gods, of our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of marryage, and other things; As also what wee decree of our young men, and how wee breed them, when they they once begin to know what is best; and arrive at such a strength of body as to endure labours. All which I will unfold to you, that you may be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, why wee set them those Games, and compell them to exercise their bodies; not meerly for the Games fake, or the glory of the prize (for few attaine to it) but for a farre more excellent good, which hereby growes to the whole Commonwealth, and to themselves in particular. For there is a more publique prize, and crowne proposed to all good Cittizens, not made of Pine, or wild Olive, or Parsly, but which comprehends the common hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of men; namely, the private liberty of every one, and publique of the State; besides riches, glory, fruition of solemne Assemblies, security of friends, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Blessings else men would aske in their prayers of the Gods. All which are woven into the Garland, I spoke of, and accompany that prize, to which those exercis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Why then, most venerable <hi>Solon,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of such value, did you tell mee of Apples, and Pars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and boughs of wild Olive, and Pine?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Solon.</speaker>
               <p>Even these, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> will not be of slight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to you after you understand what I am about to say. For these have the same purpose, and end, and are but lesser portions of that ample and happy reward, and Garland I mentioned. But my discourse, hath, I know not how, broke order, to begin with things done in the <hi>Isthmian, Olympick,</hi> and <hi>Nemean</hi> Games, I, therefore, since my leisure and your patience meet; will dravv things

If you please, therefore, let us withdraw into yonder shade, where wee may sit undisturb'd with the noyse of the exercisers. For (not to dissemble) I am impatient of the scorching Sun-beames striking on my bare head, and left my cap at home, that I might not be the onely man seene among you in a forraine Habit. Besides, now is the time of the yeare that the scorching starre, which you call the Dogge, raignes, and burnes all things, and renders the Ayre sultry and enflamed; The Sun also now at noone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verticall, casts an insupportable raye on our bodies. So that I wonder, you being an old man, do not, like me swet, nor appeare molested with the heat, nor looke about for some cool place to retire to, but patiently brook the season.</p>

               <p>Those foolish exercises, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> and frequent tumblings in the mire, and open contentions in the Sands do harden, and fortifie us against the Sunne; nor need we cappes to protect our heads from his beames. But let us withdraw. I expect not you should consent or bind your whole faith to every thing I speake as Law, but when you think I speak amisse presently to contradict, and rectifie my discourse. For in one of those two I will not faile, either to make you of my opinion, if you meet with nothing to be contradicted, or learne from you how erroneously I have beene the author of those customes; For which the whole Citty of <hi>Athens</hi> will give you ample thankes. Nor can you more oblige them then by disciplining, and instilling righter opinions into mee. which I will not conceale, but will presently make them publique, and standing in open Assembly thus bespeake the Citty. I, O yee <hi>Athenians,</hi> have heretofore written
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93795:106"/>
Lawes, which I thought most necessary for the State, But this stranger (pointing at you, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi>) being by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a <hi>Scythian,</hi> yet a wise man, hath otherwise instructed mee, and taught mee better principles, and institutions. Let him, therefore, be registred your Benefactor, and erect his brasen statue among the persons most of honour in the Citty, neere <hi>Minerva.</hi> Hereupon assure your selfe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharsis,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> will not be ashamed to be taught better rules by a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and a stranger.</p>

               <speaker>Anachars.</speaker>
               <p>I heard as much before of you <hi>Athenians,</hi> that you were great scoffers: For how should I, being a rude, wandring man, living in a waggon, and travailing from one Country to another, who never inhabited, or till now saw a Citty, discourse of policy, or teach men borne and bred in an ancient State; where for so many successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they have lived under the best forme of government? especially you, <hi>Solon,</hi> whose study, they say, it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beene to lay the best foundations of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and to know under what Lawes it would most flourish? 'Tis fit, therefore, your Authority, being a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, should sway mee. And, therefore, if I oppose you, where you seeme not to speake reason, it shall be that I may be the firmlier instructed. See we are now sheltred in this Arbour from the Sunne; this coole marble also of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us a pleasant, and seasonable seat. Begin your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course then, and say, why you breed your children to those hard labours; or how puddles, and exercise can make them gallant men; or how dust, and tumblings in the mire can advance their vertues. This I first desire to know: you shall informe mee of other particulars in their place and order. Remember I pray withall in the structure of your narration that you speake to a <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>; which I tell you, that you may neither involve, nor prolong your discourse. For I shall be apt to forget the beginning, if your narration be too much lengthened.</p>

when you find mee darke in my expressions, or digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the purpose. It shall, therefore, be in your power to aske what questions by the way, and to cut off what superfluities, you please. But where I am pertinent, and rove not from the marke, you must give mee leave to be copious; and to observe the practice of my Country, allow'd of even by the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> where matters of the highest nature are decided. For in that Court the Judges being entred, and placed, to determine of murthers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wounds, and conflagrations, Liberty is given both for the accuser, and the accused to speake by turnes, either themselves, or by their Advocates, retain'd to plead for them: who, as long as they speake to the businesse, are heard with silence of the Senate. But if any shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by a preface to render the Judges favourable, or to draw pitty, or powerfulnesse to his cause, (which are the ordinary arts of young Oratours) presently a Cryer stands forth, and enjoynes him silence, and suffers him not to trifle before the Senate, or to colour the businesse with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, but to present it naked to them. So I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute you, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> of my present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and give you power to heare mee according to the Lawes of my Court; and where you find mee over Rhetoricall to silence mee; but where I speake agreeable to the businesse to suffer mee to enlarge my selfe. For wee hold not Dialogue now in the heat of the Sunne; And therefore let mee not seeme tedious, if I prolong my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, since wee are now in the thicke shade, and are both vacant.</p>

               <p>First, then, you are briefly to marke how wee define a Citty, and Cittizens. Wee take not a Citty for the buildings, such as are the Walls, Temples, and houses: For these are but, as it were, a constant immoveable body for the receipt, and safety of the Inhabitants. All Authority is seated in the Cittizens; who fill, order, perfect, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the other, as the soule doth every one of us. Vpon these considerations wee extend our cares, as you may observe to the Body of the Citty, which we adorne to the utmost show of magnificence, with elegant structures within, and secured with the strongest Rampires, and Fortifications without. But the chiefest part of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is, that the Cittizens may have vertuous minds, and strong bodies: whereby being enabled for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they may be mutually usefull to themselves in peace, and defend the Citty, and preserve it free, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in warre. Their first education, therefore, wee assigne to their Mothers, Nurses, and Schoolmasters, to breed them to the Liberall Arts. But when they are growne up to understand what vertue is, and when modesty, bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, reverence, and desire of the best things is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, and when their bodies, by patient exercises, are confirmed, and strengthened, and brought to a manly consistency, then wee teach, and propose to them other knowledges of the mind, and exercises of the body: which wee accustome and inure to other labours. For wee thinke it not enough to be borne, as wee are, with bodies, and soules; but are to perfect both with Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and sciences: by which naturall endovvments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to order, are much advanced, and defects are beautified, and corrected. Wee take our patternes from husbandmen, vvho vvhen their plants are lovv and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cover, and digge about them, to protect them from the vvinde; But vvhen they are vvell grovvne, they cut off the supersfluous boughs, and exposing them to be tost, and shaken by the vvindes, render them the more fruitfull.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93795:107"/>
The first elements of our childrens education are, musicke, Arithmeticke, how to forme letters, and exactly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them. Afterwards, we repeat to them the sayings of wise men, ancient exployts, and usefull discourses made illustrious by verse, that they may the better be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. They hearing the deeds, and memorable Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of famous men, are insensibly inflamed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to an imitation, that they may be celebrated, and admired by posterity. Of which nature are many things deliver'd by our <hi>Hesiod,</hi> and <hi>Homer.</hi> When they are ripe for government, and are ready to be call'd to the handling of publique Affaires— but this is besides the purpose. For I intended not at first to show how wee manured their minds, but why wee thus imployed, and exercised their bodyes. I doe, therefore, enjoyne my selfe silence, without the reprehension of a cryer, or such an <hi>Areopagite</hi> as you, who out of modesty, I believe, have all this while heard mee trifle beside the purpose.</p>

               <p>Herein I am constant to my first purpose; For should I suffer my discourse to wander from the scope, I should confound your memory by my digressions: yet I will give you as briefe a draught as I can of those also. For an exact description of them, would require a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular discourse. First, then, wee lay in our childrens minds excellent sentences; Afterwards wee teach them the Common Lawes, which in capitall Letters are openly hung up to be read; commanding what is to be done,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93795:108"/>
and what to be avoided; That the company of good men is to be used, from whom they may learn to speak what is fit; to observe justice in an equality of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; not to covet things dishonest, but to desire honest; and not to offer injuries. Now these men are with us stiled <hi>Sophists,</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi>: we bring them, also, into the Theater, where wee publikely teach them by the virtues and vices of former ages presented in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moedies, and Tragoedies, which they are to shunne, which to embrace; we give liberty, also, to our Comick Poets to personate, and inveigh against those Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whose lives are infamous, and disgracefull to the Commonwealth; whereupon some grow reformed by Libells, and forsake their faults which would hereby fall under the reprehension of the vulgar.</p>

               <p>I understand you, <hi>Solon</hi>; your Tragoedians, and Comoedians were those who wore Socks, and Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and were changeably apparell'd, and adorn'd with golden fillets, having on their faces ridiculous, wide ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vizards; under which they spea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which time, if I erre not, you celebrated your feasts of <hi>Bacchus</hi> Your Comoedians were not so exalted, were lower shod, and spake in a lesser tone, and more like men; only their vizards were more ridiculous, and rays'd the generall Laughter of the Theater. But those Buskin'd Actors were heard with a generall sadnesse, out of pitty, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to the vveights, and Cloggs of their feet.</p>

               <p>'Twas not pitty to them, Sir; but the Poet, perhaps, represented some ancient, calamitous story, which cast into Tragicall language, and action, moved the Teares of the spectators, and hearers. 'Tis likely, also, you saw Fidlers, and Singers placed together in a Ring; neither are their voices, and cornets, void of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table use; but by such and the like incitements, we whet, and sharpen, and better our soules. As for our bodies,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93795:108"/>
which you next desire to hear, we thus discipline them, when they are once compact, and past their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; First, by going naked sometimes we expose them to the Ayre, and so acquaint them with all seasons, as neither to dissolve with heat, or shrink with cold. Next, we annoynt and supple them with oyle, to make them the more active and pliant. For 'twere unreasonable that dead hides, and Leather softned by Oyle, and tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, should be lesse capable of ruptures, and last longer, and that we should think such Oyntments lost upon ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated bodies. Next, we invent exercises of severall kinds, to which we assigne severall Teachers; one for Fencing, another for Wrastling. That, being accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to such exercises, we may both know how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our selves from blowes, and not shunne wounds through Cowardlinesse. Two great advantages do hence arise; our young men, by not sparing their bodies are made valia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t against dangers; and possesse a firme consistency of health, and strength. For those that wrastle, do thereby learn to fall safely, and to rise nimbly, to cast off, imbrace, tosse, strangle, and lift their adversary aloft. These, then, are not exercises to be neglected, whose chiefe and great end, which they infallibly attain, is, that bodies thus exercised gain higher patiences, and vigour. Their next end, not inferiour to the other, is, that hereby our young men may be experienced against the necessities, and Accidents of Warre. For 'tis clear, that a souldier by his skill in wrastling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will more easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow his enemy, or being overthrown rise again himself. All these personated combates, then, we referre to that greater of the Warre; out of our opinion, that men thus practiced are fittest for Armes, whose naked bodies we have first by Oyntments, and labours, confirmed, and fortified, and thereby made agile, and dextrous, and offensive to their encounterers. For you may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what those men would do in Armour, who can
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93795:109"/>
naked strike a terrour into the enemy; when they see bodies neither overburden'd with white unsupportable flesh; nor pine'd with leanesse, and palenesse; like the bodies of Women, which withering in the shade, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and flow with sweat, and pant under a helmet; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Sunne, as now it doth, shine hot at Noone. For what service can they be fit, who are impatient of thirst, and dust, and faint at the sight of bloud, and expire before they come within shot, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of the enemy? Whereas our men, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their naturall rednesse by the Sunne into a brown, show manly countenances, great Heights of spirit, and flames of valour. Being by the goodnesse of their composition, neither too grosse, nor too thinne, nor overclogged with weight, but wrought into a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by their sweats, by which they evaporate the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse superfluities of their flesh, and retaine only that which gives strength and vigour, without mixture of defects. For the like effects which winnowers have upon Corne, have those exercises on our bodies; they blow away the Chaffe, and husks, from which they separate the pure graines, and gather them into heapes. Hence comes it, that we are so sound, and so able to endure long Labours; Or that one thus bred, is so hardly provok't to sweat, and so rarely cast into a Distemper: As if one should set fire to Wheat, Straw, and Stubble, (for I return to my former comparison) I suppose the Stubble would presently be consumed, but the Corne would by degrees, without any great pyramids of flame, not at one blaze, but by insensible clouds of smoke after sometime be it selfe burnt; so neither diseases, nor wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse invading a body thus exercised will easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble, or overcome it; Being so well prepared within, and so impregnably fortifyed against them without, as, to withstand their entrance and to encounter heats and colds without dammage of the person. For by those
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93795:109"/>
Laborious exercises, much heat being taken in, and of a long time provided, and laid up, as it were, for necessary use, it administers sudden supplies, and renders the body indefatigable. For these praelabours, and Toyles, do not destroy the courage, but encrease, and enlarge it by provocation; we breed our young men to races also, and enable them by custome to hold out in long courses, and by their speed, and activity in short. Nor do we allow them to runne on firme, equall ground, but in deep sand, where they can neither fix, nor fasten their feet, but are ready to slippe at every stride. We teach them, also, if need be, to leap Trenches, and other places of hinderance; which they practise to do with leaden weights in their hands. Sometimes, also, they strive who shall hurle a Spear farthest. You have seen, also, another brazen weight in the place of exercise, round, and made in the figure of a little shield, having neither handle, nor string; which you poysed as it lay in the mid'st, and it felt massy, and hardly to be taken hold of by reason of the smoothnesse. This they sometimes fling aloft into the Ayre; sometimes straight forward, striving who shall hurle farthest, and outthrow the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which kind of exercise doth much strengthen their shoulders, and beget a vigorous spring in their Armes. Hear now, venerable Sir, why they exercise in the mire, and sand, which to you, at first, seemed ridiculous. The first reason is, that they may not be thrown on the hard pavement, but may fall softly without hurt; The next reason is, because their slipperinesse by their sweating in the mire is much increased, which you compared to Eeles; but 'tis no matter of contempt, or laughter: For hereby their strength and vigour is not a little perfected, when thus besmeared they are forced to take stronger hold of one another to hinder escapes: For you must not think it easy to hold fast one bemired, sweating, sleekt with oyle, and strugling to slip from your fingers.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93795:110"/>
All which slights do much conduce to warre; whither a wounded friend be without impediment to be fetcht off, or an enemy taken prisoner to be borne away. Upon these considerations, we exceedingly exercise them, to the most difficult labours, that they may the more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously undergoe the easier. We practice them in the dust for a contrary reason, that they may not slip from their entwinings. For being inured in the puddle to grasp their adversary, for all his sleeknesse, they learn to slippe out of his hands themselves when they seem caught: Now dust sprinkled on distilling bodies, drinks up the sweat, and much enables them not to tire. 'Tis a kind of crust to them too, and protects them from the wind striking on their tender, and naked flesh. Besides, it scoures off the filth, and makes the man much cleanlier. Should I, then, bring in presence together one of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate pale men, who alwaies live in the shade, and one of those, whomsoever you shall choose, exercised in the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> and washt from his Dust, and mire, I would ask to which you would choose to be like. I know you would presently at first sight, though unacquainted with the education of either, choose to be strong, and solide, then to be of a broken, and melting constitution, and pale with the poverty, and retirement of your bloud to the inward parts. These are the exercises, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> to which we breed our young men; whereby, we think, we enable them to defend their countrey, to secure us in our liberty, and vanquish our invaders, and make us ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to our neighbours; who for the most part are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to us, and pay us tribute. In times of peace our use of them is no lesse excellent, between whom spring no base aemulations. Nor have they leisure to be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but spend their whole time, and imployment in these exercises. Now (as I said before) The common good, and highest felicity of a state consists in the best preparation of youth, both for Peace, and Warre, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93795:110"/>
is only to be effected by Studies of this excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <p>So then <hi>Solon,</hi> when you are invaded, you meet your enemies in your Oyntments, and dust, and encounter their Armour with your hands, and fists; who in the mean time struck with terrour fly from you, fearing, least if they should gape, you should cast sand into their mouth; or coming behind them should trippe up their heeles, or twine their legges about their middle, and your Arme about their neck and stifle them? And though they shoot Arrowes and hurle Darts at you, yet you, like so many Statues are impenetrable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tainn'd in the sunne, and stored with so much bloud. For you are not men of straw, or stubble, to yield at the first onset; but are hardly brought to loose bloud, though pierrced with deep and mortall wounds. For so you said, if I mistake not your resemblance. Or, perhaps, when you goe out to battle, you Arme your selves like Comedians, and Tragedians, and put on gaping vizards, that you may appear terrible, and like so many Goblins to your enemies; and wear high buskins, which, if you have occasion to flie, are light; And if you pursue your foes, are unavoidable, bringing you so fast upon them. But consider, I pray, whither these fine slights, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, be not frivolous, and childish, and the exercises only of young men, void of better imployment, and given to sloth. For if your ayme be to be free, and happy, you should prescribe true, and reall exercises, and such as are practised in Warre. Where the Combate is not in jest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Companions, but against enemies; with whom they are to fight, with danger exercising their valour. Laying aside your dust, and your oyle, therefore, teach your young men the use of their Bow, and Pike; nor accustome them to slight darts, which are carried away by the wind; but to massy speares, which sing and whistle in their discharge; To stones also which fill their hands.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93795:111"/>
Let them wear also a Sagar on their side, a shield in their left hand, a Brest-plate also, and Helmet. For as you now are, you appear to me saved by the favour of some God, who have not all this while perisht by the incursion of any slight invaders. For put the case, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheathing this short Sword, which I wear at my girdle, should singly set upon all your young men; doubtlesse I should raise a generall shriek, and take the School, or put them to flight, none daring to look back upon my weapon, but standing behind statues, and hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves behind pillars, they would by their teares, and affrigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then should you see their bodies no longer red, as now they are, but they would presently wax pale, and discoloured with fear; For a long peace hath so soften'd you, that you cannot resolutely endure the sight of one plume in an enemies Crest.</p>

But in the mean time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any imminent danger you commit the bodies of your young men to mutuall beatings; who weaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by sweat, not forced by necessity, but vainly spend their courage in the mire and dust.</p>

But herein you are mistaken. For the more courage is drawn forth by Labours, the more it overflowes. Like the fable which you have heard of <hi>Hydra:</hi> who having one head cut off, was presently supplyed with two. 'Tis true, a body ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally unpracticed, and feeble, and wanting sufficient naturall matter, is presently tyred, and consumed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, as we see in fire, and Tapers; with the same breath you kindle the one, and in an instant blow it into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flame; but extinguish the other, not having compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent strength of matter to encounter your blast, or a strong root to sustaine it self.</p>

Nor are they, as I said before, small revvards to be cried up by the Spectators, and held the most honourable, to be pointed at by passengers, and voiced the most valiant among equalls. Many of the beholders, therefore, vvhose age is not past exercise, depart not a little enamour'd vvith their vertue, and Labours. Should any man, then, banish the thirst of Glory from common life, vvhat mark should vve have to our desires, or vvho vvould covet to performe any high Action? From hence you may conjecture hovv they vvould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themelves in Warre, armed for the defence of their Countrey, Children, Wives, and Temples, who naked for a wreath of wild Olive, or Apples, are enflamed with such a serious desire of victory. How would you be affected, should you see our Quayle, and Cockfigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and our solemne studies of them? perhaps, you would laugh; especially if you knew that our Custome were built upon a Law, which commands all of docile Age to be present; and to behold the Fowles contend
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93795:112"/>
to their utmost rigour. But 'tis no argument for Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For hereby an insensible contempt of Dangers steales into their soules, who mean not to appear more dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, or cowardly, then Cocks. And are hence taught, not to yield to wounds, wearinesse, or other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties whatsoever. Now to make the like trialls of them in Armes, and to behold their mutuall slaughters, were savage, and inhumane. 'Twere great improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence also to destroy those valiant men, whose courages would be better imployed against an enemy. Because, then, you resolve, <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> to see other parts of Greece, pray remember when you arrive at <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> that you laugh not at them also; nor think them vainly busied, when met together in the Theater at Ball you see them strike one another: or assembled in a place surrounded with water, and divided into Battalions, naked, as they are, they make a formall Warre upon one another, till one side, namely the <hi>Lycurgians,</hi> drive the other, namely the <hi>Herculeans</hi> out of the Island, or force them backward into the mote, whereupon followes peace, and no man is afterwards struck; especially when you see them whipt at an Altar, and streaming with bloud, their Fathers and Mothers standing by, not at all moved with the Spectacle, but threatning them if they shrink under their stripes, and intreating them to hold out to their utmost patience, and to take courage from their sufferings. Hence many die under the scourge, disdaining to faint in the presence of their familiars, as long as they have life, or to favour their bodies. To whose honours you shall see statues publickly erected by the <hi>Spartans.</hi> When, therefore, you see this done; think them not madde, or that they thus discipline their Children without just cause, because no Tyrant is feared, or enemy neer. For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will give you very good reasons, why he instituted such cruell customes, being neither enemy, nor carried by his hatred, to the unprofitable destruction of the youth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93795:113"/>
of the state, but desirous to render these, who were to defend their Country, stout, and of courage above their sufferings. Or suppose <hi>Lycurgus</hi> should say nothing, yet you your selfe know well, that none such taken in warre, did amidst the tortures of the enemy, ever discover any secret of the <hi>Spartanes</hi>; But smiled when they were rackt, and strived with their Tormentors who should be first tired.</p>

            <head>A Discourse of sorrowing for the Dead.</head>
            <p>'TIs worthy the Observation, what many, in their sorrow do, and say; and what is said by those that comfort them; how they account some accidents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, both to those that mourn, and to those that are mourned. When (by <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proserpina</hi>) they not at all understand, whither they be evill, and deplorable, or gratefull, and desireable to the sufferers; but make fashion and custome, the rule of their grief. For when any body dies, this is their manner. But first, I will tell you what opinions they hold of Death. Whereby it shall appear upon what grounds they are thus superfluous. The greater part of people, whom the wise call <hi>Idiots,</hi> building their faith upon <hi>Homer, Hesiod,</hi> and other Fablers, and making their Poetry their Law, imagine a certain deep place, or hell under ground, large, spacious, darke, and sunlesse; yet so lightsome in appearance, as to represent to them every thing there. In this vault (as one of them
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93795:114"/>
told me the story) raignes <hi>Iupiters</hi> brother, call'd <hi>Pluto</hi>; honour'd with that stile from the store of Ghosts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is enricht; whose forme of Commonwealth, and the life of soules infernall is thus ordered. It fell to him by Division, and Lot, to rule over the Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, as he receives, he binds in unavoidable Chaines; and permits none to return, but some few once in an Age, upon weighty reasons. Through his Countrey run Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, great, and terrible from their very Names, called <hi>Cocytus,</hi> and <hi>Phlegeton,</hi> and the like. And what is yet worse, the entrance to it is the Lake of <hi>Acheron</hi>: which first receives all Commers, and is not to be past, or sayled over without a Ferryman; being for depth not to be waded, and for breadth not to be swumme over. In a word, the Ghosts of Fowles departed cannot fly over it. In the Descent, seated in a Gate of Adamant, sits <hi>Aeacus,</hi> the Kings Cousin German, who commands the passage. Neere him lieth a dogge with three heads, of great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; who on Arrivers casts a gentle, and peacefull eye; but barkes at those who endeavour to escape, and frights them back into their Dungeon. Those that are wafted over the Lake are received into a spacious meddow, set with Daffodills; through which glides a stream enemy to remembrance, and for that reason called <hi>Lethe.</hi> For these are the relations of them, who have anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from thence; <hi>Alcestis,</hi> and <hi>Protesilaus,</hi> two Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians; <hi>Theseus</hi> also, the Sonne of <hi>Aegeus</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Homers Vlysses</hi>; very reverend and credible witnesses: who sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk not of the forgetfull Spring, for then they had not remembred such descriptions. <hi>Pluto,</hi> then, and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serpina,</hi> as they report, raigne there, and have the whole Dominion of the place. Though they have many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and Ministers of state, as Furies, Punishments, Horrours, and <hi>Mercury,</hi> (who is not constantly resident) under-rulers also, and Peeres, &amp; two Judges, <hi>Minos,</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> both of Creet, and Sonnes of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93795:114"/>
when a Competent number of good men, &amp; just, who have lived a life of vertue, are arrived, send them like a Colony into the Elysian fields, there to live a life of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But wicked men they deliver to the Furies, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the region of Malefactours, there to be punish't according to their offences. In which place what mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do they not suffer? tortur'd and burnt, and gnawne by Vultures, and tost upon wheeles, and forced to roll relapsing stones against steep hills. <hi>Tantalus</hi> stands in a Lake, yet is wretchedly in danger to dye with thirst. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a middle kind of life (of which there are store) wander in a meddow without bodies, being meere shades, which touch't vanish like smoake. These are nourisht by our sacrifices, and oblations powred on their graves. So that he who hath no friend, or Allye left on earth, wanders among them famisht, and starved. These dreames have made such strong impressions in some, that when one of their friends dyes, first they put a fare in his mouth, which hee is to give the Ferry-man for his wafrage. And do not first consider whether the money be currant, and will passe below; or whether with Ghosts, an <hi>Attick,</hi> or <hi>Macedonian,</hi> or <hi>Aegina</hi> coyne beare most value; or whether it were not much better to have no fare at all to give. For so being refused by the Ferry-man, he may be sent back, and returne to life againe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, they wash him, (as if the Infernall marrish were not B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th enough for those that come thither) and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balme his body with rich oyntments, for the expulsion of ill smells; then crowning him with Orient flowers, they lay him out gloriously apparrelled; lest, perhaps he should take cold by the way, or be seene naked of <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>; Then follow the howlings of women, teares of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, percussion of brests, tearing of haire, cheekes bloudyed, garments rent, and heads sprinkled with dust. So that the living are more to be pittied then the dead. For they many times roll themselves on the floore, and dash
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93795:115"/>
their heads against the ground, whilst the other, adorn'd and trimm'd, and gloriously crown'd, lyes aloft, and sublimed, like one drest for a triumph. Lastly, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and father, surrounded with their kindred, goe before him, to whom turning sometimes (you must imagine him to be some gallant young man, for the greater solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the play) they utter abortive, senslesse sounds, to which the dead party would make answer, were he able to speake. For his father, drawing out every word vvith interruptions, and sighes, thus bespeakes him. My deare sonne, thou art lost, dead, and before thy time snatcht from mee; leaving mee alone, solitary vvretch: Thou vvast nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married, nor hadst children, not practised to the Camp, or plough, or arrived to thy old age; never more, my child, shalt thou feast, be amorous, or drunke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vvith thy companions. Such and the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints he povvres forth, out of an opinion that his sonne after death needs, and desires such things, but is denyed the fruition. But vvhy mention I such trifles? Hovv ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, vvho at such funeralls doe sacrifice his horses, concubines, and butlers, and burne, and bury his robes, and cloathes of ornament, vvith the deceased party, as if hee vvere to use, or enjoy them belovv? Novv the old man, vvho thus laments, speakes not this, and much more, nor is thus tragicall vvith reflection on his son, (For hee knovves he cannot heare him, though hee should cry as loud as <hi>Stentor</hi>) or on himselfe, for then his bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard thought, and contemplation, vvere sufficient vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a voyce. For no man needs to be clamorous to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. It remaines, then, that he acts this distemper for the spectators sakes, since he neither knovves vvhat hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne his sonne, nor vvhere he is, nor vvell examined the course and state of his life. For, then, he could not reckon his departure hence among calamities. Well, therefore, might his son, having obtained leave of <hi>Aeacus,</hi> and hell, to raise his head a while out from his dungeon, for the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93795:115"/>
quieting of his distracted father, say thus to him, Forlorne man, what meane thy clamours? Why dost thou trouble mee? cease to teare thy haire, and to rent thy face. Why art thou so injurious to call mee miserable, and unfortunate, who am much better, and happier then thou? Is it, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou, any calamity to mee, that I am not arrived at thy decrepit age, or have not a bald head, wrinkled face, crumpt backe, and slack knees, or am not wither'd, and decay'd by so many <hi>Triacades,</hi> and <hi>Olympiades</hi> of time, or betray not my follies before so many witnesses? Fond man, What canst thou call desirable in life, which wee shall not afterwards enjoy? perchance thou wilt say deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious potations, feasts, rich garments, and the pleasures of <hi>Venus</hi>; whose denials thou fearest are my misfortunes. Dost thou not understand how much better 'tis not to thirst, then to drinke? or not to be hungry, then to eate? or not to be cold, then richly cloathed? Since, then, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee ignorant, I will truly teach thee how to grieve. Begin thy Lamentations againe, and say, My wretched child, never more shalt thou thirst, never more shalt thou hunger, never more shalt thou freeze. Thou art lost, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy boy, and hast escaped diseases, needest not hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feare feavers, enemies, or Tyrants: Love shall no more torment, nor venery tempt thee; nor shalt thou twice or thrice a day consume thy selfe. O calamity! Thou shalt not be scorn'd, when thou art old, nor thy sight be thought troublesome to young men. Shouldest thou, O my father, say thus, would not these complaints seeme much truer, and more ridiculous then the other? Be not, therefore, troubled at the consideration of our night, and great darknesse; nor imagine mee stifled when I am shut up in my tombe. But thinke rather, that my eyes being perisht, and burnt (if yet you have burnt mee) need nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darknesse, nor light to see by. But suppose your owne private complaints reasonable, how am I better'd by your howlings, or by so many brests, as it were musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93795:116"/>
strucke, or by the immoderate Lamentations of so many women? why doe you lay a stone strowed with Garlands on my grave? or to what end do you powre wine upon mee? Do you thinke 'twill distill to us, and soke through to Hell? As for your funerall sacrifices, you your selves, I suppose, plainly see that the most pretious part, which is intended for us, is carried up in smoke to heaven, and profits not us below. Nothing remaines but dust altogether unusefull, unlesse you thinke wee can eate Ashes. <hi>Pluto's</hi> Kingdome is not so barren, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, nor are we so voyd of Daffodils, as to translate your meales hither. I sweare, therefore, by <hi>Tisiphone,</hi> I have had a longing desire to exclaime against your Actions, and speeches, but was hindred by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sheet, and wooll wherewith you stopt my utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: He made an end, and then death clos'd his eyes. But for <hi>Iove's</hi> sake tell mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should one departed returne, and leaning on his elbow speak thus, would you not think he spoke reason? yet these senslesse people do both howle themselves, and hire some Sophister, whose trade is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; who mustering up many old calamities, is imploy'd as the leader, and captaine of the franticke so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie; and where he begins, they follow, and make up the ridiculous consort. Their lamentations have all one manner of folly; But severall Nations have severall manners of funerall. The <hi>Greekes</hi> burne their dead; the <hi>Persians</hi> bury them; the <hi>Indians</hi> anoint them with Lard; the <hi>Scythians</hi> eate them; the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> salt and powder them: where I have seene a dead body well dryed, and season'd set at meale, and made a guest. Nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall with an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> when he lacks mony to supply his wants, to pawne his father, or brother for a time. For as for tombes, Pyramides, Pillars, and fading Epitaphs, are they not superfluous, and childish? Others ordaine funerall Games, and make Orations at Sepulchers. As if they pleaded, or gave testimonials of their dead friends to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93795:116"/>
the infernall Judges. After all comes in the funerall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; to which are invited the deceased persons friends, who comfort his parents, and perswade them to eate. To which they are not unwillingly compell'd, having felt the famine of three dayes before. How long, say they, will you bewayle your deare losse? Trouble not his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Ghost any longer with your complaints. Or if you be obstinately resolved to mourne, you are therefore not to starve your selfe, that you may be able to hold out with the greatnesse of your sorrow. Then for a Conclusion, they all repeat these two verses of <hi>Homer</hi>;
<q>
                  <l>For bright hayr'd <hi>Niobe</hi> remembred meat:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And,

                  <l>The Hungry <hi>Greekes</hi> banisht their cares with meat.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon they fall to; but bashfully at first, out of their feare, after the death of their dearest friends, to betray any humane disturbance. Many things more ridiculous then these may hee observe, who markes what is done at mournings, since most people thinke death the greatest of evills.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Gauls</hi> in their Language call <hi>Hercules Ogmius,</hi> and paint the God in a strange figure; extreamly old, and decrepit, bald before, his haire, which remaines, white, his skinne wrinkled, and burnt into a deep tawnie, like aged saylers: you would take him for <hi>Charon,</hi> or some Infernall <hi>Iapetus</hi>; and would guesse him to be any thing sooner then <hi>Hercules.</hi> Yet in this unlikely shape he weares the ensignes of <hi>Hercules;</hi> a Lyons skinne about his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93795:117"/>
A massie clubbe in his right hand; a quiver at his backe, and a bent bow in his left hand, like an out-right <hi>Hercules.</hi> I thought at first they had drawne him thus preposterous out of contempt of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Gods; and by this uncouth picture meant to take revenge of him, for his ancient entrance into their Country, and the prey's he tooke, when in search of <hi>Geryons</hi> heards, he over-ran ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny westerne Nations. But I have not yet told you the greatest paradoxe of the picture. This aged <hi>Hercules</hi> drawes a vast multitude of people tyed by the eares with chaines, which are slender wires, made of gold, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, like to our most orient bracelets. Yet though they be captived by such feeble threds, they neither labour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, though they easily might, nor offer to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, nor hang back, or struggle with their leader, but follow him with pleased, cheerfull, and applauding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances; all striving to make haste, and slacking the cords out of their desire of prevention, and expressing some unwillingnesse to be releast. It shall not be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to mee to describe to you what to mee seemed most absurd. The painter, wanting a place where to fasten the ends of his wires, having fill'd his right hand with a clubbe, his left with a bow, bored a hole through the tip of his tongue, at which hee drew them linkt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the God turning himselfe, and smiling on them. Lord stood I fixt in the contemplation, wonder, doubt, and indignation of the peece. till a certaine <hi>Gaul,</hi> who stood neere mee, not ignorant of our learning, as hee well show'd by his exact pronuntiation of <hi>Greeke,</hi> whereby I tooke him to be some Philosopher of that Country, said, Stranger, I will unriddle the picture to you; for it seemes to have cast you into a deep astonishment. Wee <hi>Gauls</hi> doe not, like you <hi>Grecians,</hi> ascribe eloquence to <hi>Mercury,</hi> but to <hi>Hercules</hi>; who was much the stronger. Nor let it be your wonder that you see him painted old, since eloquence of all things else showes its power most in age. If your Poëts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93795:117"/>
say true: that,
<q>
                  <l>In younger minds do mists and clouds arise,</l>
                  <l>But the discourses of old age are wise.</l>
               </q>
Thus hony was said to drop from your <hi>Nestor's</hi> tongue; and the <hi>Trojan</hi> Oratours to utter fragrant flowers; that is, if I mistake not, to speake in a musicall voyce. Nor are you to marvaile that this old <hi>Hercules,</hi> the embleme of eloquence, drawes men tyed by the eares to his tongue, knowing the neare Alliance betweene them. Nor ought it to be his reproach, that you see his tongue bored; for I have learned, said hee, from your Comedies, which I yet remember;
<q>
                  <l>That men, in speaking verst,</l>
                  <l>Have tongues bore'd through, and pierc't.</l>

            </p>
            <p>Briefly, wee hold that <hi>Hercules</hi> perform'd all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by Rhetoricke; and being a wise man, subdued Countries meerly by his perswasions: whose darts were sharpe, well aymed, quick speeches, which pierced the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus said the <hi>Gaul.</hi> Whereupon I walking off, considerd with my selfe, whether it would become a man of my yeares, who had long since abandoned the profession, againe to submit my selfe to the judgement of so many censurers: when opportunely the remembrance of the picture gave mee encouragement. For till then I was jealous, lest you should thinke my course of life childish, and too youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for my Age; or lest some Schoole-boy should apply that piece of <hi>Homer</hi> to mee, and say,

               <p>
                  <hi>Adimantus</hi> the <hi>Myrrhinusian</hi> came with us too, but is lost in the Crowde of spectators, I know not how. Hee accompanyed us to the shippe, &amp; ascended with us. for if I mistake not, you <hi>Samippus</hi> went before, <hi>Adimantus</hi> followed you, and him, holding him with both my handes, Till he barefoote guided mee shodde up the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then I saw him no more either in the ship, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after our descent.</p>

               <speaker>Samippus.</speaker>
               <p>Doe you not remember, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> that he left us when the handsome boy arrayd in pure white, whose haire equally divided on his forehead was tyed behind, came forth of the Cabbin? If I know <hi>Adimantus</hi> well, at sight of the faire spectacle hee bid farewell to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> Ship-wright, who showed us the Roomes, and after his old fashion stood still, and wept: for his amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nature makes him very prone to teares.</p>

               <p>Methought, <hi>Samippus,</hi> the boy was not so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishingly handsome, as to cast <hi>Adimantus</hi> into an astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who is courted at <hi>Athens</hi> by so many young men, beautifull, nobly borne, fluent of speech, practiced in Games, and to whom teares are no disparagement. For besides the swarthinesse of his complexion, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent lippes, small legges, a loose, continued, running speech, which was <hi>Greeke,</hi> indeed, but pronounced after the manner of his Country, in an ill sound, and Tone. His haire, and locks woven behind, show'd him to bee a slave.</p>

               <p>Rather let us goe on. For 'tis likely he is past by, and return'd into the Citty after he could not finde us. If hee be not, he knowes the way; nor if we leave him behind is there danger of his losse.</p>

               <p>You have my consent, if the Schoole of exercise be yet open. But among other Discourses, doe you remember what large Descriptions the wright made of his shippe? which hee said was an hundred and twenty Cubits in length, the fourth part of that in bredth; from the Decke to the lowest Bottome, where the pumpe stands, twenty nine cubitts. Hee told us also the length of the mast, the greatnesse of the yard it bore, and the vastnesse of the cable whereto 'twas fastned. How the Sterne rising in an insensible bent had a golden goose for an ensigne, and the forcastle equally promiment, and standing out at the other end bore on each side the Goddess <hi>Isis</hi>; who gave name to the <hi>Carricke.</hi> The other trimmings, pictures, flame colourd sayles, Anchors, Capstalls, Rudders, and Cabbins next the Sterne, much provok't my admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Then the multitude of saylers, which might be compared to an Army. Then 'twas said to carry as much corne as would serve all the Inhabitants of <hi>Attica</hi> a yeare for food. And all this prodigious bulke is ruled by a litle dwarfish old man, who steeres and wields it with
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93795:119"/>

I knovv by my ovvne experience, and presage by those Ilands the roughnesse of that Coast, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially made tempestuous by the South, and South vvest vvindes. For there the <hi>Pamphilian</hi> Sea dividing from the <hi>Lycian,</hi> and the floods meeting severall vvayes, and breaking themselves against the <hi>Promontory,</hi> vvhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of sharpe, broken rockes, made craggy by the vvaves, svvell into terrible billovves, vvhich make a dismall roare, and rise sometimes above the height of their steepe rockes. Hither, hee said, they vvere driven in a darke night. At length the Gods, compassionate to their cryes, revealed a fire to them from <hi>Lycia,</hi> by vvhich they knevv the place. For a starre, one of the tvvins, sate upon their top-saile, and by a left hand course directed the vessell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Sea, just ready to dash against the steepe cliffe. From thence, having once strayed from their right course, sayling through the Arches, the seventieth day after their departure from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by Easterly side vvinds they vvere yesterday driven into the <hi>Pyraeum</hi>; and cast

               <p>No such matter, Sir, But I was shaping to my selfe great fortunes, which others, perhaps, stile empty happinesse; and when I was in the height of my wealth, and pleasures you awoke mee.</p>

               <p>Assoon then, as we were ascended the ship, &amp;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93795:120"/>
I had safely got you up, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> you all forsooke mee, and left mee measuring the greatnesse of the Anchor; I never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse tooke a survey of all things, and askt one of the Marriners, what revenue the shippe might one yeare with another bring the master of it: who said in the least com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation twelve Atticke Talents. At my returne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thus discourst with my selfe. Would some God make this shippe mine, how happy should I bee? being enabled to obliege my friends, to sayle sometimes my selfe, sometimes to send forth my servants? with the twelve Talents would I build a Pallace of the best situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a little beyond the painted pallace by <hi>Ilissus,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake my fathers house; I would buy servants also, rich apparell, coaches, and horses. In this speculation mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I sayl'd, was proclaymed happy by those in the shippe, reverenced by the saylers, and almost thought a Prince; when as I was setting things in order in the ship, and beholding the port a farre off, you, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> Wrackt my whole treasure, and overwhelmed my Burke, carryed by the prosperous gales of my Imagination and wishes.</p>

When not long since wee row'd over to <hi>Aegina</hi> in a small boat, and gave groats a piece for our fare, you disdain'd not our company in the passage; yet now you scorne to admit us, and threaten to draw up the ladder: you are growne haughty, <hi>Adimantus,</hi> and have forgot your selfe; nor know what Master of a shippe you are, but are exalted with your pallace built in the most eminent place of the Citty, and with the multitude of your followers.

Since then there is a good space to the Citty, let us divide the way into foure parts, and assigning every man his reach, let us severally put up our vvishes to the Gods.

be saluted, and petitioned by my friends, reverenced &amp; adored of all: some should every morning early walke up and downe before my doore, among which I would especially have <hi>Cleaenetus,</hi> and <hi>Democrates.</hi> At whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, and offers to enter, seven barbarous, biggboned porters should clappe the Gate in their face, as they doe now to others. When I pleased to submit my selfe, like the Sun to bee seen, upon some I would not vouchafe to dart a looke. But to a poor man, or such a one as I was before, bee affable, bid him wash, and come to supper. Rich men should hang themselves when they saw my Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otts, Horses, beautifull Pages, to the number of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, fairliest chosen out of all ages. Then my meales ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in gold plate, (for Silver is base and below mee) my sawces, and oyles from <hi>Spaine,</hi> my wines from <hi>Italy</hi>; my hony native, and untryed; my provision, as pigges, hares, and variety of fowles, from all places; my Pheasants from <hi>Colchis,</hi> Peacocks from <hi>India,</hi> Turkies from <hi>Numidia.</hi> Then, my purveyours of all those should bee Sophisters, well studyed in Luxury and Sauces. When I take the bowle to drinke to any body, Hee who pledged mee should beare away the Cup. They who are now rich, compared to mee should be so many <hi>Irus's,</hi> and beggars. <hi>Dionicus</hi> should no more in ostentation show his silver Dishes, and Goblets, seeing my Groomes imploy as much silver in daily use. My expenses upon the Citty should be these. Upon a Cittizen I would monthly bestow an hundred Drachmes; upon a Sojourner fifty: for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ornament I would build Theaters, and Bathes; and bring the Sea as farre as <hi>Dipylum,</hi> where I would make a Haven, and to which I would cut a passage large enough for my shippe to sayle in, and to be seene from the <hi>Kera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke.</hi> As for you, my friends, I would command My Steward to measure to <hi>Samippus</hi> twenty bushels of stampt gold.

But you were hurt in a Duel, and were cast into feares, and anxietyes night and day; And were not only surrounded with Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from your enemyes, but with a thousand Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93795:126"/>
Treasons: Besides the envy, hatred, and flatteryes of those with whom you convers't. Among whom you had not a true friend, but all their affections were dissembled, and acted; out of hope, or feare. The fruition of your very dreames was not pleasant. Only you had Glory, purple garments, embroyder'd with Gold, a white fillett about your head, and a guard to goe before you. The rest is toyle insupportable, joyn'd with much anguish. For you are to entertaine Embassadours from the enemy, or to sit in judicature, or to publish Edicts to your Subjects. Then some Nation rebels; or some Forrayne invasions are made upon your Empire. So that your feares, and suspicions are perpetuall. And you appeare happier to all men then to your selfe. Can that condition be noble, wherein you feele the same sicknesse as peasants doe? nor doth a feaver distinguish you as a King; nor death feare your Guards; but making what accesses to you, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, carries you away lamenting, without any reverence to your Crowne? Whilest you falling from your height, and snatcht from your Throne, and going the common way of men, and made equall to the vulgar, by being lost among the heard of the departed, leave behind you upon earth onely a high Tombe, or exalted Pillar, or Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramide rising in equall angles, as so many late, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible honours. The Statues, and Temples, which flattering Citties raise to you, your great name also perish all by degrees, and dye neglected. Or if they be of any long continuance, what fruition can they afford to one sencelesse of them? You see, then, what feares, perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and toyles befall you alive; and what shall befall you after death. 'Tis now your turne to wish, <hi>Timolaus,</hi> see you aske discreetlyer then these two; as it becomes a prudent man, and one acquainted with affaires.</p>

               <p>Judge you, then, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> what is faulty in my wish, and what to be corrected. I desire not gold, or Treasure, or sacks of Coyne, or Kingdomes, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93795:126"/>
Warres, and Affrights of Empire, which you deservedly rejected. For all these things are unstable, and fraught with Treasons, and carry with them more trouble then delight. But I would aske of <hi>Mercury</hi> certaine Rings of those severall vertues. The first should keepe mee in a firme consistency, and health of body; invulnerable, also, and free from distempers. The next should make the wearer invisible, like that of <hi>Gyges.</hi> I would have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which should instill into mee the strength of ten thousand men, and enable mee single to carry a weight scarce to be lifted by an Army. I would have another Ring, which should enable mee to fly aloft from the ground. I would also charme as many as I pleased asleep. Doores also at my approach should voluntarily open, the lockes flie backe, and the bolts fall off; and this to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with one Ring. But above all I would have one more powerfull then the rest, which worne, should make mee amiable to handsome Boyes, Women, and whole Nations, and should so enamour, and enflame them, and make mee so desirable, as to be their discourse. Women impatient of their desires should hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and boyes grow madde, and account him happy, on whom I vouchsafe to looke: And they whom I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected should pine away with griefe. Briefly, It should render mee more beautifull then <hi>Hyacinthus,</hi> or <hi>Hylas,</hi> or the <hi>Chian Phaon.</hi> And thus would I be not for a short time, or according to the measure of the life of man, but a thousand yeares, renewing my youth after youth, and still returning to the age of seventeene; and casting off my decayes like serpents. In this state I will lacke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Whatsoever others possesse shall be mine, by my power to open doores, lay the Keepers asleepe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invisible. If there be any thing in the Easterne, or Northerne parts of the World, of strange, and unusuall spectacle, or if there be any thing pretious, or pleasant to be eaten, or drunke, I would, without sending for them,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93795:127"/>
my selfe fly thither, and enjoy them to a satiety. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Griffin is a winged beast, and the Phoenix a fowle to be seene in <hi>India,</hi> and no where else, I would behold them there. I would also discover the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the uninhabited parts of the earth, and the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> if there be any such, who inhabit the adverse Hemisphaere of the world. Next, I would know the nature of the Starres, of the Moone, and Sun himselfe, being prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secur'd from their fires. But my greatest delight should be in the same day to report at <hi>Babylon</hi> who vanquisht at <hi>Olympia.</hi> And if, perhaps, I dine in <hi>Syria,</hi> to suppe in <hi>Italy.</hi> Then if I had an enemy, to take an invisible revenge of him, and dash out his braines with a stone. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to bestow secret courtesies on my friends, and showre gold on them in their sleepes. If there were a proud man, or a rich disdainfull Tyrant, I would take him up some twenty furlongs, and then precipitate him. Then, without controule might I converse with faire boyes, and make invisible approaches, by laying all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe but they onely. What a spectacle wee it to hoyer aloft in the Ayre, above all shafts, and there looke downe upon two Armies fighting? And if I listed to joyne my selfe to the weaker side, and by charming the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to bestow victory on the flyers, and recall them from their flight. In a word, the whole life of men should be my recreation; All things should be mine, and others should take mee for a God. And this is the height of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which can neither fade, nor be betrayed, especially being accompanied with health, and long life. What can you blame, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> in my wish?</p>

Againe, tell mee, why one Ring may not suffice you, but that you must weare so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and burden every finger of your left hand, nay with the over number charge the right hand too?

Hee, I say, hath introduced his whole Linage upon us, and is the Leader of a Morris, and hath declared <hi>Pan,</hi> and <hi>Silenus,</hi> and certaine wild, savage Satyres, and Goat like men, given to dancing, and of monstrous shapes, for Gods. Of which one hath hornes, and in halfe his body downward resembles a Goate, and weares just such a long beard.

Nor are wee to wonder if mortall men despise us, when they behold such ridiculous mishapen Gods. I forbeare to tell you, how hee hath brought up

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93795:130"/>
or Nature, or Fate. For that you your selfe heare such words in the disputations of Philosophers, I doubt not, unlesse you be deafe, and cannot heare their wranglings. I have much more to say, but vvill here set my Period. For I see some troubled at my discourse, others hisse; Especially those vvho have beene toucht by my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For a conclusion, therefore, if you please, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> I vvill read the Decree, lately made for redresse of those grievances.</p>

               <p>AT a councell, lawfully assembled, the seventh day of this present month, <hi>Iupiter</hi> was chiefe, <hi>Neptune</hi> President, <hi>Apollo</hi> Assistant, <hi>Momus</hi> scribe by Night, and sleepe pronounc't this sentence. Whereas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forraigners, not <hi>Greekes</hi> onely, but also <hi>Barbarians,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of this State, and Society, have regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred themselves, I know not how, and taken upon them to be Gods, and fill'd Heaven, so that our meetings are crowded with the tumultuous confluence of a diverse languaged rout, and our <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> spent, and raised to a <hi>Mina</hi> the quart by reason of the multitude of drinkers: and whereas most immodestly they displace the Ancient, and true Gods, and contrary to the Lawes of this Country, claime the highest seats here, and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Adoration on Earth: It seemes good to the Councell, and present assembly, that the next winter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, a Parliament be called in <hi>Olympus</hi>; and there seven Gods be joyn'd in a Committee for the examination of usurpations, of which three to be of the old house under

                  <hi>Saturne,</hi> and foure or the twelve; of which <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be one. Next, they who sit in Commission to be Legally sworne by <hi>Styx</hi>; and Herauld <hi>Mercury,</hi> to summon all those who are to appeare in the Synod; and they to bring sworne witnesses, and proofes of their descent, and to come forth one by one.

Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers to bee admonisht that they fayne not new names, nor trifle about things they know not. They who have beene falsly honoured with Temples and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, to have their images demolisht, and the Statue of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Iuno,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or some other Legitimate Gods to be erected.

               <p>IUst so as they who were confounded at the sight of the <hi>Gorgons</hi> head, was I lately astonisht at the sight of a beautifull woman; and almost accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht the fable, by being changed from a man into a stone, and congealed by the wonder.</p>

               <p>By <hi>Hercules</hi> 'twas a supernaturall, and very powerfull spectacle, if a woman did stupifie <hi>Lycinus.</hi> You frequently suffer such Trances at the sight of handsome Boyes; and 'tis much easier to remove <hi>Sipylus,</hi> then to draw you from their contemplation: so gazingly fixt are you, and many times ready to dissolve in teares like <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> daughter. But pray tell mee, what petrifying <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusa</hi> is this, and from whence, that I may also see her?

               <p>Know, then, that if you but see her through a Casement, shee will presently strike you dumbe, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you more immoveable then a statue.

and secretly left in the Temple, to his power committed with the Statue? but more of this some other time. Since, then, you have seene her (as you say) answer mee to this question. Have you observed <hi>Alcamenes</hi> Statue in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at <hi>Athens?</hi>

               <p>These, indeed, are his best. Nor shall I neede more Artificers: take now severall parts from all these, and proportion them as well as you can, and I will show you all their excellencies collected in one feature.</p>

               <p>The picture, then, which I will present to to your view, shall be of this composition.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93795:133"/>
grace of countenance, as <hi>Praxiteles</hi> hath fancyed them. Then the breasts, and fore parts shall be taken from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenes,</hi> and his <hi>Venus</hi> in the garden; as also the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her hands, the Arithmeticall junctures of her wrists, and the decent slendernesse of her fingers, ending in a beautifull sharpe; the Ayre of the whole face, the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the cheekes, and measure of the nose shall be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from <hi>Lemnia</hi> and <hi>Phidias,</hi> who shall also bestow the composure of the mouth and his <hi>Amazons</hi> necke. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandra,</hi> and <hi>Calamis</hi> shall adorne it with modesty; with which shall be mingled a soft, unperceiveable simper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to a smile.

               <speaker>Lycinus.</speaker>
               <p>Hitherto my discription hath beene rude; and to all this, my friend, you are to joyne colour, and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; that those parts which are blacke be exactly black, and those which are white, be execllently white; and those which are redde do out-blush the role. So that the danger is, since the greatest perfection is yet wanting, from what paternes we shall derive it. Shall wee call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our assistance the rarest paynters, to help us to mingle colours, and teach us how to give them fit order, and disposition? Bee it so; let us recall <hi>Polygnotus, Euphranor, Apelles,</hi> and <hi>Aetion</hi>; and let them divide the worke. Let <hi>Euphranor</hi> paynt the hayre, as he hath drawne <hi>Iuno's.</hi> Let <hi>Polygnotus</hi> limbe two decent eye-browes, and such flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheekes, as he hath given to <hi>Cassandra</hi> in the Quire at <hi>Delphos</hi>; let him also shape the garments so subtlely, that part may sit close, the rest may hang loose, and appeare
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93795:133"/>
blowne by the winde. Let <hi>Apelles</hi> draw the rest of the body by <hi>Pacata,</hi> on which let him not lay over much white, but make it temperately sanguine. Let <hi>Aetion</hi> draw such lippes, as he hath given to <hi>Roxana;</hi> but above all, Let <hi>Homer,</hi> the best of Painters, be joyned in assistance with <hi>Apelles,</hi> and let the whole body weare that colour which he hath layd upon <hi>Menelaus</hi> thighs, Ivory dipt in Scarlet. Let him also frame the eyes, and make them Oxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; to which let the <hi>Thebane</hi> Poet joyne his Pencill, and draw the liddes. Then let <hi>Homer</hi> adde a sweete cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, shoulders of snow, rosie fingers, and make her fitter to be compared to his golden <hi>Venus,</hi> then <hi>Briseus</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And so much be taken from the most learned Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries, Painters, and Poets. But the Grace, or rather all the Graces, and <hi>Cupids,</hi> collected in one Circle of beauty, arising from this composition what Language can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse?</p>

               <p>Trust mee you have decipher'd as divine a piece, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> as if dropt from <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or made by some Celestiall Artificer. How was shee busied when you saw her?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lycinus.</speaker>
               <p>Shee held a Booke in her hands, roll'd into two parts; one of which shee seemed to have read, and then to read the other. Onely betweene pawses shee discoursed some thing to one of her women, which came not to my knowledge, because her voyce came not to my hearing. But vvhen shee smiled, <hi>Polystratus,</hi> she betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tvvo rovves of teeth, so vvhite, so even, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to one another, that if you have seene a rope of Orient, and equally sized pearle, just in such order they grew. Onely they tooke a fresh lustre from the Crimson of her lippes, through which they shined like <hi>Homer's</hi> polisht Ivory. None were broader, or higher, or more prominent then others, as you see in most women, but were of one equall ranke, colour, and bignesse, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually order'd in their rowes. Briefly she was a great

               <p>You then, seeing this Lady but once in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, like a flash of lightning, have hitherto praised only her vulgar perfections, I meane, her body, and outward fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The perfections of her soule are invisible, nor could you know how much more excellent, and divine, her inward beauties are then her corporeall. But I doe, who am of her acquaintance, and have often mingled discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with her, and am of the same Country. For I have (as you well know) ever praised sweetnesse of carriage, and affability, and height of spirit, and wisdome, and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before beauty, as endowments much worthier to be prefer'd before those of the body. For 'twere most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and ridiculous to admire the garment above the wearer. The most perfect beauty, then, (if I may judge) is, when the vertue of the minde concurres with the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able shape of the body. I can show you some of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent features, who are staynes to their creation; In whom the onely thing praise-worthy dyes, and withers, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misht, and disgraced by its desertlesse conjunction, to so foule a Mistresse as their soule. Such women to mee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Temples, where the outward structure

is glorious, magnificent, and adorn'd with pretious stones, gold, and carvings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if you shall search for the Deity within, you shall finde an Ape, or Storke, or Goate, or Cat. 'Twere easie to give you many such examples. Forme, and shape, therefore, are not enough, where the true, and just dressings are wanting. I do not meane rich garments, and jewels, but those better dressings before mentioned, of vertue, discretion, equall behaviour, affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the rest comprehended under these.</p>

I shall need assistance too to my Draught, not of Statuaries, or Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but of Philosophers, to whose receipts my figure is to be conformed, and fashioned, according to the ancient Imagery. Thus, then, I begin. First, her speech is vocall, and cleare, and flowes sweet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every word is pronounced with most delicate Accent, neither too base, or manly, nor yet too treble, effeminate, or loose; but like the utterance of an unripe boy, pleasant, tunefull, and gently stealing into the sense: so that when shee cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es to speake, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine melody, and relique of her voyce remaines, and playes about the eare; like a soft eccho, which prolongs the hearing, and leaves certaine delicious footsteps of language, full of perswasion in the Soule. When shee sings her best, especially to the Lute, then 'tis time for Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons, and Swannes to be silent. For all things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musicall, compared to her; <hi>Pandions</hi> daughter harsh, and artlesse, with all the variety of her voyce. Had <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Amphion,</hi> who lead their hearers, and drew things
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93795:135"/>
void of sense to their harmony, heare her, they had, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, forsaken their harpes and stood her silent Listners. For whence should that <hi>Thracian,</hi> or the other, who fed a heard on <hi>Cytheron,</hi> have the skill so to touch a harpe, as to observe the exact proportions of Harmony, not to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse number, but by seasonable risings, and falls, to give measure to the lessons, then the harpe to bear consort with the voyce, and the quill to keepe time with the tongue, to which are to be added the right stroke of the fingers, and flexibility of the joynts? It, therefore, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> you ever heare her sing, you will no more undergoe the transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of a Gorgon, and passe from man to stone; but will feele raptures like those of the Sirens, whilest a sweet charme creeping over your sense, takes from you the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of your Country and acquaintance. And though you seale your eares, yet the sound will insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate through the waxe. Such is the musicke of a <hi>Terpsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chore,</hi> or a <hi>Calliope,</hi> and such is the skill of a <hi>Melpomene,</hi>

Though this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of her voyce, being purely <hi>Ionicke,</hi> with which in her familiar discourses she mingles much of the <hi>Atticke</hi> elegancy, be the least thing to be admired in her; since 'tis hereditary, and descended to her from her Ancestors; nor could shee well doe otherwise, having in her travels converst with the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Nor doe I wonder that she delights in Poetry, and is well studied in that way, spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Homer's</hi> Citty.

You are to pardon mee, If I cannot show an Archetype to this portrayture; Since in all the Monuments of the Ancient Literature, none such is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. If you thinke fit, therefore, let this piece of her be layd up as sacred; being, in my judgement, spotlesse, and without blemish.</p>

               <p>I am, next, to decipher the Image of her wisedome, and understanding.

in businesse, sharpnesse in affaires politicke, and for the edge, and piercingnesse of her judgement, will I in the most exact resemblance transferre from <hi>Miletum</hi> to my picture: only here will be the difference, she is drawn in a narrow Tablet, this Image will take up the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a <hi>Colossus.</hi>

               <p>That though both portraitures be equall in resemblance, yet they are not in magnitude. Nor did the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonwealth then carry any neere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Romane</hi> Greatnesse now. Though, then, they agree in similitude, yet this excells in largenesse, as being drawne in a more spatious Table. To these adde wee, for a second, and a third example, <hi>Theano,</hi> and the <hi>Lesbian</hi> Poetresse, and <hi>Diotima. Theano</hi> shall conferre height of mind; <hi>Sappho</hi> Courtlinesse of Behaviour; shee shall resemble <hi>Diotima</hi> not onely for those vertues extold by <hi>Socrates,</hi> but for her other discreet endowments too: and so <hi>Lycinus,</hi> you have one part more of her picture.</p>

               <speaker>Lycinus.</speaker>
               <p>By <hi>Iupiter, Polystratus,</hi> most admirably limbd. Pray describe her other perfections, namely, her sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Nature, and affability, the manner how she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth her pitty, and relieves the distrest.</p>

Next, fancy to your selfe the <hi>Idea</hi> of modesty, and discretion in Behaviour, and in both she answers <hi>Homer's</hi> Character of <hi>Icarius</hi> daughter. For just such a description hath he made of <hi>Penelope,</hi> as I have, for the agreement of their names, made of <hi>Abrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> wife before mentioned.</p>

               <p>Your peece, <hi>Polystratus,</hi> is every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, nor can you easily finde more patterns, having past through all parts of the soule, and commendation.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Not all. Her greatest praises are yet behinde.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93795:136"/>
I meane, that in the eminent height of honour in which she is, she is not blowne up by her prosperity, nor puft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond humane measure by her confidence in fortune; but observes a moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of carriage which is neither haughty nor burdensome; receives those who make their Adresse with a popular, and equall sweetnesse, affording both her hand, and familiarity. For persons of Quality by so much the more winne upon their Approachers, by how much being advanced above them, they are not tragicall, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their deportment. And, therefore, they onely who show their power not in pride, but benefits, are most worthy of the goods of fortune, and most easily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd envy. For none will repine at his happinesse, whom they see temperate amidst his felicities, and not like <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Ate,</hi> stalking on the heads of men, and trampling inferiours. A carriage not unusuall in men of base spirits, though the mis-apprehension of their fortune. By which, beyond their hopes, being suddenly advanced, and placed in a sublime, and winged chariot, they keepe not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their measure, or looke downe, but straine to fly aloft, till at length, like <hi>Icarus,</hi> their waxe melts, and feathers droppe off, and they, to the laughter of the beholders, fall headlong into the sea, and floud. But they who, like <hi>Daedalus,</hi> imploy not their wings to too lofty flights, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring they are joyned with waxe, but observe a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane course, and love to carry themselves not too high from the water, rather choosing to wet their feathers, then betray them to the Sun, fly in a safe, and secure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. As this Lady, who cannot be sufficiently praised, did: who receives this reward of her vertues, to have all men wish that she may alwayes be upon this height of the wing, and that all good things may streame to her.</p>

               <p>So be it, <hi>Polystratus</hi>; since her merits arise not onely from her bodily gifts, which are equall to <hi>Helen,</hi> but she is much more faire, and lovely in the qualities of her minde. It becomes also so great a King, and withall
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93795:137"/>
so serene, and gentle, among his other felicities to have the happinesse to have so brave a woman borne in his Empire, joyn'd to him in marriage, and to love him. For that woman can be no vulgar blessing, of whom the speech of <hi>Homer</hi> may properly be pronounced, that <hi>shee may contend with</hi> Venus <hi>for beauty, and with</hi> Minerva <hi>for parts.</hi> For the woman cannot be assigned, with whom she may be compared, for shape, for wit, for minde, for artifice, as <hi>Homer</hi> hath it.</p>

               <p>I Am sensible, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> sayes the Lady, of your great respects, and the honour you designe mee in your writings. For no man would have so over praised mee, but one who wrote with affection. But the thing which I would have you know is this. In my disposition I am not taken with Flatterers, but such men seeme to mee Impostors, and slaves by nature. So that when any man heaps Panegyricks on mee, and swells my praises into troublesome, immoderate Hyperboles, I presently blush, and am ready to stop my eares, and take his commendations rather for mockeries, then just Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93795:137"/>
For praises are no farther tolerable, then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son praysed knowes them to be due. All excesse is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and fawning. I know many, sayes she, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to heare themselves commended, and to have their defects supplyed by flatteries. As, if they be old, to have one extoll their vigour; if they be deformed, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for beauty before <hi>Nireus,</hi> and <hi>Phaon.</hi> Supposing they alter shape from their praises, and waxe young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as <hi>Pelias</hi> believed. But they are deceived. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were so pretious as Panegyricke, if Hyperboles could bestow whatsoever they commend. Methinkes, therefore, sayd shee, their case is much like his, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally ill-favoured should weare a beautifull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: and then grow proud of his borrowed lookes, though they be ready to drop off, and be disorder'd upon every encounter; and thereupon to expose him to the more laughter, when hee returnes to his owne face, and appeares vvithout his veyle. Or, as if a dvvarfe vvearing buskins should contend in stature vvith one a cubit higher. Hereto shee joyn'd an example. There vvas, sayd she, a great Lady, of competent feature, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse, but low, and very short of just stature, praised by a Poet, in songe, among other perfections for her beauty, and tallnesse, who compared her for length and straightnesse to a poplar tree; she was much tickled, and clapt her hands, as if shee had received new stature from the verses: which the Poet, seeing her so joy'd with false praises) often repeated to her. Till a stander by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spering him in the eare, said, forbeare, Sir, lest you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Lady she is growne taller. A story like this, but much more ridiculous, shee reported of <hi>Stratonice</hi> the wife of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who proposed a talent for the reward of that Poet who most elegantly praised her hayre; though shee were bald, and had but few haires left: yet bald as she was, and publiquely known to have been so of a long time, by reason of a disease; shee found some wretched
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93795:138"/>
Poets, who call'd her her hayres <hi>Hyacinthine,</hi> and wove them into curl'd tresses, and compared the thinner spaces to Lovedge. Shee, therefore, laughs at all such who thus expose themselves to flatterers. Shee added moreover, that many love to be thus flatter'd, and deceived, not onely in language, but in pictures too: and, therefore, choose those painters, who will draw them best featured. For there are some, sayes shee, who charge the painter to dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>semble their nose, to adde blacknesse to their eyes, and whatever else they desire; Hence they are not drawne, but do honour to other pictures nothing like them. These and the like were her expressions. Many things in your description shee likes, but resents one passage where you resemble her to <hi>Iuno,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Such comparisons, shee sayes, are much too high for her, or any mortall creature. Nor will shee allow you to take <hi>Idea</hi> from such Heroicke women as <hi>Penelope, Arete,</hi> and <hi>Theano,</hi> much lesse from the most excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent Goddesses. For she sayes, she beares a sacred horrour, and a superstitious reverence to all thinges concerning the Gods. And feares she should be like <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opeia,</hi> should she admit such prayses; though she stood only in comparison with sea <hi>Nymphes,</hi> and adored <hi>Iuno</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> She, therefore, bids you, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> either alter such expressions, or shee will call the Goddesses to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse you wrote without her allowance. She would have you, also, know, that shee is much troubled your booke should be made so publique, comprehending (as now it is) so much irreligion, and blasphemy against the Gods. She thinkes, also, shee cannot excuse her selfe from impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and sacriledge, should she suffer her selfe to be equall'd to <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Cnidos,</hi> or in the Gardens. Shee desires you, also, to remember what you sayd of her towards the end of your booke, where you stile her moderate, not haughty, nor soaring above humane reach, but observing humble flights; and yet forgetting your selfe, you advance her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the heavens, and place her among the Goddesses.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93795:138"/>
Shee would not have you thinke her more indiscreet, then <hi>Alexander,</hi> who when an Architect promised to transforme <hi>Athos,</hi> and so to figure it like him, that the whole mount should be his statue, holding two Citties in his hands; gave no countenance to such a prodigious undertaking, but holding the Attempt to be above his performance, dismist the man not probably able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive so vast a <hi>Colossus,</hi> and bad him let <hi>Athos</hi> stand as it was, and not shrinke so great a hill to the similitude of so small a body. Shee, therefore, much extols <hi>Alexanders</hi> Magnanimity, and sayes, by this refusall he hath erected a statue bigger then <hi>Athos</hi> in the mindes of those who will bee his perpetuall remembrancers. It being no Act of meane spirit to contemne such a Paradox of honour. Shee praises, also, your Imagery, and admires the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of your draught, but acknowledges it not to bee like her, being unworthy of such resemblances, nor any way neere them; nor, indeed, any woman else. Shee, therefore, returnes your honours with veneration of your Archetypes, and patternes: and desires you would praise her a more humane way, and not make her shooe too large for her foot; lest when shee meets you, you silence her. Shee bid mee, also, tell you, that shee heares many say (how truly you know) that conquerours in the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke</hi> Games, are not licenced to have Images erected to them bigger then their bodies; and that the Judges take care that none exceed the truth; but exactly size their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to the measure of the wrastlers: shee would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have you consider, vvhether if she should allovv your false dimensions, the Judges vvould not demolish her picture. Thinke, therefore, <hi>Lycinus,</hi> upon some faire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of your booke, and blot out your offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gods; vvhich shee tooke vvith so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, and read vvith such horrour, that she besought the Goddesses to be propitious to her. Nor vvas she to be blamed for expressing the passions of her sexe. For, to tell
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93795:139"/>
you true, I was minded to have sayd some such thing my selfe; who at first hearing perceived nothing amisse, having my contemplation fixt on her descriptions: but since she made her objections, I begin to be of her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; having before suffer'd in my selfe a deceipt of the sight; which beholding things in too neere an approach, and close to the eye, cannot perfectly distinguish; But at a just distance, and space, all things cast true appearances, and are seene as they are. To resemble a mortall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, then, to <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Iuno,</hi> what is't but to detract from the Goddesses? For by such comparisons the lesse is not advanced to the greater, but the greater is diminisht, and drawne downe to the lesse. As if two should walke together, one of very tall, the other of dwarfish statute, and you should desire to match them in equality, not one to exceed the other; the shorter by stretching himselfe would never reach the others height, though hee stood Tiptoe. But if they will appeare alike statured, the taller is to stoope, and depresse himselfe. So it is in Imagery; where a man compared to a God is not so much made greater, as the God call'd downe to an inferiour is made lesse. Yet had your want of earthly instances sent you to heaven for Coppyes, you had had some excuse for your impiety: but you having for example the beauties of so many women, had no need to liken her to <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Iuno.</hi> You are, therefore, to your utmost to deliver your selfe from envie, <hi>Lycinus</hi>: who are not accustomed, nor otherwise prone, or easie to over-praise; yet now, I know not how, you are suddainly changed, and fallen to excesses, and show your selfe as prodigall of your commendations, as hitherto you have been sparing. Nor let it beget your shame, to correct your worke, though publisht; since they report <hi>Phidias</hi> to have done so, when he drew <hi>Iupiter</hi> for the <hi>Eleans</hi>: who when hee first open'd his workmanship to the view of Passengers, stood behind a curteine, and heard what they blamed or praised. One accused the nose, as too bigge,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93795:139"/>
another the face as too long; others censured other parts; and when the spectators were gone, <hi>Phidias</hi> shutting himselfe up corrected, and reformed his picture by the publique Judgement. Holding the opinion of so many not to be contemned, but that many must necessarily see more then one, though that one were <hi>Phidias.</hi> Thus much shee gave mee in Commission to say, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but approve being your friend, and so well affected to you.</p>

               <p>I, most excellent of Ladyes, whom you charge for having praysed you above just measure, cannot see how I have bestowed more Panegyricke on you, then you have heapt upon your selfe by your religious esteeme, and reverence of the Gods, which is more to your commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then all I have sayd of you. Pardon me, therefore, that I omitted this part of your description, which had it fallen within the compasse of my knowledge, had stood in the first place: not with a purpose to excell your other prayses, but because, I have sayd much lesse then you deserve. Judge, therefore, what excellencies I have left out, and what available proofes of your religious carriage and straight intentions. Since they who thus reverence the Gods, are to be supposed vertuous in all their Actions towards men. Should you, then, enjoyne mee to alter my writings, and to correct my portrayture, I should be so farre from substraction, that I should insert this passage
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93795:140"/>
as the toppe and crowne of the whole worke. Next, I confesse my selfe oblieged to thanke you, that when I praised the moderation of your behaviour, as not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or swolne, or puft up with your present great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and fortune, you by your dislike of my expressions, have confirmed, &amp; verified them. For not greedily to catch at such commendations, but to blush at them, and to thinke them above you, is a sure signe of a discreet, and affable temper. You, therefore, by your aversenesse to praise show your selfe so much the more worthy to be praised; and do almost fulfill the saying of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who being asked which was the readiest way to glory, sayd, the contempt of it. So should one aske mee who most deserved praise, I would say, they who most avoid it. But this is Digression, and from the purpose. That whereto I am to make my defence, is, that in drawing your picture, I have resembled you to <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Cnidos,</hi> and in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to <hi>Iuno,</hi> also, and <hi>Minerva.</hi> Comparisons too high and beyond your last. To this I might reply, that the old saying is, Poets and Painters are not accountable; much lesse Panegyrists; though their language be Iower, and not fettered in numbers. For praise is a free thing, and not to be measured by the lawes of brevity, or excesse; but makes this its principall ayme, to commend the person praised to the publique emulation and wonder. But I will not take that way of defence, lest I should seeme to you so to doe for want of other matter. You know that the lawes of Panegyricall Orations consist in the Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists right use of similitudes, and resemblances; and the height of the Art is to apply well: which is atchieved not when like is compared to like, or to a worse, but when the thing praised is advanced by something as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent as 'tis possible. For example, If one in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a Dogge should say hee were bigger then a Foxe, or Catt, would you thinke such a one skill'd in the Art of praysing? you would not; nay though hee
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93795:141"/>
should say, hee were equall a Wolfe, hee had not praised him much. But the perfection of praise were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Dogge to a Lyon for size and strength. As when the Poet praises <hi>Orions</hi> Dogge, calls him Lyon-tamer, which is the perfection of a Dogges commendations. Again, should any man, desirous to praise <hi>Milo</hi> the <hi>Crotoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or <hi>Glaucus</hi> the <hi>Carystian,</hi> or <hi>Polydamas,</hi> say, they were stronger then a woman, would you not thinke him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be laught at for his silly comparison? or if he should say they exceeded other men, 'twere not praise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. But how doth the excellent <hi>Homer</hi> magnifie <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>? He sayes, Pollux <hi>had not might enough to encounter him hand to hand, nor</hi> Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mena's <hi>warlike son.</hi> Do you marke to what Gods he compares him, or rather preferres him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? yet <hi>Glaucus</hi> tooke not resentments to be extoll'd above the stoutest Gods; nor did they take revenge either of him or the Poet. as irreligious in his prelations; But both were famous, and had in honour of the <hi>Greekes, Glaucus</hi> for his valour, the Poet for his numbers, especially for that passage in them. Wonder not, therefore, that I, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to bring you into comparison, (which is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to a Panegyrist) went by the highest patternes, led by the reasons of the worke. But since you in veigh against flattery, and professe your hatred of flatterers, I am oblie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make that one degree more of your praise but by the way I will define and distinguish the businesse of a praiser, from the excesses of a flatterer. A flatterer, making his profit the end of his commendation, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth, thinkes hee cannot be hyperbolicall in his praises, with which he mingles many untruths and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of his owne, not blushing to stile <hi>Thersites</hi> com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi>; or to call <hi>Nestor</hi> the youngest of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptaines that came to Troy; and so hee may gaine by his lying, hee will sweare that <hi>Croesus</hi> sonne is of quicker hearing then <hi>Melampus,</hi> and that <hi>Iphneus</hi> is quicker sighted then <hi>Lynceus.</hi> Whereas the other in praising, lyes not,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93795:141"/>
nor inserts descriptions utterly disagreeing; but taking their naturall perfections though not great, amplifyes them, and makes them larger: not fearing when he would decipher a horse naturally swift, and fleet, to say,
<q>
                     <l>Hee could flye o're the toppes of unprest corne;</l>
                  </q>
Againe he would not doubt to say,
<q>
                     <l>The course of horses swift as winde.</l>
                  </q>
And if he were to praise a fair house magnificently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, he would say,
<q>
                     <l>Such is the Inside of the Olympicke Hall.</l>
                  </q>
Which verse a flatterer for hope of reward, would applye to a swine-heardes Cottage: like <hi>Cynaethus,</hi> flatterer to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>liorcetes</hi>; who when he had spent all other waies of flattery, praised him for his ptissicke; and sayd, he cought very musically. Nor is it the only marke of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, that flatterers strive to purchase fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with those they praise by lyes, and that the others praise truthes with advancement: but that wherein they most differ, is that the one without choice heap together what <hi>Hyperboles</hi> they can; the others use them, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and confined to moderation. These few distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many have I showne you betweene flattery and just praise; that you may not confound, but divide them, and asigne them their severall limits, and measure. Now, then, if you please, apply both these rules to my descriptions of you, and see to which side they belong. Had the person, which I compared to the statue of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> been fowle, and deformed, I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly have beene thought a deceiver, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent then <hi>Cyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ethus</hi>: but being such a one as wee all know you to be, my boldnesse is not altogether unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable. But, perhaps, you will say, or rather have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sayd, that you allow mee to praise your beauty, but then it ought to have beene without envie, or compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a fraile woman with Goddesses. I, most excellent Lady (for now truth compels mee to speake) have not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93795:142"/>
compared you to the originall Goddesses, but to their Coppies wrought by the best Artificers in stone, brasse, and Ivory. Nor can I thinke it irreligion for men to draw resemblances from the workmanship of men; unlesse you take her Statue made by <hi>Phidias</hi> for the true <hi>Pallas</hi>; or the <hi>Venus</hi> carved not long since at <hi>Cnidus</hi> by <hi>Praxiteles</hi> for the heavenly: which apprehensions of them were dishonourable, since I hold their true portraytures unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible by any humane imitation. But suppose I had compared you to them, I am not singular, or the first broacher of such similitudes; but have for my examples excellent Poets, especially your Co-cittizen <hi>Homer,</hi> whom I will now raise from the dead in my defence, confident of your allowance of a name so Classick. Let mee aske him, then, or rather you, (who among your other pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are skill'd in all the best descriptions of his Poems) What thinke you of that passage, where speaking of the captived <hi>Briseis,</hi> he sayes, <hi>Bright as Golden</hi> Venus <hi>she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayl'd</hi> Patroclus? and a little after, as if his comparison of her to <hi>Venus</hi> were not enough, he sayes:
<q>
                     <l>So spake the woman Goddess-like and wept.</l>
                  </q>
As often as you meete with such expressions, doe you hate him, or throw away his <hi>Iliads,</hi> or do you allow the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse of his resemblances? If you do not, so many past ages have; nor hath he hitherto found an accuser, or one that durst lash his Statue, or libell his obeliske, with the inscriptions of his censurable verses. If he, then, were licenced to compare a barbarous, weeping Lady to Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering <hi>Venus,</hi> may not I (ommitting your beauty, not to be spoken of with your patience in your hearing) compare a sprightfull, debonaire Lady, to the Images of the Gods, for those things which we mortalls partake in common with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? next, in his Character of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> observe how spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he hath bin of the Gods, whose scatter'd perfections he hath collected, &amp; cast into one gallant descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where he sayes, <hi>For his eyes and head hee was equall to</hi> Jupiter, <hi>for
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93795:142"/>
his courage to</hi> Mars, <hi>for his breast to</hi> Neptune; dividing his parts by severall resemblances with the most eminent Gods. In another place hee compares him to <hi>mortall-slaughtering Mars,</hi> and compares others to other Gods; Hee calls <hi>Hector</hi> the Godlike <hi>Phrygian,</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the God-like Greeke. But I returne to examples of the other sex, you know where hee sayes,
<q>
                     <l>She is like golden Venus and Diana;</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And
<q>
                     <l>Such is Diana hunting.</l>
                  </q>
Nor doth hee only compare them with Gods, but likens <hi>Euphorbus</hi> hayre to the Graces, though imbrued with bloud. In a word, there are so many examples in <hi>Homer,</hi> that there is scarce any part of his Poem unadorned with similitudes taken from the Gods. Either, therefore, let such expressions bee blotted out, or grant mee liberty to make the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay the use of allusions, and similitudes, is so uncontrouleable, that <hi>Homer</hi> hath not doubted to bestow praises on Goddesses borrowed from meane and inferiour thinges; thus hee calls <hi>Iuno oxe eyed,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in another place <hi>Violet-sighted</hi>; who is so smally verst in his poems as not to have read of the <hi>rosy-finger'd Aurora</hi>? 'Tis no offence, then, to say, one is shap'd like the Gods; but how many have assumed their compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and have stiled themselves, <hi>Bacchus's</hi> and, <hi>Vulcans,</hi> and <hi>Iupiters,</hi> and <hi>Neptunes,</hi> and <hi>Mercuryes</hi>: The wife of <hi>Euagoras,</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was called <hi>Latona</hi>; yet no Goddesse was offended, though able to transforme her, like <hi>Niobe,</hi> into marble. I forbeare to speak of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> of all people the most scrupulously superstitious; yet the names of the Gods are in that plenty worne among them, that most of their compellations are fetcht from heaven. Be not you, therefore, troubled at my prayses. For if there be any offence against the Gods in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, you are not accountable, unlesse one may prove
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93795:143"/>
guilty by hearing offences read. The Gods will punish mee, when they first punish <hi>Homer,</hi> and the other Poets; but they have not yet taken revenge of the best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, for saying man was the Image of the Gods. I have much more to say, but for <hi>Polystratus</hi> sake do here breake off, that he may the better report what I have said.</p>

               <p>Fye you have cloyd us with such prefaces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: If you will take my counsell, perplex not your selfe with verse; but take one of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> Orations against <hi>Philip,</hi> and alter it to your purpose, 'tis the practice of many moderne Orators.</p>

               <p>Thou sayest well. 'Tis a Compendious way of Rhetoricke, and lyes open and prepared for those who are unprovided: Thus then I begin. I suppose, O yee men and Gods, it will bee in stead of great fortunes to you, to heare me declare the Cause, why I have call'd you together. 'Twill, therefore, become you to lend mee cheerfull atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The present occasion, doth almost vocally instruct us to make prevention of our present dangers; with which wee all seeme too coldly affected. I will, therefore, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing no longer preface from <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> clearly open to you the reasons, why in great perplexitie I have sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond this Parliament. Yesterday, you know, <hi>Mnesitheus</hi> the Pilot offer'd a Sacrifice for the preservation of his ship, almost wrackt neere the Promontory of <hi>Caphareus.</hi> And feasted as many of us in the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> as he call'd to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. After the oblation, you all departed severall wayes, as your businesse led you. Onely I, towards evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Citty to walke in the <hi>Keramick</hi>; considering with my selfe <hi>Mnesitheus</hi> thrift, who entertain'd sixteen
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93795:147"/>
Gods with the sacrifice of one ancient, decayd, rheumatick Cock; and foure graines of musty, wither'd incense, which vanisht in the kindling, and sent not up smoake enough to touch the tip of our noses, though he vowed whole Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombes, when his ship was ready to dash upon the rocks, and sinke. With these contemplations I was carried on to the painted gallery, where I saw a vast crowde of people, some standing within the Schoole, others without, others very earnest and loud, sitting upon benches. I guessing them, (as indeed they were) to be wrangling Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, drew neere to heare what they said: And wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping my selfe in a thick cloud, presently transformd my self into one of them; and stroaking my long beard perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resembled a Philosopher. Having made my passage with my elbow, I enter'd, unknowne who I was, where I found that Atheist <hi>Damis,</hi> the Epicurean, and the best of men <hi>Timocles</hi> the Stoick, hotly disputing. <hi>Timocles</hi> had quite lost his voyce with sweating and clamour. <hi>Damis,</hi> profusely laughing, ceast not to provoke him. Their vvhole disputation vvas concerning us, vvhom the wicked <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> affirmed to be void of providence, and not to reguard the affaires of men; vvhich is to maintaine us not to be at all. And this he proved vvith great strength of Argument, and the applause of many On the contrary, <hi>Timocles,</hi> vvell studied in our cause, encounter'd, abhoried, and repelled his proofes. Much extolling our providence, and shovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how wee rule, dispose, and give order to all thinges in the world. Nor did hee want some who praysed him. Onely hee was tired, and spoke feebly, which turn'd all the eyes of the multitude upon <hi>Damis.</hi> But I apprehending our danger, caused night to close upon them, and dissolve the meeting: whereupon they divided, upon agreement the next day to give an issue to the disquisition. At their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture I mingled my selfe vvith the presse, and heard them magnifie <hi>Damis</hi>'s Arguments, and extoll them above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Some also there were vvho vvould not prejudge the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93795:147"/>
opposite side, but kept themselves in suspense, what <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> would urge the next morning. These are the motives for which I call'd you together; which are not slight, O yee Gods, if you consider that all our honour, glory, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, proceed from men. If they, then, be once perswaded, either that there are no Gods, or if there be, that they fall not under our providence, we shall no longer receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, gifts, or honour from the earth; But shall here sit neglected in heaven, famisht, and deprived of our Feasts, Holydaies, Games, Oblations, and night Solemnities. I hold it, therefore, fit that wee unanimously advise upon some remedy against those dangers; And how <hi>Timocles</hi> may prevaile, and appeare to be in the truth, and <hi>Damis</hi> may be exposed to the laughter of the Auditors. I am not confident that <hi>Timocles</hi> of himselfe can conquer, unlesse we lend him our assistance. Make legall proclamations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Mercury,</hi> that vvhosoever will may stand up and speake.</p>

               <p>Afford mee your Attentions, then, All yee Gods. I have long expected that our affaires should be driven to those straights, and that many such Sophisters should spring up who take the cause of their boldnesse from us. Nor ought wee in equity to be displeased with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or his followers, and successors in that Sect, for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of us. For what apprehension of us can they have, who see such a tumult, and disorder in things? good men despised, and afflicted with poverty, sicknesse, and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93795:148"/>
corrupt, and wicked men held in veneration, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with wealth, and bearing rule over the Vertuous? Some to scape punishment with sacriledge, others to bee crucifyed, and rackt for innocence? when they see such an unequall disposition of thinges, they may dispute whether there bee such thinges as Gods. Especially when they heare such ambiguous oracles as these: <hi>Halys past; Thou an empire shalt dissolve.</hi> Not explayning whither his owne Empire, or the enemies Againe,
<q>
                     <l>Thou Salamis shalt womens sonnes destroy;</l>
                  </q>
Which held both for <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Greekes,</hi> who, I beleeve, were womens sonnes. Againe, when they read those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, where wee are sayd to be enamourd, and wounded and made servants, and imprisoned, and to hold factions, and a thousand such passages which are practiced among us, who all the while pretend to happinesse and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, how can they choose but laugh, and contemne us? yet wee are angry because some men are not stupid, but bring these thinges into disputation, and take our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from us: whereas vvee guilty of such irregularities ought to be glad that vvee are sacrificed to at all. And here, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> (since vvee are alone, and no man present in this Assembly, but <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Ganymed,</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius</hi> vvho are novv denizon'd Gods) ansvver mee truly, vvhether earthly affaires have at any time so enter'd into your care, as to examine vvhat men are vvicked, and vvhat vertuous?

And had not <hi>Euristheus,</hi> a just and provident Prince, out of his love to mankind, enquired into their grievances, and redrest them by sending abroad <hi>Hercules,</hi> then his servant, an active, stout, and hardy man, <hi>Hydra,</hi> and the <hi>Stympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides,</hi> the <hi>Thracian</hi> horses, and contumelious drunken

                  <hi>Centaures,</hi> had never enter'd into your consideration, <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> To say truth, our vvhole employment is to sit, and observe vvho offers sacrifice, and perfumes our Altars. All other things are ruled by chance, and fall out by accident: We suffer, therefore, justly for the present, and are likely to suffer more hereafter, vvhen men looking up to us shall find that 'tis but losse to sacrifice to us, or to send us up oblations. Shortly, therefore, you vvill see the <hi>Epicureans</hi> laugh at us, such Philosophers as <hi>Metrodorus,</hi> and <hi>Damis</hi> prevaile, and our defenders overcome by them. 'Twill concerne us, therefore, to finish, and heale these grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both present, and precedent.

               <p>Doubtlesse <hi>Timocles</hi> is a vertuous man, a lover of the Gods, and exactly studyed in the Stoick Learning; which makes him so stored with pupils, by whom hee receives a large revenew; so perswasive is he to his scholers in private. But in publique he is so timorous and of such a silly, and harsh delivery, that he still raises the derision of the auditory by his disconnections, and tautologies, and Nonplusses.

               <speaker>Timocles.</speaker>
               <p>I tooke my first perswasion from the order of things; observing the Sunne alwayes to move in the same Circle, as also the Moone, then the revolution of times, the springing of the Plants, the generation of beasts, and these so regularly disposed, as to be able to feed, move, apprehend, walke, build, contrive defences.

               <p>You run away with the question, <hi>Timocles,</hi> nor have you yet proved whether providence move those wheeles or noe. That such things are done, I grant, but whether ruled by the hand of providence I hold not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be beleeved. 'Tis true there is an orderly rising, and course of things, but you call this order necessity Then you grow Cholericke if you be not obey'd in your opinion, when you make an enumeration of things, and thinke your praises of them are so many demonstrations that all their revolutions and changes are the effects of providence.

               <speaker>Timocles.</speaker>
               <p>Methinkes they need not a higher proofe; yet I will produce others: Answer mee, then, Dost thou take <hi>Homer</hi> to bee the best Poet?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Damis.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Timocles.</speaker>
               <p>I build my faith, then, on his authority: he plainly mentioneth a providence of the Gods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Damis.</speaker>
               <p>Most admired Sir, Wee all grant that <hi>Homer</hi> was an excellent Poet, but not that he or any other Poet is of authority sufficient in this case. For truth, I beleeve, was not their ayme, but the delight of their hearers. And, therefore, they sung in verse, and mixt fables with their numbers, having only pleasure for their end. But I would faine know by what place of <hi>Homer</hi> you were most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded. By that where speaking of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> he sayes, his daughter, and brother, and wife, took counsel to bind him, and had not <hi>Thetis</hi> out of compassion calld in <hi>Briareus</hi> to his ayd, our great <hi>Iupiter</hi> had bin fettered, and hurryed to prison? Out of his gratitude for which rescue, at <hi>Thetis</hi> suite, he deceived <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and sent him a false dream, that many of the <hi>Graecians</hi> might be destroyed. Where observe that he was not able by a bolt of thunder to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> unlesse he had shown himself a deceiver too. Or perhaps, you are most swayed by the description, how <hi>Diomedes</hi> assisted by <hi>Pallas</hi> wounded <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe. And how, a little after, the Gods held a conflict, and warre among themselves, males with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, where <hi>Pallas</hi> overcomes <hi>Mars,</hi> weakened, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by the wound hee received from <hi>Diomed: And 'gainst</hi> Latona <hi>usefull</hi> Hermes <hi>stands.</hi> Or perchance your perswasion is built on that passage of <hi>Diana,</hi> where shee complaines, and takes disdayne, that shee was not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Oeneus</hi> to his feast; and in revenge sent a vast Bore of an invincible strength to wast his country. Are these the authorities of <hi>Homer,</hi> on which you build your beleef?</p>

But, then, the pilot of a ship alwayes contrives things necessary; and before hand prescribes their imployment to the saylers, and provides that the vessells carry nothing uselesse, or unfit, but be fraught with profitable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But your other pilot, who, you say, rules the greater shippe, and his co-governours order nothing regularly, as becomes them. But sometimes, as it falls out, the mast is fastned to the sterne; and the tackling to the fore-decke. Sometimes the Anchors are of gold, and the trimme of lead; the bottome under water is carved, and paynted, the deck and rayles are deform'd and rude. Againe, you may observe some of the saylers, sluggish and artlesse, and impotent at their businesse, rewarded with double or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shares. Others able to steere, and to order the sayles, and skill'd in navigation, set to empty the sinkes. The like observation you may make of the passengers. Many times a slave sits uppermost, next the governour, and is lookt upon with reverence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or perhappes, some Catamite, Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, or Church robber, is advanced to the highest place of the shippe, and many vertuous men are thrust into an obscure, retired hole, and trampled by them: Consider, how <hi>Socrates, Aristides,</hi> and <hi>Phoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in what streames of pleasure did <hi>Callias,</hi> and <hi>Midias,</hi> and <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> swimme, and look downe upon their inferiours? This is the Government, <hi>Timocles,</hi> of your shippe, under which have happen'd a thousand wrackes. If there were a pilot who observed, or order'd things, first, he would not be ignorant, what passengers are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, what wicked. Next, hee would assigne imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments answerable to every mans desert; and place the best men in the best place, neer himself, and the worst men in the worst below. Then, he would take into his counsel, and fellowship, the most excellent. The industrious Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler should rule the sterne, or governe the sides, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

in chiefe; The slothfull and carelesse should five times a day be beaten about the head with a rope. The instance, therefore, which, admired Sir, you have given of a shippe is through the badnesse of the pilot in danger to suffer wrack.</p>

As, also, pleasant drinke, mony, soft beds, fair houses, and all things provided for our use. The works of art, also, are the works of the Gods. To live, then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all these, is to be miserable, though you were deprived by another, like prisoners. But his case is much more miserable, who deprives himself of all these good things, for 'tis an evident madnesse.</p>

               <p>God is like that liberall inviter; And hath set before us entertainments of all sorts, and agreeable to all palates; some things for the healthy, some things for the sicke, some things for the strong, others for the weake. Not that all should enjoy all, but every one those things which are proper for him, as his need requires. But you
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93795:157"/>
are like him, who through his insatiate appetite, and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance snatches all, when you ayme at universall fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and send your desires into all parts, nor content with the things next you, nor thinking the earth or sea sufficient for you, fetch pleasures from the farthest coasts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre things forraigne before native, and costly before cheap; and things of difficult procurement before things of easy. In a word, desireing rather the evills of businesse, and trafficke, then the calmes of life. For all these pretious, and happy provisions, in which you rejoyce, are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you through many anguishes, and disquietts. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, I pray, your so much desired Gold, and Silver; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider your magnificent houses; Consider your studyed garments; Consider all thinges belonging to these, with how much negotiation, toyle, danger, blood, slaughter, and ruine of men, are they purchased? who not only suffer shipwracke in sayling for them, besides other calamityes which they undergoe in their search, and pursuite, but imbarke themselves in frequent warres, and lay mutuall trappes, and ambushes, friendes against friendes, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren against parents, and wives against husbandes. Thus for Gold, I suppose, <hi>Eriphile</hi> betray'd her husband. And when all is done, embroidery makes not garments warmer. Nor doe houses shelter because they are guilt. Nor doth the mettall of the bowle enrich the wine; nor doe beddes of Gold, or Ivory yeild the sweetest sleepes. But you shall many times see rich men want sleep in a bed of Ivory, and under an embroyder'd coverlet. Besides all your negotiations about meates nourish not better, but corrupt the body, and engender diseases. I omitt to speake how many difficultyes men undergoe, and suffer, for the satisfaction of their lusts: which were easily cured, were luxury banisht; For which men thinke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon folly, and corruption, not sufficient, unlesse they pervert the naturall use of thinges; as when they convert their beddes into coaches.</p>

               <p>But they were not ordained for that end. As one may force a cuppe to the imployment of a kettle, but it was not made for that imployment. Your miseries are so many, that I cannot stand to recount them all. And yet dare you blame mee for not being a partaker? I live like the well-behaved man, I speake of, content with the things next mee, and of easiest provision. Not at all allured, by your varities, and daynties. Yet though I need few thinges, and use as few, my life to you seemes brutish. By the same reason the Gods are in worse condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then beastes; for they lack nothing. But that you may know how much better 'tis to need few thinges then many consider that children lacke more things, then grown youthes, and women more then men; and the diseased more then the healthy. Briefly, the worse estate wants more then the better. Thus the Gods want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore they neerest approach them who want least. Can you imagine <hi>Hercules</hi> (the most valiant of men, and deservedly reckond among the Gods) was miserable when hee travell'd up and downe naked, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed only with a skinne, and lackt none of those things? certainly hee could not be miserable, who deliver'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from calamity; nor poor, who ruled over land and sea.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93795:158"/>
that such a one, who thus traverst the world, did want a rugge, or shooes? you cannot. But he was temperate, and stout, desired to live frugally; and to avoid pleasure. Was not his scholar <hi>Theseus,</hi> also, King of the <hi>Athenians, Neptunes</hi> sonne, and the bravest man of his time? yet he contemned shooes, and went barefoote, and cherisht a long beard, and hayre. Nor was it his only, but the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all the ancients, who were your betters; and would have brookt the present luxury no more then a Lyon will suffer himselfe to be shorne. Tendernesse, and sleeknesse of flesh they thought only became women. They, as they were, still chose to appeare men; and held hair as much their ornament, as a mane a horses, or a beard a Lyons. To whom, as God hath given somethinges for ornament, and beauty, soe he hath given beardes to men. The ancients, therefore, shall be my example and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nor doe I envy the men of these times for their felicity, full tables, and rich apparell; or because they polish, and smooth all parts of their body, not content with those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret parts as nature sent them. For my part, I wish my feet differ'd not from horses hoofes, as they report of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> Or that I wanted a coverlet no more then Lyons, or high fare no more then dogges. Or that any earth, or floor may suffice mee for a lodging; That I may thinke the world my house; That my diett may be that which is easiest purchast; That neither I nor any friend of mine may covet Silver, or Gold: the thirst whereof is the root of all evills, factions, warres, treasons, and slaughters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All which have the desire of more for their fountaine, and springe. Bee, therefore, the itch of abundance farre from mee; And when I have not sufficient, yet may I bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. This is our doctrine, utterly different from the common received opinions of the most. Nor are you to marvaile, that wee differ from others in our manners, and course, who differ so much from us in their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and choices. Meane time I wonder at you, how
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93795:159"/>
you can thinke there is a certaine habit, and behaviour, proper for a fidler, trumpeter, and player, and do not perceive that there is a garbe, and dresse proper also for a vertuous man; but thinke he is to habitt himselfe like the most, though the most be vitious. If, then, good men are to be peculiar in their clothes, what attire is seemlier then that which is most disgracefull to the luxurious, and which they most eschew? 'Tis my bravery, therefore, to wear a slovenly, nasty, pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then, you are as impatient of labour as they, as easily melted with pleasures; you eate, sleep, and goe like them; or rather ye refuse to goe and are carryed, like burdens, some of you by men; others by beasts. My own feet carry mee where I list: who am patient of cold, and heat, and repine not at the seasons which the Gods send; or because they make mee miserable. But you, through too much felicity, are content with nothing, but alwayes complaine. You loath the things you have, and desire the things you have not. In winter you wish summer, in summer winter; In heat cold, and in cold heat; like displeased sick folkes who are alwayes whining; Onely they have their sicknesse for a cause, you your manners. Would you, then, have us change our course, and rectifie our life by yours, who so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erre in your counsels, and are so indiscreet in your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and do nothing with judgment, or discourse, but by custome and appetite? Certainly you differ nothing from men carried by a Torrent; For they are hurryed where ever the floud pleaseth, and you where your Lusts. Soe that you are in his case, who (as they say) ascended the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93795:159"/>
back of a wild horse; The horse ran away with him, and hee being in full speed could not alight. And when one met him, and askt whither he rode so fast, hee said, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever this horse pleaseth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soe, should one aske you whither you are carryed, your answer will be, if you speake truth, wheresoever your affections please. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, sometimes where your pleasure pleaseth; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times where your ambition; sometimes where your vainglory; sometimes where your covetousnesse of gaine; sometimes also your rage, sometimes your feare: still some passion or other transports you. You, then, are mounted on the back, not of one but of many wild horses by turnes; which hurry you upon steeps, and precipices; yet till you fall you perceive not your danger. Whereas, my patcht coat, which you deride, and my hayre, and rude accoutrements, have the power to create mee a quiet life; to do what I list, and to converse with whom I list. None of the ignorant, or unlearned will approach mee for my habits sake. Then effeminate men decline mee afarre off, onely the best wits, modestest men, and lovers of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue resort to mee, in whose company I take delight. Their gates, who are call'd Great men, I regard not, but looke upon their guilt chaplets, and purple, as arguments of their pride, and laugh at the wearers. But that you may know how agreeable my habit is, not onely to good men, but to the Gods themselves, (and then laugh if you can) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Statues; whom do they most resemble, you or mee? goe over all the Temples also, both of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and consider whether their Gods have long hayre, and beards, like mee, or are like you, carved, and drawne, trimd, and shaven.

But now I see both you, and your chaine, and great threats, by your confession, hang upon a slender Thred. Methinkes, therefore, <hi>Clotho</hi> might with more reason pronounce your bragge, who seeth you

               <p>'Tis clear, that wee are not sacrificed to out of any necessity, but for hope of returnes: so that men adore us either, to buy benefits of us, or out of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous love to religion.</p>

               <p>And this you thinke sufficient, and affirme, that profit is not the cause of oblations, but the piety of some men, who honour what is best: But if a Sophister were present, he would aske, why you stile the Gods best, since they are but fellow servants with men, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the same mistresses, and Destinyes. You will not say their condition is better, because they are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. For 'tis so much the worse. Since death, if nothing else shifts men into liberty. But your thraldome is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and your servitude is eternall, and drawne out into an everlasting thredde.</p>

               <p>You are not all happy alike, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but your felicities are distinguisht by their perturbations: you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance are happy, being King of the Gods, and able, by the demission of a coard, to draw up earth, and sea. But <hi>Vulcan,</hi> meane time, is a lame, sullyed, mechanicall Smith: <hi>Prometheus,</hi> also, was once crucifyed. I speake not now of your father, who lyes shackled in Hell. They report of your loves, and wounds, and prentiships to men: Your brother hired by <hi>Laomedon</hi>; and <hi>Apollo</hi> by <hi>Admetus</hi>: Imployments in my judgement not very happy. So that some of you seeme happy, and of prosperous estate, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not.

               <speaker>Iupiter.</speaker>
               <p>I told thee before, 'twas not fit for thee to know such things. And thou at first didst promise to aske but one Question; yet proceedest to trouble mee with frivolous doubts.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cyniscus.</speaker>
               <p>I understand you: you confesse your selves, then, the servants and ministers of the Fates; They decree, and order things, and you are their instruments, and Tooles.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iupiter.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cyniscus.</speaker>
               <p>Just as a Hatchet assists a carpenter in his trade, and an Augwer cooperates; yet no man will say they are Artificers. Nor is a ship the worke of the Axe, or Augwer, but of the Ship-wright. So Fate is the Carpenter of all things, you are but the Wimbles, and Axes of the Destinies. In reason, therefore, men should sacrifice to Fate, and thence implore benefits; and not make their addresses to you, or strive to render you propitious by veneration, and honours. Nay, in strictnesse, they ought
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93795:162"/>
not to adore fate. For, I suppose, 'tis not in the power of the Destinyes to change or alter any decree they have once made. Nor will <hi>Atropos</hi> permit any to wrest her distaffe another way, or unwinde what <hi>Clotho</hi> hath spunne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iupiter.</speaker>
               <p>So then, you maintaine, <hi>Cyniscus,</hi> that the sisters themselves are not to be adored by men, and cast all things into a confusion. Yet wee, if for nothing else, yet for our Oracles, and pre-interpretations of these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which the fates have made, deserve to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cyniscus.</speaker>
               <p>The foreknowledge of future events, <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> is utterly fruitlesse, if by observation they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be avoyded: unlesse you hold that one fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told he shall be slayne by the poynt of a spear, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate his death by shutting himself up, which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For his destiny will draw him forth to hunt, and expose him to a dart. So <hi>Adrastus</hi> spear being aymed at a bore, shall misse, and slay <hi>Craesus</hi> sonne, as if directed to him by the powerfull ordinance of the fates. That forewarning, also, given to <hi>Laius</hi> was ridiculous, which bidde him not beget a sonne against the allowance of the Gods; if he did, his child should slay him. For I hold such precautions no armour against necessary events. For after the oracle he begot a sonne who did slay him. I see no reason, therefore, why you should require to be payd for your predictions. I forbeare to speake of the crosse, double-sensed oracles, which you have utter'd to many; Not clearly expressing whether <hi>Craesus,</hi> passing <hi>Halys,</hi> should ruine his owne, or <hi>Cyrus</hi> Empire. For the oracle carryes both constructions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jupiter.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollo, Cyniscus,</hi> had a just cause of quarrell against <hi>Craesus,</hi> for mingling the flesh of a Tortoyse with that of a sheepe in sacrifice to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cyniscus.</speaker>
               <p>But it became not a God to quarrell. I therefore, rather think the <hi>Lydian</hi> was decree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to be deceived by the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93795:163"/>
oracle; and Fate long before had so spunne his thred, that he was not clearly to understand the prophecy. So that your predictions are but a part of Destiny.</p>

               <p>Perhaps you have learned none of these sciences by reason of their subtlety, and hardnesse. But what mechanicall art have you bin taught; Masonry, or Shoomaking? methinks you are not of that quality, as to be utterly without a trade.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>I will maintain this, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> to be more an Art, then any other, if you will heare mee speake as I thinke; Though, as I sayd before, I have not studyed my preparations.</p>

               <p>First, then, if please you, let us in generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what art is; so shall wee in particular know whether this bee rightly one or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>What is Art, then, doe you know?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Very well.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>If you know, define it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Art (as I remember it described by a certain wise man) is a System of precepts, got by practice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to some end profitable to life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tyciades.</speaker>
               <p>You remember his definition right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>If Parasitry, then, partake of all the parts of the definition, what is it but an Art?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>If it doe, 'tis a very Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Well, then. With application of Parasitry, to all the kindes of Art, let us examine whether it consent with that definition; or whether, like faulty pots struck
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93795:166"/>
it sound crazed. This, then, like all other Arts, ought to contain a System of precepts. The first is to find out, and choose one who is fit to feed a Parasite; and so to feed him as not to cast him off. For shall wee say that a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith by his art knowes how to distinguish what coynes are adulterate, and what not; and that a Parasite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art can distinguish what men are adulterate, and who are currant; especially since men, like coynes, cannot be known but by the touch? 'tis a thing which the wise <hi>Euripides</hi> complaines of, saying,
<q>
                     <l>How wee may ill men know,</l>
                     <l>No markes of body show.</l>
                  </q>
So that more art is required in a Parasite, to discerne and know by a kind of divination things to abstruse, and unevident. Is it not, thinke you, a great piece of precept, and institution, to know how to speak winning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and by insinuation of behaviour to steal into the familiarity, and affection of his patron?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Then, doe you thinke 'tis not a worke of great discourse, and wisedome to depart from feasts with double shares, and preferr'd before those who have not the Art?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Then, can any man unskill'd know the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and faultes of diet, and the curiosity of victuals? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially after that Oracle deliver'd by the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Plato; He that will make a feast, and is not a good Cooke, hath small judgment in entertainments.</hi> Next, that Parasitry consists not in precept only, but in practice too, you may easily from hence learne. The precepts of other Arts lye dayes, and nights, and monthes, and yeares sometimes unpracticed; yet they, whose arts they are, loose not their habits. But if the rules of a Parasite be not kept in daliy exercise, not only the art but the Artificer too is
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93795:166"/>
lost. Lastly, whether it have an end profitable to life, were madnesse to doubt; since I find nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to life than to eat and drinke, without which 'twere not possible to live.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Parasitry, then is not such a thing as beauty, or, strength; which seem not to bee an Art, but some such like power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>You say true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis not then voyd of Art. If it were, it would not profit the owner. If you should commit your self in a shippe to the sea, in a Tempest, and knew not how to steere, could you bee safe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>No, certainly.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>What's the reason? is't not because you lack skill to preserve your selfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>So, then, a Parasite, if he lack skill, cannot preserve himself by his parasitry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>By Art, then, he is preserved; by want of Art, not?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Parasitry then is an Art?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>It seems so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>I have often known expert Riders, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotteers cast from their box, bruised, and very much may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but none can tell of a wrackt Parasite. If, therefore, Parasitry be not artlesse, nor a bare faculty, but a System of precepts got by practice wee must acknowledg it to be an Art.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>As farre as I conceive 'tis. But, then, you are to assigne some genuine definition of Parasitry.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>You say well. Methinkes the best definition of it is this. Parasitry is an Art of meates, and drinkes, and of the things to be done and sayd for them, whose end is pleasure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:93795:167"/>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>In my opinion you have most excellently defined your Art. But, then, you are to consider whether a debate will not arise between you, and some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, about your end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis enough that Felicity, and Parasitry have the same end, as they manifestly have. For the wise <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> admiring a Parasites, as the only happy, and to be envyed life, sayes,
<q>
                     <l>No greater happinesse can be desired,</l>
                     <l>Then when all people are with mirth inspired,</l>
                     <l>When tables swell with chear, and Bowles are crown'd,</l>
                     <l>VVith rich wines which go in Carowses round.</l>
                  </q>
A little after, as if hee had not sufficiently exprest his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, he delivers his opinion more fully; saying excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,
<q>
                     <l>This seems to mee the top and height of Blisse.</l>
                  </q>
Intimating thereby that he thought there was no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness comparable to that of a Parasite. Nor is this sayd there by a vulgar person, but by the wisest in the Poem. For had <hi>Ulisses</hi> meant to preferre the Stoicke end, he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, when he fetcht <hi>Phelocletes</hi> from <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and when hee sackt <hi>Troy,</hi> and when hee stayed the <hi>Greeks</hi> from flight, and when he entred <hi>Troy</hi> having whipt himself, and going ragged, and torne like a Stoick. But he then mentioned no such end as best. Nor did he, when he lived an <hi>Epicurean</hi> with <hi>Calipso,</hi> where he spent his time in a voluptuous Idlenesse, and enjoy'd the loose embraces of <hi>Atlas</hi> daughter, preferre this as the happiest life, but the life of <hi>Parasites</hi>: who in those times were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Feasters. For what sayes hee? The verses deserve to be again quoted, nor can they be heard as they ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repetition,
<q>
                     <l>Let all the the Feasters sit in feast-like row,</l>
                     <l>And let the board<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with chear, and Viands flow.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Epicurus,</hi> then, impudently enough tooke his end from
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93795:167"/>
Parasitry, and made it the same with his Felicity: which is a playne theft. For that pleasure belongs to us, not to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> you may thus learn. First, I hold pleasure to be a composed tranquillity of the body. Next, an even calmnesse, and want of tempest in the minde. Both which are attayned by Parasite, neither by an <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>: who holding disputes of the figure of the Earth, of infinite worlds, of the bignesse of the Sunne, of distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the first principles, of the Gods, whether they be, or be not, and of the end it self, is in a perpetuall warre, and disagreement with others; and perplext, not only with humane, but with mundane subtiletyes also. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Parasite, content with the state of things, as they are, and beleeving they cannot be better, with all security, and quietnesse, unvext with such scruples, eates, and sleeps soundly, stretcht out both hands, and feet, like <hi>Ulysses</hi> sayling homewards. The <hi>Epicurean,</hi> then, hath no title to pleasure, not only for the forementioned reasons, but for those which follow. For what wise man soever he be, either he hath something to eat, or he hath not. If he have not, his life will be so farre from pleasant, that he cannot live at all. If he have, either 'tis his own, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If he have his diet from another, he is a Parasite, and not the man he boasts himself. If he have it from himself, he lives not pleasantly.</p>

               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>The case, then, standing thus with the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> 'tis not possible, he should enjoy his end. Whereas the Parasite hath no Cooke to quarrell with, nor Farm, nor Steward, nor money to vex him. Yet hath all things, and is the only man who eates and drinkes, disturbed with none of the incumbrances which trouble others. That Parasitry, then, is an Art hath bin sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by these, and former arguments. It now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that I prove it to be the best Art; not simply, but first, that it excells all Arts in generall; next, in particular. In generall it excells them thus. The study of all other Arts carryes with it labour, feares, and stripes; Things which never any but hated. Only the Art, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, is learnt without toyle. For who ever went wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from a feast, as wee see many School-boyes? or who ever went to a Feast with a sad looke, like those who go to schoole? A Parasite willingly frequents entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and most coveteously pursues his Art. They who learne other sciences, hate their own studyes, and some turne Apostates. Then you are to consider, that in other Arts, parents reward those children, who excell, with the same honours as they dayly reward us Parasites. The boy, say they, writes a faire hand, give him his dinner. Hee writes ill, let him fast. Then the consequence of other Arts is not to beare pleasant fruites till they be throughly learned; A thing of much industry, and wearinesse, whereas Parasitry of all other professions reapes the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93795:168"/>
of its Art in the Learning; And at once begins to be, and to be in its perfection. Againe, not some, but all other Arts were meerly invented for maintenance. Only a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites maintenance flowes to him at first. Doe you not see the husbandman plough his field, not for the meer til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage sake? And the Architect build a house, not that he may meerly build? But a Parasite drives at nothing else; That very thing which is his worke being the end for which his worke is due. Besides, none, I suppose, are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that they who are busied in other professions, live wretchedly, and keep only one, or at least two dayes in a month holy, as they are yeerly, or monthly appointed by their Citty; which they dedicate to refreshments. But the whole thirty dayes of the month are festivall to the Parasite, as so many holydayes of the Gods. Againe, they, who meane to excell in other professions, use a spare and slender diet, like sicke patients; since full tables are disadvantages to proficiency. Then all other Arts, are of no use to the professours without instruments, and tooles. No man can winde a Cornet without a Cornet; or sing to the Harp without a Harp; or show his horsemanshippe without a horse. But my Art is so perfect, and so cheap to the Artificer, that without other helpes 'tis sufficient. And whereas wee pay for our learning of other Arts, for this wee are payd. Againe, other Arts have their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: But Parasitry cannot be taught. But as <hi>Socrates</hi> sayes of Poetry, <hi>It come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I cannot answer you. But the groundes of other Arts are meane, and base; But the ground of mine is generous, and noble. For you shall find the much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated name of friendshippe to be the foundation of Parasitry?</p>

               <p>That no man invites an enemy, or stranger, or one of ordinary acquaintance to his table. But he must first be an intimate friend, that partakes of his meales, and board, and of the mysteryes of this Art. I have often heard some say, what friend can hee be, who did never eat, or drinke with us? As if they held him only a faithfull friend with whom they had converst in dyet. Now that this is the Queen of Arts, you may thus easily inform your self. Others labour, and sweat, and sit, and stand to their buisinesse, like so many slaves of their profession. A Parasite, having his Art in subjection, sits at table like a Prince; whose happinesse 'twere needlesse to recount; since, according to the wise <hi>Homer, hee neither plants, nor ploughes, but without sowing, or tillage, reapes all things.</hi> Then, 'tis permitted to an Oratour, or Geometrician, or Brasier to exercise his Art, though he be a Knave, or Fool. But no man can be a Parasite who is either.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>Trust mee, you have made Parasitry such a treasure, that I could almost change my course, and turn Parasite.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>How it excells, then, all other professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in generall, I have sufficiently showne. Let us now see how it excells them in particular. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with Mechanicall Arts were foolish, and a Diminution of its worthinesse. I am to show, therefore, how it excells the greatest and best sciences. 'Tis confest by all, that Rhetorick, and Philosophy are for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and worth, most prefer'd. If, therefore, I show that parasitry excells them, 'twill be clear that it excells all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sciences as much as <hi>Nausicaa</hi> excell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93795:169"/>
In generall, then, it farre surpasses both Rhetorick, and Philosophy. First for its certainty, and Independance. For Parasitry subsists of it self, they not. For all do not take Rhetorick to be one and the same thing; but some hold it to be an Art; some none, but an abuse of Art. Some maintain it to be one thing, some another. The like opinions passe of Philosophy. That of <hi>Epicurus</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from that of the Gate; and that of the Stoick from that of the <hi>Academy</hi>: Briefly, Philosophy is various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of Philosophers, who were never yet reconciled in opinions, or appeared to be of one sect. From whence I playnly inferre, That originally that is not an Art which is not able to subsist. For why is Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick every where one and the same? and why do twice two make four, both with us, and <hi>Persians,</hi> without any variation either among <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians</hi>? But we see great differences of Philosophy, without any agreement either in their principles or ends.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>You say true: even they who affirm there is but one Philosophy, have made it diverse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>In other professions he that with pardon passeth over some repugnances, as indifferent, and some variable principles, is not altogether to be blamed. But who will allow of Philosophy as necessary, which is as various and disagreeing to it self, as mis-tuned instruments. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy then, cannot be one, because I see 'tis numberless: nor can it be many, because 'tis one. The like may be said of Rhetorick, of which diverse speake diversely, and hold a war of opinions; which is a clear proof, that if it were built on any sure principle, 'twould fall under compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. For to dispute which opinion were truest, and not acknowledg Rhetorick to be one, were to destroy its subsistance. 'Tis otherwise with Parasitry, which is one among <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and every where the same, and like itself. Nor can it be said that some are one way Parasites, some another. Nor are there sects among
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93795:170"/>
us, as there are Stoicks and <hi>Epicureans</hi> of opposite do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines among Philosophers; but all are everywhere of one profession, and united in the agreement of our businesse, and end. So that in my judgment, by that which hath been said, there is no true wisedom but Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitry.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I'le tell you, then; and will select no vulgar instances but some of the highest mark, and whom you would least suspect. <hi>Eschines</hi> the <hi>Socratick,</hi> who wrot the long facete Dialogues, came into <hi>Sicily</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be known by them to <hi>Dyonisius</hi>: To whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read his <hi>Miltiades,</hi> much to his reputation, he made his future abode in the Island, and became Parasite to the Tyrant; renouncing the disputations of <hi>Socrates.</hi> What thinke you of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> the <hi>Cyrenaean</hi>? Was he not one of the approved Philosophers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>He too, about that time, lived at <hi>Syracuse,</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Dyonisius</hi>; and was of all his other flatterers of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93795:170"/>
greatest esteem with him; as being more naturally then others framed for the profession. So that <hi>Dyonisius</hi> dayly sent his purveyours to him to be instructed, being one so able to manage, and order the Imployment. Your most generous <hi>Plato</hi> came into <hi>Sicily</hi> with the like purpose, and was for a while Parasite to the Tyrant, but for want of a Genious to the art was cashier'd, and returned to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>; where with much industry enabling himself, he sayled the second time into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where after some few dayes entertainments he was for his unskilfulnesse reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And the misfortune which befell <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> is like that which befell <hi>Nicias.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>Many.

Aristotle,</hi> also, begun a Tract of parasitry, as he hath of other Sciences. That Philosophers, then, have studyed parasitry, I have sufficiently proved. But no man can give instance of a parasite who studyed Philosophy. If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it be felicity not to feele hunger, thirst, or cold, none are happy but parasites. For you may see many Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers halfe starved, and frozen, but not one parasite.

               <p>The life of men (if I be not deceived) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the seasons of peace, and warre. Both which plainly discover what arts, and their professours are.

               <p>To abate your wonder, and let you see that tis no matter of sport, I will draw you a case. Newes is brought that the enemy is unexpectedly enterd a country; which without suddain resistance, cannot be preserved from depopulation. The Generall calls all of fit age to a muster, and lets the rest depart. Among these are muster'd Philosophers, Rhetoricians, and parasites. Wee all strip our selves. For they who are to be armed are first to be seen naked. Consider us, then in particular, and take a view of our bodyes, and you will see some of them lean, pale, and shrunk with poverty, like so many maimed Souldiers. And were it not ridiculous to say such men were able to endure a battle, or pitcht field, or an assault, or Dust, or wounds, who need dyet, and refreshment? But take a survey of a Parasite, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h hee not carry the appearance of a strong body, and lusty colour, neither swarthy, nor pale, neither inclining to a woman, or a slave? Then, he is stout of courage, and terrible of aspect; the inseparable marks of our quality 'Twere against policy to send one of a timorous, effeminate look to the warres. One of us, then, either alive, or dead, would be an ornament to his armes. But why make I comparisons, having such clear examples? since to speak freely, few Rhetoricians, or Philosophers have in times of war ventured beyond their walls. If any have, I dare say, they forsook their ranks, and fled back again.</p>

               <p>Thus, then, I proceed. <hi>Isocrates</hi> the Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an never went to warre, nor indeed ever pleaded in a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Court; dishearten'd, I beleeve, by his fears, and the unfitnesse of his elocution, and voice. Did not <hi>Demades,</hi> and <hi>Eschines,</hi> and <hi>Philocrates,</hi> frighted with his procla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation of warre betray both their Citty, and themselves
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93795:171"/>
to <hi>Phillip,</hi> and ever after lived his agents at <hi>Athens,</hi> where every <hi>Athenian</hi> that followed their example in war was of their friendshippe? then, though <hi>Hyperides,</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> were in shew valiant, and spkae blustring Orations, and invectives against <hi>Phillip,</hi> what famous exploit did they perform in that expedition against him? <hi>Hyperides,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> went not forth, nor durst peep out of their Gates; but like self-besiegers kept within the walls, and order'd the decrees, and councells. Their great champion <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> indeed, who in his Orations had wont to say that <hi>Phillippe</hi> was the ruine of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and that they were not fit to be bought for slaves, adventured to march as farre as <hi>Boeotia.</hi> But before the Armies joyned, and came to battle, he threw away his shield, and fled. You cannot but have heard this from others, being a story so well known, not only to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but to the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and <hi>Sythians,</hi> from whence the Coward was descended.</p>

For when <hi>Hector</hi> broke open their Gates, enter'd their workes, and fought in sight of their navy, he repell'd him, quencht <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesilaus</hi> shippe then burning, and having aboard it no Cowards, but the two sonnes of <hi>Telamon, Ajax</hi> expert at his spear, and <hi>Teucer</hi> at his bow.

And at his expiration, no speeches came from him, like those of <hi>Hector,</hi> who fell down, and besought <hi>Achilles</hi> that his dead body might be restored to his friendes, but such as became a Parasite.</p>

                  <l>Let not, <hi>Achilles,</hi> my bones lye from thine,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That is, Parasite. For had he meant to call him Friend, he would never have call'd him Squire; for <hi>Patroclus</hi> was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93795:173"/>
nobly descended. Those, therefore, whom he calls Squires, were neither servants nor friends, but manifest Parasites. So he stiles <hi>Meriones Idomeneus,</hi> Squire; Which I suppose was the common name for Parasites. Where observe, that <hi>Homer</hi> vouchsafes not to equall <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> though <hi>Iupiters</hi> son, to <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but <hi>Meriones,</hi> his Parasite. Was not <hi>Aristogiton</hi> the popular, and poor, as <hi>Thucidides</hi> stiles him, Parasite to <hi>Harmodius</hi>? Nay was he not his favourite? For parasites are their favourites who feed them. This parasite, when a Tyranny was growing over the Citty of <hi>Athens,</hi> restored it to Liberty; and now (after his effeminacies) stands in a statue of Brasse, erected to him in the market place. Such famous examples have there been of parasites. By this time, then, you may imagine what kind of Souldier a parasite is in war. He never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters his files, but breakes his Fast first, like <hi>Ulisses.</hi> And though he be to fight never so early in the morning, he will not fight empty. And the time which other Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers spend fearfully in putting on their Armes, one his Helmet, another his Breastplate, tremblingly suspicious of the misfortunes of warre, he cheerfully spends in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and marching with the formost is presently ready for encounter: whilest his patron, who feeds him, closely followes at his back; whom, as <hi>Ajax</hi> did <hi>Teucer,</hi> he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with his shield, and warding off the enemies darts, beares himself naked to protect him; more careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him, then himself. Then, no Parasite falls in warre vvith the shame of the Generall, or Souldiers. Of so goodly a carkasse is he, and so like himself, sitting at a banquet; by vvhom, a dead Philosopher layd shevvs vvitherd, nasty, a long bearded carkasse, slayn before the battle, a man of no strength: vvho vvould not despise that City vvhich had such miserable Guards? vvho see<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing such vvanne long hayred fellovves lying, vvould not thinke the State, for vvant of better Souldiers, had let loose their prisons, and malefactors to the vvarre? Parasites,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93795:173"/>
then, in martiall expeditions excell Oratours, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. In times of peace Parasitry, in my judgment, as much exceeds Philosophy, as peace exceeds war. First, then, (if please you) let us consider the places of peace.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>I may call Courts of Judicature, wrastling places, races, huntings, and banquets, places of peace.</p>

               <p>A parasite frequents not Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; places, in my opinion, fit only for Sycophants, where nothing is done by moderation, or rule. But he followes, and is the only man who adornes places of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, race, and entetainment. What Philosopher, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, stript for wrastling, can show a body to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with a parasite? or which of them seen in a race Would not be a reproach to the place? Not one of them in a desert can withstand a wild boar: whose assaults a parasite expects, and easily encounters, being used to contemn such beasts at entertainments. So that neither Stagge, nor bristled Boar affrights him; but if he whet his teeth at him, he whets his teeth at him again. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues a hare more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounds do. At a feast who can enter the list with a parasite, for mirth and eating? who more cheers the Guests? He who sings and breakes jests, or he who sits demure, in a patcht gown, with a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast looke, as if he were invited to a funerall, not a feast? Methinkes a Philosopher at a feast is just like a dogge in a stew. But, to omitt such expressions, let us now passe on, and consider, and compare a parasites life. First, you may observe him to be a perfect contemner of Glory, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of the things of opinion. But you shall scarce finde an Oratour, or Philosopher not given to fame, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; And, which is yet worse, to mony. whereas a parasite is no more taken with Silver, then another man
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93795:174"/>
with the pibles on the shoare; Nor doth Gold, in his account, differ at all from fire. But pleaders, and (what is yet more unworthy) they who professe wisedome, are so wretchedly affected with gayne, that some of the most famed Philosophers, (for I forbear to speake of Oratours) sell justice for reward; others take pay for teaching their Scholers Sophistry. Another is not ashamed to receive a pension from the King for his attendance; Another, though of decrepit age, travells and hires himself out like an <hi>Indian,</hi> or <hi>Scythian</hi> Captive; nor hold they gain to be a word of reproach. Nor are these their only faults, you may perceive them lyable to the most unruly passions too; as discontents, rages, envyings, and lusts of all sorts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections unknown to a parasite. Whose patience suffers him not to be angry; nor hath he an enemy to be angry with. If at any time he be provokt, his Choller is not troublesome, or mischievous, but rather stirres mirth, and delights the company. Of all men he is least troubled with sadnesse. For 'tis the benefit, and priviledge of his profession, to grieve at nothing. Besides, he hath neither wealth, nor house, nor servant, nor wife, nor children, whose losse may afflict him. Then, he neither covets reputation, nor riches, nor beauty.</p>

               <p>But methinks, <hi>Simo,</hi> want of maintenance should grieve him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>You are deceived, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> if you take him for a true parasite who at any time wants maintenance. As he is not valiant, who wants courage, nor he wise, who lacks wisedom; so 'tis with a Parasite. Of whom I novv speak, as he is a parasite in deed, not in title, and name. If, then, a valiant man be not valiant, if he have not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; nor a vvise man, vvise, if he have not vvisedom, so a parasite is not a parasite, unlesse he have the Art of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site. He then, that cannot suck maintenance from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, falls not under my discourse, of a parasite.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>Will you never allow him, then, to vvant maintenance?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:93795:174"/>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>No. Which makes him not grieve for that, or any thing else. Whereas all Philosophers, and great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours are surrounded vvith feares. So that you may see most of them vvalk vvith staves; vvhich they vvould not do, if they feared not other men weapond. Then, they firmly bolt their doores, to prevent any night attempt. Whilest the parasite slightly shuts the doore of his cottage, meerly to keep out the wind. A night attempt no more frights him, then if there were no such matter. If he be to passe though a desert he travells without a sword; so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and fearlesse is he. But I have often seen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, upon no appearance of danger, make ready their bow, nor dare they go to a bathe, or invitation without a staffe. Then, no man can charge a parasite with adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, force, rapine, or any other crime. For then he were not a parasite, but would much wrong himself: so that if he should be caught in adultery, he should with the offence purchase the name too. For as a malefactor leaves of to be a good man, and becomes a wicked; so an offending pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite leaves off to be what he was, and assumes the compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his offence. But we not only see many such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed by the Philosophers of our times, but have large monuments of their crimes recorded in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. <hi>Socrates, Aeschines, Hyperides, Demosthenes,</hi> and most Oratours and Philosophers have had their Apologyes. But never Parasite needed a defence, because no man can give an instance of an invective writ against him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis much happier. For wee know that all, or most Philosophers have had unfortunate ends. Some found guilty, and sentenced for heynous offences, by poyson; others have wholy perisht by fire, others by the strangury; others have dyed banisht. But none can tell of a Parasite who dyed so, or who had not the happinesse
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93795:175"/>
to dye eating, and drinking. Or if any have felt a violent death, 'twas a flight, not an execution.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>You have sufficiently compared a Parasite with Philosophers. It now remaines that you show of what use he is to his nourisher, and patron. For methinks rich men maintain you out of benevolence, and charity, not without your infamies who are so maintained,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Parasite.</speaker>
               <p>I thought you not so simple, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> as not to know, that a rich man, though he possesses Gyges wealth, dining alone is poor, and appearing in publique without his parasite is a beggar. And as a Souldier without his armes, or apparell without its scarlet, or a horse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his trappings is pricelesse; so a rich man without his parasite is held base, and contemptible; so that the parasite is a credit to the rich man, but not the rich man to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite. Nor is it (what ever you thinke) any disgrace for the worse to be parasite to the better. It behooves, then, every rich man to keep his parasite, both for the honour, and the safety which he receives from his attendance. For no man will easily offer to quarrell with him so guarded. Next, no man that keeps a parasite can well be poysond. For who will make such an attempt upon him who hath such a taster? A rich man, then not only receives fame, but preservation from his parasite: who out of affection to his patron undergoes all his dangers, and chooseth not only to eat, but to dye with him.</p>

               <p>CAn you tell me the reason, <hi>Philocles,</hi> why most men desire to lye, and delight not only to speake fictions themselves, but give busie attention to others who do?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philocles.</speaker>
               <p>There be many reasons, <hi>Tychiades.,</hi> which compell some men to speake untruthes, because they see 'tis profitable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>This is nothing to the purpose. My questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concern'd not them who lye for profit: for such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve pardon; and some praise, who have thereby defeated their enemies, and used it as a preservative against dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; like <hi>Vlysses,</hi> who by such slights secured his own life, and the return of his companions. But I now speake of those, who preferre the very lye before truth, and take pleasure to busie themselves in fables, without any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary judgment. I would fain know what motives such men have to do so.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philocles.</speaker>
               <p>What other motive can they have not to speak truth, but their madnesse? Else certainly, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preferre the worst thing before the best.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tychiades.</speaker>
               <p>This is nothing; since I can show you many of great discretion, and wisedome in other things, who yet are Captives to this delusion, and love of lyes. Nor am I a little troubled to see men of excellent judgment in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93795:176"/>
other things, take delight to deceive themselves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. You cannot but know those ancients better then I, <hi>Herodotus, Ctesias the Cnidian,</hi> and the Poets before them, <hi>Homer</hi> especially; All men of great name, whose writings are stored with fictions. So that they not only deceived their hearers then, but have conveyed their lyes to us also in a preserved succession of excellent Poetry, and verses. I cannot, therefore, but blush for them, as often as they speak of a Schisme in heaven, of <hi>Prometheus</hi> chains, the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants Insurrection, and the whole Tragedy of Hell. How <hi>Iupiter,</hi> also, for love became a Bull, or Swan; and how a woman was transform'd into a Fowl, or Bear. Besides their <hi>Pegasus's, Chimaera's, Gorgon's, Cyclop's,</hi> and the like strange prodigious fables, fit only to recreate the mindes of children, who yet fear Goblins, and Fayries. But these are things tolerable in Poets. How ridiculous is it that whole Cittyes, and Nations should unanimously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in a publique lye? Thus the <hi>Cretans</hi> are not ashamed to show <hi>Iupiters</hi> Tombe. The <hi>Athenians</hi> say that <hi>Ericthoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> grew from the earth, and that the first people of <hi>Attica</hi> sprung from thence, like Coleworts. Yet these speak much modestlyer then the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who derive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from a serpents teeth sown. Yet he who takes not such ridiculous fictions for true, but upon discreet exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thinks it proper only for a <hi>Coroebus,</hi> or <hi>Margites,</hi> to beleve that <hi>Triptolemus</hi> was caryed through the Air by winged Dragons; Or that <hi>Pan</hi> came asistant to the Greeks from <hi>Arcadia</hi> into <hi>Marathon</hi>; Or that <hi>Orithyia</hi> was ravisht by <hi>Boreas</hi>; is held irreligious, and foolish, for dissenting from such clear and evident truths. So powerfull is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived lye.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Philocles.</speaker>
               <p>Yet both Poets, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> and Cittyes are thus excusable, that the one mingle fictions with their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the better to take their readers. The <hi>Athenians, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> and other countryes, make their beginnings more majestick, from such fabulous Originalls. Besides, should
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93795:177"/>
all fiction be banisht Greece, how many reporters would dye of famine? Since none there are patient to hear truth spoken gratis. In my judgment, therefore, they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in lyes, for no other reason but because they are lyes, are most deservedly to be laught at.</p>

               <p>You know not, my friend, what lyes he told, how constantly he affirmed them, and mingled Oathes with his fictions, and produced his children for witnesses.

               <p>I usually, at other times, when I had leisure, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> visited him. But to day having occasion to speake with <hi>Leontichus,</hi> (who as you know, is my inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend) and being told by his boy that he was early in the morning gone to visit <hi>Eucrates,</hi> who lay sicke, as wel to meet <hi>Leontichus,</hi> as to see him, (of whose sickness I was till then ignorant) I went thither. Where I found not <hi>Leontichus,</hi> (who, as they said, was newly departed) but a crowd of others; Among whom was <hi>Cleodemus</hi>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:93795:177"/>
the Peripatetick, <hi>Dinomachus</hi> the Stoick, and <hi>Ion</hi>; you know him; he that is so admired for <hi>Plato's</hi> discourses, as if he only understood exactly his meaning, and were able to be his interpreter to others. You see what men I name to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All Sages, famed for vertue, heads of their severall sectes; All venerable, and carrying an awfull terrour in their lookes. There was present, also, <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, sent for, I suppose, out of necessity of the disease. Though <hi>Eucrates</hi> seemed to be much upon the recovery, and his sicknesse not dangerous. For the humour was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine fallen into his feet. As soon as <hi>Eucrates</hi> saw me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his voice he feebly bad me sit down by him on the bed: whom, as I entred, I heard lowd, and shrill. I very carefull not to touch his feet, and using the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med complement, that I knew not of his sicknesse, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first intimation came post, sate neer him. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the company was concerning his disease; of which they had in part already spoken; and were then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, each severally to prescribe a severall medicine, and cure. Take up from the ground, said <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> with your left hand the tooth of a weesill, so kill'd as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bind it in a Lyons skinne, newly flead, then wrap it about your legges, and your pain will presently cease. 'Tis not in a Lyons skinne, as I have heard, said <hi>Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> but in a Virgin Hindes skinne unbuckt; And so the receipt is more probable. For a Deer is swift, and most strong of feet. A Lyon, indeed, is strong, and his fatte, and right paw, and the stiffe haires of his beard are of great vertue, if one know how to apply them every one with his proper charm. But they promise small cure of the gowte. I, also, once thought, said <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> that a Stagges skinne was to be used for his fleetnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, but since a certain wise <hi>Lybian</hi> hath me taught otherwise, and told me that Lyons are swifter then Buckes; For they, said he, catch these in hunting. The rest praised his reason, as well delivered by the <hi>Lybian.</hi> Then, said I, do you thinke such
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93795:178"/>
diseases, as this, are cured by charmes or that an inward malady is eased by an outward spell? Whereat they smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and seemed much to condemne my sillynesse as not knowing a thing so received, and not gainsaid, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by any understanding man. <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian seemed pleased with my question; who, it seemes, was formerly neglected in his offers to cure <hi>Eucrates</hi> by the prescriptions of his Art; which enjoyn'd him to abstain from wine, to eat hearbes, and to studye more remissely. <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> in the mean time, smiling replyed say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do you thinke it incredible, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> that such spells should be of power to cure diseases? I do, said I. Nor am I of so grosse a sense, to beleeve that such outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes, which have no affinity with the springs, and causes of the infirmity within, should worke, by charm, as you pretend, or by Imposture; or upon their bare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication should instill cures. A thing not to be effected, though one should bind sixteen whole weesills in the <hi>Nemean</hi> Lyons skinne. I have often seen a Lyon halt, and go lame with pain in his whole skinne. You are a very punye, said <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> and have not learnt to know what power such spells have over diseases. Nor seem to me to understand the expulsion of periodicall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the charming of serpents, and asswaging of botches, and other things performed by every old woman. All which being frequently done, why should you thinke cures of this nature impossible? You pile too much, <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> said I, and according to the proverb; drive out one naile with another. Nor doth it appear, that the things you speak of, are by such power effected. If, therefore, you prove not to me first by reason, that 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally possible that a feaver, or blayn should be frighted with a divine name, or barbarous spell, and thereupon forsake the place swoln, you have but hitherto utter'd old wives tales. Thus saying, said <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> you seem not to beleeve there are Gods; since you thinke it beyond
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93795:178"/>
the power of their names to worke cures. Say not so, Good Sir, quoth I, for there may without impediment be Gods, and yet your prescriptions may bee deceitfull, and false. I adore the Gods, and behold their cures, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veryes of sick people by regular medicines, and Physick. <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and his followers heal'd the diseased by wholesome prescriptions, not by the application, of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Weesills. Let him enjoy his opinion, said <hi>Ion.</hi> I will report to you a miraculous passage. When I was a Boy, about the age of fourteen years, one came and told my father, that <hi>Midas,</hi> his Vinedresser, a stout industrious servant, about the time of full market lay stung of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which presently gangrene'd his legge. For as he was bending a vine, and winding it about a pole, the Snake crept to him, and biting him by the great toe, presently slipt away, and retired into a hole. Whereupon he cryed out, and was ready to expire with payne. In the close of the relation we saw <hi>Midas</hi> himself, brought by his fellow servants in a chaire, swoln all over, discolourd, in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance rankled, and scarce able to breath. My father being much grieved, a certain friend of his, there present, said, Take courage, Sir, I will presently fetch a <hi>Chaldaean,</hi> who shall cure him. Not to be tedious, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> came, restored <hi>Midas,</hi> and drew the venom from his body by a charm, and by the application of a stone, cut from the pillar of a deceast Virgin, to his feet: and, which is yet more, <hi>Midas</hi> rising from the chaire, in which he was brought, went back into the field; so powerfull was the charm, and the stone taken from the tomb. Among his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other miracles, which he wrought, he went one morning early into a field, where having pronounced seven certain sacred names, taken out of an ancient book, and purged the place with brimstone, and taper, and walkt it thrice round: hee assembled to him al the Serpents of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So that drawn by force of the charm came many Snakes, Aspes, Vipers, Efts, Darters, Lizards, and Toades:
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93795:179"/>
only one ancient Dragon was left behinde; who for age, I believe, and not being able to crawle disobey'd the spell. Whereupon, All are not here, said the Magician; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently selecting one of the youngest Serpents, sent him Embassadour to the Dragon. Who not long after came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. When they were all assembled, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> puft up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and presently to our astonishment they were all burnt with his breath. Then said I, pray tell me <hi>Ion,</hi> did the young Serpent Embassadour lead the old, or did he support himself by a staffe? You are merry, said <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus.</hi> I was once as great an Infidell in these things as you are now, and saw no reason to beleeve them; yet when I beheld the <hi>Barbarian</hi> stranger fly, (who as they report came from the North) I was convinced into a belief against my inclination. For what should I do, when I saw him carryed in the Aire, walking upon the water, and in a slow, and leisurely motion passe through the fire? But did you, said I, see a Northern man fly, or walke upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Most certainly, replied he, shodde with pumpes, after the manner of his country. I forbear to speak of his smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler performances, his infusion of love, expulsion of devills, raising of the dead long buryed, publique presentment of <hi>Hecate,</hi> and drawing downe the moon from heaven. I will only report to you what I saw him do for <hi>Glaucias,</hi> the son of <hi>Anaxicles. Glaucias</hi> no sooner began to inherit his dead fathers estate but he fell in love with <hi>Chrysis, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maenetus</hi> daughter. I was Tutor to his studies. Who, had not love diverted him, had by this time learnt all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticke Sciences; since being but eighteen yeares old he had already gone over the <hi>Analytickes,</hi> and past through <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi> Physickes to the end. Thus perplext with love, he revealed himself to me: Who being his Tutor, as it became me, brought this Northern Magician to him, hired for four Crownes in hand (which were to buy things for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) and sixteen more when <hi>Glaucias</hi> enjoy'd <hi>Chrysis.</hi> He observing the moones increase, (the proper time for
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93795:179"/>
such inchantments) and having digged a hole in the house yard, about midnight, first call'd up to us <hi>Anaxicles, Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> father, dead seven monthes before. The old man stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and raged at his sonnes love, but in conclusion gave license to his affection. Next, he raised up <hi>Hecate,</hi> who brought <hi>Cerberus</hi> with her. Then he call'd down the Moon, a various spectacle, by reason of her diverse appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and changes. For first she resembled in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a woman; then she was transform'd into a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cow; then into a little dogge. After this fashioning a little <hi>Cupid</hi> of Clay, Go, said he, and fetch <hi>Chrysis</hi> hither. The Clay presently flew away, and shortly after she came, and knockt at the door, and at her first entrance embraced <hi>Glaucias,</hi> show'd her self distractedly enamour'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him till we heard the Cockes crow. Then the Moon flew to heaven, <hi>Hecate</hi> sunke into the earth, the Apparitions vanisht; and wee about day breake let <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> depart. Had you seen this, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> you would not long distrust the force of charmes. You say well, said I, I would, indeed, beleeve this, had I seen it. But am otherwise to be pardon'd, if at such visions I be not as quick-sighted as you. As for the <hi>Chrysis,</hi> you speake of, I know her to be an easy amorous woman. Nor do I perceive any need why you should imploy an earthen Embassadour to her, or trouble a Magician from the North, or the Moon, for the affection of one whom for twenty drachmes you may draw as far as the North pole; being a woman so readily prepared to meet your Incantations: Though she be thus unlike your apparitions. For they (as you report) at the sound of Brasse, or Iron vanish: But she no sooner heares Silver, but she runs to the sound. Besides, I cannot but wonder at the Magician, that being able to inforce love towards himself in the women of greatest wealth, and thereby draw whole talents from them, he should for the inconsiderable price of four Crownes procure affection for <hi>Glaucias.</hi> 'Tis folly in you, said <hi>Ion,</hi> to beleeve nothing.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93795:180"/>
I would faine ask you, what you think of them who have deliver'd Daemoniackes from their possessions; and have evidently charm'd forth their Devills. I need not tell you how many the <hi>Syrian,</hi> who came from <hi>Palestine,</hi> a man skill'd in such Arts, hath restored after they have faln down <hi>Lunatick,</hi> stared with their eyes, and foamed at mouth, and hath sent them away, cured, and releast them, for great summes, of their distempers. For standing by them as they lye, he askes the evill spirit from whence he entred into the Body. The possest person, mean time, is speechlesse, and the Devill replying, in Greek, or some barbarous language, tells from whence he is and how he entred the man; whereupon he by adjuration, and threats, if he offer to disobey, casts him out. I saw a Devill cast out black, and of the colour of soote. No marvaile <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> said I, that you saw such visions; <hi>Plato</hi> the father of your sect hath taught you to see <hi>Idae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do you mean the Quoiter, said I, who stands wryed in a Gesture ready to deliver, with his quoit
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93795:180"/>
hand reverst, and one knee bent, as if he meant to vary posture, and rise with his throw? Not him, said hee; the Quoiter you speak of is one of <hi>Myrons</hi> peeces. Nor do I mean the fair Statue next to him, filletted about the head with a bend; which is a peece of <hi>Polycletus's.</hi> You are also to passe over those which stand on the right hand as you enter; among whom are the Tyrant-slayers, carved by <hi>Critias Nesiota.</hi> Did you not marke the statue by the conveyance of water, with the bigge belly, bald, half na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, part of the haires of his beard pluckt of, of huge si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and every way resembling a man? I mean <hi>Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> he who is so like a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Captain. I saw such a one, said I, on the right hand of <hi>Saturn</hi>; having a wither'd wreath, and fillet on his head, and guilt Plates on his Brest. I, said <hi>Eucrates,</hi> caused them to be guilt, after he had in three dayes cured me of a desperate feaver. Was the famous <hi>Pelichus,</hi> then, a Physitian said I? He is now, and take heed how you scoffe at him, said <hi>Eucrates</hi>; least he shortly take revenge of you. I know the power of the Statue you laugh at; do you thinke he cannot as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a feaver, as expell one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be so powerfull a Statue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and mercifull to me, said I: pray, what else have your family seen him do? As soon as it begins to be night, said he, descending from his Pedestall, he walkes round the house; all my servants have often met him singing: he hurts none that give him way, but passeth by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbance; he washeth himself much, and playes all night, as we guesse, by the noyse of the water. Consider, said I, whether your Statue be <hi>Pelichus,</hi> or <hi>Talus</hi> the <hi>Cretan,</hi> who lived with <hi>Mino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Were he not made of Copper, but wood, I should probably thinke he were not the workmanshippe of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but one of <hi>Daedalus</hi> motions. For you say, he frequently walkes from his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. Beware, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> said he, you be not hereafter sorry for your floutes I could tell you what he suffer'd who stole
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93795:181"/>
the farthings, which we every new moon offer to him. The punishment of such a sacriledg must needs be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, said <hi>Ion.</hi> Pray what was it, <hi>Eucrates</hi>? I desire to hear, how incredulous soever <hi>Tychiades</hi> be. Many far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, said hee, lay at his feet, and some other Silver coynes were fastened with wax to his knees, besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Silver Plates, offer'd to him by the devotion, and gratitude of those whom he had recovered from feavers. A servant of mine, a <hi>Lybian,</hi> one of my Grooms, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Statue one night absent, adventured to steal his oblations. Observe how <hi>Pelichus,</hi> finding himself, at his return, robbed, revenged himself, and bewrayed the theef. Who all night walkt up and down the Hall in a Circle, unable, like one faln into a Labyrinth, to get out; till next morning he was apprehended with his stealths about him, and proportionably whipt. Nor did he live long after, but dyed miserably beaten every night, as he said, and confirm'd it with the markes seen in his body next day. Now, if please you, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> said <hi>Eucrates,</hi> laugh at <hi>Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and me, for a Doter of <hi>Mino's</hi> time. Certainly <hi>Eucrates,</hi> said I, as long as Brasse is Brasse, and your statue but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the <hi>Alopecian,</hi> who carved not Gods, but men, I shall not fear the Image of your <hi>Pelichus,</hi> nor much care for the threats of the originall were he alive. Here <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the Physitian, seconding him said, I, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> have also a brazen <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> about a cubit long, which, as soon as the Candles are put out, walkes circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly through all the house, making a noyse, overturning boxes, compounding medicines, and flinging open doors: especially if we omit to pay him his yearly sacrifice. Doth <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Physitian, then, require to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to, said I, and take it ill if he be not feasted with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations at his set times? Methinkes 'twere honour enough to power wine to him, or crown him with Garlands. Hear another passage, said <hi>Eucrates,</hi> which I with many other witnesses saw about five years past. One harvest
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93795:181"/>
time, having dispatcht my reapers about noon into the field, I solitarily retired my self into a wood, to weigh, and consider of some things. Where, at my first entrance, I heard the howling of dogges, which I imagined to be my sonne <hi>Mnason,</hi> going then abroad, as his manner is, with his companions to sport themselves, and hunt. But 'twas otherwise. For presently after followed an Earthquake, and a hideous bellowing like thunder. After this I saw a woman comming towards me of horrible aspect, and neer half a furlong tall, having in her left hand a Torch, in her right a Sword, at least twenty cubits long. She had downward feet like a Serpent, upwards in the horrour of her countenance, and visage, she resembled a Gorgon; having Snakes for hair, which partly twind about her neck, others hung loose on her shoulders. See, my good friends, said <hi>Eucrates,</hi> how I yet tremble to tell the story; and withall show'd us the hairs on his armes stiffe, and erected with fear. <hi>Ion,</hi> all the while and <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> and <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> ancient men, gave him serious attention as if drawn by the nose; and exprest a silent adoration of the incredible <hi>Colossus</hi>-half-furlong-woman, and gyant-like Hobgoblin. But I consider'd with my self, that such men as they, who read wisedome to young scholers, and were generally admired, differd only from children in their gray haires, and long beards, and were in all things else more easy to be deceived then they. Here <hi>Dinomachus</hi> put in, and said; pray tell me, <hi>Eucrates,</hi> of what size, and bignesse were her hounds? Bigger then <hi>Indian</hi> Elephants, replyed he, and alike black, their skinne as rough, squal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, and fowle. I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I saw them, stood still, and withall turnd the seale of the ring which the <hi>Arabian</hi> gave mee to the inside of my finger. Whereupon <hi>Hecate</hi> stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the the ground with her serpentine feet, made a great Cleft, which reacht to hell, into which she sunk by degrees. I assuming courage, and taking hold of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring tree, least astonisht with the darknesse I should
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:93795:182"/>
chance to fall in headlong, lookt in, and saw all the things of Hell; The burning lake of <hi>Phlegeton, Cerberus,</hi> and Ghosts; some of which I knew, especially my father, whom I saw in the very garments wee buried him. Pray, <hi>Eucrates,</hi> said <hi>Ion,</hi> what did the soules departed do? What should they do, answer'd he, but converse in companies, and societies with their frends, and <hi>Allyes,</hi> in the Daffodill mead? Henceforth, then, said <hi>Ion,</hi> let the followers of <hi>Epicurus</hi> urge arguments against <hi>Plato,</hi> and his discourses of the soul. But did you not see <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> among the dead? <hi>Socrates,</hi> replied he, I saw, but not more clearly then to guesse at him by his baldness and strutting belly. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> I knew not, nor is't fit I speak more then truth to my friendes. After I had taken an exact and universall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of things, the vault closed, and some of my servants, of which my man <hi>Pyrrhias</hi> here was one, came thither to seek me before 'twas quite shut. Speake, <hi>Pyrrhias,</hi> do I say true? Most true, by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Sir, said the fellow; for I my self heard the barking of the dogges through the cave, and saw the flashes of the Torch. Here I smiled to hear the howling; and flames put in by the witnesse. You have seen nothing strange, said <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> or what hath not been seen by others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I, in my sicknesse, not long since, saw the like apparition. At which time <hi>Antigonus,</hi> here, visited me, and gave me seven dayes Physick for a feaver, more hot, and violent then fire. One day all left the room, shut the door, and stay'd without, by your prescription, <hi>Antigonus</hi>; if perchance solitarinesse might entice me into a slumber. But I, lying awake, saw a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth approach me, clothed in white: who after he had raysed me, lead me through such another cleft down to hell; as I presently perceived, when I beheld <hi>Tantalus, Tityus,</hi> and <hi>Sisyphus.</hi> What need I report to you the rest? Briefly, I was brought to a Tribunal, where vvere present <hi>Aeacus, Charon,</hi> the Destinies, and Furies. Where, also, one sate as King, vvho seemed to be <hi>Pluto,</hi> by his reading
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:93795:182"/>
of a Catalogue of their names who were to dye, and had already out-lived their limited time. The young man brought me, and presented me to him. But <hi>Pluto</hi> much displeased, said to him, his thred is not yet quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>punne, let him, therefore, depart again. And fetch <hi>Demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Brasier, who hath exceeded his distaffe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I joyfully return'd, releast of my feaver, and told all my neighbours, that <hi>Demylus</hi> was shortly to dye. Who then, also, lay sick, as 'twas reported. And shortly after wee heard the Cryes of them that lamented his death. What miracle is this? Said <hi>Antigonus.</hi> I knew one, who after he had been buried twenty dayes, rose again. For I gave him Physick before his death, and after his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Methinkes, said I, in twenty dayes his body should putrifie, or perish with famine. Unlesse you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to an <hi>Epimenides.</hi> As we thus discourst, came in <hi>Eucrates</hi> sonnes from exercise. One a grown youth, the other about the age of fifteen. Who having saluted us sate down upon the bed by their father; and a chair was brought for me. Here <hi>Eucrates</hi> taking fresh hint from the presence of his sonnes, said, so may I have Comfort of these two, (and laid his hands on them) as that which I shall now tell you, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> is true. 'Tis well known how dearly I loved my vvife, the mother of these, of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py memory: vvhich I exprest both in my carriage to her vvhile she lived, &amp; after her death. For I burnt vvith her her vvhole vvardrobe, &amp; the garments she most delighted in vvhen she lived. The seventh day after her funerall, I lay in this bed, as I do novv, having abated my sorrovv. And silently reading to my self <hi>Plato's</hi> little tract of the soul, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maenete</hi> entred, and sate dovvn by me, as <hi>Eucratides</hi> (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his younger son) doth now. The boy childishly trembled, and vvaxt pale at the narration. I, proceeded <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> as soon as I beheld her, imbraced her and sobbingly shed teares. She permitted me not to vveep, but blamed me, that after all my other expressions of affection to her,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:93795:183"/>
I had not burnt one of her guilt pantofles; which, she said, was fallen down behind a chest: which, we not finding, cast only the other into the funerall pile. As we thus talkt, an unhappy dogge, which I loved, lying upon the bed, barkt, at which sound she vanisht. Afterwards wee found the slipper under the Chest, and burnt it. Can you still doubt, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> of truthes so manifest, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day apparent? By <hi>Iove,</hi> said I, they deserve to be clapt with a guilt Sandall, like children, who do not beleeve you, or impudently question the truth. Here <hi>Arignotus,</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> entred, a man of long hair, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aspect. You know he is famous for his wisedome, and Sirnamed the Sacred. I was something relieved with his sight, and, according to the proverb, thought I had now got an Axe against lyes. For certainly, said I to my self, this wise man will stoppe their mouthes from repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any more such prodigies. In a word, I thought fortune had unexpectedly sent some God to my succour. He sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in a place which <hi>Cleodemus</hi> resigned to him, first, enquired of <hi>Eucrates</hi> his disease, and being informed how he did, askt us what we discourst of: for as I entred, said he, methought I heard you busied in an excellent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. We were perswading this man of Adamant, said <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> pointing at me, to beleeve there were Devills. And that the shades, and soules of men departed, did wander up and down the earth, and appear to whom they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. I could not choose but blush, and fix my looke to the ground, out of reverence to <hi>Arignotus.</hi> Perchance, <hi>Eucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> said he, <hi>Tychiades</hi> holds that their Soules only do walk who dyed violently, namely such as were strangled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, crucified, or the like; and that those who dye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally walke not. If this be his opinion, he is not to be blamed. No such matter, replyed <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> he neither holdes that there are such things, or that they were ever seen. How say you, Sir; said <hi>Arignotus,</hi> looking frowningly upon me, do you deny such apparitions as are visible to
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:93795:183"/>
all? You must pardon my Infidelity, said I, who never saw any. If I had, I should beleeve, as You do. If ever you go to <hi>Corinth,</hi> said he, ask for the house of <hi>Eubatides</hi>; and when 'tis shown you, by the <hi>Craneum,</hi> enter, and tell <hi>Tibius</hi> the Porter, you desire to see the place from whence <hi>Arignotus</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> conjured away the Devill, and rendred the house habitable. May wee request the whole story? Replyed <hi>Eucrates.</hi> The house, said he, being haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was of a long time undwelt in. If any did adventure to inhabite it, they were scared, and persecuted away by a horrid, and dismall Apparition; So that it began to fall to ruine, and the roofe to droppe; nor had any man the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to enter into it. When I heard hereof, carrying with me certain <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bookes (of which I have store upon such Arguments) I went to the house about the first sleep, much disswaded, and almost violently restrayned by mine Host, after he knew vvhither I meant to go; verily suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing I vvent to my destruction. Notvvithstanding, I taking a Taper vvith me entred the house alone, and placing the linke in the great hall, and my self on the floor, read silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my self. In comes the Devill, thinking he vvas to deal vvith some vulgar fellovv, and hoping to fright me like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. A rough, shaggy fiend, and blacker then darknesse it self. At his first appearance he tryed, by making an orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular assault, to vanquish me, and sometimes turn'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Dogge, then into a Bull, lastly into a Lyon. But I having a direfull Spell in readinesse, vvhich I pronounced in the <hi>Aegyptick</hi> tongue, charm'd him back into a darke corner of the house. And having vvell observed the place vvhere he sunk, I left speaking. In the morning, after eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodyes dispair, vvho thought to find me slayn, like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I, against the expectation, came forth and vvent to <hi>Eubatides</hi>; And told him the glad nevves, that he might safely inhabit his house, vvhich vvas novv purged and freed from Divells. Withall taking him, and many others (vvho follovved out of curiosity, along vvith me to the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:93795:184"/>
place where I saw the fiend vanish, I commanded it to be digged with pickaxes, and spades. We had not dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged aboue a yard deep, but we found a dead man, consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and nothing left to represent him but the Scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Which we took up and buried. And from that time the house ceased to be molested with visions. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignotus</hi> had finisht his narration, being a man of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious wisedome, and generally reverenced, there were not any of the company who did not condemne me of stupidity for being incredulous. Neverthelesse, I, neither daunted with his beard, nor their opinion of him, said, can such a man as you, <hi>Arignotus,</hi> from whom alone I hoped to hear the truth, be fraught also with fumes and Phantasmes? You have verified the proverb, <hi>I have found coales for treasure.</hi> If, said, <hi>Arignotus,</hi> you neither beleeve me, nor <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> nor <hi>Cleodemus,</hi> nor <hi>Eucrates,</hi> whom can you produce more Authentick to disprove us? A man much admired, said I, <hi>Democritus</hi> the <hi>Abderite.</hi> Who was so smally perswaded of such fictions, that shutting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up in a monument without the Citty, he there lived, wrot, and composed nights, and dayes. And when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain boyes, desirous to scare, and fright him, arrayed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves like Ghosts in blacke Garments, and wearing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit vizards on their heads, surrounded him, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently skipt about him, he neither feared their disguises, nor at all reguarded them, but wrot on, and bid them cease to play the fooles. So firmly did he beleeve, that Soules were nothing after their departure from the body. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, replyed <hi>Eucrates, Democritus</hi> was the veryer fool to thinke so. I will, therefore, report one story more, in which I my self was an Actor, and tooke it not up upon relation. Perchance when you hear it, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> the truth of the narration, will convince you. When I lived in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> yet a boy, sent thither by my father, to learn their Arts, I had a desire to saile to <hi>Coptus,</hi> and from thence to hear the famous <hi>Memnon</hi> sound at the rising of the sun.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:93795:184"/>
Whom I heard, not as others ordinarily do, yeeld an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant sound; But <hi>Memnon</hi> himself utter'd Oracles to me, and open'd his mouth in seven verses. Which, but that I should digresse, I would repeat to you. As we were at Sea, there sayled in company with us a certain holy Priest of <hi>Memphis,</hi> admired for his wisedome, and skill'd in all the learning of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> He was said to have lived three and twenty years in a cave under ground, and there to have learnt Magick of <hi>Isis.</hi> You mean my Tutor <hi>Pancrates,</hi> replyed <hi>Arignotus,</hi> he is a religious man, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, goes in linnen, is very learned, speakes Greek purely, is tall of stature, hath a bow nose, full lippes, and small legges. The very same answer'd <hi>Eucrates.</hi> At first I knew not who he was. But when I saw him, after our arrivall in the port, among many other miracles which he wrought, ride upon Crocodiles, approach such cruell beasts, and they to reverence him, and wagge their tayles, I guessed him to be some sacred person. And by degrees insinuated my self into his acquaintance, and friendship. So that at length he revealed all his secrets, and mysteryes to me. To be short, he perswaded me to leave all my servants at <hi>Memphis,</hi> and to accompany him alone; who promised we should not want attendants. And from that time thus we lived. When we came into an Inne, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the bolt of the door, or a broom, or bar, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it, spoke a charm to it, and enabled it to go, and in all things to resemble a man. The thing going forth, would draw water, provide, and dresse our supper, and diligently wait, and attend upon us. After his businesse was done, he pronounced another charm, and turn'd the broom into a broom again, and the pestle into a pestle. This was an Art which, though I labour'd much, I could not learn of him. For this was a mystery which he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, though in all things else he were open. One day, hiding my self in a darke corner, I overheard his charm, which was but three syllables. He having appointed the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:93795:185"/>
bolt its businesse, went into the market. The next day, he having some other imployment in the market, I taking the pestle, and apparelling it, in like manner pronounced the syllables, and bid it fetch me some water. When it had brought me a bason full, 'tis enough, said I, fetch no more, but be a pestle, again. But it was so far from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that it ceast not to fetch water till it had overflown the room. I, much troubled at the accident, and fearing least if <hi>Pancrates</hi> should return (as he did) he would be much displeased, took an Axe, and cut the pestle in two. Then both partes taking severall buckets fetcht water. And in stead of one, I had two servants. In the mean time <hi>Pancrates</hi> came in, and perceiving what had happen'd, transform'd them into wood again, as they were before I utter'd the spell. Shortly after he secretly left me, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing went I know not wither. And can you now, said <hi>Dinomachus,</hi> make a man of a bolt? I have but one half of the Art replyed he, nor am I able to return him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his former shape If, therefore, I once make him a water bearer; we shall be driven from the house by a deluge. Will you old men, said I, never leave to speake monstrous fictions? If for no other reason, yet for these young boyes sakes, forbear your improbable, and terrible narrations till some other time, least they be insensibly fil'd with uncouth affrightments, &amp; fables. Accustome them not to hear things which will make impressions, and trouble them all their life; make them start at every sound, and fill them with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse superstitions. You do well, said <hi>Eucrates,</hi> to put me in minde of superstition. Pray what think you of Oracles, <hi>Tychiades,</hi> &amp; Predictions, &amp; Prophecies, utter'd by people inspired, and heard from Curtaines, or delivered in verse by a Virgin, which foretells things to come Cannot these things fall under your belief neither? I forbear to tell you that I have a sacred ring whose seale beares the image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and that the God himself frequently talkes with me; least you should thinke I faine this of my self, out of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:93795:185"/>
arrogance, I will only tell you what I saw and heard from <hi>Amphilochus</hi> at <hi>Mallus,</hi> who entertained me with a long discourse, and consulted the Oracle concerning my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Next I will report to you what I saw at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> &amp; heard at <hi>Patara.</hi> When I sail'd homeward from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd that there was an open, infallible Oracle at <hi>Mallus,</hi> which verbatim gave clear answers to every mans inquiryes, written in a note, and deliver'd to his Priest, I thought I should do well, as I sayl'd by, to try the Oracle, and consult the God concerning my future fortunes. I by this entrance perceiving that <hi>Eucrates</hi> was likely to length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his story, and that he had begun no very compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous discourse of Oracles, and not holding it fit to contradict them longer, leaving him sailing from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Mallus</hi> (for I saw them discontented with my presence, as an opposer of their fictions) I will take my leave, said I, and go seek <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontichus.</hi> For I have urgent occasion to meet with him. You, who thinke humane passages not sufficient, have the liberty to call the Gods into your fabulous discourses. And having so said, I departed. They, glad of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in likelyhood entertained, and feasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with impostures. I, cloy'd with what I heard, am come to you, <hi>Philocles,</hi> just like those who having drunk new wine, and swoln their belly, have need to vomit: I would give any money for a potion of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion to make me forget, and to wash away the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous remembrance of what I heard.

               <p>Since, <hi>Crato,</hi> by the bitternesse of your inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, I guesse you have long studyed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparage both dances, and the Art of dancing, and us who delight in such showes, as if we misbusied our selves in a vain, womanish exercise, know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your errour, and how much you have decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your self, to blame one of the most excellent recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of life.

               <p>For you, most delicate <hi>Lycinus,</hi> being such a man as you are, well bred, and indifferently instructed in Philosophy, to forsake the best studies, and the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ancients, to sit listning to fidlers, and to see an effeminate fellow loosly clad, charm you with bawdy songes, and act the loves of such ancient strumpets as the lustfull <hi>Phaedra, Parthenope,</hi> and <hi>Rhodope,</hi> and all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with Knick-Knacks, obscene gestures, and sounds of the feet, are, doubtlesse, most ridiculous pastimes, and little beseeming one of your free education. Wherefore hearing how you imployed your time in such spectacles, I not only blusht for you, but was much grieved, that having studyed <hi>Plato, Chrysippus,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> you should sit and suffer, like them whose eares are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As vertuous Sights, rare Musitians, and artificiall Singers to the Harp, in grave Tragedyes, and merry Comedyes, which deserve to be stiled exercises. You had need, therefore, gentle Sir, frame a large Apology to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if you mean not to be utterly expell'd, and banisht from the flock of the vertuous. Your best course, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in my opinion, will be to cure all by a deniall, and not at all to confesse your self guilty of such a crime. And for the future take heed least, unknown to us, of the man you were, you be transformed into some <hi>Lyde,</hi> or <hi>Bacche.</hi> And so not only raise an imputation on your self, but on us also, if like <hi>Ulysses,</hi> wee draw you not from the inchanted cup, and reduce you to your former studyes, before you be insensibly ensnared by the <hi>Syrens</hi> of the Theater.

               <speaker>Lycinus.</speaker>
               <p>'Twas the thing I should have craved of you, <hi>Crato.</hi> For you shall shortly perceive whether what I shall say appear to you trifling. First, then, you plainly seem to mee not to know, that dancing is no new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of yesterdayes, or the other dayes growth, or born among our fore-fathers, or their Ancestours. But they who most truely derive dancing, say it sprung with the first beginning of the universe; and had a birth equally as ancient as love. Since the regular motion of the starres, and the combination of the fixt with the planets, their musicall consort, and well order'd harmony, are but so many examples of the originall of dancing. Which increasing by degrees, and alwaies gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new accesses for the best, hath at length arrived to its perfection, and is become a various, harmonious, and musicall vertue. The Goddesse <hi>Cybele,</hi> as they report, first delighted with the Art, enjoyned the <hi>Coribantes</hi> in <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and the <hi>Curetes</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> to use dancing. From whose practice of it she received no small benefit. For they, dancing round him, saved her sonne <hi>Iupiter</hi>; who cannot but ascribe his preservation to them, by whose measures he escapt his fathers teeth. The manner of their dancing was in Armour, with Swords clasht against Bucklers; at once expressing a divinely inspired, &amp; warlike measure. In time, the noblest <hi>Cretans</hi> studiously addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting themselves to this exercise, became most excellent dancers, as well private men, as Princes, and such as bore sway. <hi>Homer,</hi> therefore, intending not to disparage but to commend <hi>Meriones,</hi> called him <hi>Dancer</hi>: Who was so famous and generally renowned for this quality, that he was thereby not only known to the <hi>Greekes,</hi> but to the <hi>Trojans</hi> his enimies too. Who observed, I suppose, a kind of beauty in his fights, and musicall Gesture, which he
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93795:188"/>
tooke in from dancing. The verses speake thus of him;
<q>
                     <l>Soon had my Spear peirc't thee, <hi>Meriones,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Although a Dancer—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Though he were not, in truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vanquisht, but by his Skill in dancing, I suppose, easily avoided the darts hurl'd at him. Though I might make instance in diverse other <hi>Hero's</hi> who busied themselves in this quality, &amp; made their exercise an Art; Yet I will content my self with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>optolemus, Achilles</hi> sonne: Who so excell'd in this Science, that he added thereto the noblest kind, from him called the <hi>Pyrrhichian</hi> Dance. <hi>Achilles,</hi> also, himself, hearing thus much of his sonne, was more joy'd, I beleive, then with his excellent shape, or strength of bodye. Nay the Citty of <hi>Troy</hi> remain'd unconquer'd, till by his skill in dancing 'twas ruined, and laid levell with the ground. The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> also, who were alwaies held the stoutest <hi>Grecians,</hi> having learnt from <hi>Castor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> to <hi>Caryatize</hi> (which is a kind of Dance, taught at first by the <hi>Caryans,</hi> a people of <hi>Laconia,</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all their Atchievements afterwards in musick; and made war by the sound of the pipe, and the orderly treadings and measures of the foot, so that the fife still gave the signall to the battle; which made them so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally victorious, musick and numbers still directing their Marches. You may observe their young men no lesse addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to dancing, then to bear Armes. For having at Armes end a while strugled, and mutually given, and received blowes, after a short respite, their encounters end in a dance. Where a minstrell set in the middest, playes, and keepes time with his foot; whilest they regularly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another, and ordering their motions by his tunes, cast themselves into figures of all sorts; sometimes war-like; sometimes amorous; most suitable to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Nay the Song which they sing in dancing
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:93795:188"/>
weares the name of <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi>; As if they joyned with them in their sporting and dancing. And another song they have (for they sing too) which comprehendes how to dance; and runs thus.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Farre, Boyes, be hence unskillfull feet:</l>
                  <l>Let every step in numbers meet.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>That is, dance better. The like custome have they who danc't the Bracelet. A kind of dance common to young men, and virgins. In which one so succeeded another, as to resemble a Bracelet. For a young man led, and exprest all the youthfull motions which he was to practice afterwards in the war; A Virgin blushingly followed, and so exprest the motions of a woman, that from both sprung a Bracelet, compounded of modesty, and valour. Like to these is the dance call'd the Bare feet. As for the dance, which <hi>Homer,</hi> in his shield, makes for <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and that other dance contrived by <hi>Daedalus</hi> for her, I passe over as well known to you. As, also, the two leaders of the dance, which the Poet there calls dancers on their heads; besides what he there sayes;
<q>
                     <l>The Youthes in Dancing rowl'd</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As if dancing were the greatest ornament, <hi>Vulcan</hi> had inserted into the shield. Nor is it strange that the <hi>Corcyrans</hi> should so much delight in dancing, being a people so delicate, and so abounding with all plenty. That, therefore, which <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Ulysses</hi> most admire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them was the nimblenesse of their feet. In <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly</hi> the exercise of dancing hath so prevailed, that they stile their Princes, and Generalls the Leaders of the dance. As appears by the Inscription of their Statues, which they erect to the best deservers. The Citty, sayes one, prefer'd him as the fore-dancer. The people, sayes, another, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate these Statues to <hi>Ilation</hi> for dancing the battle well. I spare to tell you, that you shall scarce find any ancient,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:93795:189"/>
religious solemnity without dancing. A custom, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, instituted by <hi>Orpheus, Musaeus,</hi> and other excellent Dancers of that time: who, as a thing most becomming, decreed; that none should be initiated to such rites but with measure, and dancing. And to prove this true, they, who were initiated, were bound not to reveale their rites to those that were not. From whence they who divulge mysteryes, as all know, are proverbially said to undance them. At <hi>Delos</hi> no sacrifices were offer'd without dancing, and musick. Where a Quire of boyes, entring with a flute and harp, danced, and they, who among them were judged the most skillfull, followed. From whence the tunes which were composed for such Quires were call'd dance-tunes, and were set for the Violl. But why insist I upon the <hi>Graecians</hi>; since the <hi>Indians,</hi> every morning when they rise, pray to the Sunne, not as we do, who hold the killing of our hand to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat devotion, but turning themselves towards the East, salute the Sunne with a Dance; silently ordering their postures, and motions, in imitation of his. And this among the <hi>Indians</hi> is prayer, devotion, and sacrifice, with which twice a day, mornings, and evenings, they keep the Sun propitious. Then, the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> alwaies go to war dancing. Nor will a Moore offer to pluck an arrow from his head (which serves them in stead of quivers stuck round with shafts like so many rayes) till he have first danced, and by such agitation threatned, and terrified his enemy. Nor were it amisse, having past through <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> to draw our discourse down to their neighbouring <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Where the ancient fiction which goes of <hi>Proteus,</hi> methinkes, signifyes him to be only a certain Dancer, and Mimick; who could trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and change himself into all shapes, sometimes act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fluidnesse of water, sometimes the sharpnesse of fire, occasioned by the quicknesse of its aspiring moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; sometimes the fiercenesse of a Lyon, and fury of a
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:93795:189"/>
Libbard, and waving of an Oake; and what ever he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. From whence the fable, wresting his naturall parts something pardoxically, sain'd him to be really changed into the things he acted. The like abilities are found in the Dancers of our time: whom you may in an instant see suddainly metamorphosed, and turn'd into a <hi>Proteus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may, also, conjecture that <hi>Empusa,</hi> who turn'd her self into a thousand shapes, was such another woman, derived to us in a fiction. After these examples 'twere Injustice to forget the dance practiced by the <hi>Salii</hi> (the name of a certain Priesthood taken from dancing) in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Mars,</hi> the most war-like God; in which they mingled gravity with religion. Nor is the <hi>Bithynian</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble altogether unsuitable to the <hi>Italian</hi> custome, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes that <hi>Priapus,</hi> a military God, one of the <hi>Titans,</hi> I believe, or <hi>Idaean</hi> Dactyls, learnt this exercise with his Armes. For Mars receiving him from <hi>Iuno</hi> yet a boy, boysterous, and beyond measure manly, taught him not to bear Armes before he had made him a perfect Dancer. For which the reward assigned by <hi>Iuno,</hi> was, that he should ever after have the tithe of his spoyles taken in war. I presume you expect not I should tell you of the <hi>Bacchanalls,</hi> or feasts of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; whose celebration was nothing but dancing. Now of the noblest sort of Dances, there are three kindes, the Cordacke or Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Sicinnidde or Satyricall, &amp; Harmonious or Tragicall, which were invented by the Satyres, the followers of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> from whom they take their names. And <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> himself using this Art subdued the <hi>Tuscanes, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> and danced down war like Nations with Javelines wrapt in Ivye. Wherefore take heed, admired Sir, least you prove impious thus to accuse so Divine, and Mysterious an exercise, practiced by such illustrious Gods, and performed in their honour and which carryes with it so much pleasure joyn'd with so much usefull discipline. I cannot but wonder, that being so great a
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:93795:190"/>
lover of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Hesiod,</hi> as you are (for I once more betake my self to the Poets) you dare controule them, who above all things praise dancing. For <hi>Homer</hi> having muster'd together the things most delightfull, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable, sleep, love, singing, and dancing, stiles this last onely praise worthy; ascribing, indeed, sweetnesse to singing, both which are found in dancing; namely Harmony of voice, and commendable measure, which you thus study to carpe at. Again in another place of his poem he sayes;
<q>
                     <l>To some Iove gives of war-like actions choice,</l>
                     <l>Dancing to some, to some a charming voice.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For, certainly, a good voice, joyn'd with dancing, is very charming, and the most excellent gift of the Gods. Again <hi>Homer,</hi> having divided all things into war, and peace, opposeth this as the more commendable to the passages of warre. And as for <hi>Hesiod,</hi> who went not by hear-say, but early in the morning saw the Muses dance, in the beginning of his Poem sets this as their greatest praise, that in soft measures they danced round about a flowrye fountain, and encircled their fathers Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Yet you, Gentle Sir, almost making war with the Gods, calumniate dancing. Though <hi>Socrates,</hi> of all men the wisest, (if we may beleeve <hi>Apollo,</hi> who sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him so) not only praised dancing, but vouchsaft to learn it, ascribing much to the Elegancy, and Grace, and Musicall Treadings, and amiable behaviour of such a mover. Nor blusht he, though old, to reck on dancing among his serious imployments. In which, you may guesse, he spent no small studye, who refused not to learn Arts yet meaner, nor disdayned to frequent the scooles of the Minstrells, and to attend the Lectures of <hi>Alpasia,</hi> a known Whore. Yet he beheld this Art one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its first rising, before 'twas grown up to such height of perfection. Did he see those who in our time have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:93795:190"/>
advanc'd it to this great pitch, I assure my self, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all other studyes he would wholly apply his minde to this spectacle, and would teach his Schollers nothing else. In praising Comedy, and Tragedy, you seem to me to forget that in either a peculiar kind of dancing is observed; the grave in Tragedy, in Comedy the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dack, and sometimes also the Sicinnidd. But because at first you prefer'd Tragedy, and Comedy, and vagrant fidlers, and singing to the harpe, before dancing; calling them truely exercises, and therefore commendable: let us, I pray, compare them severally with Dancing. Where, if please you, we will passs over the Pipe, and Harpe, as parts and instruments of Dancing, and consider Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as it is, first, according to its propertyes, and dresse. What a deformed, and frightfull fight is it to see a man raised to a prodigious length, stalking upon exalted bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, his face disguised with a grimme vizard, widely gaping, as if he meant to devoure the Spectatours? I forbear to speake of his stuft Brests, and fore-Bellyes, which make an adventitious, and artificiall corpulency, least his unnaturall length should carry disproportion to his slendernesse. As, also, his clamour from within, when he breakes open, and unlockes himself, and when he howles lambicks, and most ridiculously singes his own sufferings, and renders himself by his very tone odious. For as for the rest, they are inventions of ancient Poets. Yet as long as he personates only some <hi>Andromache,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hecuba,</hi> his singing is tolerable. But for a <hi>Hercules</hi> to enter dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully singing, and to forget himself, and neither to regard his Lyons skinne, nor clubbe, must needs, to any judging man, appear a Solcecisme. And whereas you dislike that in dancing men should act women, is a reprehension which holds for Tragedyes, and Comedyes too; in which are more womens parts, then mens. Besides, as part of the delight, Comedy challengeth to it self the most ridiculous parts; as Parasites, Fidlers, and Cookes. But the propertyes
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:93795:191"/>
of a Dancer are so comely, and decent, that I need not describe them, being visible to all but the blind. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gracefully adorn'd, and agreeable to his part; not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping like the others, but decently closed, under which many sing their own Tunes. For anciently the Dancers sung too, till 'twas found, that Motion, and shortnesse of Breath troubled the Voice; whereupon 'twas better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that they should be sung to. The Argument of both are alike. Nor do Dances differ from Tragedies, but that These have more variety, and are more variously studied, and admit more severall Changes. The reason why there are no Dancing-matches I take to be, because the Judges held it to be a thing too reverend, and solemn to be brought into Decision. Though there be a famous City in <hi>Italy,</hi> descended of the <hi>Negroponts,</hi> where Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Prizes are assigned to this Exercise. And here I desire to be excused for my omissions of many things not toucht, and that you will not impute them to my ignorance, or want of Learning. For 'tis not unknown to me, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have heretofore written of Dancing, and have spent most of their industry, and Style, in decyphering the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinds of Dances; their Names, Distinctions, and who were their Inventors: wherein they thought they made shew of various learning. But I, holding such ostentations superfluous, and unseasonable, and unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my person, shall passe them over in silence. Withall, I shall desire you to remember, and think, that I intend not to derive the Pedigree of Dances of all sorts, nor make it the aime of my discourse to reckon up the names of all Dances, but of those few of the Nobler sort, before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. For the present then, the Summe of my defence is to praise the manner of dancing now in fashion; and to shew what pleasure, and profit it comprehends, and from what an ancient beginning it hath aspired to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Elegancy, or Veneration rather. For those Dancings of the first Ages were, as it were, the roots, and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:93795:191"/>
of Dancing, whose Flower, and grown Fruit now ripened into a perfection, is the Argument of my Defence: omitting to speak of Capring, or Crane-dancings, or the like, as impertinent to this discourse. Nor have I, out of oversight, past by the <hi>Phrygian</hi> manner of Dancing, which was a drunken, and feastly kind of Revelling, performed in Wine, by a Rowt of Clowns, who danced like Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a Pipe, using violent and boisterous Leapings, yet in use among Country people: but because it hath no agreement with the dancing I now treat of. Though <hi>Plato</hi> in his Laws commends some of these kinds, but rejects others; distinguishing them by their pleasure, and profit, and banishing the more uncomely, prefers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires the rest. And thus much be spoken of Dancing it self. For to extend my discourse, to all that might be said, were troublesome. I will now unfold to you how a Dancer ought to be qualified, how practised, what to learn, and by what waies to attain his Art, that you may perceive this not to be one of the facile, and easily learn'd Arts, but to be attained in perfection by the help of all the other Sciences; not Musick only, but Arithmetick, and Geometry, and especially your Philosophy, both naturall, and morall. As for Logick, it hath been held vain and uselesse to it: but Rhetorick it requires, and partakes, as far as 'tis demonstrative of manners, and affections, which are the subjects of Oratours too. Nor is it a stranger to Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Sculpture; but imitates their Graces so exactly, as not to come short of <hi>Phidias,</hi> of <hi>Apelles</hi> himself. But above all it aims to have the two Muses, <hi>Mnemosyne,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Polyhymnia</hi> propitious, and exactly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all things: for, as <hi>Calchas</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> it behoves a Dancer to know
<q>
                     <l>Things present, past, and future.—</l>
                  </q>
and not to be ignorant of any thing, but to have a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry open, and at command. In a word, 'tis an imitating
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:93795:192"/>
and demonstrating Science; an Interpreter of conceiptes, and clearer of Ambiguityes. And what <hi>Thucydides</hi> said in praise of <hi>Pericles,</hi> is the thing most praise worthy in a Dancer; which is, to know what is fit, and to expresse it. By expression I here mean a clearnesse of behaviour. So that the whole businesse of a Dancer consists in the knowledge of ancient history, the ready remembrance of it, and expressing of it with decency. Taking, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, his beginning from the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and birth of the world, he must carry his knowledge as farre as the age of the <hi>Aegyptian Cleopatra</hi>: within which space of times we circumscribe the various learning of a Dancer. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, let him learn by the way the division of Heaven, the originall of <hi>Venus,</hi> the <hi>Titans</hi> war, <hi>Iupiters</hi> birth, <hi>Cybel's</hi> plot, and substitution of a stone, <hi>Saturnes</hi> Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, the lottery of the three Brothers, as also the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants invasion, the stealth of fire, the formation of man, <hi>Prometbeus</hi> punishment, the power of love, of each sort; Then the floating of <hi>Delos,</hi> the travelling of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona, Pythons</hi> Slaughter, <hi>Tityu's</hi> Treason, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Earth found out by the flight of Eagles. Adde to this <hi>Deucalion</hi> and the Universall wrack of that Age, and the lone Arke which received and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all mankind, &amp; how Men were repayr'd from stones. Next the dismembring of <hi>Iachus, Iuno's</hi> cheate, <hi>Semele's</hi> conflagration and <hi>Bacchus</hi> double birth; &amp; whatsoever is reported of <hi>Minerva, Vulcan,</hi> and <hi>Ericbthonius</hi>; The strife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Attica,</hi> and first sentence in <hi>Areopagus</hi>; In a word, the whole <hi>Attick</hi> fable. Let him also exactly know the Erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Ceres</hi> and finding of her daughter, and hospitality of <hi>Celeus,</hi> &amp; husbandry of <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> &amp; plantation of vines by <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:93795:192"/>
                  <hi>Thrace.</hi> Then let him know <hi>Acamas,</hi> and <hi>Phyllis,</hi> and <hi>Hellens</hi> first Rape, and the expedition of the Twinnes against the City; <hi>Hippolytus</hi> mischance, and the return of the <hi>Herculeans</hi>; all which he may read in the <hi>Attick</hi> Records, which being <hi>Athenian</hi> passages, I have briefly, for examples sake, run over. Next, let him learn the story of <hi>Megara, Nisus,</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> and the purple Hair, and <hi>Mino</hi>'s departure, and his ingratitude towards his Assister. To which let him adde the Atchievements wrought at <hi>Cytheron,</hi> and <hi>Thebes;</hi> the calamities of the people, <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Banishment, and sign taken from the lying down of a Cow; the Serpents teeth sown, and springing up again; as also <hi>Cadmus</hi> transformation into a Serpent; the erection of Walls by Musick, the Builders madnesse, his wife <hi>Niobes</hi> insolent pride, and stupefaction through Griefe. As, also, the story of <hi>Pentheus, Actaeon, Oedipus,</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> together with his Labours, and slaughter of his Children. Nor is <hi>Corinth</hi> lesse fraught with stories of <hi>Glauce,</hi> and <hi>Creon</hi>; and before these <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> and <hi>Sthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neboea</hi>; and the Combate between <hi>Neptune</hi> and the Sun; as also the Madnesse of <hi>Athamas,</hi> and aëry flight of <hi>Nephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> children upon a Ramme; and the Receipt of <hi>Ino,</hi> and <hi>Melicerta.</hi> To which may be added the Reports which go of the <hi>Pelopidae,</hi> and <hi>Mycenae,</hi> and more ancient then these of <hi>Inachus</hi> and <hi>Io,</hi> and her keeper <hi>Argus</hi>; of <hi>Atreus</hi> also, and <hi>Thyestes,</hi> and <hi>Aerope,</hi> and the Golden Fleece, and <hi>Pelops</hi> Wedding, and <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s slaughter, and <hi>Clytem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestra</hi>'s punishment: and more ancient yet then these; the expedition of the Seven Generals, and the receipt of <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> fugitive Sons in Law, and the Oracle which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of them; besides, the deniall of Buriall to the slain, and the destruction of <hi>Antigone,</hi> and <hi>Menoeceus</hi> thereupon; the stories also which are recorded in <hi>Neméa</hi> of <hi>Hypsipyle,</hi> and <hi>Archemorus,</hi> are monuments most necessarily to be known of a Dancer. Who before that is also to know what is said of <hi>Danae's</hi> Virginity, the birth of <hi>Perseus,</hi> and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:93795:193"/>
his enterprize against the <hi>Gorgons</hi>; to which he is to joyn the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Reports which go of <hi>Cassiopea,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda</hi> and <hi>Cepheus,</hi> whom the Superstition of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have placed among the Stars. Nor ought he to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the ancient passages of <hi>Aegyptus,</hi> and <hi>Danaus,</hi> and the Treasons of that Wedding. Nor will <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> afford a few such examples, of <hi>Hyacinthus,</hi> and <hi>Zephyrus</hi> Rivall to <hi>Apollo</hi>; and the slaughter of the Boy by a Quoit, and the Flower which sprung from his bloud, and the mournfull Inscription written in it; as, also, the restoring of <hi>Tyndarus</hi> from the dead, and <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s displeasure therefore against <hi>Aesculapius.</hi> Besides, the entertainment of <hi>Paris,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Helen,</hi> after the decision of the Apple. And to this <hi>Spartan</hi> History he is to annex the <hi>Trojan,</hi> no lesse copious, and full of parts; from whence, according as every one fell, may be drawn Arguments for the Stage. All which he is upon occasion to remember; especially what hapned after <hi>Helens</hi> Transportation, 'till the return of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Captains. <hi>Aenea</hi>'s wandrings, also, and <hi>Dido's</hi> Love. Nor will the reports which passe of <hi>Orestes</hi> be impertinent, and of his adventures in <hi>Scythia.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, the stories which go of <hi>Achilles,</hi> answerable to his <hi>Trojan</hi>; his disguise of a Girle in <hi>Scyrus; Ulysses</hi> distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and desertion of <hi>Philoctetes</hi>; In a word, all <hi>Ulysses</hi> Travels, the stories of <hi>Circe,</hi> and <hi>Telegonus,</hi> and <hi>Aeolus</hi> Empire over the Winds, and other passages along to the revenge taken of the Suitors: And before that his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Palamedes, Nauplius</hi> Rage, <hi>Ajax</hi> Phrenzy, and the shipwrack of the other <hi>Ajax</hi> against Rocks. <hi>Elis</hi> also hath many patterns for Dancers; as <hi>Oenomaus, Myrtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is <hi>Arcadia</hi> lesse replenisht with stories, of <hi>Daphne's</hi> flight, <hi>Callisto's</hi> conversion into a Bear, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures drunkennesse, <hi>Pan</hi>'s Parents, <hi>Alpheus</hi> Love, and <hi>Hyphalus</hi> Peregrination. And if we will send our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course into <hi>Creet,</hi> dancing may from thence fetch nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

examples, taken from <hi>Europa, Pasiphae,</hi> and both their Buls; the Labyrinth, also, <hi>Ariadne, Phaedra, Minotaure, Daedalus, Icarus, Glaucus,</hi> the Prophecy of <hi>Polyides; Talo,</hi> also, and the Brazen wall of the City. If you look into <hi>Aetolia,</hi> many Instances may from thence, also, be taken for dancing; from <hi>Althaea, Meleager, Atalanta, Dalus,</hi> the Combate between the River and <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Birth of the <hi>Sirens,</hi> the Retribution of the <hi>Echinades,</hi> and habitation of <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> after his Madnesse; <hi>Nessus,</hi> also, and <hi>Deïanei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> Jealousie; to which is to be added the Funerall pile in <hi>Oeta. Thrace,</hi> also, hath many examples requisite to a dancer; as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and his dismembring; his vocall Head swimming along with his Harp: <hi>Haemus,</hi> also, and <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dope,</hi> and the punishment of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> But <hi>Thessalia</hi> is yet more copious in instances, of <hi>Pelias, Iason, Alcestis,</hi> the Fleet of fifty Ships, the <hi>Argo,</hi> and its speaking Keel; the passages of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> also concerning <hi>Aeta, Medea's</hi> dream, and dilaniation of <hi>Absyrtus,</hi> and what befell her in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: To which are to be added <hi>Protesilaus,</hi> and <hi>Laoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meia.</hi> If you will once more passe into <hi>Asia,</hi> you shall meet with as plentifull arguments, where <hi>Samus</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently accost you, and the calamity of <hi>Polycrates,</hi> and his daughters voyage into <hi>Persia</hi>; besides the more ancient passages of <hi>Tantalus</hi> Babling, and his Feasting of the Gods. The eating of <hi>Pelops</hi> flesh, supplyed with an Ivory shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In <hi>Italy</hi> you meet with <hi>Eridanus,</hi> and <hi>Phaeton,</hi> and his sisters bewailing themselves into Poplars, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Amber. A Dancer is to know all the story of the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> and the Dragon-keeper of the Golden fruit; of <hi>Geryon,</hi> also, and his conveyance of the Oxen from <hi>Erythia.</hi> Nor is he to be ignorant of all the Fabulous Transmutations which have been made of things into Trees, or Beasts, or Fowls, or Women turn'd into Men; I mean <hi>Caeneus,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Tiresias,</hi> and the like: and in <hi>Phoenicia Myrrha,</hi> and the divided sorrow of the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> Nor shall he only know these, but the more
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:93795:194"/>
modern passages, attempted by <hi>Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire, for the love of <hi>Stratonice.</hi> He shall, also, know the most secret Mysteryes of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>; That he may the more Symbollically act them; I mean <hi>Epaphus,</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> and the transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gods into beasts; especially what ever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of their loves, and of <hi>Iupiter</hi> himself, and his various shift of disguises. He shall, also, be skill'd in all the passages of Hell; in their tortures, and their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall causes, and in the undivided friendshippe of <hi>Theseus,</hi> and <hi>Perithous,</hi> even in that infernall place. And to comprize all in a word, he shall be ignorant of nothing deliver'd either by <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Hesiod,</hi> or the most excellent Poets, especially the Tragick. And thus have I recounted a few examples of many, or rather infinite, and rudely hudled them up in a Masse. The rest I leave to be sung by Poets, and to acted by Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to be pursued by you according to these patterns and instances. All which a Dancer must have in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, and prepared to be brought forth, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon occasion. Now because he is to be a Mimick, and to expresse by motions what is sung in verse, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, like Oratours, he should practice perspicuity, that every part of which he acts, may carry its own light, and not require an Interpreter. And as the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle said, he that sees a Dance, must understand the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer though dumbe, and hear him though silent. As it befell <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the Cynick Philosopher; who, like you, spoke much in disparagement of Dancing; sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Dancer, the idle imployment of a pipe, and fiddle, and noyse; who added nothing to a Maske, but an absurd, vain, and senselesse motion; and that it was the part of a Jugler, not of a Dancer, to be drest in silke clothes, guilt vizards, and to move to a pipe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious tune, and wanton voice. A skillfull dancer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the story goes, in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn'd,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:93795:194"/>
but well verst in history, and the Art of gesture, desired <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with the most becomming intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes he could, I suppose, to see him dance, and then to reprehend him. He promised also to act before him without either Pipe, or Tune, and did so: For having imposed silence to the Minstrels, and Fidlers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, he by himself danced the Adultery of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> the Sun betraying them, and <hi>Vulcan</hi> plotting and catching them in a wire Net. Then every God, who was seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spectator; then <hi>Venus</hi> blushing, and <hi>Mars</hi> beseeching; In a word, he acted the whole Fable so well, that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> much pleased with the spectacle, as the greatest praise could be bestow'd upon him, cryed out, and in a loud voice said, I hear, my Friend, what you act; Nor do I only see them, but methinks you speak with your Hands. And because my Discourse is fallen upon <hi>Nero</hi>'s times, I will report to you a passage of a Stranger concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same Dancer, who gave the greatest praise of his dancing that could be. This Barbarian Prince, being come from <hi>Pontus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> about some business with <hi>Nero,</hi> among other entertainments saw this Dancer personate so lively, that though he knew nothing of what was sung (being half a <hi>Grecian</hi>) yet he understood all. Being to return to his Country after this entertainment of <hi>Nero's,</hi> and bid ask what he would, and it should be granted, Give me the Dancer, said he, and you shall much please me. <hi>Nero</hi> asking him of what use he could be to him, My neighbour Barbarians, said he, are of a different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor is it easie for me to find interpreters for them. This Fellow, therefore, as often as I have need, shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to me by Gestures; such praise gain'd his Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Dancing, being significant and clear. The chiefe businesse, and aime of Dancing, then, is, as I said, Personation; which is to be perform'd by the rules of Rhetoricians, especially of those who busie themselves in Declamations. In which, the thing most praiseworthy is
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:93795:195"/>
to resemble their subjects, and not to let the things said disagree from the Princes, or Tyrant-slayers, or Beggers, or Husbandmen spoken of, but to give every one his propriety, and distinction. I will report to you the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another Barbarian to this purpose: who seeing five Arguments provided, (for the Presentment consisted of so many parts) and seeing but one Dancer, askt who should act, and personate the rest; and being told that one would undergoe the whole performance, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in you, my Friend, said he, who have but one Body, and many Soules. Thus the Barbarian. Nor do the <hi>Italians,</hi> without reason built upon his performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, call a Dancer a <hi>Pantomime,</hi> or generall Actor. The Poets excellent exhortation therefore, which sayes,
<q>
                     <l>When thou in Cities Stay dost make,</l>
                     <l>The mind of a pourcontrell take,</l>
                  </q>
is very necessary for a Dancer, who must vary with his Argument, and transforme himself into every part he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents. Especially Dancing undertakes to act, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate behaviours, and passions of all sorts; sometimes bringing a Lover on the Stage, sometimes a cholerick man, sometimes a man distracted, sometimes one lost in sorrow, and all this gracefully. And what is most strange, upon one and the same day, it presents at one time <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> frantick, at another, <hi>Ino</hi> trembling; at another <hi>Atreus,</hi> presently after <hi>Thyestes,</hi> then <hi>Aegysthus,</hi> or <hi>Aerope,</hi> and all this by one man. In other showes, and sights, severall things are severally represented; as the Pipe, or Harp, or melody of the voice, or action of a Tragedy, or merry performance of a Comedy. But a Dancer doth expresse all these; in whose presentations you may behold vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously compounded, and mixt, the Wayte, and Flute, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the Feet, shrilnesse of the Cymball, tunable voice of an Actor, and consort of a Quire. Besides, in other performances, one part of the man is only imploy'd:
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:93795:195"/>
where some parts concern only the Soul, others the Body. But in Dancing both are mixt, where what is done exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the mind with the exercise, and activity of the Body. But the thing most regardfull is the discretion, and <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> there observed. <hi>Lesbonax,</hi> therefore, the <hi>Mitylenian,</hi> an honest and vertuous man, used to call Dancers, Handy-wisemen; and went frequently to see them, as if he return'd better from the Theater: whose Tutor <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> seeing once by chance, not of set purpose, a Dancer performe his parts, cryed out, What rare sights have I lost through a Philosophicall modesty? Now if it be true, what <hi>Plato</hi> delivers of the Soul; A Dancer most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently represents the 3 parts of it: The irascible, when he acts an angry man; the Concupiscible, when he presents a Lover; and the Rationall, when he puts a bridle to every affection. For Reason is mingled, and scatter'd with all parts of Dancing, as Feeling is with the other Senses. Now what doth this wisdome of the mind, made visible by the gracefulnesse of Dancing, but verifie <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s saying, who praising Beauty, cals it <hi>the third part of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> And as for the silence sometimes used by dancers, I have heard some in a youthfull <hi>Hyperbole</hi> praise it as a piece of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> discipline. And whereas other Studies carry with them either pleasure only, or profit, dancing only hath both, and renders profit the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable coming drest in pleasure. For how much a more delightfull Spectacle is this, then to see Young men cuff, and flow with Bloud, and wrestle in the dust, when they might much safelier, and comelier, and with more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure be seen in a dance. The decent motions, therefore, of dancing, gracefull postures, turnings, treadings, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prings, are both delightfull to the spectators, and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Actors. For I must think that the best and most proportionable exercise, which both supples the body, and renders it flexible, and pliant, and bending to all postures, and strengthens it too. How can dancing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:93795:196"/>
then, choose, but be the most accomplisht exercise, which thus whets the soul, exerciseth the body, delights the beholders, and instructs them in much antiquity, and equally by Flutes, and Cymballs, and the gracefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the limbes, diffuseth its charmes to the eyes, and eares? If, therefore, you affect the harmony of the voice where can you meet a fuller, or more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious consort? If you delight in ayres of the Cornet, or Flute, Dancing will abundantly supply you. I spare to tell you, that by such spectacles, and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Theater, you will be better'd in your manners, by learning to hate fowle deedes presented, and to bewayle those who are innocently unfortunate; And seeing the whole behaviour of the Spectators di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplined. But that which I most extoll in Dancers is their Art, both to show strength, and softnesse; Nor is it to me lesse then a Paradox, for the same person, in the same performance, to expresse the boystrousnesse of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the delicacy of <hi>Venus.</hi> But I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to show how a good Dancer must be qualifyed both in his minde and body. Though I have already reckon'd most of the endowments of his soul, who must have a fast memory, piercing wit, sharpe understanding, able to distinguish times well; he must also be a Critick of Poems, and songes, able to discern Dittyes well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and to reject the ill. A draught of his body, I will give you by <hi>Polycletus</hi> rules. Which must not be over tall, nor too low, or dwarfish, but of a moderate size; neither over fleshy, which is prodigious, nor over lean, like a Sceleton, or a Anatomy. To this purpose, I will report to you some showtes of dislike utter'd by a people, who are no dull observers. The Cityzens of Antioch are most ingenious, and much addicted to dancing; and so given to marke what is said, or done, that no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage escapes them. Seeing, upon a time, a little, short Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer enter, and act <hi>Hector,</hi> they cryed out with one
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:93795:196"/>
voice, This is <hi>Astyanax,</hi> but where's <hi>Hector?</hi> Another time a fellow of an overgrown length preparing to dance <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paneus,</hi> and to scale the walls of <hi>Thebes,</hi> they told him he might mount the wall without a ladder. Another time, a very big, and corpulent dancer, endeavouring to vault high, We had need, said they, to underprop the Stage. To a very lean Dancer, they cryed out, God strengthen you; as if he had been in a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have alleadged these Examples, not to stir your laughter, but that you may know, that whole nations have so applyed their studies to dancing, as to be able to distinguish the right performance from the absurd. A Dancer, then, must be of an active, pliant, and compacted body; able upon occasion to make quick Turnes, and, if need be, to stop strongly. And that Dancing is no stranger to the warlick gestures of the hands, but partakes the vertues in combating of <hi>Mercury, Pollux,</hi> and <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> you may perceive by severall presentments. <hi>Herodotus</hi> holds, that the Representations which are taken in by the Sight, are much more authentick then those which are taken in by the Ear. Dancing satisfies both sences, and conveies such strong impressions, that a certain Lover passing through the Theater was cured, by seeing the ill successes of Love; and though he came possess'd with a deep melancholly, departed cheerfull, as if he had drunck some potion of Oblivion; or, according to the Poet, Some draught of <hi>Nepenthe</hi> against Sadness. Now the sign of proper Action, and that the Presentment is universally understood, are the tears shed by the Spectators, as often as any calamitous, or tragicall passage is brought upon the Stage. The Bacchanall manner of dancing, exercised especially in <hi>Ionia,</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> being also Satyrick, doth so inchant the people, that at certain times appointed, they neglect all other businesse, and sit whole daies to see the <hi>Titans, Corybantes, Satyrs,</hi> and Clowns acted, which are danced by the most noble, and greatest personages of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:93795:197"/>
every City, who think it no dishonour, but rather value themselves more for such performances, then for their Births, Attendances, and Dignities of their Ancestours. And thus having deciphered the vertues of Dancers, give me leave to decipher the vices too. Those of the Body I have shown already. Those of the Mind you may thus observe. There are many, who out of ignorance (for 'tis not possible that all should be wise) commit great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loecismes in Dancing: such, I mean, whose actions are irregular, and not to the Tune, as they say; when the Foot sayes one thing, and the Instrument another. Others keep proportion to the Musick, but their Presentments, as I have often seen, are disproportioned to the right time. For you shall have one, who endeavouring to act <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> Birth, and <hi>Saturn</hi> eating his Children, danceth <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes</hi> sufferings, for the affinity of the Fables. Again, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being to act <hi>Semele</hi> burnt with Lightning, likens <hi>Glauce</hi> to her, born long after. Yet is not Dancing to be scorn'd, because there are such Dancers; nor is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise to be hated, but such Actors to be held unskilfull; and they to be praised, who, according to the right rules of their Art regularly make their performances. In a word, a Dancer must be every way exact, do all things with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, decency, measure, like himself, beyond detraction, blame, and imperfections; have thoughts of the best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, an Education quick, a deep Apprehension, and especially humane: whose applause must necessarily follow his performances, when every Spectator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds himself acted; and sees in the Dancer, as in a Glass, whatever he useth to do, or suffer. For then men cannot containe for pleasure, but poure themselves forth in tumultuous praises, when every one sees the Images of his mind presented, and owns them. For the <hi>Delphick</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, <hi>Know thy self,</hi> is by such spectacles so artificially instill'd into them, that they depart from the Theater taught what to choose, and what to shunne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93795:197"/>
in those things which before they knew not. For as in speech so in Dancing, over-affectation is the fault of many, who strive to exceed the bounds of imitation, and strain beyond <hi>Decorum.</hi> As when some great passage is to be presented, to show it over great; or if some soft passage, to present it too womanish; or to stretch some manly Atchievement to savagenesse, and bestiality. As I once saw a Dancer, formerly much approved, and in his other performances discreet, and worthy to be admired, I know not by what mischance disgrace himself by over action. For being to dance <hi>Ajax</hi> after his vanquishment distracted, he failed so grossely, that some thought he acted not a madnesse, but was himself distemper'd. For he rent the garment of one of those who stampt in Iron shooes; and snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cornet from one of the Fidlers, struck <hi>Ulysses,</hi> who stood by, insulting for his victory, such a blow on the head, that if his Helmet had not saved him, and borne off the violence of the stroke, the wretched party had perisht, and fallen prostrate at his feet. Though the whole Theater of Spectators, as mad as <hi>Ajax,</hi> stampt, showted, and shooke their cloathes. For the Rout, and Idiots, who knew not <hi>Decorum,</hi> nor were able to distinguish false action from right, took this as a great expression of fury. And the better bred, and more understanding, though they blusht at what was done, yet show'd not any dislike as much as by their silence; but colour'd the Dancers folly with their commendations. Though they plainly saw not the madnesse of <hi>Ajax,</hi> but of the representer acted. Not herewith content the Gentleman plaid a prank much more ridiculous. For descending into the pit he sate down between two who had been Consulls; much affraid least he should have mistaken, and beaten one of them for a sheep: which passage some extolled, others derided; others suspected his over Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:93795:198"/>
had cast him into a true Madnesse. Others report, that after he came to himselfe, he was so ashamed of his action, that upon the true apprehension of his distemper, he fell sick for grief, and plainly profest it. For those of his Faction reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him to act <hi>Ajax</hi> over again to them, When I come next upon the Stage, said he; In the mean time 'tis enough for me to have once play'd the Madman. But his chiefe discontent sprung from an Antagonist, or Anti-Actor, who represented <hi>Ajax</hi> Raging, so gracefully, and discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was much extolled, keeping himself within the limits of dancing, and not breaking forth into any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper action. These few examples, and exercises of dancing, of many, have I, my Friend, recounted to you, that you should not too much resent my thirst, and desire to frequent them. If, therefore, you will vouchsafe to partake of the Spectacle, I assure my self you will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled, and become in love with Dancing. Nor shall I need to apply that saying of <hi>Circe</hi> to you,
<q>
                     <l>I wonder by my Cup you'r not encharm'd;</l>
                  </q>
for you will be enchanted; not to have the head of an Asse, or heart of a Swine, but your understanding will be much more confirm'd, and you for pleasure will leave little of the Potion undrunk. For what <hi>Homer</hi> sayes of <hi>Mercury's</hi> Golden Rod, that he thereby charmes up the Eyes of whom he lists, and rewakens them from sleep, is truly verified of Dancing, which wakes, and unlocks the eyes of the Beholders, and rouzes up their minds to all the passages of Life.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diogenes.</speaker>

               <p>First, I will take you and strippe you of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and confine you to poverty, and apparrell you in a patcht Coat. Next, I will enjoyn you to labour, and toyle, to sleep on the ground, to drinke water, and to eat what comes next. If you have any wealth, by my directions you shall cast it into the sea. You shall take no thought for Wife, Children, or Country, but esteem them Toyes. Leaving the house you were born to, you shall inhabit either some Cave, forsaken turret, or Tub. A Scrip you shall have fill'd with Lupines, and endorsed bookes. Thus furnisht, you shall call your self much happier then the greatest King. If you be beaten, or rackt, you shall pretend no torment.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Diogenes.</speaker>
               <p>You shall imitate that saying of <hi>Euripides</hi> a litle alterd.</p>

               <p>But the things which you are chiefly to learn, are to be impudent, bold, to barke without distinction at all, both Kinges, and private men. A way to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and admire you, for a valiant man. Let your speech be Barbarous, and your Elocution rude, and Artlesse, like a dogge. Let your look be forced and your Gate be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to your look. In a word, let your whole behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be beastly and savage. Be Modestly, Gentlenesse, and

moderation far from you, and all blushing quite blotted out of your face. You are to frequent, also, populous places, and there to walk alone, and unaccompanied, and neither to salute acquaintance, or stranger; for that were to destroy your Empire. Then, you are undauntedly to do that in publick, which no man else would do in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and to performe the Acts of <hi>Venus</hi> after the most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous manner.

               <p>I, but, Sir, as soon as I undisguise him, I shall know the truth. But what end propose you to

your wisedome? And by what meanes will you arrive to the height of vertue?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chrysippus.</speaker>
               <p>First I busie my self about the chiefest things in nature. As riches, health, and the like; but first much labour is necessarily to be undergone. The sight to be accustomed to small prints, comments to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, Soloecismes, and absurd speeches to be noted. In a word, no man can be wise till he have drunke Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore thrice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant.</speaker>
               <p>Your studies are very generous, and manly. But to be a Banker, or Usurer (for such a one you are) must a man drinke Hellebore, and be perfectly vertuous?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Chrysip.</speaker>
               <p>He must. For 'tis fit only for a wise man to let out money, whose propertie only is to make Syllogismes. For to let out mony, and to compute the usury, have neer affinity with making of Syllogismes. So that as the one agrees only to a vertuous man, so doth the other, who is not to take single increase like other men, but use up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on use. For do you not know that there is a first, and second use, and one the off-spring of the other? You may perceive it in this Syllogisme;
<q>
                     <l>He that receives the first use is to</l>
                     <l>receive the second,</l>
                     <l>But he hath received the first use, <hi>ergo</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>He is to receive the second.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant.</speaker>
               <p>Holds this, I pray, for the rewards too, which you take for reading wisedome to your Schollers? Methinkes vertuous men should ayme at no reward but vertue.</p>

Moved therefore with indignation, wee have risen from the dead against thee, and as many as thou seest here, <hi>Chrysippus, Epicurus, Plato</hi> My selfe, <hi>Aristotle</hi> there, and silent <hi>Pythagoras, Diogenes</hi> also, and as many of us as thou hast libell'd have for a while left the inferiour world.</p>
