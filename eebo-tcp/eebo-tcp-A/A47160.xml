            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF George Keith's Proceedings at <hi>Coopers-Hall, BRISTOL.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AT a Propoſed Conference at <hi>Coopers-Hall</hi> in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the 14th day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1700. betwixt ſome Quakers, and <hi>George Keith;</hi> divers Miniſters and many Citizens, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> being preſent, then and there, did declare that they heard <hi>George Keith</hi> fairly and fully by clear Evidence, to their full Satisfaction, prove out of the Books of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>B. Cool,</hi> the following Poſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all Mankind had but one <hi>General Rule</hi> of Faith and Practice, and that that Rule was not the Scripture, but the Light in every Man; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſay is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42409:3"/>
And the Arguments of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> which <hi>G. Keith</hi> did Read out of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>A Diſcourſe of the General Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> did plainly appear to the Auditory, to be Levelled againſt their <hi>Authority, Perfection,</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> as to all the peculiar Doctrines of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and particularly as to the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> &amp;c. and the Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper againſt the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That that Outward Perſon [that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem]</hi> was not properly the Son of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſts out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Manifeſtation, has been a Deadly Poyſon, theſe later Ages have been infected with.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding the Endeavours uſed by <hi>B. Cool</hi> [the Quakers chief Speaker now at <hi>Briſtol]</hi> in his Book, called, <hi>Sophiſtry Detected,</hi> to clear <hi>W. Penn</hi> and render him ſound, as touching the three Points above-mentioned; the ſaid <hi>B. Cool</hi> denying them to have been truly charged on <hi>W. Penn</hi> by <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and calling his ſo charging them palpable Untruths, yet by the Quotations read by <hi>G. Keith</hi> out of <hi>B. Cools</hi> ſaid Book, called, <hi>Sophiſtry Derected;</hi> the Auditory above-mentioned, did then and there, declare that <hi>B.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42409:3"/>
               <hi>Cool</hi>'s Defences of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> touching theſe three Points, were inſufficient and invalid; and that what <hi>B. Cool</hi> had called Palpable Untruths, <hi>G. Keith</hi> had proved out of <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s ſaid Book to be Palpable Truths, and that they were all three owned and juſtified by <hi>B. Cool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As alſo that the Plain Tendency of the Book of <hi>W. Penn,</hi> called, <hi>A Diſcourſe of the general Rule of Faith and Practice;</hi> and of the Book of <hi>Ben. Cool,</hi> called, <hi>Sophiſtry Detected:</hi> [Being a pretended anſwer, to a Printed half Sheet by <hi>George Keith,</hi> called, <hi>A Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of</hi> W. Penn's <hi>Deiſm,]</hi> by the ſeveral Quotations Read by <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and preſented by him to the View of any, who were willing to inſpect into them, (which ſome of the Miniſters did) appear'd to the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, to be, to Overthrow the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and to Introduce <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> in it's ſtead.</p>
            <p>As alſo, <hi>G. Keith</hi> did make it clearly appear, by the Quotations he Read out of <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s ſaid Book, that the Reflections <hi>B. Cool</hi> had caſt on <hi>G. Keith,</hi> were Unjuſt, Uncharitable, and Unchriſtian.</p>

And that which further confirms what I ſay, is the Variety of Readings which we find among thoſe Copies, amounting to ſeveral thouſands; and if the Copies cannot, how can the Tranſlations be the Rule, ſo various (if not differing) from the true Sence of the Copies in many things, and one from another?</p>

            <p>But no other Anſwer could I have from him, but over and over; he ſtill ſaid; he cou'd not Read the Scripture; whereby it did Plainly enough appear to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42409:8"/>
the Auditory, that he thought the Light within him Taught him all that was needful to his Salvation, without Scripture; as the very Nature and Manner of his Queries and Objections, did plainly make Manifeſt.</p>
            <p>I thought it neceſſary to ſet down this whole Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which to the beſt of my Remembrance, is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fairly done, as to the ſubſtance of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I doubt not, but many have a true Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and if need be, will atteſt to the Truth of it; as well as to the Truth of the other Paſſages above Deliver'd.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of my ſetting it down, is to Silence and put to Shame the Lyes that ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> here have ſpread, whereof I have been Inform'd by divers, that a <hi>Quaker,</hi> that was a poor <hi>Cobler,</hi> was too hard for me, at <hi>Coopers-Hall;</hi> and tho' I anſwer'd his firſt queſtion, yet that I could not anſwer his next, and other following queſtions.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42409:9"/>
againſt me, or own his Error, he having abuſed me in his Book called <hi>Sophiſtry Detected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I took along with me Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> Miniſter of the Temple, Mr. <hi>Noble,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wear,</hi> to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what paſt, ſuſpecting (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oft is) that they wou'd unfairly Repreſent it; and ſo I find ſome of them have done, and writ to their Correſpondents at <hi>London</hi> (of which I have had an Account in two ſeveral Letters from <hi>London)</hi> that <hi>B. Cool</hi> was ſo Powerful in his Diſcourſe with me at his Houſe, that I was not able to ſpeak in my own Defence: and that I call'd on Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> to ſpeak for me, but he refus'd; and he left me alone in the Street, and I fat down in the Street as a Man forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to my own confuſion; and that I had no favour among any at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
            </p>

               <p>I know no ſuch Words of Prayer, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> uſeth. At this he and his Brethren Stranged; whereupon I took the Common Prayer out of my Pocket, and Read the Paſſage

to them: <hi>We have Erred and Strayed from thy Ways, like Loſt Sheep?</hi> You ſee it is in the time paſt, and not in the preſent; <hi>We have Erred, and we do Err,</hi> are differing.</p>
               <p>Said ſome <hi>of the Quakers, Read on</hi> George, <hi>and thou will find it, in the preſent:</hi> So I Read on, till I came to the Words, <hi>And there is no help for us. What ſay'ſt thou to this,</hi> George?</p>

Is not the Light in Man, to Direct his Steps? And do ye not ſay, the Spirit is in you, given you of God, to direct your Steps? So I ſay, As there is no Light or Spirit in Man, as of himſelf to direct his Steps, but what true Light or Spirit he hath that directs him, is not of himſelf, but of God; ſo what True Health is in us, is not of our ſelves, but of God; as we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our ſelves without God, ſo we cannot Heal our ſelves. The Quakers generally blaming this Interpretation; B. Cool</hi> ſaid, George <hi>is in the Right of it, I own his Sence to be true.</hi> Some alledging, that it was not the Sence of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> I bid them ask Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> whether it was not her Sence, and his, as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Miniſter of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> who ſaid it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I further told them, they did not fairly by me,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42409:12"/>
to Upbraid me with my Changes, and Apoſtacie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would prove, that in any of my Changes, I have departed from any Fundamental of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith; which I never did, in any of my Changes. Nor have my Changes been greater, than many of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome of you have had more Changes than I ever had, and have gone through all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Profeſſions among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as Epiſcopal, <hi>Presbyterian, Independant, Anabaptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Quaker;</hi> and why ſhould I be more Upbraided with my Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, than <hi>Richard Claridge</hi> with his; who firſt was a Benefic'd Man in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> than an <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and now a <hi>Quaker;</hi> ſome of them ſaid, <hi>But I changed for Money;</hi> which I Poſitively denyed, and withal, told them, that I had leſs Money now, than when I was a <hi>Quaker;</hi> ſome of them ſaid, <hi>I had it in reverſe, or to that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Falſe and Groundleſs Inſinuations, I did not think worth while to Anſwer: And it is very great Impudence in them, to object either againſt me, or others in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for having a Living; ſuppoſing I had, as at preſent I have none: Seeing they know well enough, that many of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Preachers are grown Rich by their Preaching; and the ready way to get Money, is to turn Preacher among the <hi>Quakers;</hi> Witneſs <hi>B. Cool,</hi> who from a Poor Lad that wrought at the Loom, (as ſome of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42409:12"/>
his Brethren has told him, as I am informed) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worth many hundreds; and the Itinerant Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who moſtly have not of their own to bear their Charges, are largely ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Common Fund: And <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> great Apoſtle, who mightily Pleaded that Miniſters ſhould work with their Hands, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he turned the Quakers Apoſtle, he wholly left off his Trade of Shooe-making, and never either made or mended a Shooe, after that time, and Dyed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably Rich</p>

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in my being over-charitable to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and uncharitable to all other Proteſtant Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, judging the Quakers the only viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>(All which three Errors I have Retracted, in my Book of Retractations, Printed three years ago) And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42409:13"/>
having compared them in my Ignorance, to the higheſt round of the Ladder, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Loweſt, the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,</hi> in the middle, making ſeveral removes from Popery, which I counted as dreg and Earth; from this I am informed, that they have raiſed a report, that I ſaid to them, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Foundation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other Proteſtant Churches, which I declare to be a horrid Slander, as I can prove by ſufficient Witneſſes. <hi>G.

            <p>
               <hi>Note alſo,</hi> That after <hi>C.

None of them would give me a poſitive Anſwer, but ſaid, they held me not for their Father Confeſſor, which is their ordinary evaſion; but by their blaming my joining with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to confeſs my Sins, and ask forgiveneſs of Sin from God; it is evident, they hold they have no Sins to Confeſs, or pray for the Forgiveneſs of. And it is greatly worth Noticing, that they are not heard in their Prayers in their Meetings, to confeſs their Sins, or to Pray, <hi>Forgive us our Sins;</hi> tho' ſome of late, have been heard to ſay, (as I my ſelf have heard ſome at <hi>London</hi> ſay in their Meeting) <hi>Pardon</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42409:13"/>
               <hi>them that have Sinned againſt thee:</hi> As ſuppoſing ſome in the Meeting needed Pardon of Sin; but the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were ſuch perfect Men, that they needed no ſuch Confeſſion nor Prayer; tho' <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who were better Men than any Quaker, did both <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>

MR. <hi>Bedford</hi> Miniſter at the <hi>Temple,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the deſigned Conference, did clear himſelf of an Aſperſion caſt upon him by a Quaker, called <hi>John Dyer;</hi> that the ſaid <hi>John Dyer</hi> did affirm, that he heard Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> ſay in the Houſe of <hi>Charles Harford</hi> Junior, that <hi>George Keith</hi> had been Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and Unfair to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> This <hi>John Dyer</hi> ſaid to <hi>G.

2. Tho' <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath again, and again, ſince his coming to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> deſired the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>B.

               <p n="3">3. On the <hi>13th</hi> of this Inſtant, the <hi>Quakers</hi> gave in an Addreſs to the Mayor of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> Signed by <hi>Charles Jones</hi> Junior, and divers others of chief Note of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> giving their Reaſon, why they refuſed to meet with <hi>G. Keith,</hi> in order to procure an order from the Mayor, to hinder the deſign'd Conference at <hi>Coopers-Hall</hi> abovemention'd; preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they were againſt a Tumultuous Meeting. The Mayor, out of his good Inclination, propos'd to them his Deſire, that <hi>Benjamin Cool</hi> ſhould meet with <hi>G. Keith</hi> at the Mayors Houſe. Twelve being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen on each ſide, fairly to hear matters Debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and he ſhould Treat them civilly at his Houſe; and if they would grant his deſire, he ſhould hinder the Meeting at <hi>Coopers-Hall;</hi> and told them, he would wait for their Anſwer till next Morning;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42409:15"/>
but no Anſwer coming, he did Conſult with the Aldermen, about the <hi>Quakers</hi> Addreſs, who did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the Conference at <hi>Coopers-Hall</hi> was not to be hindred, their Reaſon not being found ſufficient for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Quakers</hi> thus refuſing to Meet with <hi>G. Keith,</hi> not only at his Requeſt, but at the Requeſt of the Mayor; which was ſo reaſonable, that if <hi>G.

Keith</hi> are without juſt Ground, and that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Conſcious in themſelves, their Books are Unſound, and that they cannot ſtand by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, delivered them by their chief Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, but muſt needs Retract them, which all good Chriſtians deſire them to do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>G. Keith</hi> at the beginning of the Meeting at <hi>Coopers-Hall,</hi> declared Solemnly that he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> Errors, from any Prejudice, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuggeſted againſt him, but could not prove; but from Real and True Love both to the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Souls

Keith</hi> at <hi>Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers-Hall,</hi> ſhewed how Unfairly the <hi>Quakers</hi> dealt with him, in uſing theſe Books againſt him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining paſſages in his former Books, Writ by him when a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which had been both generally and particularly Retracted by him; and yet that none of thoſe Quotations, did contain any matters contrary to any one Article of the Apoſtles Creed, or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity, which he was ready to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books did, never by them to this day Retracted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It having been Reported at <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>B. Cool</hi> had ſo Worſted <hi>G. Keith</hi> at <hi>B. Cool</hi>'s own Houſe, in a Diſpute betwixt them, that <hi>G. Keith</hi> had nothing to to ſay in his own Defence, but called to Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> to aſſiſt him, and that Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> refuſed to do it, and at their going away from the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> left him, and <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſat down in the Street Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and Aſtoniſhed, and had not the Favour of any in the City of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it is all utterly falſe what is reported of <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s being worſted in diſpute by <hi>B. Cool,</hi> or that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42409:16"/>
he called for his Aſſiſtance, but only that <hi>G. Keith</hi> twice or thrice deſired Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> to ſpeak to <hi>B. Cool</hi> and the Quakers there preſent, to give him a Meeting, ſeeing <hi>B. Cool</hi> refus'd to ſpeak to him, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him Apoſtate, and charging him very unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and Paſſionately that he had Acted againſt his Conſcience; and telling him that <hi>G. Keith</hi> was not worthy that he, <hi>viz B. Cool,</hi> ſhould ſpeak to him; all which <hi>G. Keith</hi> did bear very patiently; of which <hi>G. Keith</hi> has three Witneſſes, namely, Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Noble,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wear;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> did not leave Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> as he declares, out of any Diſſatisfaction, but had occaſion, that neceſſarily called him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place than whither <hi>G. Keith</hi> was going.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſat down in the Street, or was aſtoniſhed, or diſquieted, are all groſs Falſhoood; as is that other Story, that <hi>G. Keith</hi> had not any in the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to favour him, or think well of him; the contrary whereof hath ſufficiently appear'd, by the general reſpect the People of this City have ſhew'd to him, by the frequent Confluence of great Multitudes to hear him Preach; who has Preached ſeven times in this City, during theſe three Weeks, and who have generally ſpoken well of him, and eſpecially by the Favour that the Mayor, and others of chief Note in the City have ſhow'd him; not only by their hearing him Preach, in ſeveral Churches,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42409:16"/>
but by kindly Entertaining him in their Houſes, and expreſſing their Thanks to him for his good Doctrine and Inſtructions, and their hopes of his being made Inſtrumental to do good among them.</p>
