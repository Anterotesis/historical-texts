            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> haue been the principall cauſes in conſideration whereof aſwell they of auncient times, as thoſe of our age haue been enduced to trauell into farre and remote regions. The firſt hath beene the naturall deſire which we haue to ſerch out the commodities to liue happely, plentifully, and at eaſe: be it whether one abandon his naturall cuntrie altogether, to dwell in a better, or bee it that men make voiages thither, there to ſerch out and bring from thence ſuch thinges as are there to bee found, and are in greateſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and in moſt requeſt in our cuntries. The ſecond cauſe hath beene the multitude of people too frutefull in generation, which, being no longer able to dwell in their natiue ſoyles, haue entred vppon their neighbours limites, and oftentimes paſſing further haue pearced euen vnto the vttermoſt regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After this ſorte the north climate, a frutefull father of ſo many nations, hath oftentimes ſent foorth this way and that way his valiant people, and by this meane hath peopled infinite countries: ſo that moſt of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe drawe their original from theſe partes. Contrariwiſe the more ſouthern regions, becauſe they be too barraine by reaſon of their inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heate which raigneth in them, neede not any ſuch ſending foorth of their in habitances, and haue beene oftentimes conſtrained to receaue other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more often by force ofarmes then willingly. All Africke, Spaine, and Italie, can alſo teſtifie the ſame, which neuer ſo abounded with people that they had neede to ſend them abroode to inhabite elſe where: as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scythia, Norway, Gotland, and France haue done. The poſterite of which nations remaineth yet not only in Italie, Spaine and Affricke, but alſo in frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and faire Aſia. Neuertheleſſe I find that the Romains proceding farther, or rather adding vnto theſe two chiefe cauſes aforeſayd, (as being moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to plant not only their enſignes and victories, but alſo their lawes, cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes, and religion in thoſe provinces which they had conquered by force<note place="margin">Planting of colonies.</note> ofarmes) haue oftentimes by the decree of their ſoueraine Senate ſent forth inhabitantes, which they called colonies, (thinking by this way to make their name immotall), euen to the vnfurniſhing of their owne countrye of the forces which ſhould haue perſerued the ſame in her perfection: a thing which hindred them much more, then advanced them to the poſſeſſion of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall monarchie, where vnto their intention did aſpyre. For it came to paſſe that their colonies here and there being miſerably ſacked by ſtrang people
<pb facs="tcp:9915:6"/>
did vtterly ruine and ouerthrowe their empire. The brinkes of the riuer of Rine are yet red, thoſe of <hi>Danubius</hi> are noe leſſe bloodie, and our France be came fatte with their blood which they loſt. Theſe are the effectes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of al ſuch as being pricked forward with this Romaine and tirannicall ambition will goe aboute thus to ſubdue ſtrange people: effectes, I ſay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the profitte which thoſe ſhall receaue, which only are affectioned to the common benefitte, that is to ſay, to the generall pollicie of all men, and endeuour to vnite them one with another as well by traſicke and forraine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations, as alſo by militarie vertues, and force of armes, whenas the ſauages wil not yeeld vnto their endeuours ſo much tending vnto their profite.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe princes haue ſent foorth out of their dominions certaine men of good actiuitie, to plante themſelues in ſtrang countries, there to make their profite to bring the countrie to ciuilitie, and, if it might be, to reduce the inhabitantes to the true knowledg of our God: an end ſo much more commé<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dable, as it is farre from all tiranicall and cruell gouernement: and ſo they haue alwayes thriued in their enterpriſes, and by lyttle and little gained the hartes of them which they haue conquered or wonne vnto them by any meanes. Here of we may gather that ſometimes it is good, yea very expedient to ſend foorth men to discouer the pleaſure and commoditie of ſtrang countries: But ſo, that the country out of which theſe companies are to paſſe remayne<note place="margin">Two conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> required in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As within theſe fewe dayes paſt the french haue proued to my great greife, being able by no meanes poſſible to withſtand the ſame, conſidering that the elementes, men, and al the fauours which might be hoped for of a faithful and Chriſtian alliance fought againſt vs: which thing I purpoſe to diſcouer in this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hiſtorie with ſo euident truth, that the kings maieſtie my ſouerainge prince ſhall in parte be ſatiſfied of the diligence which I haue vſed in his ſeruice, and myne aduerſaries ſhall find themſelues ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in their falſe reportes, that they ſhall haue no place of refuge.

And fiue yeeres after <hi>Americus</hi> went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the commaundement of the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and gaue vnto it his owne name, wherevpon afterward it was called <hi>America.</hi>

I will deuide it for the better vnderſtanding into three principall partes. That which is toward the pole Articke or the North, is called newe Fraunce, becauſe that in the yeere 1524, <hi>Iohn Verarſana</hi> a Florentine was ſent by king <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt, and by Madam the Regent his mother vnto theſe newe regions, where he went on land, and diſcouered all the Coſte which is from the tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> to witte, from the eight and twentith vnto the fiftith degree, and farther to the North. Hee planted in this Countrey the enſignes and armes of the king of
<pb facs="tcp:9915:7"/>
Fraunce: ſo that the Spaniardes themſelues, which were there af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, haue named this Countrey <hi>Terra Franceſca.</hi> The ſame then extendeth it ſelfe in Latitude from the 25. degree vnto the 54, toward the North: and in Longitude from 210. vnto 330. The Eaſterne part thereof is called by the late Writers the lande of <hi>Norumbega,</hi> which beginneth at the Bay of <hi>Gama,</hi> which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth it from the Iſle of <hi>Canada,</hi> whither <hi>Roberuall</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Carter</hi> ſayled the yeere 1535. About the which there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ilands, among which is that which is named <hi>Terra de Labra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> ſtretching toward <hi>Groneland.</hi> In the Weſterne parte there are many knowne countries, as the Region of <hi>Quiuira, Ceuola, Aſtatlan,</hi> and <hi>Terlichichimici.</hi> The Southerne part is called <hi>Florida,</hi> becauſe it was diſcouered on Palmeſunday, which the Spaniards call <hi>Paſcha Florida.</hi> The Northerne part is altogether vnknowen.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of all <hi>America</hi> is called <hi>Newe Spaigne.</hi> It<note place="margin">The 2. general part of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> extendeth from the tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> in the 23. degrees and a half, vnto the nienth degree. In the ſame is ſcituated the citie of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitan,</hi> and it hath many regions, and many Ilandes adioyned vnto it, which are called the <hi>Antilles,</hi> whereof the moſt famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced are <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> with an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All this land together with the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and all the Iſlandes aforeſaide haue not in longitude paſt ſeuentie degrees, to wit, from the 240. vnto three hundreth and ten: it is alſo long and narrow as <hi>Italie.</hi> The third part of <hi>America</hi> is called <hi>Peru,</hi> it is<note place="margin">The 3. general part of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</note> very great, and extendeth it ſelfe in latitude from the tenth degree vnto the 53. beyond the equator, to wit, as I haue ſaide before vnto the ſtraite of <hi>Magelan.</hi> It is made in faſhion like to an egge, and is very well knowne vppon all ſides. The parte where it is largeſt hath threeſcore degrees, and from thence it waxeth narrower and narrower toward both the endes.

The Cape thereof is as it were a long head of land ſtreatching out into the Sea an hundred leagues, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth directly toward the South, it hath right ouer againſt it 25. leagues diſtant the Iſle of <hi>Cuba</hi> otherwiſe called Iſabella, toward the Eaſt the Iſles of <hi>Bahama</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucaya,</hi> and toward the Weſt the Bay of <hi>Mexico.</hi> The Countrie is flat, and deuided with diuers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and therefore moyſt, and is ſandie towards the Sea ſhore. There groweth in thoſe parts great quantitie of Pynetrees which<note place="margin">The trees of Florida,</note> haue no kernels in the Aples which they beare. Their Woods are full of Oakes, Walnuttrees, blacke Cherietrees, Mulbury trees, Lentiſkes, and Cheſtnut trees, which are not naturall as thoſe in Fraunce. There is great ſtore of Ceders, Cypreſſes, Bayes, Palme trees, Hollies, and wilde Uines, which clime vp along the trees and beare good Grapes. There is there a kind of Medlers, the fruit whereof is better then that of Fraunce, and bigger. There are alſo Plum trees, which beare very fayre fruite, but ſuch as is not very good. There are Raſpiſſes, and a little bearie which we call among vs Blues, which are very good to eate. There growe in that Countrie a kind of Roots which they call in their language <hi>Hatſeh</hi> whereof in neceſſitie they make bread. There is alſo there the tree called Eſquiue which is very good againſt the Pocks and<note place="margin">The beaſtes of Florida.</note> other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagious diſeaſes. The Beaſts beſt known in this Country are Stags, Hinds, Goats, Deare, Beares, Leopards, Owneces, Luſerns, diuers ſortes of Wolues, wilde Dogs, Hares, Cunnies, and a cretaine kind of beaſt that differeth little from the Lion of <hi>Affrica.</hi> The Foules are Turkeycockes, Partridges, Parrots,<note place="margin">The foule of Florida.</note> Pigions, Ringdoues, Turtles, Blackbirds, Crowes, Tarcels, Faulcons, Laynerds, Herons, Cranes, Storkes, wild Geeſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards, Cormorans, Egrepts white, red, blacke and gray, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſorte of all wilde foule. There is ſuch aboundance of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles<note place="margin">Crocodiles.</note> that often times in ſwimming men are aſſayled by them, of Serpents there are many ſortes. There is found among the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages good quantitie of Gold and Siluer, which is gotten out of<note place="margin">Gold &amp; ſiluer.</note> the Ships that are loſt vpon the coſt, as I haue vnderſtood by the ſauages themſelues.

Neuertheleſſe they ſay

They couer their priuities with the ſkin of a ſtagge wel dreſſed. The moſt part of them haue their bodies, armes, &amp; thighes painted with very fayre deuiſes: the paynting whereof can neuer be taken away, becauſe the ſame is pricked into their fleſh. Their haire is very blacke and reacheth euen downe to their hippes,<note place="margin">The wearing of their haire.</note> howbeit they truſſe it vp after a faſhion that becometh them very well. They are great diſſemblers and traytors, valiant of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and fight very well. They haue none other weapons but their Bowes and Arrowes. They make the ſtring of their bow of a gutte of a ſtagge or of a ſtagges ſkinne, which they know how to dreſſe as well as any man in Fraunce and with as many different ſorts of coloures. They head their arrowes with the teeth of Fiſhes and ſtone which they work very fine and handſomly.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues much in ſhooting. They play at the ball in this maner. They ſet vp a tree in the middeſt of a place which is eight or nine fathom high, in the toppe wherof there is ſet a ſquare matte made of reedes or Bulruſhes which whoſoeuer hitteth in playing thereat, winneth the game. They take great pleaſure in hunting and fiſhing. The kinges of the Countrie make great warre one againſt the other, which is not executed but by ſurpriſe, and they kill all the men that they can take: afterward they cut of their heads to haue their haire, which returning home they carry away, to make thereof their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph when they come to their houſes.

The prayers being ended, the Indians which were very attentiue to harken vnto them, thinking, in my iudgement, that we worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſunne, becauſe wee alwayes had our eyes lifted vp towarde heauen, roſe all vp and came to ſalute the Captaine <hi>Iohn Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault,</hi> promiſing to ſhewe him their king, which roſe not vp as they did, but remayned ſtill ſitting vppon greene leaues of bayes and Palmetrees: toward whom the Captaine went and ſate downe by him, and heard him make a long diſcourſe, but with no great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe he coulde not vnderſtand his language, and much leſſe<note place="margin">Preſents giuen to Ribault.</note> his meaning.

Wherevpon the king began very louingly to intreate both our Captaine and vs. And after theſe gentle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, we went our ſelues into the woods, hoping there to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer ſome ſingularities: where were great ſtore of mulbeary trees white and redde, on the coppes whereof there was an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Great ſtore of ſilkewormes.</note> of ſilke wormes.

For knowing him to be ſo liberall they would haue wiſhed him to haue ſtayed a little longer, ſeking by all meanes, to giue him occaſion to ſtay, ſhewing him by ſignes that he ſhould ſtay but that day onely, and that they deſired to aduertiſe a great <hi>Indian</hi> Lord which had perles in great aboundance, and ſiluer alſo, all<note place="margin">Store of perles and ſiluer.</note> which things ſhould be giuen vnto him at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kings ariual: ſaying far ther y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the meane while y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this great Lord came thether they wold lead him to their houſes, &amp; ſhew him there a thouſand pleaſures in ſhooting &amp; ſeeing the Stag killed, therfore they prayed him not to deny the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their requeſt.

A fewe dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Iohn Ribault</hi> determined to returne once againe toward the <hi>Indians</hi> which inhabited that arme of the Riuer which runneth toward the Weſt, and to carry with him good ſtore of ſouldiers. For his meaning was to take two <hi>Indians</hi> of this place to bring them into Fraunce, as the Queene had commaunded him. With this deliberation againe we tooke our former courſe, ſo farre foorth that at the laſt we came to the ſelfeſame place where at the firſt we<note place="margin">Two Indians taken away.</note> found the <hi>Indians,</hi> from thence we tooke two <hi>Indians</hi> by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the king, which thinking that they were more fauoured then the reſt thought themſelues very happie to ſtay with vs. But theſe two Indians ſeeing we made no ſhew at all that we would goe on land, but rather that we followed the middeſt of the courrant, began to be ſomewhat offended, and would by force haue lepte into the water, for they are ſo good ſwimmers that immediately they woulde haue gotten into the forreſtes. Neuertheleſſe being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their humour, wee watched them narrowly and ſought by all meanes to appeaſe them: which wee could not by any meanes doe for that time, though wee offered them thinges which they much eſteemed, which thinges they diſdayned to take, and gaue backe againe whatſoeuer was giuen them, thinking that ſuch giftes ſhould haue altogether bound them, and that in reſtoring them they ſhoulde bee reſtored vnto their

               </gap>yed vs to giue them thoſe thinges which they had reſtored, which wee did incontinent: then they approched one toward the other, and beganne to ſinge, agreeing ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, that in hearing their ſonge it ſeemed that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for the abſence of their friendes. They continued their ſonges all night without ceaſſing: al which time we were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lie at anker by reaſon of the tide which was againſt vs, but wee hoyſed ſayle the next day very early in the morning, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our ſhips. Aſſoone as we were come to our ſhippes euery one ſought to gratifie theſe two Indians, &amp; to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce that was poſſible: to the intent that by ſuch curteſies they might perceiue the good deſire and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we had to remain their friends in time to come. Then we offered them meate to eate, but they refuſed it, and made vs vnderſtande that they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to waſh their face, and to ſtaye vntill the ſunne were ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The Indians eat not before the ſun be ſet.</note> they did eate, which is a ceremonie common to al the Indians of new Fraunce. Neuertheleſſe in the ende they were conſtrayned to forget their ſuperſtitions, and to apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to our nature, which was ſomewhat ſtrange vnto them at the firſt. They became therefore more ioconde, and euery houre made vs a thouſande diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, being marueilous ſorie that we could not vnderſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A few dayes after they began to beare good wil toward me, ſo heartie good will I ſay, that, as I thinke, they would rather haue periſhed with hunger and thirſt then haue taken their refection at any mans hand but mine. Seing this their great good will, I ſought to learn ſome Indian wordes, and began to aſke them queſtions, ſhewing them the thing whereof I deſired to know the name, how they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it. They were very glad to tell it me, and knowing the deſire that I had to learne their language, they incouraged me afterward to aſke them euerye thing. So that putting downe in writing the<note place="margin">Laudonniers putting downe in writing the wordes and phraſes of the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſpeech.</note> wordes and phraſes of the Indian ſpeech, I was able to vnderſtand the greateſt part of their diſcourſes.

the ſunday. They gaue me to vnderſtand, that they would bring me to ſee the greateſt Lord of this countrey which they called <hi>Chiquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chiquola or Chiquora a king of greate ſtature.</note> which exceedeth them in height (as they tolde me) a good foote and a halfe.

I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then to ſhew them al the parts of heauen, to the intent to learne in which quarter they dwelt. And ſtraightway one of them ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth his hand ſhewed me that they dwelt toward the North, which maketh mee thinke that it was in the riuer of <hi>Iordan.</hi> And now I remember, that in the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, certaine Spaniardes inhabitants of <hi>Saint Domingo,</hi> (which made a voyage to get certaine ſlaues to worke in their mynes) ſtole away by ſuttletie the inhabitants of this riuer, to the number of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thinking to carry them into their <hi>new Spaine.</hi> But they loſt their labour: for in deſpite they died all for hunger, ſauing one that was brought to the Emperour, which a little while after he cauſed to be baptiſed, and gaue him his owne name &amp; called him <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Chiquola,</hi> becauſe he ſpake ſo much of this Lorde of <hi>Chiquola,</hi> whoſe ſubiect he was. Alſo, (as men woorthy credite haue aſſured<note place="margin">The ſecond proofe. The third proofe.</note> me) he reported continually, that <hi>Chiquola</hi> made his abode within a very great incloſed citie. Beſides this proofe, thoſe which were left there in the firſt voyage haue certified me, that the Indians ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them by euident ſignes, that farther within the land on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide part toward the North, there was a great encloſure or Citie, and within the ſame manye faire houſes, wherein <hi>Chiquola</hi> dwelt. But not to digreſſe from my matter, I wil returne to the Indian, which took ſo great delight in ſpeaking to me of this <hi>Chiquola,</hi> that there neuer paſſed anie one day, wherein hee did not diſcourſe of ſome rare thing concerning the ſame. After they had ſtayed a while in our ſhippes, they beganne to be ſorie, and ſtill demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me when they ſhoulde returne. I made them vnderſtande that the Captaines will was to ſende them home againe, but that

firſt he would beſtow apparrel of them, which few dayes after was deliuered vnto them. But ſeeing he would not giue them licence to depart, they reſolued with themſelues to ſteale away by night, and to get a little boate which we had, and by the helpe of the tide, to ſayle homeward towarde their dwellinges, and by this meanes<note place="margin">The 2. Indians eſcape away.</note> to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Which thing they failed not to doe, and put their enterpriſe in execution, yet leauing behind them the apparel which the Captaine had giuen them, and carrying away nothing but that which was their owne, ſhewing wel hereby that they were not void of reaſon. The Captaine cared not greatly for their departure, conſidering they had not beene vſed otherwiſe then well: and that therefore they woulde not eſtrange themſelues from the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Captaine <hi>Ribault</hi> therefore knowing the ſingular faireneſſe of this riuer deſired by all meanes to encourage ſome of his men to dwell there, well foreſeeing that this thing might bee of<note place="margin">The benefit of planting.</note> greate importaunce for the Kinges ſeruice, and the reliefe of the common wealth of Fraunce. Therefore proceeding on with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he commaunded the ankers to be weighed and to ſet things in order to returne vnto the opening of the riuer, to the end that if the winde came faire he might paſſe out to accompliſh the reſt of his meaning. When therefore we were come to the mouth of the riuer, he made them caſt anker, whervpon we ſtayed without diſcouering any thing all the reſt of the day. The next day he commaunded that all the men of his ſhip ſhould come vp vppon the decke, ſaying that he had ſomewhat to ſay vnto them. They all came came vp, and immediately the Caytaine beganne to ſpeake vnto them in this manner. <hi>I thinke there is none of you that is ignoraunt of howe<note place="margin">The oration of Ioh. Ribault to his companie.</note> greate conſequence this our enterpriſe is, and alſo howe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is to our young king. Therefore, my friends, as one deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your honour and benefite, I woulde not fayle to aduertiſe you all of the exceeding greate good happe which ſhoulde fall to them, which, as men of valure and worthy courage, would make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in this our firſt diſcouerie of the benefites and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this newe lande: which ſhould be, as I aſſure my ſelfe, the greateſt occaſion that euer could happen vnto them, to ariſe vnto the title and degree of honour. And for this cauſe I was deſirous to propoſe vnto you and ſet downe before your eies the eternall memorie which of right they deſerue, which forgetting both
<pb facs="tcp:9915:15"/>
their parentes and their countrey haue had the courage to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe a thing of ſuch importance, which euen kinges themſelues vnderſtanding to be men aſpiring to ſo high degree of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and increaſe of their maieſties, doe not diſdaine ſo wel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, that afterwardes employing them in matters of weight and of high enterpriſe, they make their names immortal for euer. How beit, I woulde not haue you perſwade your ſelues, as manie do, that you ſhall neuer haue ſuch good fortune, as not being knowen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the king nor the Princes of the Realme, and beſides deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſo poore a ſtock, that few or none of your parents, hauing euer made profeſsion of armes, haue beene knowen vnto the great eſtates. For albeit that from my tender yeeres I my ſelf haue applied al my induſtry to follow them, &amp; haue hazarded my life in ſo many dangers for the ſeruice of my Prince, yet could I neuer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thervnto, (not that I did not deſerue this title and degree of gouernment,) as I haue ſeen it happen to many others, only bicauſe they deſcended of a noble race, ſince more regarde is had of their birth than of their vertue. For well I knowe that if vertue were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, there would more be found better to deſerue the title, and by good right to be named noble and valiant. I will therfore make ſufficient anſweare to ſuch propoſitions and ſuche thinges as you maye obiect againſt mee, laying before you the infinite examples which we haue of the Romaines: which concerning the point of honour were the firſt that triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed ouer the world. For how many find we among them, which for their ſo valiant enterpriſes, not for the greatneſſe of their parentage, haue obtayned the honour to triumph. If we haue recourſe vnto their aunceſters, wee ſhall finde that their parentes were of ſo meane condition, that by labouring with their handes they liued verie baſely. As the father of Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<note place="margin">Aelius Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from baſe pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage became Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Rome</note> Pertinax, which was a poore artiſant, his Grandfather like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was a bond man, as the hiſtoriographers do witueſſe: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, being moued with a valiant courage, he was nothing diſmayed for al this, but rather deſirous to aſpire vnto high things, he began with a braue ſtomacke to learne feates of armes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited ſo well therein, that from ſteppe to ſtep he became at length to be Emperour of the Romaines For all this dignitie he deſpiſed not his parentes: but contrariwiſe, and in remembrance of them, hee cauſed his fathers ſhoppe to bee couered with a fine wrought

But the more to eterniſe the memorie of his parents and to make his name renowmed, he commaunded that he ſhould be ſerued at the Table in Veſſels of gold and ſiluer and others of earth: declaring thereby, that the dignitie wherein he was placed came not vnto him by his parents, but by his owne vertue onely. If I ſhal ſpeak of our time, I will lay before you onely <hi>Ruſten Baſſha,</hi> which may be a ſufficient example to all men: which</hi>

the nextday to ſearch the moſt fit and conuenient place to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. Wherefore he embarked himſelfe very early in the morning and commaunded them to follow him that were deſirous to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite there, to the intent that they might like the better of the place. Hauing ſayled vp the great riuer on the north ſide, in coſting an Ile which endeth with a ſharpe point toward the mouth of the riuer, and hauing ſayled a while, he diſcouered a ſmall riuer, which entred into the Ilande, which hee would not fayle to ſearch out. Which done, and finding the ſame deepe inough to harbour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gallies and Galliots in good number, proceeding further, hee found a very open place, ioyning vpon the brinke thereof, where he went on land, and ſeeing the place fit to builde a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe in, and commodious for them that were willing to plant there, he reſolued incontinent to cauſe the bignes of the fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be meaſured out.

doe much for his ſake: Beſides all this, in his neceſſitie they might be able to ſuccour him with victualles: One of theſe kings was called <hi>Mayon,</hi> another <hi>Hoya,</hi> the third <hi>Touppa,</hi> and the fourth<note place="margin">Mayon. Hoya. Touppa. Stalame.</note> 
                  <hi>Stalame.</hi> He tolde him moreouer, that they woulde bee very glad, when they ſhoulde vnderſtand the newes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and therefore he prayed him to vouchſafe to viſit them. The Captayne willingly conſented vnto him for the deſire that he had to purchaſe friendes in that place.

After that he had remained by the ſpace of certayne dayes with theſe ſtrange kinges, he determined to take his leaue, and being come back to the houſe of <hi>Auduſta,</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded al his men to goe abord of their Pinneſſe: for he was minded to goe toward the countries of king <hi>Stalame,</hi> which dwelt<note place="margin">The Countrey of king Stala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me 15. leagues Northward of Charles Fort.</note> towarde the North the diſtance of fifteene great leagues from <hi>Charles Fort.</hi> Therefore as they ſayled vp the riuer they entred into a great Courrant, which they followed ſo far till they came at the laſt to the houſe of <hi>Stalame:</hi> which brought him into his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where he ſought to make them the beſt cheere he colde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.

embarked themſelues therefore and ſayled towarde the kinges houſe, which was already come foorth on the way towards them to receaue them curteouſly, to bid them welcome and bring them to his houſe, where he ſought to entreate them the beſt hee might. In the meane while the <hi>Indians</hi> prepared themſelues to celebrate the feaſt the morrow after, &amp; the king brought them to ſee the place, wherin the feaſt ſhould be kept: where they ſaw many wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> round about which laboured by all meanes to make the place cleane and neate. This place was a great circuit of ground with open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte and rounde in figure. On the morrowe therefore early in the morning, all they which were choſen to celebrate the feaſt, being paynted and trimmed with riche fethers of diuers colours,<note place="margin">The Indians trimming of themſelues with rich fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</note> put themſelues on the way to goe from the kings houſe toward the place of <hi>Toya:</hi> whereunto when they were come they ſette themſelues in order, and followed three <hi>Indians,</hi> which in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and in geſture were differing from the reſt: ech of them bare a Tabret in their hand, daunſing and ſinging in a lameutable tune when they began to enter into the middeſt of the rounde circuit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed of others which anſwered them agayne. After that they had ſong, daunſed, and turned three times, they fell on run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like vnbridled horſes, through the middeſt of the thickeſt woods. And then the <hi>Indian</hi> women continued all the reſt of the day in teares as ſad and wofull as was poſſible: and in ſuch a rage they cut the armes of the yonge gerles, which they lanced crutlly with ſharpe ſhelles of muſkels, that the blood followed, which they flang into the ayre, crying out three times, <hi>He Toya.</hi> The king <hi>Auduſta</hi> had gathered all our men into his houſe, while the feaſt was celebrated, and was exceedingly offended when he ſaw them laugh. This he did becauſe the <hi>Indians</hi> are very angry when they are ſeene in their ceremonies. Notwithſtanding one of our men made ſuch ſhifte that by ſubtile meanes hee gatte out of the houſe of <hi>Auduſta,</hi> and ſecretly went and hid himſelfe behinde a very thicke buſh, where at his pleaſure, he might eaſily diſcry the ceremonies of the feaſt. They three that began the feaſt are named <hi>Iawas:</hi> and they are as it were three Prieſtes of the <hi>Indian</hi> lawe: to whome they giue credite and beliefe, partely becauſe<note place="margin">Iawas are their Prieſts.</note> that by kinred they are ordayned to bee ouer their Sacrifices,

and partely alſo becauſe they bee ſo ſubtile Magicians that any<note place="margin">Maigicians.</note> thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is loſt is ſtraightway recouered by their meanes.

Thoſe that ran ſo through the woods returned two dayes after: after their returne they began to daunce with a cheerefull courage in the middeſt of the fayre place, and to cheere vp their good olde <hi>Indian</hi> fathers, which either by reaſon of their too great age, or by reaſon of their naturall indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and feebleneſſe were not called vnto the feaſt. When all theſe daunces were ended, they fell on eating with ſuch a greedineſſe, that they ſeemed rather to deuour their meate then to eate it, for they had neither eaten nor drunke the day of the feaſt nor the two dayes following. Our men were not forgotten at this good cheere, for the Indians ſent for them all thither, ſhewing themſelues verye glad of their preſence. While they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certayne time with the Indians a man of ours got a yonge boy for certaine trifles, and enquired of him what the Indians<note place="margin">Inuocations of the Iawas or Priſtes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Toya.</note> did in the wood during their abſence: which boy made him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by ſignes that the <hi>Iawas</hi> had made inuocations to <hi>Toya,</hi> and that by Magicall Characters they had made him come that they might ſpeake with him and demaund diuers ſtrange thinges of him, which for feare of the <hi>Iawas</hi> hee durſt not vtter. They haue alſo many other ceremonies, which I will not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe for feare of moleſting the reader with a matter of ſo ſmall importance. When the feaſt therefore was finiſhed our men returned vnto <hi>Charles Forte:</hi> where hauing remayned but a<note place="margin">Their victuals fayle them.</note> while their victualles began to waxe ſhorte, which forced them to haue recourſe vnto their neighbours, and to pray them to ſuccour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that their neceſſitie: which gaue them part of al the victuals which they had and kepte no more vnto them ſelues then woulde<note place="margin">The Indians maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the Winter time of Maſt and rootes.

They tolde them farther that for this cauſe it was needefull for them to retire themſelues into the woodes, to liue of Maſt and rootes vntill the time of Harueſt, being as ſory as might bee that they were not able any farther to ayd them. They gaue them alſo counſel to goe toward the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of king <hi>Couexis</hi> a man of might &amp; renowne in this preuince,
<pb facs="tcp:9915:19"/>
which maketh his aboad toward the South abounding at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and repleniſhed with ſuch quantitic of mill, corne, and beanes that by his onely ſuccour they might be able to liue a very long<note place="margin">King Ouade.</note> time. But before they ſhould come into his territories, they were to repayre vnto a king called <hi>Ouade</hi> the brother of <hi>Couexis,</hi> which in Mill, Beanes, and corne was no leſſe welthy, and withall is very liberall, and which would bee very ioyfull if hee might but once ſee them. Our men perceauing the good relation which the <hi>Indians</hi> made them of thoſe two kings reſolued to goe thither; for they felt already the neceſſitie which oppreſſed them. Therefore they made requeſt vnto king <hi>Maccou,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to giue them one of his ſubiectes to guide them the right way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:<note place="margin">King Maccou.</note> whereunto he condiſcended very willingly, knowing that without his fauour they ſhould haue much adoe to bring their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe to paſſe. Wherefore after they had giuen order for all thinges neceſſary for the voyage, they put themſelues to Sea, and ſayled ſo farre that in the end they came into the countrey of <hi>Ouade,</hi> which they founde to bee in the Riuer <hi>Belle.</hi> Being<note place="margin">Ouades coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Belle.</note> there ariued they perceaued a company of <hi>Indians</hi> which aſſone as they knew of their being there came before them. Aſſone as they were come neere them, their guides ſhewed them by ſignes that <hi>Ouade</hi> was in this company, wherefore our men ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to ſalute him. And then two of his ſonnes which were with him, being goodly and ſtrong men ſaluted them agayne in very good ſorte, and vſed very friendly intertainment on their parte. The kinge immediately beganue to make an Oration in his <hi>Indian</hi> language of the great pleaſure and contentment which hee had to ſee them in that place, proteſting that he would become ſo loyall a friend of theirs hereafter, that hee would bee their faithfull defendour againſt all them that woulde offer to bee their enimies. After theſe ſpeeches hee ledde them towarde his houſe, where hee ſought to intreate them very courteouſly. His houſe was hanged about with Tapiſtrie of feathers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe<note place="margin">Tapiſtrie of feathers.

They aduertiſed the kinge by one of the

guides which they brought with them, howe that (hauing heard of his greate liberalitie) they had put to the Sea to come to beſeech him to ſuccour them with victuals in their great want and neceſſitie: and that in ſo doing, he ſhould binde them all hereafter to remaine his faithfull friendes and loyall defenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all his enemies. This good Indian aſſoone readye to doe them pleaſure, as they were to demaund it, commaunded his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes that they ſhould fill our Pinneſſe with mil and beanes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">The liberalitie of king Ouade</note> he cauſed them to bring him ſixe pieces of his tapiſtry made like little couerlets, and gaue them to our men with ſo liberall a minde, as they eaſily perceyued the deſire which he had to become their friend. In recompence of all theſe giftes our men gaue him two cutting hookes and certaine other triſſes, wherewith he helde himſelf greatly ſatiſfied. This being done, our men took their leaue of the king, which for their farewell, ſayd nothing elſe but that they ſhould returne if they wanted victuals, and that they might aſſure themſelues of him, that they ſhould neuer want any thing that was in his power. Wherefore they embarked themſelues, and ſailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <hi>Charlesfort,</hi> which from this place might be ſome fiue and<note place="margin">Ouades coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie 25. leagues Southward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Charlesfort.</note> twenty leagues diſtant. But as our men thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at their eaſe, and free from the dangers whereinto they had expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues night and day in gathering together of victuals here &amp; there: Loe, euen as they were aſleepe, the fire caught in their lodgings with ſuch furie, being increaſed by the wind, that the great roome<note place="margin">The fort ſet on fire by caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> that was built for them before our mens departure, was conſumed in an inſtant, without being able to ſaue any thing ſauing a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of their munition.

Within a ſmall while after this miſchance, their victuals began to waxe ſhort: and after our men had taken good deliberation, thought and bethought them ſelues againe, they founde that there was no better way for them then to returne agayne vnto King <hi>Ouadé</hi> and <hi>Couexis</hi> his brother. Wherefore they reſolued to ſend thither ſome of their companie the next day following: which with an Indian <hi>Canoa</hi> ſayled vp into the countrey about tenne leagues: afterwarde they founde a very fayre and great riuer of freſh water, which they fayled not to ſearch out: they found therin a great number of Crocodils, which in greatneſſe paſſe thoſe of the<note place="margin">Crocodiles.</note> riuer <hi>Nilus:</hi> moreouer, all along the bankes thereof, there growe mighty high Cypreſſes.

And the principall occaſion that moued them therevnto, was becauſe hee degraded another ſouldier

named <hi>La chere,</hi> (which he had baniſhed) and becauſe he had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his promiſe: for he had promiſed to ſend him victuals from eight dayes to eight daies, which thing he did not, but ſaide on the contrarie, that he would be glad to heare of his death.

Hauing executed their purpoſe, they went to ſeeke the Souldier that was baniſhed, which was in a ſmall Iland diſtant from <hi>Charlesfort</hi> about three leagues, where they found him almoſt halfe dead for hunger. When they were come home againe, they aſſembled themſelues together to chooſe one to be gouernour ouer them, whoſe name was <hi>Nicolas<note place="margin">Nicolas Barré choſen Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> Barré,</hi> a man worthy of commendation, and one which knew ſo well to quite himſelfe of his charge, that all rancour and diſſention ceaſſed among them, and they liued peaceably one with another, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time, they beganne to builde a ſmall Pinneſſe, with hope to returne into Fraunce, if no ſuccours came vnto them as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from day to day. And though there were not a man among them that had any ſkill, notwithſtanding neceſſitie, which is the maiſtreſſe of all ſciences, taught them the wayes to builde it.

But they wanted thoſe thinges that of all other were moſt needfull, as cordage and ſailes, without which the enterpriſe could not come to effect. Hauing no meanes to recouer theſe thinges, they were in worſe caſe then at the firſt, and almoſt ready to fall into deſpayre. But that good God, which neuer forſaketh the afflicted, did ſuccour them in this neceſſity. As they were in theſe perplerities, king <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſta</hi> and <hi>Maccou</hi> came to them, accompanied with two hundred Indians at the leaſt, whom our Frenchmen went foorth to meete withal, and ſhewed the king in what neeede of cordage they ſtood, who promiſed them to returne within two dayes, and to bring ſo much as ſhould ſuffice to furniſh the Pinneſſe with tackling. Our men being pleaſed with theſe good newes and promiſes beſtowed vpon them certaine cutting hookes and ſhirtes. After their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our men ſought all meanes to recouer roſen in the woodes, wherein they cut the Pine trees round about, out of which they

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, left them all their marchandiſe that remayned, leauing them thereby ſo fully ſatiſfied that they departed from them with all the contentation of the world. They went forward therefore to finiſhe the Brigandine, and vſed ſo ſpeedie diligence, that within a ſhorte time afterwarde they made it readie furniſhed with all thinges. In the meane ſeaſon the winde came ſo fit for their purpoſe that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to inuite them to put to ehe Sea: which they did without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay after they had ſet all their thinges in order.

But being drunken with the too exceſſiue ioy, which they had conceiued for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into Fraunce, or rather depriued of all foreſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, without regarding the inconſtancie of the winds, which<note place="margin">They put to the ſea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient victuals.</note> change in a moment, they put themſelues to ſea, and with ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der victualles, that the end of their enterpriſe became vnlucky and vnfortunate. For after they had ſayled the third parte of their way, they were ſurpriſed with calmes which did ſo much hinder them, that in three weeks they ſayled not aboue fiue and twentie leagues. During this time their victuals co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed, and became ſo ſhort, that euery man was conſtrained to eate not paſt twelue graines of mill by the day, which may be in value as much as twelue peaſon. Yea<note place="margin">Their victuals vtterly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> and this felicitie laſted not long: for their victuals failed them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together at once: and they had nothing for their more aſſured refuge but their ſhoes and leather ierkins which they did eate.

Being nowe more out of hope then euer to eſcape out of ſo extreame perill they cared not for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of the water which nowe was almoſt readie to drowne them. And as men reſolued to die, euery one fell downe backeward, and gaue themſelues ouer altogether vnto the will of the waues. When as one of them a little hauing taken hart vnto him declared vnto them how little way they had to ſayle, aſſuring them that, if the winde held, they ſhould ſee land within three dayes. This man did ſo incourage them, that after they had throwne the water out of the Pinneſſe they remayned three dayes without ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or drinking, except it were of the Sea water. When the time of his promiſe was expired they were more troubled then they were before, ſeeing they could not diſcry any lande. Wherefore in this extreme deſpaire certayne among them made this motion, that it was better that one man onely ſhould dye, then that ſo many men ſhould periſh: they agreed therefore that one ſhould dye to ſuſtaine the others.

After the peace was made in Fraunce, my Lord Admiral <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> ſhewed vnto the king, that he heard no newes at all of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> men which Captaine <hi>Iohn Ribault</hi> had left in <hi>Florida,</hi> &amp; that it were pity to ſuffer them to periſh.

We ſawe it all couered ouer with ſnowe, although it were then but the fifte of May. The inhabitantes in this Iſle being heretofore purſued by the Spaniardes, retired themſelues into this mountaine, where for a ſpace they made warre with them, and woulde not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto their obedience, neither by foule nor faire meanes, they diſdayned ſo much y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> loſſe of their Iland.

               </gap>t of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, I continued my courſe towarde the Weſt, wherein the windes fauoured me ſo well, that fifteene dayes after our ſhippes arriued ſafe and ſounde at the <hi>Antilles:</hi> and going on land at the Iſle of <hi>Martinica</hi> one of the firſt of them, the next day wee arriued<note place="margin">The Iſle of Martinica.

As ſoone as wee had caſt Anker, two <hi>Indians</hi> inhabitantes of that place ſayled toward vs in two <hi>Canoaes</hi> full of a fruit of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie which they call <hi>Ananas.</hi> As they approched vnto our<note place="margin">Ananas a fruite of great excellencie.</note> barke, there was one of them which being in ſome miſdoubt of vs, went backe againe on land, and fled his way with as much ſpeede as he could poſſibly.

But the poore fellow became ſo aſtonied in beholding vs, that he knew not which way to behaue himſelfe, becauſe that (as afterward I vnderſtood) hee feared that he was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9915:24"/>
fallen into the Spaniard hands, of whom he had beene taken once before, and which, as he ſhewed vs, had cut of his ſtones. At length this poore <hi>Indian</hi> was aſſured of vs, and diſcourſed vnto vs of many things, wherof we receaued very ſmal pleaſure, becauſe we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not his mind but by his ſignes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he deſired me to giue him leaue to depart, &amp; promiſed me y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he would bring me a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d preſents, whereunto I agreed on condition that hee would haue patience vntill the next day when I purpoſed to goe on land, where I ſuffered him to depart after I had giuen him a ſhirte, and certain ſmall trifles, wherewith he departed very well content with vs. The place where we went on ſhore was hard by a very hie Rocke out of which there ran a litle riuer of ſweet and excellent good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: by which riuer we ſtayed certayne dayes to diſcouer the things which were worthy to bee ſeen, &amp; traficked dayly with the <hi>Indians:</hi> which aboue all thinges beſought vs that none of our men ſhould come neere their lodgings nor their Gardens, otherwiſe that we ſhould giue them great cauſe of ieloſie, and that in ſo doing wee ſhould not want of their fruit which they call <hi>Ananas,</hi> whereof they offered vs very liberally, receiuing in recompence certaine things of ſmall value. This notwithſtanding it hapned on a day that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of my men, deſirous to ſee ſome new things in theſe ſtrange countries, walked through the woods: and following ſtill the little riuers ſide, they eſpied two Serpents of exceeding bigneſſe, which went ſide by ſide ouerthwarte the way my ſoldiers went before them, thinking to let them from going into the woods: but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents nothing at all aſtoniſhed with theſe geſtures glaunced into the buſhes with fearefull hiſſings, for all which my men drewe their ſwordes and killed them, and found them afterward nine great foote long, and as bigge as a mans legge. During this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, certaine others more vndiſcreete went and gathered their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanas</hi> in the <hi>Indians</hi> Gardens, trampling through them without any diſcretion: and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wee coulde not knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee were killed on the place, or whether he were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: for thoſe of his company had inough to doe to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

without thinking of their companion. Whereof <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur de Ottigni</hi> my Lieuetenant being aduertiſed, ſent vnto me to know whether I thought good that he ſhuld lay an ambuſh for the <hi>Indians</hi> which had either taken or killed our man, or whether hee ſhould goe directly to their dwellinges to knowe the truth. I ſent vnto him, after good delebration hereupon, that hee ſhould not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing and that for diuers occaſions: but contrariwiſe that he ſhould embarke himſelf with all diligence, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all they that were on land: which hee did with ſpeede. But as he ſayled toward our ſhippes he perceiued a long the ſhore a great number of <hi>Indians</hi> which beganne to charge them with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: he for his part diſcharged ſtore of ſhotte againſt them, yet was not able to hurte them, or by any meanes to ſurpriſe them: for which cauſe he quite forſooke them, &amp; came vnto our ſhip.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they brought at their entraunce a great veſſell of earth, made after a ſtrange faſhion full of fountaine water cleere and very excellent. This veſſel was borne by an Indian, and there was another younger which bare of this water in another little veſſell of wood, and preſented thereof to euery one to drinke, obſeruing in doing the ſame, a certaine order and reuerence, which hee made to each of them, to whom he gaue drinke. Our thirſt well quenched by this meane, and our men being ſufficiently refreſhed, the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſſy</hi> brought them to his fathers lodging, one of the oldeſt men that liued on the earth.

Afterwarde they queſtioned with him concerning the courſe of his age, whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he made anſweare, ſhewing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he was the firſt liuing originall, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence 5. generations were deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, as he ſhewed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſate directly ouer againſt him, which far exceeded him in age. And this man was his father, which ſeemed to be rather a dead carcaſſe then a liuing body. For he had his ſinewes, his veins his artiers, his bones, and other parts, appearing ſo cleerely thorow his ſkin, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might eaſely tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; diſcern them one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

He cauſed alſo little Paniers made of Palme leaues full of gourds red and blew to be deliuered vnto them. For recompence of which preſents he was ſatiſfied with French toyes. The two old men cauſed our men to bee guided backe againe to the place from whence they came, by the young <hi>Parracouſſy</hi> which had brought them thither. And hauing taken leaue of the <hi>Paracouſſy</hi> they came and ſought me out in the place where I ſtayed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed vnto me all that they had ſeene, praying me alſo that I would reward their guide, which ſo frankly and heartily had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them into his houſe, which I would not fayle to doe by any meanes. Now was I determined to ſearch out the qualities of the Hill. Therfore I went right to the top therof, where we found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Ceders, Palmes, bayes exceeding ſweete.</note> elſe but Cedars, Palme, and Baytrees of ſo ſoueraine odour, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Baulme ſmelleth nothing like in compariſon.

After I had ſtayed there a while, I embarked againe my people to ſayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the mouth of the Riuer, where we found the <hi>Paracouſſy</hi> which according to his promiſe wayted for vs. Wherefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him we went on ſhore and did him that reuerence that on our part was requiſite: Then he gaue me the ſkin ſo richly painted, &amp; I recompenſed him with ſomewhat of our marchandiſe.

Whereupon when I ſawe with what affection he ſpake, when he pronounced <hi>Thimogoua,</hi> I vnderſtood what hee would ſaye. And to bring my ſelfe more into his fauour I promiſed him to accompany him with all my force, if he would fight againſt them: which thing pleaſed him in ſuch ſorte that from thence foorth, he promiſed himſelfe the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of them, and aſſured me that he would make a voyage thither within a ſhort ſpace, would cauſe ſtore of Mill to be prepared, and would commaund his men to make ready their bowes, and furniſh themſelues with ſuch ſtore of arrowes, that nothing ſhould be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to giue battayle to <hi>Thimogoua.</hi> In fine he prayed me very earneſtly not to fayle of my promiſe, and in ſo doing, hee hoped to procure me gold and ſiluer in ſuch good quantitie that my affayres ſhould take effecte according to mine own and his deſire.

Then the <hi>Paracouſſy</hi> cauſed a Corſelet to be ſet on end, and prayed me to make a proofe of our Harkubuſies and their bowes: but this proofe pleaſed him very little, for aſſoone as he knew that our Harkubuſes did eaſily perce that which al the force of their bowes could not hurte, he ſeemed to be ſorie, muſing with himſelfe how this thing might be done. Neuertheleſſe going about to diſſemble in his mind, that which his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance could not doe by any meanes, he began to fall into another matter, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs very earneſtly to ſtay with him that night in his houſe or lodging, affirming that no greater happineſſe could come vnto him then our long aboad, which he deſired to recompence with a thouſand preſents.

Firſt I let them vnderſtand, how none of them were ignorant, that the parte which was towarde the Cape of <hi>Florida,</hi> was altogether a mariſh Countrey, and therefore vnprofitable for our inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: A thing which cold yeeld neither profit to the king nor any contentment or pleaſure to vs, if peraduenture we would inhabite there.

And that at our firſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it was muche more needefull for vs to plant in places plentifull of victualle, then in goodly Hauens, fayre deepe and pleaſant to the vewe, In conſideration whereof that I was of opinion, if it ſeemed good vnto them to ſeate our ſelues

about the riuer of <hi>May:</hi> ſeing alſo that in our firſt voyage we found the ſame onely among all the reſt to abound in <hi>Maiz</hi> and corne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the gold and ſiluer that was found there: a thing that put<note place="margin">Gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found at the riuer of May.</note> me in hope of ſome happie diſcouery in time to come. After that I had propoſed theſe things euery one gaue his opinion thereof: and in fiue all reſolued, namely thoſe which had beene with me in the firſt voyage, that it was expedient to ſeate themſelues rather on the riuer of <hi>May,</hi> then on any other, vntill they might heare newes out of Fraunce. This point thus being agreed vpon wee ſayled toward the riuer, and vſed ſuch diligence, that with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the windes we arriued there the morrow after about the breake of day, which was on a Thurſeday the 29. of the moneth of<note place="margin">Iune the 29.</note> Iune. Hauing caſt Anker, I embarked al my ſtuffe and the ſoldiers of my company, to ſayle right toward the opening of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: wherein we entred a good way vp, and found a creake of a reſonable vigneſſe, which inuited vs to refreſh our ſelues a little, while we repoſed our ſelues there. Afterward we went on ſhore to ſeeke out a place plaine without trees, which wee perceiued from the creeke. But becauſe we found it not very commodious for vs to inhabite there: we determined to returne vnto the place which we had diſcouered before, when we had ſayled vp the Riuer. This place is ioyning to a mountayne, and it ſeemed vnto vs more fit and commodious to builde a fortreſſe, then that where we were laſt. Therefore we tooke our way towards the foreſts being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein by the young <hi>Paracouſſy</hi> which had led vs before vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fathers lodging. Afterward we found a large plaine couered with high pinetrees diſtant a little one from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other: vnder which we perceiued an infinite number of Stagges which braied amidſt the plaine, a thwarte the which we paſſed: then we diſcouered a little hil adioyning vnto a great vale very greene and in forme flat: wherein were the fayreſt medowes of the world and graſſe to feed cattell.

The prayers ended euery man began to take courage. Afterward hauing meaſured out a piece of ground in forme of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle wee endeuored our ſelues of all ſides, ſome to bring earth ſome to cut Fagots, and others to rayſe and make the rampyre, for there was not a man that had not either a ſhouel, or cutting hook, or hatchet aſwel to make the ground plaine by cutting down the trees, as for the building of the Fort, which we did haſten with ſuch cheerefulneſſe that within few dayes the effect of our diligence was apparant: In which meane ſpace the <hi>Paracouſſy Satourioua</hi> our neereſt neighbour, and on whoſe ground we built our fort, came vſually accompanied with his two ſonnes and a great number of Indians to offer to do vs al curteſie.

For this purpoſe hee cauſed the barke to retire wherein were the two Indians his guides, &amp; went with his toward the Canoes which were on the Riuers ſide.

I made him aunſwere that for his amitie I would not purchaſe the enmitie of the other, and that albeit I would, yet notwithſtanding I wanted meanes to doe it.

The <hi>Paracouſſy Satourioüa</hi> had no ſooner ended his ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and had taken a viewe of all his companye, but he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked himſelfe, and vſed ſuch diligence with his Almadies or boates, that the next daye two houres before the ſonnes ſet, hee arriued on the territories of his enemies aboute eight or ten leages from their villages: Afterward cauſing them all to goe on lande he aſſembled his counſel, wherein it was agreed that fiue of the <hi>Paracouſſies</hi> ſhoulde ſaile vp the riuer with halfe of the<note place="margin">Conſultation before they aſſault their enemies.</note> troupes and by the breake of daye ſhould approch vnto the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their enemie: for his owne parte that he woulde take his iorney through the woodes and foreſts as ſecretly as hee coulde: that when they were come thither, as wel they that went by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as he which went by land ſhoulde not faile by the breake of the daye to enter into the village, &amp; cut them all in peeces except the women and little children.

to ſing prayſes vnto the ſunne to whome they attributed their victorie.

After that I was aduertiſed of theſe things, I ſent a ſoldier vnto <hi>Satourioüa</hi> praying him to ſende me two of his priſoners: which hee denied me, ſaying that hee was nothing beholding vnto me, and that I had broken my promiſe, againſt the oath which I had ſworne vnto him at my arriuall. Which when I vnderſtoode by my ſoldier, which was come backe with ſpeéde, I deuiſed howe I might be reuenged of this ſauage, and to make him knowe howe dearely this bolde brauado of his ſhoulde coſt him: therefore I commanded my ſergiant to prouide me twentie ſoldiers to goe with mee to the houſe of <hi>Satourioüa:</hi> Where after I was come and entered into the hall without any manner of ſalutation, I went and ſate mee downe by him and ſtayed a long while without ſpeaking any worde vnto him, nor ſhewing him any ſigne of friendſhip, which thing put him deépe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his domps: beſides that certaine ſoldiers remained at the gate, to whome I had giuen expreſſe commandement to ſuffer no Indian to goe foorth: hauing ſtoode ſtill about halfe an houre with this countenaunce, at length I demaunded where the priſoners were, which hee hadde taken at <hi>Thomogoua,</hi> and commaunded them preſentlie to be brought vnto mee.

Then <hi>Satourioüa</hi> commanded his ſonne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thore</hi> to ſeéke out the priſoners, and to cauſe them to be brought<note place="margin">Athore.</note> into that place, which thing he did within an houre after.

The meſſengers praied me to haue patience vntill the morrowe, at what time they woulde come agayne vnto mee to certifie mee of their lordes inclination: which they fayled not to doe, aduertiſing mee that <hi>Paracouſſy</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:9915:35"/>
               <hi>Satourioua</hi> was the gladdeſt man in the worlde to treate of this accorde (although in deede he was quite contrarie) and that hee beſought me to be diligent therein, promiſing to obſerue &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatſoeuer I ſhould agreé vpon with thoſe of <hi>Thimogoü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a:</hi> which thinges the meſſengers alſo rehearſed vnto the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners which I had led away. After they were departed I reſolued within two dayes to ſende backe againe the priſoners to <hi>Olata Ouae Vtina,</hi> whoſe ſubiectes they were: but before I embarked them, I gaue them certaine ſmale trifles, which were litle kniues or tablets of glaſſe, wherein the image of King <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth was drawen verie liuely, for which they gaue mee verie great thankes, as alſo for the honeſt entertainment which was giuen them at the fort <hi>Caroline:</hi> after this they embarked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, with captaine <hi>Vaſſeur,</hi> &amp; with monſur <hi>De Arlac</hi> mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne which I had ſent of purpoſe to remaine a certaine time with <hi>Ouae Vtina,</hi> hoping that the fauour of this great <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſſy</hi> would ſerue my turne greatly to make my diſcoueries in time to come. I ſent with him alſo one of my ſergeantes, and ſixe gallant ſoldiers. Thus things paſſed on this manner, and the hatred of <hi>Paracouſſy Satourioua</hi> agaynſt me did ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, vntill that on the 29. of Auguſt a lightning from heauen<note place="margin">A wonderfull lightning the 29. of Auguſt.</note> fell within halfe a league of our forte, more worthie I beleéue, to be wondred at, &amp; to be put in writing, then all the ſtrang ſignes which haue beéne ſeéne in times paſt, and whereof the hiſtories haue neuer written. For although the medowes were at that ſeaſon all greéne, and halfe couered ouer with water, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the lightning in one inſtant conſumed aboue fiue hundred acres therewith, and burned with the ardent heate thereof all the foules which tooke their paſtime in the medowes, which thing continued for threé dayes ſpace, which cauſed vs not a little to muſe, not able to iudge whereof this fire proceéded: for one while wee thought that the Indians had burnt their houſes, and abandoned their places for feare of vs: another while wee thought that they had diſcouered ſome ſhips in the ſea, and that according to their cuſtome they had kindled many fires here and there to ſignifie that their countrie was inhabited: neuertheleſſe being not aſſured, I determined to ſende to <hi>Paracouſſy Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
               <note place="margin">King Sarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay.</note> to know the trueth thereof. But euen as I was vppon the

point to ſende one by boate to diſcouer the matter, ſixe Indians<note place="margin">King Allima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany.</note> came vnto meé from <hi>Paracouſſy Allimacany,</hi> which at their firſt entrie made vnto meé a long diſcourſe, and a verie large and ample oration (after they had preſented mee with certaine baſketes full of Maiz, of Pompions and of Grapes,) of the louing amitie which <hi>Allimacany</hi> deſired to continue with meé, and that hee looked from day to day when it would pleaſe meé to employ him in my ſeruice. Therefore conſidering the ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affection that he bare vnto mee, hee founde it very ſtrange, that I thus diſcharged myne ordinance againſt his dwelling,<note place="margin">The ſauages thinke the lightning to be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Chriſtians ordinance.</note> which had burnt vp an infinite ſight of greéne medowes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed euen downe vnto the bottome of the water, and came ſo neére vnto his manſion that heé thought heé ſawe the fire in his houſe: wherefore heé beſought meé moſt humblie to commaunde my men that they woulde not ſhoote any more towardes his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, otherwiſe that hereafter heé ſhould beé conſtrayned to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his countrey, and to retyre himſelfe into ſome place more farther of from vs. Hauing vnderſtood the fooliſh opinion of this man, which notwithſtanding could not chooſe but beé very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for vs, I diſſembled what I thought thereof for that time, and aunſwered the Indians with a cheérefull countenaunce, that the relation, which they made vnto meé of the obedience of their <hi>Paracouſſy,</hi> did pleaſe meé right well, becauſe that before heé had not behaued himſelfe in ſuch ſort towardes meé, eſpecially when I ſommoned him to ſende meé the priſoners of great <hi>Olata Ouae Vtina</hi> which heé detained, whereof notwithſtanding hee made no great accompt, which was the principall cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had diſcharged myne ordinaunce againſt him: not that I meant to reach vnto his houſe, as I might haue done eaſily, if it<note place="margin">Laudonnlere vſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion to his profite.</note> had pleaſed meé, but that I was content to ſhoote the halfe waye to make him knowe my force: aſſuring him furthermore, that on condition that heé would continue in his good affection, no more ordinance ſhoulde be diſcharged againſt him hereafter: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that I would become his faithfull protectour againſt his greateſt enimies. The Indians contented with myne aunſwere returned to aſſure their <hi>Paracouſſy,</hi> which notwithſtanding the aſſurance withdrew himſelfe from his dwelling tweéntie or fiue and twentie leages off, and that for the ſpace of more then two

               <hi>Bourdet</hi> determined to leaue me to returne into Fraunce. Then I requeſted him, yea rather was exceéding importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with him, to carrie home with him ſome ſixe or ſeauen ſouldiers whome I coulde not truſt by any meanes: which he did for my ſake, and would not charge him ſelfe with <hi>Gieure,</hi> which offered him a great ſumme of money, if it woulde pleaſe him to carrie him into France: he tranſported him onely to the other ſide of the riuer. Threé dayes after his departure thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene mariners which I had brought out of France, ſuborned by certayne other mariners which captaine <hi>Bourdet</hi> had left me, ſtole away my barkes in manner following. Theſe mariners of captayne <hi>Bourdet</hi> put mine in the heade, that if they had<note place="margin">One of his Barkes ſtolne away by his mariners.</note> ſuche barkes as mine were, they might gaine verie muche in the Iſles of the <hi>Antilles,</hi> and make an exceéding profitable voyage. Herevppon they beganne to deuiſe howe they might ſteale away my barkes, and conſulted that when I ſhoulde commande them to goe vnto the village of <hi>Sarauahi</hi> diſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue<note place="margin">The village of Sarrauahi.</note> a league and an halfe from our ſort, and ſcituated vppon an arme of the riuer (whither according to my manner I ſent them dayly to ſeéke clay, to make bricke and morter for our houſes) they would returne no more, but would furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with victuals as well as they might poſſiblie: and then would embarke themſelues all in one veſſell and woulde goe<note place="margin">Another of his barkes ſtolne away by two car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters.</note> their way: as in déede they did. And that which was woorſe, two Flemmiſhe carpenters, whiche the ſayde <hi>Bourdet</hi> had left me, ſtole away the other barke, and before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cut the cables of the barke and of the ſhippe Boate, that it might goe away with the tyde, that I might not purſue them: ſo that I remayned without either barke or boate, which fell out as vnluckily for me as was poſſible. For I was readye to imbarke my ſelfe with all ſpeéde, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as farre vp our riuer, as I might by any meanes. Nowe my mariners, as I vnderſtoode afterwardes, tooke a barke that was a paſſenger of the Spaniardes neére the Iſle of Cuba, wherein they founde a certayne quantitie of golde and ſiluer, which they ſeaſed vppon: And hauing this bootie they lay a while at ſea, vntill their victuals beganne to ſayle them: whiche was the cauſe that oppreſſed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men to the Spaniards and brought them into Florida.</note> of <hi>Cuba:</hi> whereupon proceéded that miſchiefe which hereafter I will declare more at large. When I ſawe my Barkes retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not at their wonted howre, and ſuſpecting that which fell out in deéde, I commaunded my Carpenters with all diligence to make a little boate with a flat bottome, to ſerch thoſe riuers for ſome newes of theſe Marriners. The boate diſpatched within a day and a night, by reaſon that my Carpenters found planks and timber readie ſawed to their handes, as commonly I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">A ſavve mill neceſſary here</note> my Sawyers to prouide it, I ſent men to ſeéke ſome newes of my thieues: but all was in vaine. Therefore I determined to cauſe two great Barkes to be built, each of which might bee thirtie fiue or thirtie ſixe foote long in the keele. And nowe the worke was verie well forward which I ſet my workemen about, when ambition &amp; auarice, the mother of all miſchiefe, tooke roote in the heartes of foure or fiue ſoldiers which could not away with the worke and paines taking: and which from hence forward, namely one <hi>Foueneaux,</hi> and one <hi>La Croix,</hi> and another called<note place="margin">The thirde ſedition.</note> 
               <hi>Steuen le Geneuois,</hi> the threé principall authors of the ſedition, beganne to practiſe with the beſt of my troupe, ſhewing them that it was a vile thing for men of honeſt parentage, as they were, to moyle them ſelues thus wich abiect and baſe worke, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had the beſt occaſion of the worlde offered them to make themſelues all rich: which was to arme the two Barkes which were in building and to furniſh them with good men: and then to ſaile vnto <hi>Peru,</hi> and the other Iſles of the <hi>Antilles,</hi> where euerie<note place="margin">By Peru the French meane the coſte of Carthagena and Nombre de Dios.</note> ſoldier might eaſily enrich himſelfe with ten thouſand crownes. And if their enterpriſe ſhoulde bee miſliked with all in France, they ſhoulde bee alwayes able, by reaſon of the great wealth that they ſhould gaine, to returne themſelues into Italie, vntill the heate were ouer paſſed, and that in the meane ſeaſon ſome warre would fall out which would cauſe all this to bee quite forgotten. This worde of riches ſounded ſo well in the eares of my ſoldiers, that in fine, after they had oftentimes conſulted of their affaires, they grew to the number of threé ſcore and fixe: which to colour their great deſire which they had to goe on ſtealing, they cauſed a requeſt to be preſented vnto mee by <hi>Francis la Caille</hi> ſergeant of my companie, containing in ſumme a declaration of the ſmale

ſtore of victuals that was left to mayntayne vs, vntill the time that ſhippes might returne from France: for remedie whereof they thought it neceſſarie to ſende to <hi>Newe Spaigne,</hi> to <hi>Peru,</hi> and all the Iles adioyning, which they beſought meé to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to grant. But I made them anſwere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when the barkes were finiſhed, I woulde take ſuch good order in generall, that by meanes of the kinges Marchandiſe, without ſparing myne owne apparell, weé woulde get victuals of the inhabitantes of the countrey: ſeéing alſo that wee had ynough to ſerue vs for foure monethes to come. For I feared greatly, that vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſerching victuals they woulde enterpriſe ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the kings of Spaynes ſubiectes, which in time to come might iuſtly be layde to my charge, conſidering that at our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture<note place="margin">The captaines charge at his ſetting forth.</note> out of France, the Queéne had charged me very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to do no kinde of wrong to the king of Spaines ſubiects, nor any thing whereof he might conteyne any ieloſie. They made as though they were content with this anſwere. But eight daies after, as I continued in working vpon our fort, &amp; on my barkes, I fell ſicke. Then my ſeditious companions forgetting all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and duetie, ſuppoſing that they had found good occaſion to execute their rebellious enterpriſe, began to practiſe afreſh their former deſignes, handling their buſines ſo well, during my ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that they openly vowed that they woulde ſeaſe of the corps de gard, and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whom I cauſed unmediately to be put in fetters: for my meaning was not to puniſh the reſt, conſidering that they were ſuborned, and becauſe my counſell, expreſſely aſſembled for this purpoſe, had concluded that theſe foure onely ſhoulde die,<note place="margin">Laudonnieres oration to his mutinous ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> to ſerue for an example to the reſt. In the ſame place I made an Oration vnto them in this maner. <hi>My friendes, you knowe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9915:42"/>
               <hi>the cauſe why our king ſent vnto this countrie: you knowe that hee is our naturall Prince, whome wee are bounde to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey according to the commandement of God, in ſuch ſorte that wee ought neither to ſpare our goods nor liues to doe thoſe thinges, that concerne his ſeruice: yee knowe, or at leaſt you can not be ignorant, that beſides this generall and naturall obligation, you haue this alſo ioyned thereunto, that in receyuing of him reaſonable paye and wages, you are bounde to followe thoſe, whome hee hath eſtabliſhed ouer you, to bee your gouernors, and to commaunde you in his name, hauing for this purpoſe giuen him an othe of fidelitie, which you cannot by any meanes reuoke for any faire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which you haue to doe the contrarie: for this is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſeeing you liue vppon his charges on this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (this is reaſon I ſaye,) that you ſhoulde bee faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Notwithſtanding you haue had more regarde vnto your vnbridled affections, then vnto vertue, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited you to the obſeruance of your othe, in ſuch ſort that being become contemners of all honeſtie, you haue paſſed your bonds, and thought that all things were lawful for you. Whereupon it is fallen out, that while you thought to eſcape the iuſtice of men you coulde not auoide the iudgement of God: which as a thing by no meanes to bee auoided hath ledde you, and in ſpite of you hath made you to arriue in this place, to make you to confeſſe, how true his iudgementes are, and that he neuer ſuffreth ſo foule a fault to eſcape vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi> After that I had vſed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe or the like ſpeaches, following that which wee had agreed vppon in counſaile, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the crimes which they had committed, aſwell againſt the kinges Maieſtie, as againſt mée which was their Captaine, I commaunded that they ſhoulde bee hanged. Seeing therefore<note place="margin">The ſentence of death.</note> that there was no ſtarting hole nor meanes at all to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from this arreſt, they tooke themſelues vnto their praiers. Yet one of the foure thinking to rayſe a mutinie among my ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſayd thus vnto them: What, brethren &amp; companions, will you ſuffer vs to die ſo ſhamefully? And taking the word out of his mouth, I ſaid vnto him, that they were not companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of authors of ſedition &amp; rebels vnto the kings ſeruice. Hereupon the ſoldiers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9915:42"/>
beſought me not to hang the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather let them be ſhot through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then afterward if I thought good, their bodies might be<note place="margin">Execution.</note> hanged vpon certaine gibbets along the Hauens mouth: which I cauſed preſently to bee put in execution. Loe heere what was the and of my mutinous ſoldiers, without which I had alwaies liued peaceably and enioyed the good deſire which I had to make an happie and quiet voyage. But becauſe I haue ſpoken of nothing but their accidentes and aduentures which happened vnto them after their departure, without making any mention of our fort,<note place="margin">The continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the hiſtorie.</note> I will returne to the matters from which I digreſſed: to declare that which fell out after their departure. Firſt I began to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the ende I might confirme and make my ſelfe more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in mine affliction, that theſe murmurours coulde not ground their ſedition vpon want of victualls. For from the time of our arriuall, euery ſoldier daily vnto this day and beſides vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the eight and twentith of February had a loaf of bread weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two and twenty ounces. Againe I recounted with my ſelfe that all newe conqueſts by ſea or by land are ordinarily troubled<note place="margin">Nevve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts ſubiect to rebellions and mutinies.</note> with rebellions, which are eaſie to be raiſed aſwel in reſpect of the diſtance of place, as in reſpect of the hope that the ſouldiers haue to make their profite, as we may bee well informed both by aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtories, &amp; alſo by the troubles which lately happened vnto <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> after his firſt diſcouery, to <hi>Francis Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro,</hi> &amp; <hi>Diego de Almagro</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and to <hi>Fernand Cortes.</hi> An hundred thouſand other thinges came vnto my minde, to incourage and confirme me. My Lieuetenaunt <hi>Ottigny</hi> and my Sergeaurunt of my band came to ſeeke me in the ſhippe, where I was priſoner, and carried me from thence in a barke, aſſoone as our rebels were departed. After I was come vnto the fort, I<note place="margin">Laudonniere ſetteth things in order after his returne out of priſon to the fort.</note> cauſed all my companye that remained to bee aſſembled in the middeſt of the place before the corps de garde, and declared vnto them the faultes which they which had forſaken vs had committed, praying them to beare them in memorie, to beare witneſſe thereof when neede ſhoulde require. Forthwith I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained newe Captaines to commaund the troupes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed them an order, according where-vnto they were to gouerne themſelues from thence forwarde, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their watch, for the greateſt parte of the ſouldyers
<pb facs="tcp:9915:43"/>
of whome I had the beſt opinion, were gone away with them. My declaration ended, they promiſed me all with one accorde to obey me moſt humblie, and to doe whatſoeuer I ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them, though it were to die at my féete for the kinges ſeruice: wherein aſſuredly they neuer after fayled: So that I dare ſay after the departure of my mutinous companions I was as well obeyed as euer was Captayne in place where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. The next day after my returne vnto the fort, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled my men together agayne, to declare vnto them that our fort was not yet finiſhed, and that it was néedefull that all of vs ſhoulde put thereto our helping handes, to aſſure our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Indians. Wherein hauing willingly agréed vnto me,<note place="margin">Reperation of the vveſt ſide of the fort. Carpenters.</note> they raiſed it all with turfes from the gate vnto the riuer, which is on the weſt ſide. This done I ſet my Carpenters on worke to make another barke of the ſame bigneſſe that the others were of: I commanded the ſawiers that they ſhould prepare plancks,<note place="margin">Savviers. Smithes. Coleyers.</note> the Smithes to prepare yron and Nayles, and certayne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make coales: ſo that the barke was finiſhed in eightéene dayes. Afterwarde I made an other leſſer then the firſt the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſcouer vp the riuer. In this meane ſpace the Indians viſited me and brought me daily certaine preſents, as fiſh, deare, Turkicockes, Leopards, little Beares, and other things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the place of their habitation. I recompenſed them with certayne hatchets, kniues, beads of glaſſe, combes, and looking-glaſſes. Two Indians came vnto me one day to ſalute me on the<note place="margin">King Marra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou.</note> behalfe of their king whoſe name was <hi>Marracou,</hi> dwelling from the place of our fort ſome fortie leagues toward the South, and tolde me that there was one in the houſe of King <hi>Onathaqua</hi> which was called <hi>Barbu</hi> or the bearded man, and in the houſe of<note place="margin">King Ona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaqua. King Mathia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note> king <hi>Mathiaca</hi> another man whoſe name they knew not, which was not of their nation: wherupon I conceiued that theſe might be ſome Chriſtians. Wherefore I ſent to all the kinges my neighbours to pray them, that if there were any Chriſtian dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their countries, they would finde meanes that hee might be brought vnto me, and that I woulde make them double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. They, which loue rewardes, tooke ſomuch payne, that the two men, whereof wee haue ſpoken, were brought vnto the fort vnto mee. They were naked, wearing their heires
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9915:43"/>
long vnto their hammes as the ſauages vſe to doe: and were<note place="margin">Tvvo Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards brought vnto Laudon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere by the ſauages.</note> Spaniards borne, yet ſo well accuſtomed to the faſhion of the countrie, that at the firſt ſight they found our manner of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſtraunge. After that I had queſtioned of certayne matters with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I cauſed them to be apparelled and to cut their heire, which they would not looſe, but lapped it vp in a lynen cloth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they woulde carie it into their countrey to be a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the miſerie that they had indured in the Indies. In the heire of one of them was founde a little golde hidden, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of fiue and twentie Crownes, which hée gaue vnto me. And examining them of the places, where they had beene, and howe they came thither, they anſwered mee that fiftéene yeares paſt, thrée ſhippes, in one of which they were, were caſt away ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Calos a place The Flattes called the Martyrs neere the Cape of Florida.</note> a place named <hi>Calos</hi> vppon the Flates which are called <hi>The Martyrs,</hi> and that the king of <hi>Calos</hi> recouered the greateſt part of the riches which were in the ſaide ſhippes, traueiling in ſuch ſort that the greateſt part of the people was ſaued and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women, among which number there were thrée or foure wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men married, remaining there yet, and their children alſo, with this king of <hi>Calos.</hi> I deſired to learne what this king was:<note place="margin">The King of Calos.</note> they anſwered me, that he was the goodlieſt and the talleſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the countrey, a mightie man, a warrier, and hauing many ſubiectes vnder his obedience. They tolde me moreouer, that hee had great ſtore of golde and ſyluer, ſo farre foorth that in a<note place="margin">Great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of gold &amp; ſyluer.</note> certayne village hée had a pit full thereof, which was at the leaſt as high as a man, and as large as a tunne, all which wealth the Spaniards fully perſwaded themſelues that they coulde cauſe me to recouer, if I were able to marche thither with an hundred ſhotte, beſides that which I might get of the common people of the countrie, which had alſo great ſtore thereof. They further alſo aduertiſed me, that the women going to daunce did we are<note place="margin">Plates of gold as broad as a ſavvcer.</note> about their girdles plates of golde as broade as a ſawcer, and in ſuch number that the weight did hinder them to dance at theyr eaſe, and that the men ware the like alſo.

               </gap>ppes which commonly were caſt away in this ſtraight, and the reſt, by the traficke which this king of <hi>Calos</hi> had with the other kings
<pb facs="tcp:9915:44"/>
of the countrie, finallie that hée had in great reuerence of his ſubiectes, and that hee made them beléene, that his ſorceries and charmes were the cauſes that made the earth bring foorth her fruite, and that hee might the eaſier perſwade them that it was ſo, he retyred himſelfe once or twiſe a yeare to a certaine houſe, accompanied with two or thrée of his moſt familier friendes, where hee vſed certayne inchauntmentes, and if any man intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe to goe to ſée what they did in this place, the king immediately cauſed him to bee put to death. Moreouer they<note place="margin">One of theſe Spaniardes names was Martin Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> tolde mee, that euery yeare in the time of harueſt this ſauage king ſacrificed one man, which was kepte expreſſely for this purpoſe, and taken out of the number of the Spaniardes, which by tempeſt were caſt away vppon that coſte. One of theſe two declared vnto mee that hee had ſerued him a long time for a meſſenger: and that oftentimes by his commaundement hee had viſited a king named <hi>Oathcaqua,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Calos</hi> foure<note place="margin">King Oath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caqua or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uathcha.</note> or fiue dayes iourney, which alwayes remayned his faithfull friende: but that in the midway there was an Ilande ſituate in a great lake of freſhwater, named <hi>Sarrope,</hi> about fiue leagues in<note place="margin">Sarrope an Ilande. Aboundance of Dates. A roote of great price to make bread of</note> bigneſſe, abounding with many ſortes of fruites, ſpecially in Dates which growe on the palme trées, whereof they make a wonderfull traficke, yet not ſo great as a kinde of roote, whereof they make a kinde of meale ſo good to make bread of, that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to eate better: and that, for fifteene leagues about, all the countrie is fed therewith. Which is the cauſe that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes of the Iſle gaine of their neighbours great wealth and profite: for they will not depart with this roote without they he well payed for it: beſides that they are taken for the moſt warrelike men of all that countrie, as they made good proofe when the king of <hi>Calos,</hi> hauing made alliance with <hi>Oathca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua,</hi> was depriued of <hi>Oathcaquaes</hi> daughter which hee had promiſed to him in marriage. Hee tolde mee the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this ſorte. As <hi>Oathcaqua</hi> well accompanied with his people carried one of his daughters, excéeding beawtifull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the coulour of the countrey, vnto king <hi>Calos,</hi> to giue her vnto him for his wife, the inhabitantes of his Iſle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed of the matter, layde an ambuſh for him in a place where

hee ſhould paſſe, and ſo behaued themſelues, that <hi>Oathcaqua</hi> was diſcomfited, the betrothed young ſpouſe taken, and all the Damoſelles that accompanied her, which they carried vnto their<note place="margin">The greateſt victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians.</note> Iſle, which thing in all the Indians countrey they eſteeme to be the greateſt victorie: for afterwarde they marrie theſe virgins, and loue them aboue all meaſure. The Spaniarde that made this relation, tolde me that after this defeite he went to dwell with <hi>Oathcaqua,</hi> and had béene with him full eight yeares, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vntil the time that hee was ſent vnto mee. The place of<note place="margin">The ſituation of Calos.</note> 
               <hi>Calos</hi> is ſituate vppon a riuer which is beyond the Cape of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> fortie or fiftie leagues towardes the Southweſt: and the dwelling of <hi>Oathcaqua</hi> is on this ſide the Cape towarde the North in a place which we call in the Carte <hi>Caignaueral,</hi> which<note place="margin">Caiguaueral in 28. degrees.</note> is in eight and twentie degrées. About the fiue and twenteth of Ianuarie <hi>Paracouſſy Satourioüa</hi> my neighbour ſent me cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne preſentes by two of his ſubiectes, to perſwade me to ioyne with him, and to make warre vppon <hi>Ouae Vtina</hi> which was my friende: and farther beſought mee to retyre certayne of my men which were with <hi>Vtina,</hi> for whome if it had not béene hee had oftentimes ſet vppon him and defeited him, he beſought me herein by diuers other kinges his allies, which for thrée weekes or a monethes ſpace ſent meſſengers vnto mee to this ende and purpoſe. But I woulde not graunt vnto them that they ſhould make warre vppon him, yea rather contrariwiſe I endeuoured to make them friendes: wherein they condiſcended vnto mee, ſo farre foorth that they were content to allowe of any thing that I would ſet downe: whereupon the two Spaniardes which of long time knew well the nature of the Indians, warned me that in any caſe I ſhould not truſt vnto them: becauſe that when they<note place="margin">The Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans great trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emblers.</note> ſhewed good countenance and the beſt chéere vnto men, then was the time that they woulde ſurpriſe and betraye them: and that of their nature they were the greateſt traitours and moſt deepe diſſemblers of the worlde. Beſides I neuer truſted them but vpon good ground, as one that had diſcouered a thouſand of their craftes and ſubtilties, aſwel by experience as by reading of the hiſtories of late yeares. Our two barkes were not ſo ſoone finiſhed, but I ſent Captayne <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> to diſconer a long the coſte lying towarde the Northe, and commaunded him to
<pb facs="tcp:9915:45"/>
ſaile vnto a riuer the king wherof was called <hi>Auduſta,</hi> which was lord of that place, where thoſe of the yeare 1562. inhabites. I ſent him twoe ſutes of apparel, with certaine hachats, kniues, and other ſmale trifles, the better to inſinuate my ſelfe into his friendſhippe. And the better to win him I ſent in the barke with captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> a ſoldier called <hi>Aimon,</hi> which was one of them which returned home in the firſte voyage, hoping that king <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſta</hi> might remember him. But before they were embarked I commanded them to make inquirie what was become of another called <hi>Rouffi,</hi> which remained alone in thoſe parts, when Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las<note place="margin">Nicalas Maſſon.</note> Maſſon and thoſe of the firſte voyage embarked themſelues to returne into France. They vnderſtood at their arriual there, that a barke paſſing that waye had caried awaye the ſame ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And afterward I knew for a certaintie, that they were Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes which had carried him to <hi>Hauana.</hi> The kinge <hi>Auduſta</hi> ſent mee backe my barke ful of mill, with a certaine quantitie of<note place="margin">King Audu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie.

In the meane while there came vnto our forte a flocke of ſtocke voues in ſo<note place="margin">Peter Martyr vvrites cap. 1. decad. 7. that the like flocks of Pigeons are in the Iſles of the Lucayes.</note> greate nomber, and that for the ſpace of ſeuen weekes together, that euery daye wee killed with hargubuſe ſhot twoe hundred in the woods aboute our forte. After that captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I cauſed the two barkes to be furniſhed againe with ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and mariners, and ſent them to carrie a preſent from mee vnto the widow of king <hi>Hioacaia,</hi> whoſe dwelling was diſtante<note place="margin">The vvidovve of King Hioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caia, or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houhacara.</note> from our forte about twelue leages northward.

And the place where this widowe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth is the moſt plentiful of mil that is in all the coaſte and the<note place="margin">This Quenes name vvas Nia-Cubaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> moſte pleaſant. It is thought that the queene is the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of al the Indians, and of whome they make moſt accompt: yea and her ſubiects honour her ſo much, that almoſt continualy they beare her on their ſhoulders and wil not ſuffer her to go on foote.

Nowe while I thought I was furniſhed with victuals vntill the time that our ſhippes might come out of France, (for feare of<note place="margin">The fift voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age vp the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of May.</note> keeping my people idle) I ſent my two barkes to diſcouer along the riuer and vp toward the head thereof, which went ſo farre vp that they were thirtie leagues good beyonde a place named <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiaqua,</hi>

The greater part was of<note place="margin">A good note.</note> opinion, that I ſhoulde doe well to ſende ſuccour vnto this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racouſſy,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:9915:46"/>
becauſe it would be harde for mee to diſcouer any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vp into the countrie without his helpe: and that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards<note place="margin">A ſpecial note</note> when they were employed in their conqueſtes, did alwaies enter into alliance with ſome one king to ruine another. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, becauſe I did alwayes miſtruſt the Indians, and that the more after the laſt aduertiſement that the Spaniards had giuen me, I doubted leaſt the ſmall number which <hi>Vtina</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded might incurre ſome danger: wherefore I ſent him thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhot vnder the charge of Lieuetenant <hi>Ottigny:</hi> which ſtayed not aboue two dayes with <hi>Vtina,</hi> while he prepared victuals for his voyage, which ordinarily and according to the cuſtome of the countrie are carried by women and yong boyes, and by Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites. <hi>Vtina</hi> ſetting forward with threé hundred of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,<note place="margin">Thre hundred Indians.</note> hauing ech of them their bowe and quiuer full of arrowes, cauſed our thirtie ſhot to be placed in the forewarde, and made them march all the day vntill that the night approching, and hauing not gone paſt halfe the way, they were enforced to lie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in the woodes, neére a great ſake, and there to encampe themſelues: they ſeperated themſelues by ſixe and ſixe, making ech of them a fire about the place where their king lay, for whoſe garde they ordayned a certayne number of thoſe archars, in whome hee put moſt confidence. As ſoone as daye was come, the campe of the Indians marched within threé leagues of <hi>Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou:</hi> There king <hi>Vtina</hi> requeſted my Lieutenant to graunt him foure or fiue of his men to goe and diſcouer the countrey: which departed immediately, and had not gone farre but they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">A lake three leages diſtant from the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou.</note> vpon a lake, diſtant about threé leagues from the village of <hi>Potanou,</hi> three Indians which fiſhed in a Canoa. Nowe the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is that when they fiſhe in this lake, they haue alwayes a companie of Watchmen, armed with Bowes and Arrowes to garde the fiſhers.

Wherefore they returned towardes <hi>Vtina,</hi> which ſuddenly ſent them backe with a greater company to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the fiſhers, before they might retyre and aduertiſe their king <hi>Potanou</hi> of the comming of his enimies. Which they coulde not execute ſo politikely but that two of them eſcaped:
<pb facs="tcp:9915:47"/>
the third alſo did the beſt he could to ſaue himſelfe by ſwimming, in which meane while hee was ſtaied with ſhotte of arrowes, and they drew him ſtarke dead vnto the bankes ſide, where our Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fleade of the ſkinne of his head, cut of both his armes in the high way, reſeruing his haire for the triumphe which their king hoped to make for the defeate of his enimie. <hi>Vtina</hi> fearing leaſt <hi>Potanou</hi> aduertiſed by the Fiſhers which were eſcaped, ſhoulde put himſelfe in armes to withſtand him valiantly, asked counſell<note place="margin">Iávva, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their Prieſt or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</note> of his <hi>Iawa,</hi> which is aſmuch to ſay in their language as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician, whether it were beſt to goe any farther. Then this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian made certaine ſignes hidious and fearefull to beholde, and vſed certaine wordes, which being ended, he ſayd vnto his king,<note place="margin">Potanou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied vvith tvvo thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> that it was not beſt to paſſe any farther, &amp; that <hi>Potanou</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with two thouſand Indians at the leaſt ſtaied in ſuch and ſuch a place for him, to byd him battaile: and beſides this, that all the ſayd Indians were furniſhed with coards to binde the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners which they made full accompt to take. This relation cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Vtina</hi> to be vnwilling to paſſe any farther: Whereupon my Lieuetenant being as angry as euer he might be, becauſe he had taken ſo great paines without doing any thing of accompt, ſayd vnto him, that he would neuer thinke well of him nor of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if he would not hazard himſelfe: and that if he would not doe it, at the leaſt that he would giue him a guide to conduct him and his ſmall companye to the place where the enimies were encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

For when they goe on hunting, they make little cottages in the woodes, whereunto they retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, liuing vpon that which they take in hunting. This was the cauſe that during this time, we could get no victuals by their meanes: and had it not beene that I had made good prouiſion<note place="margin">They looke for ſuccour out of France by the end of April at the vttermoſt.</note> thereof, while my men had ſtore, vntill the ende of Aprill (which was the time, when at the vttermoſt, we hoped to haue had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour out of France) I ſhould haue beene greatly amazed.

During which time the poore ſouldyers and handycrafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men become as féeble as might be, and beeing not able to worke, did nothing but goe one after another in centinel vnto the clift of an hill, ſcituate very néere vnto the fort, to ſée if they might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any French ſhippe. In fine beeing fruſtrated of their hope, they aſſembled altogether, and came to beſéech me to take ſome order that they might returne into France, conſidering that if we let paſſe the ſeaſon to embarke our ſelues, we were neuer like to ſée our countrie, where it coulde not bee choſen but that ſome troubles were fallen out, ſéeing they had broken their promiſe<note place="margin">Promiſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> made vnto vs, and that no ſuccour was come from thence. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it was conſulted and reſolued by all the companye that the barke Breton ſhould be trimmed vp, whereof Captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> had charge. But becauſe the ſhippe was not bigge inough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs all, ſome thought good to builde the Brigantine two deckes higher, which our mutinous ſoldyers had brought backe, and that 25. men ſhould hazard themſelues to paſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in into France. The reſt being better aduiſed ſaid that it ſhoulde be farre better to builde a faire ſhippe vpon the kéele of the gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote which I had cauſed to be made, promiſing to labour couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly there vpon. Then I enquired of my ſhipwrights to know in what ſpace they coulde make this ſhippe readie.

There remained now but the principal, which was to recouer victuals to ſuſtaine vs while our worke endured: which I vndertooke to do with the reſt of my company and the Mariners of the ſhippe. To this end I embarked my ſelfe making vp y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thirtieth in my great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9915:48"/>
barke to make a voyage of fortie or fiftie leagues, hauing with vs no prouiſion at all of victuals: whereby it may eaſily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red howe ſimply thoſe of our fort were prouided. True it is that certaine ſouldyers being better huſbandes then the reſt, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſome prouiſion of maſt, ſolde a little meaſure thereof for fiftéene and twenty ſous vnto their companions. During our voyage we liued of nothing elſe but raſpices, of a certaine round graine, little and blacke, and of the rootes of palmites which we gate by the riuer ſides, wherein after wee had ſayled a long time in vaine, I was conſtrained to returne to the fort: where the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyers beginning to bee wearie of working becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame famine which did conſume them, aſſembled themſelues, &amp; declared vnto me, that ſéeing we could get no victuals of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, it was expedient for the ſauing of their liues, to ſeaſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſon of one of the kinges of the countrie: aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that being taken, the ſubiects woulde not ſuffer our men to want victuals. I made them aunſwere that this enterpriſe was not raſhly to be attempted. But that wee ought to haue good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde vnto the conſequence that might inſue thereof. Hereupon they replyed vnto me, that ſéeing the time was paſt of our ſuccour from France, and that we were reſolued to abandon the countrie, that there was no danger to conſtraine the ſauages to furniſh vs with victuals: which for the preſent I would not graunt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but promiſed them aſſuredly that I would ſend to aduertiſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that they ſhoulde bring me victuals for exchaunge of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe and apparel: which they alſo did for the ſpace of certain daies, during which they brought of their maſt and of their fiſh,<note place="margin">The vile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> which theſe Indians being trayterous, &amp; miſchieuous of nature, &amp; knowing our excéeding ſtrange famin, ſold vs at ſo déere a price that for leſſe then nothing they had gotten fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all the reſt of our marchandiſe which remained. And which was worſe, fearing to be forced by vs &amp; ſéeing that they had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al from vs, they came no nearer to our fort then the ſhot of an Harquebuſe. Thither they brought their fiſh in their little boats, to which our poore ſoldiers were conſtrained to go, &amp; oftentimes (as I haue ſéen) to giue away the very ſhirtes from their backes to get one fiſh. If at any time they ſhewed vnto the ſauages the exceſſiue price which they tooke,<note place="margin">A cruell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere of the ſauages.</note> theſe villains would anſwer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rughly &amp; churliſhly: if thou make ſo great account of thy marchandiſe, eat it, &amp; we wil eat our fiſh:
<pb facs="tcp:9915:49"/>
then fell they out a laughing and mocked vs with open throate. Whereupon our ſouldyers vtterly impatient, were oftentimes ready to cutte them in pieces, and to make them pay the price of their fooliſh arrogancie. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding conſidering the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hereof, I tooke paines to appeaſe the impatient ſouldier: for I would not by any meanes enter into queſtion with the ſaua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and it ſufficed mee to delay the time. Wherefore I deuiſed to ſende vnto <hi>Vtina</hi> to praye him to deale ſo farre forth with his ſubiects, as to ſuccour me with maſt and maiz: which he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparingly, ſending me twelue or fifteéne baſkets of maſt, and<note place="margin">Pinocke a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of fruite as big as cheries.</note> two of pinockes, which are a kinde of little greéne fruites which growe among the weédes in the riuer, and are as big as cheries: yea &amp; this was not but by giuing of them in exchaunge twiſe as much marchandiſe and apparell as they were worth. For the ſubiectes of <hi>Vtina</hi> perceiued euidently the neceſſitie wherein wee were, and began to vſe the like ſpeach vnto vs as the others did: as it is commonly ſeéne that neede altereth mens affections. While theſe thinges were in dooing a certaine breathing ſpace preſented it ſelfe: for <hi>Vtina</hi> gaue me to vnderſtand that there was a king his ſubiect whoſe name was <hi>Aſtina,</hi> which he determined<note place="margin">Aſtina a king.</note> to take priſoner, and to chaſtiſe him for his diſobedience: that for this cauſe, if I would giue him aid with a certaine number of my ſouldiers, he woulde bring them to the village of <hi>Aſtina,</hi> where there was meanes to recouer maſt and maiz. In the meane ſeaſon he excuſed himſelf vnto me becauſe he had ſent me no more maiz, and ſent me word that the little ſtore that he had left, was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient for his ſeede-corne. Nowe being ſomewhat relieued, as I thought, by the hope which I had of this offer, I would not fayle to ſend him the men which he deſired of me, which neuer the leſſe were very euill intreated: for he deceiued them, and in ſteéde of leading them againſt <hi>Aſtina,</hi> he cauſed them to march againſt his other enimies. My Lieuetenant which had the charge of this enterpriſe with Captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> and my Sergeaunt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be reuenged of <hi>Vtina</hi> and to cutte him in pieces and his people: and had it not beene that they feared to doe any thing againſt my will, without all doubt they would haue put their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe in execution. Therefore they would not paſſe any farther without aduertiſing me thereof. Wherefore being come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9915:49"/>
vnto the fort, angry and pricked deépely to the quicke for being ſo mocked, they made their complaints vnto me, declaring vnto me that they were almoſt dead for hunger. They tolde the whole matter to the reſt of the ſouldyers, which were very glad that they had entred into that action, and reſolued, aſſembling themſelues agayne together, to let mee vnderſtand that they did perſiſt in their firſt deliberation, which was, to puniſh the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and maliciouſues of the ſauages, which they could no longer endure, and were determined to take one of their kings priſoner: which thing I was enforced to graunt vnto them, to the ende to auoid a greater miſchiefe, &amp; the ſedition which I foreſaw would enſue, if I had made refuſall thereof. For, ſayd they, what occaſion haue you to deny vs, conſidering the neceſſitie wherein we are, &amp; the ſmall account that they make of vs. Shall it not be lawful for vs to puniſh them for the wrongs which they do vnto vs, beſides that we know apparantly how little they reſpect vs? Is not this ſufficient although there were no neceſſitie at all, ſince they thus delude vs, and haue broken promiſe with vs? After I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolued with them to ſeaſe on the perſon of <hi>Vtina,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he had giuen vs occaſion hereof, was alſo moſt able to helpe vs to recouer victuals, I departed with fiftye of my beſt ſouldyers all embarked in two Barkes and wee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arriued in the dominions of <hi>Vtina,</hi> diſtant from our fort about fortye or fiftye leagues: then going on ſhoare wee drewe towardes his village<note place="margin">Vtina taken priſoner in his village by Laudoniere and 50. of his ſouldyers.</note> ſcituated ſixe great leagues from the riuer, where wee tooke him priſoner, how be it not without great cryes and alarmes, and led him away in our barkes, hauing firſt ſignyfied vnto hys Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lawe and his chiefe ſubiectes, that in that I had taken hym, it was not for any deſire that I had to doe him any harme, but onely to relieue my neceſiitie and want of victuals which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed me, and that in caſe they woulde helpe me to ſome, I woulde finde meanes to ſet him agayne at libertie: that in the meane ſpace I woulde retire my ſelfe into my Barkes (for I feared leaſt they woulde there aſſemble themſelues together, and that ſome miſchief might thereof inſue) where I would ſtay for him two dayes, to receaue his aunſwere: notwithſtanding that my meaning was not to haue any thing without exchaunge of marchaundiſe. Thys they promiſed they woulde doe. And
<pb facs="tcp:9915:50"/>
in verye deéde the verye ſame euening, hys wyfe accompanyed withall the women of the village came vnto the Ryuers brincke, and cryed vnto meé to enter into the barke, to ſeé her huſband and her ſonne, which I helde both priſoners. I diſcouered the<note place="margin">Fiue or ſixe hundred Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> next daye fiue or ſixe hundred Indyans Archers, which drewe neére vnto the Ryuers ſide, and came to meé to ſignyfie vnto meé howe that duryng the abſence of their kyng, their enemye <hi>Potanou</hi> beéyng thereof aduertiſed, was entred into their vyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,<note place="margin">The deepe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the Indians.</note> and had ſet al on fire. They prayed meé that I woulde ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them: neuertheleſſe in the meane while they had one parte of their troupe in ambuſh, wyth intent to ſette vpon meé if I had come on lande, which was eaſie for meé to diſcerne. For ſeéyng that I refuſed ſo to doe, they greatly doubted that they were diſcouered, and ſought by all meanes, to remooue out of my mynde that euill opinion whych I had conceaued of them. They brought meé therefore fiſh in their little boates and of their meale of Maſt, they made alſo of their drinke which they call caſſine, which they ſent to <hi>Vtina</hi> and meé. Nowe albeit I had gotten thys poynt of them, that I helde their king pryſoner, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I could not gette any greate quantitye of victuals for the preſent: the reaſon was, becauſe they thought, that after I had drawne victuals from them, I woulde put their Kynge to death. For they meaſured my will accordyng to their cuſtome,<note place="margin">The Indians kil al the men priſoners that they take in warre.</note> whereby they put to death all the men pryſoners that they take in Warre. And thus beéing out of all hope of hys libertye, they aſſembled themſelues in the great houſe, and hauing called all the people together they propoſed the election of a newe Kyng, at which time the Father in lawe of <hi>Vtina</hi> ſet one of the Kynges<note place="margin">The election of a new king.</note> young Sonnes vpon the royal throne: and tooke ſuch paynes that euerye man dyd hym homage by the Maior parte of the voyces. This election had lyke to haue beéne the cauſe of great troubles amonge them. For there was a kinſman of a Kyng neére adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which pretended a tytle to the Kyngdome, and in deéde heé had gotten one parte of the Subiectes: notwithſtandyng thys enterpryſe coulde not take effecte, for aſmuch as by a common conſent of the chiefe, it was conſulted and concluded, that the Sonne was more meéte to ſucceéde the Father then anye other. Nowe all thys whyle I kepte <hi>Vtina</hi> with meé, to whome I had
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9915:50"/>
giuen ſome of myne apparell to cloath hym, as I had lykewiſe done vnto hys Sonne. But his Subiectes which before had an opinion that I woulde haue killed hym, beeing aduertyſed of the good entertaynement which I vſed towardes him, ſent two men which walked alonge the Ryuer, and came to viſite hym, and brought vs ſome victuals. Theſe two men at their comming were receaued by me with all curteſie, and entertained according to the victuals which I had. Whyle theſe thinges thus paſſed there arriued from all quarters many ſauages of the countries<note place="margin">The hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage kings of Florida.</note> adioyning, which came to ſeé <hi>Vtina,</hi> and ſought by all meanes to perſwade me to put him to death, offering that if I would doe ſo, they woulde take order that I ſhoulde want no victuals. There was alſo a king my neighbour whoſe name was <hi>Saturioüa,</hi> a ſubtile and craftie man, and one that ſhewed by proofe that heé<note place="margin">Note.</note> was greatly practiſed in affaires. This king ſent ordinarily meſſengers vnto mee, to pray me to deliuer <hi>Vtina</hi> vnto him: and to win me the more eaſily, hee ſent twiſe ſeuen or eight baſkets of Maze or of maſt, thinking by this way to allure me, and to make me come to compoſition with him: In the ende notwithſtanding when he ſawe he loſt his time he ceaſed to viſite me with ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and victuals: and in the meane whyle I was not able with the ſmall ſtore of victuals which I had ſo well to proportion out the trauaile vppon the ſhippes which wee built to returne into France, but that in the ende wee were conſtrayned to endure extreame famine, which continued amonge vs all the moneth of Maye: for in this latter ſeaſon, neither Maiz nor Beanes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> nor Maſt was to beé founde in the villages, becauſe they had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all for to ſowe their fieldes, inſomuch that weé were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to eate rootes, which the moſt part of our men punned in<note place="margin">Roots.</note> the morters which I had brought with meé to beate gunnepow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in, and the grayne which came to vs from other places: ſome tooke the wood of <hi>Eſquine,</hi> beate it, and made meale there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Eſquine.</note> which they boyled with water, and eate it: others went with their harquebuſies to ſeéke to kill ſome Foule. Yea this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie was ſo great, that one was founde that gathered vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the filth of my houſe, all the Fiſh bones that heé coulde find, which heé dryed and beate into powder to make bread there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The effectes of this hidious famine appeared incontinently
<pb facs="tcp:9915:51"/>
among vs, for our bones eftſoones began to cleane ſo néere vnto the ſkinne, that the moſt part of the ſouldyers had their ſkinnes pearced thorough with them in manye partes of their bodyes: in ſuch ſorte that my greateſt feare was, leaſt the Indyans woulde ryſe vp agaynſt vs, conſidering that it would haue béene verye harde for vs to haue defended our ſelues in ſuch extreame decaye of all our forces, beſides the ſcarſitye of all victuals, which fayled vs all at once. For the verye Ryuer had not ſuch plenty of fiſh as it was wont, and it ſéemed that the lande and water dyd fight agaynſt vs. Now as we were thus vpon termes of diſpayre, about the ende of the moneth of Maye, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Nevv corne by the ende of May in Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> of Iune, I was aduertiſed by certayne Indyans that were my neighbours, that in the high countrie vp aboue the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, there was newe maiz, and that that countrye was moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of all. This cauſed me to take vpon me to goe thither with a certayne number of my men, and I went vp the ryuer to a place called <hi>Enecaque:</hi> where I met the ſiſter of <hi>Vtina</hi> in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage<note place="margin">The village of Enecaque.</note> where ſhee made vs verye good cheare and ſent vs fiſh. We found that which was tolde vs to bee true: for the maiz was now rype: but by this good lucke one ſhrewde turne happened vnto me. For the moſt part of my ſouldyers fell ſicke wyth eating more of it then their weakened ſtomackes coulde digeſt. We had alſo béene the ſpace of foure dayes, ſince wee departed from our fort, without eating anye thyng ſauyng little pinockes, and a<note place="margin">A little green fruite that grovveth in the ryuers as bigge as che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Iſle of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delano.</note> little fiſh, which wée gate of the Fyſhers, whych wée mette ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes along the ryner. And yet thys was ſo lyttle that certayne ſouldyers eate priuylye lyttle whelpes which were newly whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. The next day I purpdſed to goe into the Iſle of <hi>Edelano</hi> to take the kyng which had cauſed one of my men to bée ſlayne, as I haue mentioned before: but béeyng aduertyſed of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng out of my Fort, and of the waye which I tooke vp the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, hée feared that I went foorth wyth a purpoſe to bée reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the euil turne which hée had played: ſo that when I came thither, I founde the houſes emptye: for hée was retyred a lyttle before wythall hys people: and I could not by any meanes keep my ſoldiers, being angrie becauſe they had loſt one of their companions, from ſetting the village on fire. At my departure from thence I paſſed backe againe by <hi>Enecaque,</hi> where I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:9915:51"/>
as much maiz as I could poſſibly: which with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I conueyed to our fort, to ſuccour my poore men, which I had left in great neceſſitie. They therefore ſeeing me a farre off comming ranne to that ſide of the riuer where they thought I would come on lande: for hunger ſo pinched them to the hearte, that they could not ſtaye vntill the victuals were brought them to the fort. And that they well ſhewed, aſſoone as I was come, and that I had diſtributed that little maiz among them, which I had giuen to ech man, before I came out of the barke: for they eate it before they had taken it out of the huſke. But ſeeing my ſelfe in this extreeme néede, I tooke paynes daye by daye to ſeeke ſome villages, where there was ſome foode. And as I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed<note place="margin">Two Carpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters killed for gathering the Indians maiz.</note> this way and that way, it happened that two of my Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters were killed by the two ſonnes of king <hi>Emola,</hi> and by one whoſe name was <hi>Caſti,</hi> as they went on walking to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Athore.</hi> The cauſe of this murder was, becauſe they<note place="margin">The village Athore.</note> could not refraine themſelues as they walked through the fields from gathering a little maiz, which as they were doing they were taken in the manner: whereof I was preſently aduertiſed by an Indian which a little before had brought me a preſent from<note place="margin">Nia-Cubaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a queene.</note> 
               <hi>Nia-Cubacani</hi> Queene of a village, and neighbour to our forte. Uppon receipt of this aduertiſment, I ſent my ſergeant with a number of ſoldiers, which founde nothing elſe but the two dead corpſes, which they buried, &amp; returned without doing any other exploite, becauſe the inhabitantes were fled away fearing they ſhoulde be puniſhed for ſuch a foule facte. As theſe thinges thus paſſed, &amp; that by this time we had almoſt driuen out the moneth of May, two ſubiectes of king <hi>Vtina</hi> came vnto mee with an Hermaphrodite, which ſhewed me that by this time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiz was ripe in the greateſt part of their quarters. Whereupon <hi>Vtina</hi> ſignified vnto mee that in caſe I woulde carrie him home to his houſe, he woulde take ſuch good order that I ſhoulde haue plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of maiz and beanes: and withall, that the fielde which he had cauſed to be ſowed for mee, ſhoulde be reſerued to my vſe. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with my men concerning this matter, and founde by the aduice of all my companie, that it was beſt to graunt him his requeſt, ſaying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had means to ſuccour vs with food ſufficient to ſerue our turnes for our embarkement, and that therefore I
<pb facs="tcp:9915:52"/>
might do well to carrie him home. Wherefore I cauſed the two barkes forthwith to be made readie, wherein I ſayled to <hi>Patica,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Patica a village.</note> a place diſtant from his village eight or nine leagues, where I founde no body: for they were gotten into the woods, and would not ſhewe themſelues, albeit <hi>Vtina</hi> ſhewed himſelfe vnto them, for aſmuch as they imagined that I ſhoulde be conſtrayned to let him goe. But ſéeing no body to ſhewe themſelues I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to hazarde one of my men, which had béene acquainted with the ſtate of the countrey, to whome I deliuered the young ſonne of <hi>Vtina,</hi> and commaunded him to goe with diligence to the village of <hi>Vtina,</hi> vnto his father in lawe and his wife, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them that if they woulde haue their king agayne, they ſhoulde bring me victuals vnto the ſide of the little riuer whither I was gone. At my mans comming euerie one made much of the litle child, neither was there a man that thought not himſelfe well appaide to touch him. His father in law &amp; his wife hearing of theſe newes came preſently towards our barkes, and brought bread which they gaue vnto my ſoldiers, they held me there thrée dayes, &amp; in the meane while did all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they could to take me: which preſently I diſcouered, &amp; therfore ſtood diligently vpon my gard. Wherefore perceyuing they could not haue their purpoſe, &amp; that they were already diſcouered, they ſent to aduertiſe mee y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as yet they could not helpe me to victuals, &amp; that the corne was not yet ripe. Thus I was conſtrained to returne &amp; to carry backe <hi>Vtina</hi> home, where I had much a do to ſaue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rage of my ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: which perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maliciouſnes of the Indians, went about to haue murdred him. Moreouer it ſéemed they were content that they had gotten y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſon, &amp; that they cared notgreatly for the father. Now my hope fayling me on this ſide, I deuiſed to ſend my men to the villages, where I thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maiz was by this time ripe: I went to diuers places, &amp; continued ſo doing fiftéene dayes after, when as <hi>Vtina</hi> beſought me againe to ſend him vnto his village, aſſuring himſelfe that his ſubiectes would not ſticke to giue mee victuals: &amp; that in caſe they refuſed ſo to do, he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent that I ſhuld do what I thought good with him. I vndertoke this voiage the ſecond time with the two barkes furniſhed as before. At my comming vnto the litle riuer, we found his ſubiects there, which failed not to come thither, with ſome quantitie of bread, beanes,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9915:52"/>
and fiſh, to giue my ſoldiers. Neuertheles returning agayne to<note place="margin">Deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge rooted in the ſauages</note> their former practiſe they ſought almeanes to entrap me, hoping to cry quittance for the impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their king, if they might haue gotten the victory of me. But after that they ſaw the ſmall meanes, which they had to annoy me, they returned to intreaties &amp; offered that if I woulde giue them their king with certaine of my ſoldiers, they would conduct them vnto the village, &amp; that the ſubiects ſéeing him, would be more willing to giue vs victuals. Which thing notwithſtanding I would not grant vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting their ſubtiltie, which was not ſo couerte, but that one might eſpie day at a little hole) vntil they had firſt giuen me two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pledge with charge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by the next day they ſhould bring me victuals. Which thing they granted, &amp; gaue me two men, which I put in chaines, for feare they ſhould eſcape away, as I knewe well they were inſtructed to do. Foure dayes were ſpent in theſe conferences, at the end whereof they declared vnto me, that they could not fully and wholy performe their promiſe: &amp; that the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt that they could do for the preſent was to cauſe ech ſubiect to bring his burthen of myl. To conclude they were content to do ſo on condition that I would ſend them their two pledges with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten daies. As my lieuetenant was ready to depart, I warned<note place="margin">A neceſſarie admonition.</note> him aboue all things, to take heede hee fell not into the Indians hands: becauſe I knew them to be very ſubtill and craftie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe &amp; execute any thing to our diſaduantage. He departed therefore with his troupe, &amp; came to the ſmal riuer whereinto we were accuſtomed to enter to approch as néere as we coulde vnto the village of <hi>Vtina,</hi> being ſixe french leagues diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. There he went on ſhore, put his men in good array, and drewe ſtreight towards the great houſe that was the kinges, where the chiefe men of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> countrie were aſſembled, which cauſed very great ſtore of victuals to be brought now one &amp; then another, in doing wherof they ſpent notwithſtanding thrée or foure dayes: in which meane while they gathered men together to ſet vpon vs in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treite. They vſed therfore many means to hold vs ſtill in breath.<note place="margin">The Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſubtilties.</note> For one while they demanded their pledges, another while (ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my liuetenant would not yeld to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill ſuch time as they had brought the victuals vnto the boats, according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:9915:53"/>
paſſed betweene vs) they ſignified vnto him that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and yong children were affraide out of all meaſure to ſee fire in their matches ſo neere their harquebuſes: and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they moſt earneſtly beſought them to put them out, that they might more eaſily get people ynough to carrie the victuals, and that they for theyr partes woulde leaue their bowes, and arrowes, and woulde be contented that their ſeruantes ſhoulde carrie them. This ſeconde requeſt was as flatly denied them as the former: For it was an eaſie matter to ſmell out their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. But while theſe thinges were thus in handling, <hi>Vtina</hi> by no meanes was to be ſeene, but hid and kept himſelfe ſecrete in a little houſe a part, where certayne choſen men of mine went to ſee him, ſhewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues agreeued with him, for the long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes of his ſubiectes: whereunto hee anſwered, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects were ſo much incenſed againſt vs, that by no meanes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he was able to keepe them in ſuch obedience, as he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woulde haue done, and that hee coulde not holde them from waging of warre againſt Monſieur <hi>De Ottigny.</hi> That he alſo called to mind, that euen while he was priſoner, at what time our men ledde him into his countrie to obtaine ſome victuals, hee ſaw along the high waies arrows ſtucke vp, at the ends whereof<note place="margin">A certaine ſigne of vvarre</note> long haires were faſtened, which was a certayne ſigne of open warre proclaimed, which arrowes the captaine alſo carried with him to the fort. He ſaide further that in reſpect of the good will he bare the Captaine, he forewarned his Lieuetenant that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes were determined to cut downe the trees, and cauſe them to fall a thwhart the little riuer, where the boates were, to keepe them from departing thence, that they might fight with them at their eaſe, and that if it thus fell out, hée aſſured him for his part he woulde not be there to meddle in the matter. And that which much more augmented the ſuſpicion of warre was, that as my meſſengers departed from <hi>Vtina,</hi> they hearde the voyce of one of my men, which during the voyage had alwayes beene among the Indians, and whome as yet they woulde neuer render, vntil they had gotten their pledges home. This poore fellowe cryed out a mayne, becauſe two Indians would haue carried him into the woods to haue cut his throate: whereupon hee was ſuccoured
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9915:53"/>
and deliuered. Theſe admonitions being well vnderſtoode, and after ripe deliberation thereof Mounſieur, <hi>de Ottigny</hi> reſolued to retire himſelfe the ſeauen and twentieth of Iuly. Wherefore he ſet his ſoldiers in order, and deliuered to ech of them a ſacke full of myl: and afterward he marched toward his barkes, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to preuent the enterpriſe of the ſauages. There is at the<note place="margin">An alley of three or foure hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes long.</note> comming foorth of the village a great alley about threé or foure hundred paſes long, which is couered on both ſides with great trees. My lieutenant diſpoſed his men in this alley and ſet them in ſuch order as they deſired to march: for hee was well aſſured that if there were any ambuſh, it woulde be at the comming out of the treés. Therefore he cauſed Mounſieur <hi>De Arlac</hi> myne enſigne to march ſomwhat before w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eight harquebuſiers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer whether there were any danger: beſides he commanded one of my ſergeants and corporalles to march on the out ſide of the alley with foure harquebuſiers while hee himſelfe conducted the reſt of his companie through it. Nowe as he ſuſpected, ſo it fell out: for Mounſieur <hi>de Arlac</hi> mette with two or thrée hundred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians at the ende of the alley, which ſaluted him with an infinite<note place="margin">A ſkirmiſh tvveene the Sauages &amp; the French.</note> number of their arrowes, and with ſuch furie that it was eaſie to ſée with what deſire they ſought to charge vs. Howbeit they were ſo wel ſuſtayned in the firſt aſſault which mine enſigne gaue them, that they which fell downe deade, did ſomewhat abate the choler of thoſe which remayned aliue. This done my lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant haſted to gaine grounde in ſuch ſort as I haue already ſaid.<note place="margin">A ſecond freſh charge of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages.</note> After he had marched about foure hundred paſes, hee was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged afreſh with a newe troupe of ſauages which were in number about threé hundred, which aſſayled him before, while the reſt of the former ſet vppon him behinde. This ſeconde aſſault was ſo valiantly ſuſtained, that I may iuſtly ſay that Monſieur <hi>De Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigny</hi> ſo well diſcharged his duetie, as was poſſible for a good Captaine to doe. And ſo it ſtoode them vpon: for he had to deale with ſuch kinde of men, as knew well how to fight &amp; to obey their heade which conducted them, and which knewe ſo well to behaue themſelues in this conflict, as if <hi>Ottigny</hi> had not preuented their practiſe, he had beéne in danger to haue beéne defeated.<note place="margin">The Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans maner of fight.</note> Their manner in their fight was, that when two hundred had ſhotte, they retyred themſelues and gaue place to the reſt that
<pb facs="tcp:9915:54"/>
were behinde, and all the while had their eye and foote ſo quicke and readie, that aſſoone as euer they ſawe the harquebuſie layde to the cheeke, ſo ſoone were they on the ground, and eftſone vp to anſwere with their bowes, and to flie their way, if by chance they perceyued we went about to take them: for there is nothing that they feare ſo much, becauſe of our ſwordes and daggers. This<note place="margin">The Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans chiefe feare.</note> conflict continued and laſted from nine of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, vntill the night departed them. And if <hi>Ottigny</hi> had not bethought himſelfe to cauſe his men to breake the arrows which they founde in the waye, and ſo to depriue the ſauages of the meanes to beginne agayne, without all doubt he ſhould haue had very much to do: for by this meane they lacked arrowes, and ſo were conſtrayned to retyre themſelues. During the time of the conflict they cryed and made ſignes that they were the captaines and lieutenants friendes: and that they fought for none other cauſe but to be reuenged on the ſoldiers, which were their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enimies. My lieutenant being come vnto his boates tooke a reuewe of his company, and found two men wanting which were<note place="margin">Tvvo ſlaine.</note> killed, of whome the one was called Iames Sale, and the others name was Meſureur. He founde moreouer two and twentie of<note place="margin">Tvvo &amp; tvven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vvounded.</note> them wounded, which with much adoe he cauſed to bee brought vnto the boates. All the mill that he found among his company came but to two mens burthens, which hee deuided equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. For aſſoone as the conflict beganne, euery man was conſtrained to leaue his ſacke to put his hande vnto his weapon. In this meane while I remayned at the forte, and cauſed euery man diligently to trauell, hoping that my Lieutenant woulde bring vs victuals. But ſeéing the time conſume away, I began to ſuſpect the crueth of that which fell out, whereof I was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured immediately after at their returne. Seéing therefore mine<note place="margin">Praier and thankes vnto God for their deliuerance.</note> hope fruſtrate on that ſide, I made my prayer vnto GOD, and thanked him of his grace which he had ſhewed vnto my poore ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which were eſcaped: Afterward I thought vppon newe meanes to obtayne victuals, aſwell for our returne into France, as to driue out the time vntill our embarking. I was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by certayne of our companie, which vſually went on hunting into the woodes and through the villages, that in the village<note place="margin">The village Sarauhi.</note> 
               <hi>Sarauahi</hi> ſituated on the other ſide of the riuer and two leagues
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9915:54"/>
diſtant from the fort, and in the village <hi>Emoloa</hi> there were<note place="margin">The village Emoloa.</note> fieldes wherein the mil was very forwarde, and that there was thereof in thoſe partes in great aboundance. Wherefore I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my boates to be made readie, and ſent my Sergeant thither with certayne ſoldiers, which vſed ſuch diligence, that wee had good ſtore of myl. I ſent alſo to the riuer which the Sauages cal<note place="margin">The riuer of Iaracana cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Ribault the riuer of Somme.</note> 
               <hi>Iracana</hi> named by captaine <hi>Ribault</hi> the riuer of Somme, where Captayne <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> and my ſergeant arriued with two boates and their ordinarie furniture, and founde there a great aſſemblie of the Lordes of the countrey, among whom was <hi>Athore</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Satourioua, Appolou,</hi> and <hi>Tacadocorou,</hi> which were there aſſembled to make merrie: becauſe that in this place are the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt maides &amp; women of al the countrey. Captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> in my<note place="margin">Curteſie and liberalitie the beſt meanes to deale vvith the ſauages.</note> name gaue certaine ſmal trifles to all the Lords, to the Quéene, to the maydes and women of the villages. Whereupon the boates were foorth with laden with myl, after they had made our men as good cheére as they could deuiſe. The Queéne ſent mee two ſmall Mats ſo artificially wrought as it was vnpoſſible to<note place="margin">Moſt artificial mattes.</note> make better. Now finding our ſelues by this meane ſufficiently furniſhed with victuals, we began ech of vs in his place, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile &amp; vſe ſuch diligence, as the deſire to ſeé our natiue countrie might moue vs. But becauſe two of our Carpenters were ſlaine by the Indians (as heretofore I mentioned) <hi>Iohn de Hais,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter carpenter, a man very worthie of his vocation, repaired vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and tolde me that by reaſon of want of men hee was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make me vp the ſhip againſt the time that hee had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee: which ſpeach cauſed ſuch a mutinie among the ſoldiers that verie hardly he eſcaped killing: howbeit I appeaſed them aſwell as I could, and determined to worke no more from thence foorth vpon the ſhippe, but to content our ſelues to repaire the Brigantine which I had. So we beganne to beate downe all<note place="margin">The beating dovvne of the houſes vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fort, &amp; the paliſade.</note> the houſes that were without the forte, and cauſed coales to be made of the tymber thereof: likewiſe the ſoldiers beate downe the palliſade which was towarde the waters ſide, neither was I euer able to keepe them from doing it. I had alſo determined to beate downe the fort before my departure and to ſet it on fire, for feare leaſt ſome newe-come gueſte ſhoulde haue enioyed and poſſeſſed it. In the meane while there was none of vs to

whome it was not an extreéme griefe to leaue a countrey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we had endured ſo great trauailes and neceſſities, to diſcouer that which we muſt forſake through our owne countriemens default.

As ech of vs were much tormented in minde with theſe or ſuch like cogitations, the<note place="margin">Aug. 3. 1565.</note> thirde of Auguſt I diſcryed foure ſayles in the ſea, as I walked vppon a little hill, whereof I was exceeding well appaide: I ſent immediately one of them which were with mee to aduertiſe thoſe of the fort thereof, which were ſo glad of thoſe newes, that one would haue thought them to bee out of their wittes to ſee them laugh and leape for ioy. After theſe ſhippes had caſt ancre, we diſcried that they ſent one of their ſhip boates to lande: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I cauſed one of mine to be armed with diligence, to ſend to meete them, and to know who they were. In the meane while fearing leaſt they were Spaniards, I ſet my ſoldiers in order &amp; in readines, attending the returne of Captaine <hi>Vaſſeur</hi> and my lieutenant, which were gone to meete them, which brought mee word that they were Engliſhmen: &amp; in truth they had in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

one whoſe name was <hi>Martine Atinas</hi> of Diepe, which at that time was in their ſeruice, which on the behalfe of Maiſter<note place="margin">Maſter Iohn Havvkins the Engliſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> their generall came to requeſt meé that I woulde ſuffer them to take freſh water, whereof they ſtood in great neéde, ſignifiyng vnto me that they had beene aboue fifteéne daies on the coaſt to get ſome. He brought vnto me from the generall two fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of wine, and bread made of wheate: whichich greatly refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed me, foraſmuch as for ſeuen moneths ſpace I neuer taſted a droppe of wine: neuertheleſſe it was all diuided among the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of my ſouldyers. This <hi>Martine Atinas</hi> had guided the Engliſhmen vnto our coaſt, wherewith he was acquainted: for in the yeare 1562. he came thither with mee, and therefore the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſent him to mee. Therefore after I had graunted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he ſignified the ſame vnto the generall, which the next day following cauſed one of his ſmall ſhippes to enter into the ryuer, and came to ſeé me in a great ſhipboate, accompanied with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen honourably apparelled, yet vnarmed. Hee ſent for great ſtore of bread and wine, to diſtribute thereof to euery one: On my part I made him the beſt cheére I could poſſibly, and cauſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">Sheepe and Poultrie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida.</note> ſheépe and poultry to bee killed, which vntill this preſent I had carefully preſerued hoping to ſtore the countrie withall. For, notwithſtanding all the neceſſities and ſicknes that happened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I would not ſuffer ſo much as one chicking to be killed: by which meanes in a ſhort time I had gathered together aboue an hundred Pullets. Now threé dayes paſſed, while the Engliſh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remayned with me, during which tyme the Indyans came in from all parts to ſee hym, and aſked me whether hee were my<note place="margin">An aduantage vviſely taken.</note> brother: I told them he was ſo, and ſignified vnto them, that heé was come to ſeé me and ayde me with ſo great ſtore of victuals, that from thence forward I ſhould haue no neéde to take any thing of them. The bruite hereof incontinently was ſpread ouer all the countrie, in ſuch ſort as Ambaſſadours came vnto me from all parts, which on the behalfe of the kings their maſters deſired to make alliance with mee: and euen they, which before ſought to make warre againſt me, came to offer their friendſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto mee: Whereupon I receaued them and gratified them with certayne preſentes. The generall immediately vnderſtoode the deſire &amp; vrgent occaſion which I had to returne into France:
<pb facs="tcp:9915:56"/>
Whereupon he offred to tranſport me and al my company home: whereunto notwithſtanding I woulde not agreé, being in doubt vpon what occaſion hee made ſo large an offer. For I knewe not howe the caſe ſtoode betweéne the French and the Engliſh: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he promiſed me on his faith to put me on land in France, before he would touch in England, yet I ſtoode in doubt leaſt he<note place="margin">The French miſtruſted that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen vvould plant in Florida.</note> would attempt ſomewhat in <hi>Florida</hi> in the name of his miſtreſſe. Wherefore I flatly refuſed his offer: whereupon there roſe a great mutiny among my Souldiers, which ſayd that I ſought to deſtroy them all, and that the Brigantine, whereof I ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was not ſufficient to tranſport them, conſidering the ſeaſon of the yeare wherein we were. The bruite and mutinye increaſed more and more: for after that the Generall was returned to his ſhips, he told certaine gentlemen and ſouldiers which went to ſee him, partly to make good cheére with him, he declared, I ſay, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that he greatly doubted that hardly we ſhould bee able to paſſe ſafely in thoſe veſſels which we had: &amp; that in caſe we ſhould enterpriſe the ſame, we ſhoulde no doubt bee in great ieopardye: notwithſtanding if I were ſo contented, hee would tranſport part of my men in his ſhippes, and that hee woulde leaue me a ſmall ſhippe to tranſport the reſt. The Souldyers were no ſooner come home, but they ſignified the offer vnto their companyons, which incontinently conſented together that in caſe I woulde not accept the ſame they woulde embarke themſelues with hym and forſake me, ſo that he would receaue them accordyng to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. They therefore aſſembled themſelues altogether and came to ſeeke me in my Chamber, and ſignified vnto me their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereunto I promiſed to aunſwere within one houre after. In which meane ſpace I gathered together the principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of my company, which after I had broken the matter with them, anſwered me all with one voice, that I ought not to refuſe this offer, nor contemne the occaſion which preſented it ſelfe, and that they could not thinke euill of it in France, if being forſaken, as we were, we ayded our ſelues with ſuch meanes as God had ſent vs. After ſundry debatinges of this matter, in concluſion I gaue mine aduiſe, that wee ought to deliuer him the price of the ſhippe which hee was to leaue vs, &amp; that for my part I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">Syluer found in Florida.</note> to giue him the beſt of my ſtuffe, and the ſiluer which I had
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9915:56"/>
gathered in the Country. Whereupon notwithſtanding it was determined that I ſhoulde keépe the ſiluer, for feare, leaſt the Queéne of England ſeeing the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhoulde the rather be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged<note place="margin">Note.</note> to ſet footing there, as before ſheé had deſired: that it was farre better to carry it into France, to giue encouragement vnto<note place="margin">The great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</note> our Princes not to leaue of an enterpriſe of ſo great importance for our common wealth, and that, ſeéing we were reſolued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, it was farre better to giue him our Artillerye, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould bee conſtrained to leaue behind vs, or to hide it in the ground, by reaſon of the weakenes of our men, being not able to embarke the ſame. This point being thus concluded and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on, I went my ſelfe vnto the Engliſh Generall, accompanied with my Lieutenant, and Captaine <hi>Vaſſeur,</hi> Captaine <hi>Verdier,</hi> and <hi>Trenchant</hi> the Pilot, and my Sergeant, all men of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſuch affaires and knowing ſufficiently how to driue ſuch a bargaine. We therefore tooke a viewe of the ſhippe which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall would ſell, whom we drewe to ſuch reaſon, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtand vnto mine owne mens iudgement, who eſteémed it to be worth ſeuen hundred crowns, wherof we agreéd very friendly. Wherfore I deliuered him in earneſt of the ſumme, two baſtards, two mynions, one thouſand of iron, and one thouſand of powder. This bargaine thus made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he conſidered the neceſſity wherein we were, hauing for all our ſuſtenance but myl &amp; water: whereupon<note place="margin">The great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie and bountie of Maſter Iohn Havvkins to the French.</note> being moued withpitie, he offred to relieue me with twenty bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of meale, ſix pipes of beanes, one hogſhead of ſalt, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of waxe to make candels. Moreouer foraſmuch as he ſawe my Souldyers goe barefoote, hee offered me beſides fifty payres of ſhoes, which I accepted and agreéd of a price with hym, and gaue hym a byll of mine hand for the ſame, for which vntill this preſent I am indebted to hym. He did more then this: for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he beſtowed vppon my ſelfe a great iare of oyle, a iare of Uynagre, a barill of Olyues, and a great quantitye of Ryce, and a barill of white Biſcuit. Beſides hee gaue diuerſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the principall Officers of my companye accordyng to their qualities: ſo that I may ſaye that wee receaued as manye courteſies of the Generall, as it was poſſible to receiue of any man liuing. Wherein doubtleſſe hee hath wonne the reputation of a good and charitable man, deſeruing to be eſteémed aſmuch of
<pb facs="tcp:9915:57"/>
vs all as if hee had ſaued all our liues. Incontinent after his<note place="margin">The depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Engliſh Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</note> departure I ſpared no payne to haſten my men to make biſcuits of the meale which hée had left mée, and to hoope my Caſke to take in water néedefull for the voyage. A man may well thinke what diligence wée vſed, in reſpect of the great deſire wée had to depart, wherein mée continued ſo well, that the fiiftéenth day of Auguſt the biſcuit, the greateſt part of our water, and all the<note place="margin">Auguſt. 15.</note> Souldyers ſtuffe was brought aborde: ſo that from that daye forwarde wée dyd nothing but ſtay for good windes to driue vs into France: which had fréed vs from an infinite number of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which afterwarde wée ſuffered, if they had come as wée deſired: but it was not Gods good pleaſure, as ſhall appeare hereafter. Being thus in a readynes to ſette Sayle, wée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought our ſelues that it woulde doe well to bringe certayne men and women of the countrye into France, to the ende, that if thys voyage ſhoulde bee taken in hande agayne, they might declare vnto their Kynges, the greatneſſe of our Kyng, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencye of our Princes, the goodneſſe of our Countrye, and the manner of liuyng of the Frenchmen: and that they might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo learne our language to ſerue our turnes thereby in tyme to come. Wherein I tooke ſo good order, that I had found meanes to bring away with me the goodlyeſt perſons of all the Countrye, if our intentions had ſuccéeded, ad I hoped they woulde haue done. In the meane ſeaſon the Kynges my neighbours came often to ſée and viſite mée: which, after that they vnderſtoode that I woulde returne into France, demaunded of mée whether I meant to returne agayne or no, and whether it ſhoulde bée in ſhort tyme. I ſignyfied vnto them that within tenne Moones (ſo they call their Moneths) I woulde viſite them agayne with<note place="margin">The Floridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans meaſure their moneths by the reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Moone.</note> ſuch force, that I woulde bée able to make them Conquerours ouer all their enimies.

Which I made as though I would graunt vnto them, to the end I might alwaies remaine their friend vntil my laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9915:58"/>
The report hereof being made vnto me, I placed ech of my men in his quarter, with full deliberation to defend our ſelues, if they had béene enemies, as in truth wee thought them to haue béene: lykewiſe I cauſed the two ſmall field pieces which I had left mee to be trimmed in ſuch ſort, as if in approching to the fort they had not cryed, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it was Captayne <hi>Ribault,</hi> I had not fayled to haue diſcharged the ſame vpon them. Afterward I vnderſtood that the cauſe why they entered in this manner, procéeded of the falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes<note place="margin">Falſe reportes of Laudon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere to the Admirall of France.</note> which had béene made vnto my Lorde Admirall by thoſe which were returned into France in the firſt ſhips. For they had put in hys head, that I playde the Lord and the Kyng, and that I would hardly ſuffer that any other ſaue my ſelfe ſhoulde enter in thither to gouerne there. Thus we ſée how the good name of the moſt honeſt is oftentimes aſſayled by ſuch, as hauing no meanes to wyn themſelues credyt by vertuous and laudable endeuours, thinke by debaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For it is very hard, yea vtterly vnpoſſible, that in gouerning of a company of men gathered out of diuers places and ſundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and namely ſuch as we know them to bee in our warres, it is, I ſay, vnpoſſible, but there will be alwaies ſome of euill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; harde to be ruled, which eaſily conceaue an hatred againſt hym, which by admonitions and light corrections endeuoureth to reduce them to the diſcypline of warre. For they ſéeke nothing elſe, but for a ſmall occaſion founded vpon a light pretext to found into the eares of great Lordes that which miſchieuouſly they haue contriued againſt thoſe, whoſe execution of iuſtice is odious vnto them. And albeit I will not place my ſelfe in the ranke of great and renowmed Captaines, ſuch as liued in times paſſed, yet wee may iudge by their examples, howe hurtfull backebyters haue béene vnto common-wealths.

But that I looſe not my ſelfe in digreſſing ſo far in this my iuſtification, I wil returne againe to my firſt courſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore aduertiſed that it was Captayne <hi>Ribault,</hi> I went<note place="margin">Laudonnieres receauing of Captayne Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault.</note> forth of the fort to goe to méete hym, &amp; to doe hym all the honor I coulde by any meanes, I cauſed hym to bee welcommed with the artillerie, and a gentle voley of my ſhotte, whereunto he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his. Afterward being come on ſhore and receaued hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and with ioy, I brought hym to my lodging, reioycing not a little becauſe that in this company I knew a good number of my friendes, which I intreated in the beſt ſort that I was able, with ſuch victuals as I could get in the country, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſmall ſtore which I had left mee, with that which I had of the Engliſh Generall. Howbeit I maruailed not a little when as all of them with one voice beganne to vtter vnto me theſe or the like ſpeaches.

Wherefore hauing accoſted Captain <hi>Iohn Ribault,</hi> &amp; going both of vs aſide together out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fort, he ſignified vnto me the charge which he had, praying me not to returne into France, but to ſtay with him my ſelfe &amp; my company, &amp; aſſured me that he would make it well thought of at home. Whereupon I replied that out of this place I woulde doe him all ſeruice: that for the preſent I could not nor ought not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this offer, ſince he was come for no other intent then to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie the place which I before poſſeſſed: that I could haue no credit to be there commanded: that my friendes would neuer like of it, and that hee woulde hardly giue me that counſaile, if in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt I ſhould demaund his aduiſe therein. He made me aunſwere, that he would not commaund me, that we ſhould be companions, and that he would builde another fortreſſe, &amp; that he would leaue mine owne vnto mee.

For the<note place="margin">4.</note> laſt poynte, that I had not written to any of the Lords of the Court but by the aduice and commaundement of my Lorde Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, which willed me at my departure to ſende part of ſuch thinges as I ſhoulde finde in the countrey vnto the Lords of the Counſell: to thende that being moued by this meane they might deale with the Queéne mother for the continuance of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: that hauing beéne ſo ſmall time in the countrey, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindred with building of fortreſſes, and vnlading of my ſhips, I was not able to come by any newe or rare things to ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereupon I thought it beſt to content them in the meane while with letters, vntill ſuch time as I might haue longer ſpace to ſerch out the Countrey, and might recouer ſomething to ſende them: the diſtribution of which letters I meant not otherwiſe but to referre to my Lorde Admirals good pleaſure: that if the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer had forgot himſelfe ſo farre, as that he had broken the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the letters, and preſented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe for hope of gaine, it was not my commandement. And that I neuer honoured noble<note place="margin">5.</note> man ſo much, nor did to any more willing &amp; faithfull ſeruice then to my Lord Admirall, nor euer ſought aduancement but by his meanes.

the Indians came in from all partes, to know what people theſe were, to whome I ſignified that this was hee which in the yeare a thouſande fiue hundred ſixtie and two arriued in this countrie, and erected the piller whiche ſtoode at the entrie of the riuer. Some of them knew him: for in truth he was eaſie to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by reaſon of the greate bearde whiche hee ware. He receaued many preſents of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were of the villages neére adioyning, among whom there were ſome that he had not yet forgotten.

               <note place="margin">Fiue Indian kings.</note> came to viſite him and welcome him with diuerſe giftes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their manner. I aduertiſed them that he was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the king of Fraunce, to remayne there in my roome, and that I was ſent for. Then they demaunded and prayed him, if it might ſtand with his good pleaſure, to cauſe the marchandiſe that he had brought with him to be deliuered them, and that in fewe dayes they woulde bring him to the mountaines of <hi>Apalaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi>

Sixe great Spaniſh<note place="margin">September. 4.</note> ſhips arriued in the rode, where foure of our greateſt ſhips re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, which caſt anker, aſſuring our men of good amitie. They<note place="margin">The Spaniards vndermining and ſurpriſing of the French.</note> aſked how the chiefe captaines of the enterpriſe did, &amp; called them all by their names and ſurnames. I report me to you if it could be otherwiſe but theſe men before they went out of Spaine muſt neéds be enformed of the enterpriſe and of thoſe that were to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame. About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breake of day they began to make toward our men: but our men which truſted them neuer a deale, had hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſayles by night, being ready to cut the ſtringes that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Wherefore perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this making toward our men of the Spaniards was not to do them any pleaſure, and knowing well that their furniture was to ſmal to make head againſt them, bicauſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of their men were on ſhore, they cut their Cables, left their ankers, and ſet ſaile.

And the Spaniardes ſeéing they could not rech them, by reaſon that the french ſhips were better of ſaile then theirs, and alſo becauſe they would not leaue the coaſt, turned backe and went on ſhore in the riuer <hi>Seloy,</hi> which we call<note place="margin">The riuer Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy or the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phines but eight or ten leagues ouer land from the fort: but it is thirtie dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the cape by ſea fol. 19.</note> the riuer of <hi>Dolphines</hi> eight or ten leagues diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the place where we were.

were in the rode to ſeéke the Spaniſh fleéte, whereupon he aſked our aduiſe. I firſt replyed, and ſhewed vnto him the conſequence of ſuch an enterpriſe, aduertiſing him among other thinges of<note place="margin">Dangerous flawes of wind on the coſt of Florida in ſeptember.</note> the perilous flawes of windes that riſe on this coaſt, and that if it chaunced that he were driuen from the ſhore, it woulde bee verie harde for him to recouer it agayne, that in the meane while they which ſhoulde ſtay in the fort ſhoulde be in feare and danger. The Captaines, <hi>Saint Marie,</hi> and <hi>La Grange</hi> declared vnto him farther, that they thought it not good to put any ſuch enterpriſe in execution, that it was farre better to keépe the lande, and doe their beſt endeuour to fortifie themſelues: And that after that the Trinitie (which was the principall ſhippe) were returned, there woulde be much more likelihood to enterpriſe this voyage. This notwithſtanding he reſolued to vndertake it, and that which more is, after he vnderſtoode by king <hi>Emola,</hi> one of our neighbours<note place="margin">King Emola.</note> which arriued vppon the handling of theſe matters, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in great numbers were gone on ſhore, which had taken poſſeſſion of the houſes of <hi>Seloy,</hi> in the moſt part whereof they<note place="margin">A village and a riuer both of that name.</note> had placed their Negros, which they had brought to labour, and alſo lodged themſelues and had caſt diuers trenches about them. Thus for the conſiderations which hee had, and doubtinge (as hee might well doe) that the Spaniardes woulde encampe themſelues there to moleſt vs, and in the ende to chaſe vs out of the countrie, hee reſolued and perſiſted in his embarkment, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Proclamation to be made, that all ſoldiers that were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge ſhoulde preſently with their weapons embarke them, and that his two enſignes ſhoulde march: which was put in execution. He came into my chamber, and prayed me to lende him my Lieutenant, mine enſigne, and my ſergeant, and to let all my good ſoldiers, which I had, goe with him, which I denied him, becauſe, my ſelfe being ſicke, there was no man to ſtay in the fort. Thereuppon he anſwered me that I neéded not to doubt at all, &amp; that he would returne the morrow after, that in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane ſpace Monſieur <hi>De Lys</hi> ſhould ſtay behind to looke to al things. Then I ſhewed vnto him that he was chiefe in this countrey, and that I for my part had no farther authoritie: that therefore hee would take good aduiſement what he did, for feare leaſt ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience might enſue. Then he tolde me that he coulde doe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9915:61"/>
no leſſe, then to continue this enterpriſe, and that in the letter which he had receyued from my Lorde Admirall, there was a<note place="margin">An aduertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Lord Admiral to Captaine Ribault.</note> poſtſcript, which he ſhewed me written in theſe words: <hi>Captaine Iohn Ribault, as I was encloſing vp this letter, I receaued a certayne aduice, that Don Pedro Melendes departeth from Spaine to goe to the coaſte of Newe Fraunce: ſee you that you ſuffer him not to encroch vppon you, no more then he would that you ſhould encroch vpon him.</hi> You ſeé, (quoth he) the charge that I haue, and I leaue it vnto your ſelfe to iudge if you could doe any leſſe in this caſe, conſidering the certayne aduertiſment that we haue, that they are already on lande, and will inuade vs. This ſtopped my mouth. Thus therefore confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or rather obſtinate in this enterpriſe, and hauing regard ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto his particular opinion then vnto the aduertiſmentes which I had giuen him, &amp; the inconueniences of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I had forewarned him, hee embarked himſelfe the eighth of<note place="margin">Captaine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baults embark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment Sept. 8.</note> September, and tooke mine enſigne and eight and thirtie of my men away with him. I report me to thoſe that knowe what wars meane, if when an enſigne marcheth any ſoldier that hath any courage in him will ſtay behinde, to forſake his enſigne: Thus no man of commaundement ſtayed behinde with meé, for ech one followed him as chiefe, in whoſe name, ſtraight after his arriual, all cryes and proclamations were made. Captayne <hi>Grange,</hi> which liked not very well of this enterpriſe, was vnto the tenth<note place="margin">The tenth of September.</note> of the moneth with mee, and woulde not haue gone aborde, if it had not beéne for the inſtant requeſtes that Captaine <hi>Ribault</hi> made vnto him, which ſtaid two dayes in the rode attending vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>La Grange</hi> was come vnto him: Who being come aborde they ſet ſayle altogether, and from that time forwarde I neuer<note place="margin">A mightie tempeſt the tenth of Sept.</note> ſawe them more. The verie day that he departed, which was the tenth of September, there roſe ſo great a tempeſt accompanied with ſuch ſtormes, that the Indians themſelues aſſured me that it was the worſt weather that euer was ſeéne on that coaſt: where vpon two or threé dayes after, fearing leaſt our ſhippes might be in ſome diſtreſſe, I ſent for Monſieur <hi>Du Lys</hi> vnto me, to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſemble the reſt of our people to declare vnto them what neéde we had to fortifie our felues: which was done accordingly: and then I gaue them to vnderſtande the neceſſitie and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
<pb facs="tcp:9915:62"/>
whereinto we were like to fall, aſwell by the abſence of our ſhips, as by the neérenes of the Spaniards, at whoſe hands we could looke for no leſſe then an open and ſufficient proclamed warre, ſeéing they had taken lande and forcified themſelues ſo néere vnto vs. And if any miſfortune were fallen vnto our men which were at ſea, we ought to make a full accompt with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that we were to endure many great miſeries, being in ſo ſmall number, and ſo many wayes afflicted as we were. Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one promiſed me to take paynes: and therefore conſidering that their proportion of victuals was ſmall, and that ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, they would not be able to doe any great worke, I aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their allowance: although that after the arriuall of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne <hi>Ribault</hi> my portion of vituacls was allotted vnto mee as<note place="margin">Laudonniere hardly vſed by Ribault</note> vnto a common ſouldier, nether was I able to geue ſo muche as parte of a bottel of wine to anye man which deſerued it: for I was ſo farre from hauing meanes to doe ſo, that the Captaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe tooke two of my boates, wherein the reſt of the meale was which was left me of the biſcuits which I cauſed to bee made to returne into Fraunce: ſo that if I ſhoulde ſay that I receaued more fauour at the handes of the Engliſhmen being ſtrangers<note place="margin">Laudonniere &amp; his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie begin to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> vnto mee, I ſhoulde ſay but a truth. Wee began therefore to fortifie our ſelues and to repaire that which was broken downe, principallie towarde the waterſide, where I cauſed threéſcore foote of treés to bee planted, to repaire the <hi>Paliſſado</hi> with the plankes which I cauſed to bee taken of the ſhippe which I had builded. Neuertheleſſe not withſtanding all our diligence and trauaile, we were neuer able fully to repaire it by reaſon of the ſtormes, which commonly did vs ſo great annoy, that we could not finiſh our incloſure. Perceatting my ſelfe in ſuch extremitie I tooke a muſter of the men, which captaine <hi>Ribault</hi> had left me,<note place="margin">A muſter of the men left in the fort by Ribault.</note> to ſeé if there were any that wanted weapon: I found nyne or ten of them whereof not paſt two or threé had euer drawen ſword out of a ſcabbarde, as I thinke. Let them which haue beene bolde to ſay that I had men ynough left me, ſo that I had meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende my ſelfe, giue eare a little nowe vnto mee, and if they haue eyes in their heads, let them ſe what men I had. Of the nine there were foure but young ſtriplinges, which ſerued Captaine <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault</hi> and kept his dogges, the fift was a cooke: among thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9915:62"/>
that were without the fort, and which were of the aforeſaide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Captayne <hi>Ribault,</hi> there was a Carpenter of threéſcore yeares olde, one a beérebrewer, one olde Croſſe-bowe maker, two ſhoemakers, and foure or fiue men that had their wiues, a player on the Virginals, two ſeruants of Monſieur <hi>Du Lys,</hi> one of Monſieur <hi>De Beauhaire,</hi> one of Monſieur <hi>De la Grange,</hi> and about foureſcore and fiue or ſixe in all, counting aſwell Lackeys<note place="margin">Foureſcore &amp; fiue left in the fort with Lau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>donniere.</note> as women and children. Beholde the goodly troupe ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defende themſelues and ſo couragious as they haue eſteé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them to be: and for my part I leaue it to others conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to imagine whether Captaine <hi>Ribault</hi> woulde haue left them with mee to haue borrowed my men, if they had beéne ſuch. Thoſe which were left mee of myne owne companie were about ſixteéne or ſeuenteéne that coulde beare armes, and all of them poore and leane: the reſt were ſicke and maimed in the conflicte which my Lieutenant had againſt <hi>Vtina.</hi> This viewe beéing thus taken, we ſet our watches, whereof wee made two centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, that the ſoldiers might haue one night freé. Then we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought our ſelues of thoſe which might bee moſt ſufficient, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome wee choſe two, one of whom was named Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Saint Cler,</hi> and the other Monſieur <hi>De la Vigne,</hi> to whom we deliuered candles and Lanterns to go round about the fort to viewe the watch becauſe of the foule and foggie weather. I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them alſo a ſandglaſſe or clocke that the centinels might not be troubled more one then the other. In the meane while I ceaſed not, for all the fowle weather nor my ſickeneſſe which I had, to ouerſeé the corps de garde. The night betweene the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth and twentieth of September <hi>La Vigne</hi> kept watch with his companie, wherein hee vſed all endeuour although it ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without ceaſing. When the day was therefore come, and that hee ſawe that it rayned ſtill worſe then it did before, hee pitied the centinelles ſo too moyled and wette: and thinking the Spaniardes woulde not haue come in ſuch a ſtrange time, hee let them depart, and, to ſay the trueth, hee went himſelfe vnto his lodging. In the meane while one which had ſomething to doe without the fort, and my trompet which went vp vnto the<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards diſcryed the 20. of September.</note> rampart perceaued a troupe of Spaniards which came downe from a little knappe. Where incontinently they beganne
<pb facs="tcp:9915:63"/>
to cry alarme, and the trompetter alſo: Which aſſoone as euer I vnderſtoode, foorthwith I iſſued out, with my Target and ſworde in my hande, and gatte mee into the middeſt of the Courte, where I beganne to cry vppon my ſoldiers. Some of them which weee of the forwarde ſort went towarde the breach, which was on the ſouth-ſide, and where the munitions of the artillerie lay, where they were repulſed and ſlaine. By the ſelfeſame place<note place="margin">The Spaniards enter the fort.</note> two enſignes entred, which immediatly were planted on the walles. Two other enſignes alſo entred on the other ſide toward the Weſt, where there was another brech: and thoſe which were loged in this quarter, and which ſhewed themſelues, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe defeated. As I went to ſuccour them which were defending the breach on the ſouthweſt ſide, I incountred by chaunce a great companie of Spaniardes, which had alreadie repulſed our men<note place="margin">Francis Iean a traitour to his nation.</note> and were nowe entred, which draue mee backe vnto the court of the fort: being there I eſpied with them one called <hi>Francis Iean,</hi> which was one of the marriners which ſtoale away my barkes, &amp; had guided &amp; conducted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Spaniards thither. Aſſoone as he ſaw me, he began to ſay, This is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Captaine. This troupe was led by<note place="margin">Don Pedro Melendes cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine of the Spaniards.</note> a captaine whoſe name, as I thinke, was <hi>Don Pedro Melendes:</hi> theſe made certaine puſhes at me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their pikes which lighted on my target. But perceauing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I was not able to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo great a companie, &amp; that the court was already wonne, &amp; their enſignes planted on the ramparts, and that I had neuer a man about me, ſauing one onely whoſe name was <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> I entred into the yard of my lodging, into which they followed me, and had it not beéne for a tent that was ſet vp, I had beéne taken: but the Spaniards which followed me were occupied in cutting of the Cordes of the tent, and in the meane while I ſaued my ſelfe by the breach which was on the weſt ſide neére vnto my Lieutenantes<note place="margin">Laudonniers eſcape.</note> lodging, and gate away into the woods: where I founde certaine of my men which were eſcaped, of which number there were threé or foure which were ſore hurte. Then ſpake I thus vnto them: Sirs, ſince it hath pleaſed GOD that this miſchaunce is happened vnto vs, wee muſt neédes take the paynes to gette o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Marſhes vnto the ſhippes which are at the mouth of the Riuer. Some woulde neédes goe to a little village which was in the woods, the reſt folowed mee thorough the reédes in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9915:63"/>
water, where being able to goe no farther by reaſon of my ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which I had, I ſent two of my men which were with mee, which coulde ſwim well, vnto the ſhips, to aduertiſe them of that which had happened, and to ſend them worde to come and helpe me. They were not able that day to get vnto the ſhips to certifie them thereof: ſo I was conſtrained to ſtand in the water vp to the ſhoulders all that night long, with one of my men which woulde neuer forſake me. The next day morning, beeing ſcarcely able to drawe my breath any more, I betooke mee to my praiers with the ſouldier which was with me, whoſe name was <hi>Iohn du Chemin:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn du Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min a faithful ſeruant.</note> for I felt my ſelfe ſo feéble, that I was afraid I ſhould dye ſoden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and in truth if he had not embraced me in both his armes, and ſo held me vp, it had not beéne poſſible to ſaue mee. After wee had made an ende of our praiers, I heard a voice, which in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was one of theirs which I had ſent, which were ouer againſt the ſhips and called for the ſhip boate, which was ſo in deéde: and becauſe thoſe of the ſhips had vnderſtanding of the taking of the fort by one called <hi>Iohn de Hais,</hi> maſter Carpenter, which fled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in a ſhallop, they had ſet ſayle to runne along the coaſt to ſée if they might ſaue any: wherein doubtleſſe they did very well<note place="margin">The diligence of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſaue them that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of the fort.</note> their endeuour. They went ſtraight to the place where the two men were which I had ſent, and which called them. Aſſoone as they had receiued them in and vnderſtood where I was, they came and found me in a pitifull caſe. Fiue or ſixe of them tooke me and carried me into the ſhallop: for I was not able by any meanes to goe one foote. After I was brought into the ſhalloppe ſome of the Marriners tooke their clothes from their backs to lend them me, and woulde haue carried me preſently to their ſhips to giue me a little <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi> Howbeit I woulde not goe thither, vntill I had firſt gone with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> boat along the reéds, to ſeéke out the poore ſoules which were ſcattered abroad, where we gathered vp eighteene or<note place="margin">Among thoſe was Iaques Morgues painter yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the Blacke-Fryers in London.</note> twentye of them. The laſt that I tooke in was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Nephewe of the Treaſurer <hi>le Beau.</hi> After we were all come to the ſhips, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them aſwell as I coulde, and ſent backe the boate againe with ſpeéde to ſeé if they coulde finde yet any more. Vpon her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, the Mariners told me how that Captaine <hi>Iames Ribault</hi>
               <note place="margin">Francis Iean cauſe of this enterpriſe.</note> which was in his ſhippe about two muſkets ſhotte diſtant from the fort, had parled with the Spaniardes, and that <hi>Francis Iean</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9915:64"/>
came vnto his ſhippe, where he ſtaied a long ſpace, whereat they greatly maruailed, conſidering that hee was the cauſe of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, how he would let him eſcape. After I was come into the ſhip called the Greyhounde, Captain <hi>Iames Ribault</hi> &amp; Captain <hi>Valuot</hi> came to ſee me: and there wee concluded to returne into France. Nowe foraſmuch as I founde the ſhippe vnfurniſhed of Captaine, Pilot, Maſter, and Maſters-mate, I gaue aduiſe to chooſe out one of the moſt able men among all the Mariners, and that by their owne voices. I tooke alſo ſixe men out of another ſmall ſhippe, which wee had ſunke becauſe it wanted ballaſt and coulde not be ſaued. Thus I encreaſed the furniture of the ſhip wherein I was my ſelfe embarked, and made one, which had beéne Maſters-mate in the foreſaid ſmall ſhippe, Maſter of mine. And becauſe I lacked a Pilot, I praied <hi>Iames Ribault</hi> that heé would graunt me one of the foure men that he had in his ſhippe, which I ſhould name vnto him, to ſerue me for a Pilot: he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue me them, which neuertheleſſe he did not at the inſtant<note place="margin">The bad dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Iames Ribault.</note> when we were readie to depart, notwithſtanding all the ſpeéch I vſed to him, in declaring that it was for the Kinges ſeruice.

For Captain <hi>Iames Ribault</hi> had taken away her furniture: I tooke away her ordinance onely, which was all diſmounted, whereof I gaue nine pieces to <hi>Iames Ribault</hi> to carrye into France, the other fiue I put into my ſhippe.

We ſailed al the night, ſuppoſing we had beéne ſhot into the narrow Sea betweene Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and France, &amp; by the next day to reach Diepe, but wee were deceaued of our longing: for about two or three of the clocke after midnight as I walked vpon the hatches, I diſcried land rounde about me, whereat we were aſtonied. Immediatly I cauſed them to ſtrike ſaile and ſound: we found we had not vnder vs paſt eight fathoms of water, whereupon I commaunded them to ſtaye till breake of day: which being come, and ſeéing my Mariners tolde me that they knew not this land, I commanded them to approch vnto it. Being neére thereunto I made them caſt anker, and ſent the boat on ſhoare to vnderſtand in what country we were. Word was brought me that we were in Wales a prouince of England. I went incontinently on land, where after I had taken the ayre, a ſickeneſſe tooke mee whereof I thought I ſhoulde haue dyed.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſcouery of the fort the Spaniards were no niggards of their Canon ſhotte, nor of two double coluerines, which beeing mounted vppon a bulwarke commaunded all along the Ryuer, which made captain <hi>Gourgues</hi> to get to the hil couered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wood, at the foote whereof the Fort beginneth, and the forreſt or woode continueth and ſtretcheth foorth beyond it: ſo that he had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">Note.</note> couerture to approch thereunto without offence. He purpoſed alſo to remaine there vntill the morning wherein hee was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to aſſault the Spaniardes by ſcaling their walles on the ſide toward the hill where the Trench ſeémed not ſufficiently flanked for the defence of the courtaines, and from whence parte of his men might drawe them that were beſieged, which ſhoulde ſhewe themſelues to defend the rampart while the reſt were comming vp. But the Gouernour haſtened his vnhappye deſtinye, cauſing threéſcore ſhotte to ſallie foorth, which paſſing thorough the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches aduaunced forwarde to diſcry the number and valure of the French, whereof twenty vnder the conduct of <hi>Cazenoue,</hi> getting betweéne the Fort and them which nowe were iſſued foorth, cutte of their repaſſage, while <hi>Gourgues</hi> commanded the reſt to charge them in the front, but not to diſcharge but neére at hande, and ſo that they might be ſure to hitte them, that afterwarde with more eaſe they might cutte them in pieces with their ſwords. So that turning their backes aſſoone as they were charged, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in by his Lieutenaunt, they remained all ſlaine vppon the<note place="margin">The ſlaughter of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the third Fort.</note> place. Whereat the reſt that were beſieged were ſo aſtonied that they knewe none other meane to ſaue their liues, but by fleéing into the Wooddes adioyning, where neuertheleſſe beéing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred agayne by the Arrowes of the Sauages which lay in waight there for them (whereof one ranne thorough the target and bodie of a Spaniarde, which therewithall fell downe

ſtarke deade) ſome were conſtrained to turne backe, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die by the hand of the French, which purſued them: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelues that none of them could finde any fauour neither with the one nor the other Nation, whom they had alike and ſo out of meaſure cruelly entreated, ſauing thoſe which were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be an example for the time to come. The fort when it was taken was found well prouided of all neceſſaries: namely of fiue<note place="margin">The taking of the third Fort.</note> double coluerines, and foure mynions, with diuers other ſmall pieces of all ſorts, and eighteéne groſſe cakes of gunnepowder, all ſorts of weapons, which <hi>Gourgues</hi> cauſed with ſpeéde to bee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, ſauing the powder &amp; other moueables, by reaſon it was all conſumed with fire through the negligence of a ſauage, which in ſeéthing of his fiſh, ſette fire on a traine of powder which was made and hidden by the Spaniardes to haue feaſted the French at the firſt aſſault, thus blowing vp the ſtore houſe and the other houſes built of pyne treés. The reſt of the Spaniards being led away priſoners with the others, after that the General had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the wrong which they had done without occaſion to all the French Nation, were all hanged on the boughes of the ſame treés whereon the French hunge: of which number fiue were hanged by one Spaniarde, which perceiuing himſelfe in the like miſerable eſtate confeſſed his fault, and the iuſt iudgement which God had brought vppon him. But in ſtéede of the writing which <hi>Pedro Melendes</hi> had hanged ouer them, emporting theſe words in Spaniſh, <hi>I doe not this as vnto French men, but as vnto Lutherans, Gourgues</hi> cauſed to bee imprinted with a ſeéring<note place="margin">The writings hanged ouer the French &amp; Spaniards ſlain in Florida.</note> iron in a table of Firrewoode, <hi>I doe not this as vnto Spaniardes, nor as vnto Mariners, but as vnto Traiters, Robbers, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</hi> Afterward conſidering hee had not men inough to keépe his Forts which he had wonne, much leſſe to ſtore them, fearing alſo leaſt the Spaniarde which hath dominions neére adioining ſhould renew his forces, or the Sauages ſhould preuaile againſt the French men, vnleſſe his Maieſtie would ſend thither, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to raze them. And in deéde, after hee had aſſembled, and in the end perſwaded, all the ſauage kinges ſo to doe, they cauſed their ſubiects to runne thither with ſuch affection, that they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threwe all the threé Forts flatte euen with the ground in one day.<note place="margin">The three Forts razed.</note> This done by <hi>Gonrgues,</hi> that hee might returne to his ſhippes

which were left in the Ryuer of <hi>Seyne</hi> called <hi>Tacatacourou,</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teéne leagues diſtant from thence, he ſent <hi>Cazenoue</hi> and the artillery by water, afterward with foureſtore harquebuſiers, armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> corſlets, &amp; matches light, folowed with forty Mariners bearing pikes, by reaſon of the ſmall confidence he was to haue in ſo many ſauages, hee marched by land alwaies in battaile ray, finding the<note place="margin">Great honour done by the Sauages to Gourgues.</note> waies couered with ſauages, which came to honor him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents &amp; praiſes, as the deliueret of all the countries round about adioyning. An old woman among the reſt ſaid vnto him, that now ſheé cared not any more to die, ſince ſheé had ſeéne the Frenchmen once againe in <hi>Florida,</hi> &amp; the Spaniards chaſed out. Briefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arriued, and finding his ſhippes ſet in order, and euery thing readie to ſet ſayle, he counſelled the kings to continue in the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and auncient league, which they had made with the king of Fraunce, which woulde defend them againſt all Nations: which they all promiſed, ſhedding teares becauſe of his departure, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locotara</hi> eſpecially: for appeaſing of whom he promiſed them to returne within twelue Moones (ſo they count the yeares) and that his king woulde ſend them an army, and ſtore of knyues for<note place="margin">Kniues in great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> preſentes, and all other thinges neceſſarye. So that after he had taken his leaue of them, and aſſembled his men, he thanked God of al his ſucceſſe ſince his ſetting foorth, and prayed to him for an happy returne. The third of May 1568. all thinges were made<note place="margin">The third of May.</note> readie, the rende-vous appointed, and the Ankers weighed to ſette ſayle, ſo proſperouſly, that in ſeuenteene dayes they ranne eleuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hundred leagues, continuing which courſe they arriued<note place="margin">The arriuall of Gourgues at Rochel, the ſixt of Iune.</note> at <hi>Rochell</hi> the ſixth of Iune, the foure and thirtieth day after their departure from the Ryuer of May, hauing loſt but a ſmall Pinneſſe and eight men in it, with a fewe gentlemen and others which were ſlaine in the aſſaulting of the Forts. After the cheere and good entertainement which hee receaued of thoſe of <hi>Rochell,</hi> hee ſayled to <hi>Bordeaux</hi> to enfourme Monſieur <hi>Monluc</hi> of the thinges aboue mentioned, albeit hee was aduertiſed of eighteene Pinneſſes, and a great ſhippe of two hundred Tunnes full of Spaniardes, which beeing aſſured of the defeat in <hi>Florida,</hi> and that he was at <hi>Rochell,</hi> came as farre as <hi>Che-de Bay,</hi> the ſame<note place="margin">Che-de Bay.</note> day that hee departed thence, and followed him as farre as <hi>Blay</hi> (but he was gotten already to <hi>Bordeaux</hi>) to make him yeelde an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account of his voyage, then that where with he made many

Frenchmen right glad. The Catholicke king being afterwarde infourmed that <hi>Gourgues</hi> coulde not eaſilye be taken, offered a great ſomme of money to him that coulde bringe him his heade, praying moreouer king <hi>Charles</hi> to do iuſtice on him as of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of ſo bloudye an art contrarye to their alliaunce and good leage of friendſhippe. In ſo much as comming to <hi>Paris</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe vnto the king, to ſignifie vnto him the ſucceſſe of his voyage, and the meanes which he had to ſubdue this whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try vnto his obedience, (wherein hee offered to employe his life, and all his goods,) he found his entertainement and aunſwere ſo contrarye to his expectation, that in fine hee was conſtrained to hide himſelfe a long ſpace in the Court of <hi>Roan,</hi> about the yeare 1570. And without the aſſiſtaunce of Preſident <hi>Marigny,</hi> in whoſe houſe hee remained certaine daies, and of the receiuer of <hi>Vacquieulx,</hi> which alwaies was his faithfull friende, hee had beene in great daunger. Which grieued not a little <hi>Dominicke de Gourgues,</hi> conſidering the ſeruices which hee had done aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well vnto him as to his predeceſſours kinges of Fraunce. Hee<note place="margin">The birth, life and death of Captaine Gourgues.</note> was borne in Mount <hi>Marſan in Guyenne,</hi> and employed for the ſeruice of the moſt Chriſtian kinges in all the armies made ſince theſe twentye fiue or thirtie yeares: at laſt hee had the charge and honour of a Captaine, which in a place neere vnto <hi>Siene,</hi> with thirty Souldyers ſuſtained the brunt of a part of the Spaniſh Army, by which beeing taken in the aſſault, and hauing all his men cutte in pieces, hee was put into a galcy in token of the good warre and ſingular fauour which the Spaniarde is wont to ſhewe vs. But as the galey was going toward <hi>Sicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> beeing taken by the Turkes, ledde away to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it was ſhortly afterwarde recouered by <hi>Romeguas,</hi> commaunder ouer the army of <hi>Malta.</hi> By this meane returning home, he made a voyage on the coaſt of <hi>Affrica,</hi> whence hee tooke his courſe to <hi>Breſil,</hi> and to the ſouth Sea. At length being deſirous to repaire the honour of Fraunce he ſette vpon <hi>Florida</hi> with ſuch ſucceſſe as you haue heard. So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become by his continuall warlike actions both by land and Sea, no leſſe valiant Captaine then ſkilfull Mariner, hee hath made himſelfe feared of the Spaniard, and acceptable vnto the Queéne of England for the deſert of his vertues. To conclude, he died in the yeare 1582. to the great grief of ſuch as knew him.</p>
