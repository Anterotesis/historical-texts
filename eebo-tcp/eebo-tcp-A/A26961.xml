            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat Artifices and aſſaults the Devil hath made and uſed to ſupplant the weightieſt Principles, to darken the moſt clear and comfortable Truths, and to break the Peace and Concord of the Church, is grown too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to require proof. And how he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed this preſent Doctrine of the <hi>Church-Memberſhip, and Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> with Controverſies, we need not now inſiſt upon. But ſurely, were not our little ones as well concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intereſted in the Covenant of Grace, as their Parents are, your ſtrange and deep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions towards them (ſo rooted in Nature, and cultivated and enlarged by Grace) would become their dreadful torment and diſtreſs. And why Infants ſhould feel the ſmart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And what their capacity ſhould be for, if not to be anſwerably treated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, (ſuppoſing what God by his Son and in his Goſpel hath prepared and tendred to us) I cannot underſtand. All Laws conſider Infants at in their Parents, until maturity make them
<pb facs="tcp:60979:3"/>

And why we ſhould exclude them from Covenant redreſſes, ſeeing God once took them in by an Act or Law of Grace not yet repealed, I am not able to conjecture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were they excluded from Goſpel-Grace, their Parents would want, <hi>1.</hi> That Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Argument which now they have to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted unto God themſelves, and to be true to ſuch a Dedication, as ever they regard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and eternal welfare of their Infant-Seed.

And then with what dejected hearts and looks muſt mournful Parents follow their deceaſed Infants to their Graves! But I ſhall (and need) not ſay any more, ſeeing this Abſtract of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> larger and elaborate Treatiſe, comes on this Errand to its Reader, who is deſired to take notice, that it was ready many Months agone, ſoon after the publication of the Anti-Queries, though its own publication hath been obſtructed until now.

               <head>A few Notes upon the Queriſt Examined.</head>
               <p>YOur <hi>Anti-Queries,</hi> very lately ſent me by one of your party, as <hi>[A full Anſwer to the Fifty Queries,]</hi> I have conſidered imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I hope; and cannot think them worthy of a Book in Anſwer: Yet that you might not take my <hi>Silence</hi> either for <hi>conſent,</hi> or for a contempt, I have written theſe few pages here.</p>
               <p>Now in the firſt place I muſt tell you, Thoſe <hi>Fifty Queries</hi> will remain unanſwered, until that Book of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> be anſwered, to which every <hi>Query</hi> refers, which, for ought I know, you never yet lookt into. <note n="*" place="margin">In your Title page you ſay, <hi>Fifty Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the works of Mr. <hi>Rich. Baxter.</hi>
                  </note> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your <hi>Anti-Queries,</hi> ſo far as they concern the main point in Queſtion, be not cut off, and anſwered again and again in that Book, and divers other extant, and common, I leave to the judgment of indifferent Readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60979:4"/>
Further I might tell you of your playing upon the word, <hi>[Church,] Antiq.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 1. which is immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in my firſt Query, by <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> which prevents your exception. And I might take notice of your new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covn'd Term, <hi>[Practical Ordinance,]</hi> which you have ſo often, as if there were ſome other Ordinances, <hi>ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or not practical. I might take notice of your <hi>Illogical</hi> diſtinction, of being a Member of the Church <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and being a Member <hi>Formally, Anti.</hi> 18. <hi>p.</hi> 14. And your not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an univerſal <hi>Viſible</hi> Church, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 12. I might take notice how you miſunderſtand, or miſapply thoſe Texts, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of—(Joh.</hi> 6. 53.) And, <hi>Except a man be born of water—(Joh.</hi> 3. 5.) As if the former ſpake of the Lords Supper, and the latter of Baptiſm, <hi>(vid. Antiq. p.</hi> 5.) Again, I might take notice of your <hi>ſhooting ſhort,</hi> in many of your <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queries.</hi> As becauſe there was a time when Infants within the Church were not devoted to God by any ſuch <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ſign,</hi> as Circumciſion, or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, no ſuch <hi>engaging ſign</hi> being then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60979:4"/>
inſtituted; therefore Infants are not to be ſo ſolemnly devoted to God, when ſuch an engaging ſin is inſtituted, and belongeth to all within the Church. And your <hi>ſhooting wide</hi> is plain in ſome others. I might tell you, how you have the ſame things over and over again. Though you accuſe me of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual tautologizing, Antiq.</hi> 38. <hi>p.</hi> 30. I am willing, the Impartial Reader ſhould judge, whether of us be moſt guilty here. <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori,</hi> &amp;c. I take notice of your citing Mr. <hi>Baxters Cure of Church-Diviſions, p.</hi> 7. no leſs than thrice, <hi>(ſoil.</hi> in Preface, and <hi>p.</hi> 10. and <hi>p.</hi> 32.) yet a man may turn thrice to <hi>p.</hi> 7. in that book of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for that which you refer unto, and loſe his labour. So I take notice of your vain flouriſhing, and braving it with Mr. <hi>T's confident challenge,</hi> both in the end of your Preface, <hi>[And know this,</hi> &amp;c.] and again, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 49 <hi>p.</hi> 38, 39. (when alſo you <hi>ſhoot wide,</hi> not one word to my Query.) As concerning Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I may ſay, <hi>Know this,</hi> that others that are ſober and judicious, <hi>tell him,</hi> he hath clear'd thoſe points ſufficiently, that any <hi>further debate</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60979:5"/>
concerning them is <hi>needleſs.</hi> Further I might take notice of the many <hi>[Et caetera's]</hi> you have put to my <hi>Queries,</hi> ſometimes leaving out what was moſt lively to pinch; yea, you cut off the <hi>chief part</hi> of fiftieth and <hi>laſt Query,</hi> without ſo much as an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs it was the Printers fault. Again, I might take notice where you are not very conſiſtent with, but rather contradict your ſelf One or two places I may have occaſion to obſerve.</p>
               <p>But I muſt take notice of your fair <hi>conceſſions,</hi> and I thank you for them. I will not diſpute it with you, whether theſe of yours be properly called, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queries?</hi> Let the <hi>prepoſition</hi>

                  </gap> be either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> with you, I ſhould not ſpend time in criticiſing on the word. But whether <hi>in compoſition,</hi> the <hi>word</hi> of an Apoſtle or Meſſenger of the Churches, (as I have heard, ſome do call you) ſhould be both <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> may be a queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now, what do theſe following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Adam <hi>as any whatſoever?</hi> Antiq. 10. p. 9. <hi>As for the gracious Covenant made with</hi> Adam, <hi>do we not grant that it extends to Infants? yea, we ſay with Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>it was never abrogated.</hi> Antiq 19. p. 14. <hi>Whether the Bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>(if you underſtand it of Eternal Life) was not the Bleſſing of the Fathers that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? And whether that Bleſſing did not belong to their Infants?</hi> (which is not at all oppoſite to my 19 Query. And in what follows there, you plainly <hi>ſhoot ſhort,</hi> as I noted before.) And <hi>Antiq.</hi> 23. <hi>p.</hi> 17. you fairly grant, that <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to the <hi>Seed of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> to the children of them that Love God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are unrevoked, you doubt not but <hi>theſe Promiſes yet remain.</hi> (Though I confeſs, I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what you mean by thoſe words, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>Whether all men that follow the rules of Morality, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of theſe Bleſſings alſo?</hi> Theſe you ſpeak of, are either <hi>Righteous,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>love God,</hi> or they are not. If they be <hi>ſuch,</hi> then certainly they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Univerſal Church, and are real <hi>Members</hi> of it; if they are not <hi>ſuch,</hi> then they have not an intereſt in

But to go on with your conceſſions: <hi>Antiq.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the difference between the Baptiſts and Paedobaptiſts, be not chiefly (if not only) about impoſing Ceremonies upon Infants?</hi> Antiq. 12. p. 10. <hi>Seeing the Baptiſts may and do in a good ſenſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Infants to be related to the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>by Redemption, pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to God,</hi> &amp;c. Antiq. 30. p. 23. <hi>And who denies Infants to be capable of Infant-Relation, Obligation, or Right? Or who oppoſeth their being devoted to God in their capacity?</hi> Antiq. 31. p. 24. <hi>Whether you do not greatly wrong your ſelf, and thoſe you call Anabaptiſts, in ſaying, they vehemently plead againſt devoting their Children to God? yea, ſure they do it actually, as far as Gods word requires.—Prove if you can, that you your ſelves do conſent to the Covenant of grace for your Infants, more than we, whom you call Anabaptiſts.]</hi> Here we have (as you ſay in your <hi>Preface)</hi> your <q>
                     <hi>Conceſſions in reſpect of Infants. Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, and the Devotion of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>

 &amp;c.</q> I ſhall be very glad, if I may know you are all agreed in theſe things.

                  <hi>Body.</hi> Only I query whether it be not a contradiction, when you ſay, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 28. <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>How can Infants be ſaid to be a ſpiritual Seed:</hi> Are any but a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed, Members of the Inviſible Church? Are not they a ſpiritual Seed that are of Chriſts Body, and ſaved by him?</p>
               <p>But if Infants be not Members of the Viſible Church, how can you prove they are Members of the Inviſible Church? To be probably Members of the Inviſible Church, is to be Members of the Viſible Church, or Viſible Church-Members. Further, you ſay, <hi>The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts do in a good ſenſe acknowledge In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be related to the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>by Redemption, pious Dedication to God, &amp;c. (Antiq.</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. before-cited) now do but make ſenſe of it, and I have enough. Either theſe Infants viſibly belong, to the Kingdom of Chriſt, or to the Kingdom of Satan: (for theſe two Kingdoms divide and ſhare the whole world, that ſuch as are not of the one, are certainly of the other; and ſuch as are not viſibly of the one, are viſibly of the other) And will you ſay, that ſuch as are of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60979:7"/>
                  <hi>Redeemed-Church, related to the Church by Redemption,</hi> and further related by <hi>Pious Dedication to God,</hi> &amp;c. are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the ſeed of the Serpent, and of the Kingdom of Satan.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>[Pious Dedication]</hi> leads me to another of your ſelf-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Antiq.</hi> 30. <hi>p.</hi> 23. <hi>Where are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Parents required to devote their children, by conſenting to any Covenant for them?</hi> (Though you grant there, the <hi>Jews</hi> were required to Covenant for their children <hi>in matters of Religion.)</hi> And yet under the next <hi>Anti-query, p.</hi> 24. you ſay, <hi>Prove if you can, that you your ſelves do conſent to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace for your Infants, more than we.</hi> How properly may theſe be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anti-queries?</hi> Or to get off, will you ſay, you <hi>conſent</hi> to the Covenant of grace for the Infants? but not as a <hi>thing required?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave you thanks before, for ſome things granted concerning Infants, and I here promiſe more thanks, if you will prove the ſame of <hi>all Infants.</hi> This you inſinuate, p. 5. <hi>Seeing then all Infants (for ought you know) have the ſame right—</hi>But I doubt, your proof of this

               <p>You enquire further, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>And whether this do not give the Parents power to ſave, or damn their Infants?</hi>

But you will not ſay, I ſuppoſe, that you are your own Saviour, when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition of the Covenant, to which Salvation for Chriſts ſake is graciouſly promiſed.

               <p>The overthrow of both thoſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the deluge, (ſpoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.) is a ſtrange <hi>Medium</hi> to prove the Salvation of all their Infants, which you hint at, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 6 And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. which you there cite, will no more prove, that all Infants (that die Infants) are ſaved; then that all men are ſaved. <hi>The free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life.</hi> This <hi>[all]</hi> muſt be limited to <hi>all</hi> in Chriſt.</p>

But if it be ſo clear, that none are to doubt the Salvation of the Infants of Pagans, we ſhould reſt ſatisfied, and think it enough that the children of the faithful are put into ſo good a condition. But I told you (in my Treatiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>p.</hi> 359.) That to aſſert the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that die in Infancy, ſeems to imply, that Gods deſtroying the old world, and <hi>Sodom, &amp;c.</hi> were eminent

                  <hi>Acts of Mercy,</hi> rather then of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> wherein ſuch multitude of Souls were ſent to Heaven together, who if they had lived, had probably (at leaſt the greateſt part of them) gone to Hell. I deſire you would remove this doubt of mine. So likewiſe I cannot yet recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile your opinion with that Reaſon the Lord gives for his ſparing <hi>Nineveh, Jonas</hi> 4. 11. (which I alſo there took notice of.) Had there not been more Mercy, ſuppoſe the Lord had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way above ſixſcore thouſand little ones, that were not come to the uſe of reaſon, if then they had all been undoubtedly ſaved; then in ſparing them with the City, whereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not one of very many of them was ſaved. Help me over this doubt. And if the Salvation of Pagans-Infants is not to be doubted, (as you ſuggeſt) then ſuppoſe the <hi>French King</hi> ſhould have power to over-run all the <hi>Pagan</hi> countries in the world, though he ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, plundered, fired all the Towns where he came; yet provided he did but withal ſlay all their little ones, then will it not follow, that he might be looked upon as a greater Bleſſing than
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60979:11"/>
Scourge to the world? Had the world your light and knowledge, they muſt conclude, that they ought not to be ſo ſorry for the ſpoiling of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, (a temporal calamity) as they ſhould rejoyce, (have cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing indeed) that all their little ones were undoubtedly ſaved, certainly ſent to Heaven. And then what ſhall we make of <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others?</hi> And v. 12. <hi>That all that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of Promiſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hope, and without God in the world.

               <p>But have you not forgotten that you told us, you <hi>do not doubt,</hi> but the promiſes made to the Seed of the Righteous, and the promiſe of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the children of them that love God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain unrevoked?

death of Chriſt, to and for all Infants that die Infants, (as you intimate <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.</hi> 37. p. 14. and in other places? And when you would have the <hi>bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>(underſtanding it of eternal life) to belong to the Infants of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> (as <hi>Antiq.</hi> 19. <hi>p.</hi> 14.) if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and take in the Infants of the unbelieving, as well as believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; then do not you forget that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>That the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles.</hi> As to their Infants, you here ſuppoſe it to have been on them all along, and not to come on them, by their Parents <hi>receiving the Promiſe through faith.</hi> According to your opinion, all Infants are, and ever were bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abraham,</hi> notwithſtanding many of the Parents have been, and are Pagans, Infidels, and ſuch as the word Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces under a Curſe. Now, how may divers of your own party (ſuch as you call Baptiſts) juſtly object that to you, which without ground they are wont to object againſt us? you would <hi>make the promiſe of Salvation run unto a fleſhly line indeed,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> notes in his <hi>Review,</hi> p. 33.) And

                  <hi>who can forbid water,</hi> (now that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the initiatory Sign and Seal of the Covenant) to any dying Infant of a Pagan, ſince he may be confident the Bleſſings of the Covenant belong to it?</p>
               <p>You query <hi>ubi ſupra, (Antiq.</hi> 37. <hi>p.</hi> 29.) <hi>Will not the ſecond</hi> Adams <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſalve the firſt</hi> Adams <hi>diſobedience?</hi> And <hi>Antiq.</hi> 38. <hi>p.</hi> 30. <hi>Whether the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſneſs of Chriſt is not as avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſave Infants, without any mans acceptance thereof for them?]</hi> I doubt not, but the ſecond <hi>Adams</hi> obedience and merits are available, ſo far as was intended, and agreed betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him.

               <p>Antiq. 37. p. 29. <hi>Whether it be his will, that the grace of that Covenant ſhould depend upon others obſervation of the condition for them?

               <p>To what you ſay of Gods, <hi>[putting the Salvation of Infants out of his own hand:]</hi> I need ſay but this, you might as well query, whether God put not the Salvation of the Adult out of his own hand, if their Salvation be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required.</p>
               <p>One thing more I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, (wherein I ſuppoſe you are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſingular alſo) In <hi>Antiq.</hi> 26. <hi>p.</hi> 19.

There is one Body, and one Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. This is the concluſion of the Sermon, <hi>(p.</hi> 96, 97.) And what <hi>gifts</hi> of the Spirit you ſpeak of is very plain, throughout the Sermon. For brevity, I will mention but one place, (p. 77.) <hi>Thus you ſee the Church being under perpetual Exhortations, to ſeek for ſpiritual gifts [without any reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,] neceſſarily infers her perpetual right to them, and every of them; which conſideration alone is ſufficient (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) to ſatisfie any Chriſtian, that the promiſe of the Spirit (even the ſame that was given to the firſt Churches) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of gifts as well as graces, belongs to the Church of Chriſt throughout all Ages.</hi>

Now if <hi>Impoſition of hands generally pertains</hi> to all the Members of the Church, and <hi>ſolemnly intereſteth</hi> them in the promiſe of the Spirit, methinks it ſhould follow, that all ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, on whom you lay your hands, (ſuppoſing you have <hi>right</hi> to do it, as you take up the practice, if I be not miſ-informed) ſhould have ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts</hi> of the Spirit. And I have reaſon to think, you encourage your followers to ſubmit to this <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> by working in them ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion and expectation. For <hi>(p.</hi> 88. of the forecited Sermon) you have theſe words, <hi>As the promiſe of gifts (as well as graces) [pertains to us as we are the called of God] we ought to ſtir one another up, to ſeek with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and [full aſſurance] for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of promiſe.</hi> And p. 95. <hi>'Tis well known (and I think granted on all hands) that they</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Primitive Churches) uſed the ſolemn Ordinance of Prayer and Impoſition of hands, for obtaining the promiſed Spirit, at leaſt with reſpect to theſe gifts.—Then ſeeing theſe gifts are promiſed to us as well as unto them, and are attainable, and in part (at leaſt) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>

May it not be ſaid of you, <hi>you know not what Spirit you are of?</hi> May you not as well take upon you, to lay hands on the Sick to heal them?

               <p>I can paſs by what you ſay of me, that I am <hi>worſe for my Baptiſm in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi> as <hi>reſting upon that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Antiq.</hi> 40. <hi>p.</hi> 32. <hi>Doth not your Conſcience tell you, that the Baptiſm of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon profeſſion of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is beyond the reach of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?]</hi> The Baptiſing of ſuch as were without the Church, or were firſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and to be afterwards admitted into the Chriſtian Church, upon the profeſſion of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is plain in Scripture, not to be contradicted. But this contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Baptiſing of the Infants of ſuch, being alſo to be acknowledged Church-Members. Neither can you ſhew in all the New-Teſtament one inſtance of any Baptiſed upon their profeſſion, who deferred their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Baptiſm (if Infants) till they were grown up, and able to make the like profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60979:16"/>
But to come a little nearer to you; would you have none but <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> Baptiſed? Then do you not forget your ſelf again? and what you ſaid, <hi>Antiq.</hi> 39. <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>Who is againſt as early an engagement of children to God, as can lawfully be made?]</hi> Now this one conceſſion of yours, that you are for <hi>as early an engaging</hi> them to God, <hi>as can lawfully be,</hi> will prove your way <hi>not ſo certain, not altogether clear,</hi> (as you would perſwade your Readers in your <hi>Preface)</hi> not <hi>beyond the reach of contradiction,</hi> but full of doubts, full of difficulties. If the children of Chriſtians are not to be engaged, and devoted to God in their Infancy, you can none of you tell, (how then are you like to agree) <hi>at what age</hi> they are to be ſo engaged, and devoted to God? What think you? Is it not <hi>ſinful</hi> to neglect and put it off, when once it might <hi>lawfully</hi> be done? Now what word, what <hi>Example</hi> can you produce out of Scripture, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Conſcience <hi>how early</hi> you may do it? What was the youngeſt Age that ever any Chriſtians child was Baptiſed at? And if you could tell us the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60979:16"/>
                  <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> and <hi>quod non,</hi> the youngeſt age at which any child was Baptiſed, and under which age none might be Baptiſed, it would be ſome guide to us. Becauſe you put the matter to my Conſcience, I would ſpeak ſeriouſly. And ſo I muſt ſay, was I off from the <hi>grounds of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> I cannot ſee, how Conſcience would be well ſatisfied about the time of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing my own Children. To defer it after they are come to make a viſible profeſſion, by your own Principles, ſhould be concluded ſinful, againſt the Rule of the Goſpel; but how ſoon a Childs profeſſion may be taken for a ſufficient viſible profeſſion, I ſhould not know how to reſolve, or how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>I have one requeſt to you, that you would take into your more ſerious thoughts that part of the <hi>laſt Query</hi> which you left out. Think how much of it you have granted unto. And let us ſtudy the things that make for Peace, and whereby we may edifie one another.</p>

The main Queſtion not being [By what ſign Members are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church,] or [whether by a ſign, or without?] but [At what age they are to be admitted Members?] which is as fully determined in the old Teſtament, as moſt things in the

               <p n="2">2. Will the difficulty of a point, that it is not ſo eaſie or clear as we would have it, prove, that it is not Truth? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us many things <note place="margin">

Are there not many weighty Controverſies more difficult than this? (And ſhould it not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, whether the contrary hath not far leſs evidence and likelihood of Truth?)</p>
               <p n="3">3. If never ſo clear evidence of Truth be produced, will it not ſtill be dark to them that are uncapable of diſcerning it? And is not this the caſe of many, even of the godly, that are <note place="margin">

[That Infants are Church-Members:] is not this as much, as to prove, They muſt be Baptized? Will you allow of ſuch an Argument for Infant-Baptiſm as Chriſt brought for the Reſurrection? <hi>(Mat.</hi> 22. 31, 32.) or will you call that weak arguing, which is like his?</p>

               <p>Now to the Queſtion, <hi>[whether ſome Infants ought not to be Baptized?]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Ought not all Chriſts Diſciples <note place="margin">

                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 14.</note> ſenſe, Relatively; for one that is of the number of thoſe that belong to Chriſt, as Maſter and King of the Church, and devoted to his overſight and rule, and teaching for the future: as well as in a narrower ſenſe, for thoſe who are actual Learners? And</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Doth not the Holy Ghoſt call <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 15</note> them Diſciples? <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. Is it not evident, that thoſe on <hi>whoſe necks</hi> the falſe Teachers would have <hi>laid the yoke,</hi> were <hi>Diſciples?</hi> If you ſay, not All, but ſome of them are here called Diſciples, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 16.</note> that is, only them at Age; then will it not follow, that it is but ſome only, whoſe Circumciſion the Apoſtle and the Synod doth conclude againſt, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60979:20"/>
is, thoſe of age? Then for any thing the Apoſtle ſaith, or this Synod, all Infants might be circumciſed ſtill: and is not this abſurd?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If no Infants are Diſciples, what <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 18.</note> is the cauſe? Is it becauſe they are <hi>not capable?</hi> or becauſe <hi>God will not ſhew them ſuch mercy?</hi> Can you find out a third cauſe, which is not redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to one of theſe? And 1. If In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are <hi>capable</hi> of being <hi>ſervants of God,</hi> how can they be thought incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being <hi>Diſciples?</hi> If you will make a difference, is not more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a <hi>Servant,</hi> than to a <hi>Diſciple?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 19.</note> Yet is it not plain, that Infants are capable of being Gods Servants? <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 41, 42. If God call Infants his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, though they are uncapable at preſent of doing him Service, what forbids, but that we may call them Diſciples, tho at preſent they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of learning? Were not the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Infants called Gods ſervants in a ſenſe peculiar, as choſen <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 20.</note> and ſeparated from all others; that the Gentiles at age were not ſo Gods ſervants, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Infants were? Otherwiſe how could it be a reaſon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60979:20"/>
for releaſing them in the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee, any more than for releaſing any other?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are not Infants capable of being <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 21.</note> Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom? And is not Chriſts Church both his Kingdom and his School, and every Member of it under him, both as King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? Are not all Subjects of Chriſt in his viſible Kingdom or (Church) <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> And are not <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> all one in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 26.</p>
               <p>Again, can it be, that Infants are not Diſciples, becauſe God <hi>will not ſhew them ſuch Mercy?</hi> Were not Infants in the Jewiſh Church Servants and Diſciples of Chriſt, (tho not ſo fully, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 22.</note> and explicitly as now?) was not Chriſt then the King of the Church, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, upon undertaking to pay our debt? And if Infants in the Jews Church were Servants, and Diſciples, doth not God ſhew as great and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mercy to his Church now under the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>And to your common objection, that Infants <hi>cannot learn.</hi> (1.) Yet can they not partake of the protection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60979:21"/>
of their Maſter, and enjoy the Priviledges of the Family and School, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 23.</note> and be under Chriſts charge and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion? (2.) And be <hi>devoted to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> if they live, and conſecrated to him as their Maſter? (3.) And why ſhould any be more vigorous with Chriſt in this caſe, than with Men? Is it not common to call the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> both old and young, by the name of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> or <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Mahomet?</hi> And what if Infants cannot at firſt learn to know Chriſt? Is that the firſt Leſſon? Is it not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, if they can be taught any of the duty of a rational creature? And doth not Scripture require to <hi>teach Children</hi> the trade of their life <hi>in the time of their youth;</hi> (as early, no doubt, as they are able to underſtand) and to bring them up <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?</hi> And does not this nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture belong to them, as <hi>Schollars of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Ought not all ordinarily to be Baptized, that ought to be <hi>admitted viſible Church-Members?</hi> Since Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was inſtituted, have we any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 24.</note> or Example of admitting viſible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60979:21"/>
Members any other way? Will you not grant, that all viſible Church-Members <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 26.</note> muſt be admitted by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? Now what plentiful proof may be brought, that ſome Infants ought to be admitted viſible Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? And does there need any more to prove, that they ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Whether were not ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants once to be admitted Members of the viſible Church, by the <hi>merciful gift</hi> and <hi>appointment of God,</hi> not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed?</p>
               <p>Were not Infants part of them that <hi>entered into Covenant</hi> with the Lord, that he might <hi>ſtabliſh them for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to himſelf, and might be to them a God? <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12, 13. And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 27.</note> were not Infants engaged to God by the Seal of his Covenant, <hi>[Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?]</hi> If you ſay, That this merciful gift of God to Infants, and ordinance for their Church-Memberſhip is repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does it not lie on you to prove it? yet how will you fail herein; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is eaſie to prove the contrary?</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If this Ordinance and merciful Gift be repealed and revoked, whether <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60979:22"/>
is it in Mercy, or in Juſtice? whether is it for their good, or for their hurt?</p>
               <p>Dare you ſay, that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed Infants Church-Memberſhip to <hi>their hurt, in juſtice?</hi> Did he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Mercies in Juſtice to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hurt, till they firſt brake Covenant with him, and ſo procured it by their own deſert? Now, were there not many <hi>Jews</hi> that believed, and did not forſake the Covenant of God? How then could theſe or their Infants, be put out of the Church in juſtice to their hurt?</p>
               <p>Or can you ſay, that it is in <hi>Mercy for their good?</hi> How can it be a mercy to take away a mercy, except it be to give a greater mercy inſtead of it? Now, is there any greater mercy given to Infants than <hi>Church-Memberſhip?</hi> Thoſe Infants which were in the Church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 99.</note> before Chriſt, had they not God enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Covenant to be their God, and to take them for his <hi>peculiar people, Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. And thoſe that were <hi>aliens to the Common-wealth of</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60979:22"/>
12. And is there any Scripture that ſpeaketh of delivering any from this ſad eſtate, but Church-Members? And when God <hi>addeth to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved,</hi> can it be any known way of mercy, to be caſt, or put out of the Church? Did Chriſt come in tho fleſh to put Infants out of his Church in mercy? Will you ſay, he could more fitly ſave them out of his Church, than in it? And if it be no benefit to the Catholick Church to have Infants <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 42.</note> kept out of Heaven, nor any hurt to the Church to ſee them there; why ſhould it be a benefit to the whole Church to have them kept out on Earth? or any hurt to the Church to ſee them Members here? And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it may be to ſtrangers, yet how can it ſeem ſuch a mercy to Parents, to have their Children put out of the Church? why then hath God made ſuch promiſes to Parents for their Seed; as if much of the Parents comfort lay in their Childrens Welfare? And hath God no mercy for Infants? or can he not ſhew mercy to the whole Church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>(v. epiſtle to</hi> Bewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>p.</hi> 7.)</note> in an eaſier way, than by caſting out all their Infants? What great comfort

               <p n="5">(5.) It hath been objected, that if it be the Will of Chriſt that Infants <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 115.</note> ſhould be Baptized, it is ſtrange, that he hath left it ſo dark. To which, will you not grant, that all Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt be admitted by Baptiſm? Is this dark or doubtful? And how many Scriptures are there that prove Infants muſt be admitted Church-members? Can we ſay, the Scripture is dark, or ſparing in that? Again, The Scripture ſpeaks moſt fully in the Controverſies, which in thoſe times were agitated: but was it any Controverſie then, whether Infants were to be Members of the viſible Church?

               <p>Further, what if it were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure than it is?

And is not the Goſpel to many, <hi>The Savour of Death unto Death, and to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs?</hi> And muſt the Goſpel be blamed for this? What is it that Wicked men will not take hurt by, and make an occaſion of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60979:32"/>
deluſion? If a Childs name be put into a Leaſe, is there any thing in this to do him hurt? 3. Was that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the deluſion, and groſs ignorance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they did not ſtay till they were at Age?

If it was an <hi>high favour</hi> to them to be entred in Infancy into the Church and Covenant, how comes it to be an hurt or wrong to us now? 4. Was the caſe of the Proſelites among the <hi>Jews</hi> (being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at age) ſo much better than the caſe of their own children, and of all the <hi>Jews</hi> and their children?

If all ſhould profeſs their Faith in Chriſt before they were entred, how quickly might the multitude learn <hi>ſuch a profeſſion,</hi> as none of you could reject upon any Scripture-ground? And might it not become cuſtomary, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and conſiſtent with great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? And they that will make no conſcience of the ſolemn Promiſe which their Parents made in their names, is it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60979:32"/>
likely that they will make ever the more Conſcience of it, if they had made it firſt in their own names; ſeeing the violation of either will alike forfeit their Salvation? 6. Do not Miniſters indeavour to take men off from ſuch formality and ſelf-deluſions? And let them know, that their meer Baptiſm (whether in Infancy, or at Age) is not ſufficient? 7. What if this were done, that when children come to Age, they muſt all ſolemnly, in the face of the Congregation <hi>perſonally</hi> own, and renew their Covenant? Why may not this engage them, as well as if they were Baptized then? Was every man that was <hi>Baptized at Age</hi> in the Apoſtles <note place="margin">

Would your way of Baptizing be likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men half ſo ſolemnly, as ſuch a courſe; it being ordinarily in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner private, and done in ſuch manner,

that perſons of modeſty will be ſo taken up with ſhame, that they will be leſs ſerious in the buſineſs.</p>

               <p>Now (having enquired about the grounds and proofs, and defence of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 125.</note> Church-memberſhip, and Baptiſm of Infants,) next let us ſee, whether your practice of <hi>delaying Baptiſm</hi> have as much warrant in Gods word.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Where do you find one word of <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> in all the Bible for deferring the Baptiſm of the Child of any one Chriſtian till years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

               <p n="2">(2.) Is not your way inconſiſtent with obedience to the Rule? Is it not Chriſts Rule, that perſons ſhall be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed without delay, when they are firſt made Diſciples? Doth not this appear in the <hi>Commiſſion, Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60979:33"/>
where Chriſt adjoyneth Baptizing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Diſcipling? And from <hi>conſtant example</hi> in Scripture, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commiſſion? Where do we find mention of any one perſon, that was Baptized long after being diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled? And from the <hi>end and uſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 127.</note> Is not this the uſe of Baptiſm, to be the ſign of their firſt Covenant with Chriſt, and ſolemn admiſſion into the Church? Then is it not to be uſed at their firſt Admiſſion? (If any reaſon of neceſſity or convenience, cauſe it to be put off a few days; yet this is not delaying it months and years, (as you do) though indeed there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture for any delay at all, but as neceſſity may excuſe it.) Now, though you yield the uſe of the ſign to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 341.</note> them when they come to Age, yet what is it but an empty ſign, quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Chriſts Inſtitution, and void of the true end of Baptiſm? for how can it then be the initiating ſign to thoſe that have been long in the Church before?

them when they are firſt Diſciples? And further, ſuppoſe this were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Infants are Diſciples, yet if you cannot know when ſuch children are firſt diſcipled (except it be in their Infancy) how can you Baptiſe them when they are firſt diſcipled? Taking diſcipleſhip at preſent in your own ſenſe, and ſetting aſide the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meer Relative Infant-diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how can you know it, ſince God uſeth to work ſuch as are born and brought up of Chriſtian Parents to the acknowledgment of Chriſt by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible degrees, that the beginning of their true acknowledgment is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily unperceivable? Again, ſeeing ſuch do not uſually know themſelves when they were firſt diſciples (in this ſenſe) how much leſs can others know it?</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Would not this practice (of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 130.</note> yours) neceſſarily fill the Church with perpetual contentions, as being about a matter, that cannot be determined by any known Rule? And can that be according to the mind and will of Chriſt? If the Goſpel occaſioneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, doth it any more than occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion them? But would not this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,

When would the Churches or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ever agree upon it, when their underſtanding, or ſeeming ſeriouſneſs is arrived at that degree, which muſt ſatisfie?

               <p n="4">(4.) When you pretend to ground your practice on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. from whence you would infer, that none are to be Baptiſed, but thoſe that are firſt made Diſciples by teaching, (though the truth is, that <hi>indirectly,</hi> and <hi>remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the diſcipling of the Parent, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipling of his ſeed alſo) would not your Doctrine turn Baptiſm, (for the moſt part) out of the Churches of the Saints? According to you, only they that are made diſciples by <hi>Miniſterial teaching directly,</hi> ſhould by this Rule
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60979:35"/>
be Baptized, and in a well-ordered godly Church would not theſe be few, or none? Taking <hi>[Diſciple]</hi> in your ſenſe for a Profeſſor of Chriſtianity, hath not God appointed another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, more ordinary way of making Diſciples of the children of the Godly, <hi>viz.</hi> godly education? Hath not God commanded the uſe of this means to all Parents, that they teach them the Law of God, and bring them up in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord</hi> from their childhood? And may we not conclude, that God appoints no means to be uſed, from which he will ordinarily withdraw his Grace, or to which he will deny his Bleſſing, if it be uſed aright? (though the Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert many that have neglected their <note place="margin">

                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 149.</note> many a <hi>diſtracted</hi> family is there in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (upon this account) where one will pray, and the other will not pray with him, becauſe he is unbaptized, who were wont to Worſhip God in unity?</p>
               <p>And here I would have ended. Only there are two or three Queries more which offer themſelves, that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your ſerious conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether it be at all credible <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 177.</note> that Satan would be ſo charitable to Believers Infants, as to plead for their priviledges; or would be a propagater of Chriſts Kingdom, and forward to engage and bring in Subjects and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whereas we tell ſinners of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 174.</note> hainous aggravation of their ſins, as being committed after Baptiſm, and after their ſolemn Vow and Covenant made to God; whether you that make Infant-Baptiſm a <hi>nullity,</hi> dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to bear the burthen of this Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation for them? And whether you may tell ſinners (that we do but ſerve
<pb facs="tcp:60979:39"/>
them, as ſome ſerve fooliſh children, Fright them with Bug-bears) that there is no ſuch matter, they were never Baptized, and therefore never ſinned againſt their Baptiſm: they were never ſo engaged to God, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned againſt that engagement? Will you warrant them, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver need to repent for their ſinning againſt their Baptiſm, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then made? Or will you bear the blame for them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether it ſhould not lie heavy on any tender conſcience to add <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 160.</note> to Gods Word, holding the repeal of the Ordinance of Infants Church-memberſhip, which no Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth; to be guilty of the Churches doleful Diviſions, and the great grief that hereby oppreſſeth the hearts of ſo many of Gods people; to cenſure (if not unchurch) all the Churches of Chriſt ſince the Apoſtles times, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all—? And all this in contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that your own children are out of Chriſts viſible Church? How doleful <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 161.</note> is it, that any Chriſtians ſhould be ſo zealous to diſpute their own children out of Chriſts Church; and to plead
<pb facs="tcp:60979:40"/>
that they have no right to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Members, that they are no Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt, no Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>And whether they that are zealous <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. p.</hi> 177.</note> in ſolliciting men not to engage their Children in Covenant with God, may not have as many thanks from Chriſt, as the Diſciples had for keeping ſuch from him?</p>
