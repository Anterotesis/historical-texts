            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are few or none (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) even among the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but underſtand that Republique or Kingdom to be moſt happy, that lives moſt peaceably: Yet what doth moſt conduce to the Welfare and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of King and People, hath been long debated by the Ancient as well as Modern Philoſophers, and Politicians.</p>
            <p>Some are of opinion, that good Laws work and frame the people to a civil life; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think it lies in the power of good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation: ſome imagine that it proceeds from the Influence and Operation of the Stars upon ſublunary Bodies; and others, from the Endeavors and Examples of good Kings. To the laſt, we ſubſcribe: for the peace and tranquillity of a Nation proceeds primarily from the ſplendor of Princely <gap reason="illegible" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>rtues; which are ſo glorious and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
<pb facs="tcp:110845:3"/>
that they do not onely incite the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to gaze on them, but with an extaſied admiration, to adore and affect them, ſo that they are ſtimulated to an imitation, as far as in them lies: and when Prince and People mutually labour in the purſuit of Vertue <hi>(pro viribus,</hi> as we ſay) according to the utmoſt extent of their ability, how can there chuſe but be a reſult of Unanimity, Peace and Concord? To perfect this, 'tis requiſite that a Senate be elected; which is a certain number of grave, wiſe, diſcreet Perſons, that may help their Soveraign to pull in or ſlacken the reins of Government, according as 'tis judg'd convenient; by the Nobility of whoſe Perſons, and the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of whoſe Conſultations, married to the Judgement of the King, the quiet and glory of the People is infinitely promoted and preſerved. To which intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we have here deciphered <hi>A SAGE SENATOR,</hi> with all qualifications ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Perfection; his Office, Duty, Honour, Preferment and Repute among the Ancients, as well as thoſe of latter Ages; firſt aſſerting, and then proving their neceſſity, and the benefit that accrews to a Kingdom or Republike from their grave and ſerious Debates in Counſel, and
<pb facs="tcp:110845:3"/>
their induſtrious management of political Affairs. By ſuch Union between King and Council, Prince and People; the whole Nation will undoubtedly flouriſh with a perpetual Verdure, as if an immortal peace were entail'd upon them and their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ever; Laws will have their full force and efficacie, as well for the puniſhment of Malefactors, as the Reward of honourable deſerving Perſons: Juſtice will run in its proper current, and not be diverted to ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and baſe ends, by lucre or ſelf-intereſt; two Hammers that are able to knock a Kingdom in pieces. Learning will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and the Learned promoted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merit and deſert: without this, no Kingdom can ſtand; take away the Pen, and the Pike will be unneceſſary. 'Twas the Saying of a potent Monarch, That, <hi>He received more benefit from his dead, then living Counſellours;</hi> intimating thereby, that his Library did afford him better Counſel then his Senate. Learning and Senators, like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable; they cannot dwell aſunder; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in ſuch a one as is here deſcribed. And though I am ſufficiently ſenſible, that a diſcourſe of thoſe Qualities that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Perfect Politician, is, not onely
<pb facs="tcp:110845:4"/>
a work of great Importance, but attended by a Troop of oppoſing Difficulties: Yet I have endeavored to diſplay the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the moſt famous Kingdoms, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques and States Popular, according to the Statutes, Laws and Cuſtoms of the moſt potent, as well as prudent Monarchs. And my hope is, (though my imbecility can lay no claim to merit) that my earneſt deſire to promote the publick good, will plead my excuſe; and I am confident, there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is unprejudiced, if commonly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but will accept of my humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs; which is the very highth of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Deſires; who at this preſent hath no more to ſay, but bid thee, Reader,</p>

But to begin: Man, the perfection of the Creation, was not made a Citizen or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of this World only, but Lord Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount over all Creatures that have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the compaſs of the terreſtrial Globe: This authority and dignity was conferred upon him by the ſupreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Heaven and earth, who hath deſcended ſo far below his ſacred Self, as to make him his Co-partner in Government, adorning him with divine underſtanding; to the intent, that the Scepter of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Empire may be ſwayed by his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Counſel. The cauſe of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of Government between God and Man, proceeds from Reaſon; which being perfect, makes Man capable of imitating Almightineſs; ſo that it appears, there is a kind of near alliance or conſanguinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creator and the Creature, who ſometimes is made God's Vicegerent upon earth: yet without divine aſſiſtance, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or counſel can be termed good, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For, the ſeed of this glimmering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a Deity planted in Man, if it light on fertile ground, and that happen to meet with good culture, produceth a crop according to the expectation of the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Planter; otherwiſe, it is like corn
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110845:7"/>
caſt into a barren ſoyl; whoſe product is nothing but brambles, thorns, or thiſtles. Thus then Man being reduced to a ſenſe or feeling of thoſe ſparks of divinity that lie latent in him, ſhould be wrought to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that he hath the Character or <hi>Idaea</hi> of a Deity in his mind; the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Creator's holy Image ſtamped on his ſoul; and ought thereupon to be ſo induſtrious in the employment of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the management of his affairs, that his actions may ſpeak him worthy, in ſome ſenſe, of ſo heavenly a favour beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him. Yet, though he be made God's aſſociate (as it were) he muſt return him the glory, to whom it properly and primarily belongs; and acknowledge all authority to flow from him, as from the Fountain: For, as brute Animals are not governed by Animals, but by an Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; no more can Man rule or govern Man, without the aſſiſtance and protection of Providence divine. And ſhould any man be ſo ſordidly ignorant, or atheiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophane, as to undertake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Country or Nation, without divine knowledge or aſſiſtance; it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that that State, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or Kingdom, and every Member
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110845:7"/>
thereof, be implunged into an Ocean of miſery and infelicity: For, it is in vain to build upon the imagined welfare of a State, or Kingdom, if God be not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and Patron thereof. It is then as conſpicuous as the Meridian Sun, that all vertue, wiſdom and goodneſs owes its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to God; which did inſtigate the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind, or rather pure-blind Heathen, that had only the ruſh-candle of Nature, to conſecrate publike Temples to Vertue, Faith, Concord, Wiſdom, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>Ovid</hi> the Ethnick durſt be ſo bold, well may we then <hi>à fortiori</hi> affirm, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<q>
                        <l>Eſt Deus in nobis, agitante caleſcimus illo;</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is therefore our duty to endeavour the deſerving a more noble title than that of meer Man, and ſtrenuouſly to labour in the purſuit of Underſtanding, that flies a higher pitch, than either humanity or morality dare aſpire unto; that ſo, if poſſible, we may ſurpaſs all our Anceſtors, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dictates of that which hath the greateſt ſupremacy in us, <hi>viz.</hi> Reaſon; by vertue whereof, we are made ſenſible

                     </gap>, embrace that which is good, and avoid what is evill: this is that which endows a man with the qualifications of Wiſdom, Valour, and Juſtice; by this we are able to diſcern, that the terreſtrial Globe is wheel'd about by divine wiſdom; it is this that makes a man Noble, a <hi>Hero:</hi> which was the reaſon that the Lacedaemonians impoſed the title of Gods upon thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that were judged to move in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſphear of underſtanding; <hi>homines de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liore luto;</hi> men of a more noble allay, than dull mud-wall'd man can boaſt of: Nay, <hi>Homer</hi> deifies <hi>Hector</hi> in this enſuing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich:

So that we may maintain (without being Paradoxical) that that man, who is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſolid reaſon in all his words and actions, is <hi>quaſi ſemi-deus inter mortales;</hi> a Demi-god among men.</p>
                  <p>Now, of ſuch repute is a Sage Senator, or grave Couſellor; who hath reaſon for his Cynoſure, and wiſdom his coadjutreſs in all undertakings. Such perſons are ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110845:8"/>
neceſſary in a Commonwealth, that they can by no means be omitted or left out: For, the King being but a ſingle perſon, cannot have an eye unto all the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Kingdom; beſides, ſomtimes it happens, that he is ſeduced from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of reaſon, by yeilding to his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſlackning the reins of his appetite and licentiouſneſs; and the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being ignorant, is altogether uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that underſtanding, or knowledge. Yet the Senate, elected according to the Law of the Land, and compacted or made up of vertuous, ſober, grave, diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, do from their place, as from a <hi>Pharos,</hi> or Watch-tower, look about them, and provide all things requiſite for the diſcreet and well regulating of the State wherein they live; preventing all mutinies, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſſentions that the rebellious rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble durſt any waies attempt: Of ſuch great uſe and neceſſity are they, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the King, but the people alſo; like unto the vital part of mans ſoul, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the heart, enliveneth and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that which partakes of Reaſon, and is ſituated in the head: and a Monarch that is guided by the advice and counſel of a grave Senate, rules his Kingdom prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110845:9"/>
and governs it diſcreetly. For, as reaſon in all her proceedings, makes uſe of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſenſes; yet ſhe alone deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and deſerves the greateſt honour and eſteem: ſo a Prince, though he admit of Counſel, is to be judged the wiſeſt; and is uncontroulable in all his actions: for it is a Maxim among us, that <hi>The King can do no wrong.</hi> And as the hand diſtinguiſhed into fingers is thereby ſtrengthned, and made the more apt to lay hold on any thing; ſo he that governeth with the aid and aſſiſtance of Counſel, ſhall manage all affairs with the greater conſideration and prudence. Their original did proceed from the benefit that it was imagined would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to the Commonwealth, whereof they were members, by their counſel: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they, that firſt aſſembled men into Cities, who before like Savages, ranged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the woods, and inhabited the deſarts diſperſedly, without either Law or Order, firſt gained the Title of Kings; yet that courſe alone could not make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the dutiful Allegiance they owed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Soveraign: wherefore perceiving, that when they were civilized, and reduced from their brutality, the authority of a ſingle Perſon was not of ſufficiency to curb
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110845:9"/>
and check them in the full career of their exorbitancies, they judged it convenient to have aſſiſtance from ſerious and grave Counſellors: which we find performed by <hi>Romulus</hi> the <hi>Proto-baſileus,</hi> or firſt King of the Romans; who ſuppoſing the Government of a ſingle Perſon without a Senate to be perilous and unſafe, made a Convocation of 100 Senators, who out of reſpect to their gray heads, and grave underſtandings, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name of <hi>Patres. Theopompus</hi> alſo, King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> trod the ſame path; For, he conſtituted the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and inveſted them with eminent authority: whereat his wife being offended, was ſo pragmatical as to tell him, That he had derogated from his dignity, and clipt the wing of his enſuing Poſterity, by diminiſhing their authority and ſupremacy: But he replied, like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, That the Counſel and gravity of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would fortifie his Kingdom, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Bulwark againſt the impious machinations and plots of rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Whereby it is apparent, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs firſt embraced Counſellors out of neceſſity: and all rational men are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that thoſe State-tranſactions are moſt firm and ſolid, that are digeſted by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a Parliament, ere they come to a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110845:10"/>
publike birth. Now, I call that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Senate, which by Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the general conſent of the whole Nation, is freely elected, and conſtituted, to adviſe and govern the State; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a Senator, or Parliament-man, is one lawfully choſen into the number of thoſe that are authorized to ſit at the helm, and ſteer the Ship of State. And it hath ever been obſerved, that they were alwaies the moſt grave, diſcreet, and noble ſort of Subjects; becauſe there is no Society of Men, or Nation, how barbarous and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſoever, but will voluntarily and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſent, that the Government ſhould be impoſed upon, and reſt in thoſe perſons that are vertuous; and think it juſt and reaſonable to obey them. Nor are there any ſo fit to govern, as the ancient, experienced, which are uſually choſen; becauſe others, either through want of maturity or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are uſually withdrawn by their juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile phancies, and recreations, from ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places of authority: but a grave Counſellor is not diſturbed or diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with extravagant affections, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by appetite, or inveigled by youth; but by Reaſon directed, by Counſel fortified, and by Age made perfect. And further,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110845:10"/>
Philoſophers maintain, that in all things there are three degrees; Great, Small, and Indifferent: And that is judged the moſt perfect, that participates of either, and ſtands in an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> between two: Now, the Senator ſtanding as a mean or moderator between the King and People, the Monarch and his Subjects; may be the more intimately acquainted with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all things; and ſtudy what is the Office of a King, and the duty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of a Subject; with the Rights, Properties, Liberties, and Laws appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to both; and ſo adviſe them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that the King may not turn tyrannical for want of Counſel, nor the people tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the bounds of a moderate becoming liberty: Therefore he muſt of neceſſity be a man of excellent endowments, a clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and a piercing underſtanding, to dive into the intricacies of Government. <hi>Scipio</hi> ſaith, That as the end of Mariners, and their laborious endeavours, tends to a ſafe arrival into the intended Haven; the Phyſicians skill and art is employed for the recovering and preſerving health in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered Patients; and the Captains va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour levels at victory: So the happineſs of Subjects, their glory, life, and liberty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110845:11"/>
ſhould be the <hi>ſumma totalis,</hi> or chiefeſt end that our Counſellor ſhould aime at; all which he muſt labour to preſerve, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and augment, by his induſtry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to the utmoſt extent of his ability; and leave no ſtone unturned for the benefit of the Republick, of which he is a Member. Nor is it my deſign here in this Treatiſe to broach any new-fangled opinion, like thoſe that are hatcht in the brains of our Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Regicides; or to phancie a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or make my brain the womb or <hi>Idaea</hi> of an Utopian Counſellor, that can only be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, and not found <hi>in eſſe</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> did in his Commonwealth, and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) but my diſcourſe ſhall tend to, and end in a relation and deſcription of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have liv'd heretofore, and <hi>citra omnis controverſiae aleam,</hi> may be hereafter. And as divine <hi>Plato</hi> compoſed, and reduced all thoſe things into order, that might conduce to the felicity of his City, or Republick; the ſame courſe will we take in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our Counſellor: wherefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf to be arrived at, or come to ſome famous <hi>Emporium,</hi> or <hi>Piazza;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all perſons, of all Nations, Countries and Cities repair; and we will diſrobe every ſingle perſon of ſome Vertue, Law,

Cuſtome, or Qualification, that ſhall ſeem moſt advantagious and beneficial to our enterprize; and therewith make up our Sage Senator, Grave Counſellor, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Politician: that they, who for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are inveſted with ſuch eminent digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and authority, may imitate our Senator, and endeavour to be adorned with theſe enſuing qualifications.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing more clear, than that the Supreme Power, among many other gifts, hath conferr'd that of Reaſon upon Man, to the end that by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he may pry into the nature of Coeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as well as Terreſtrial bodies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by honour, reverence, and adore the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>Now, he that is ſenſible of the gifts of God, and the benefits of Nature; and doth, both by contemplation and action, employ this ſupernatural gift, ſlowly Apes the Deity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110845:12"/>
and thereby reſembles him, as much as comes within the compaſs of mortality. But, they that contrary to Nature, and the end of their Creation, indulge their geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, delighting themſelves in ſenſuality, neglecting, or totally deſerting Reaſon; <hi>Facie tantum homines ſunt, non animo:</hi> carry only the outward aſpect or complexion of a Man; becauſe they are deſtitute of his more noble endowments.</p>
                  <p>Hence ariſeth the variety of mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and diſpoſitions, or rather conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for, ſome are born Free, Noble, Wiſe, and with an aptitude to govern; others, Vaſſals, Ruſticks, Ideots, predeſtinated to ſervitude and bondage: All Societies of men, being willing and ready to ſubmit to the Government of the more grave and wiſe; promoting, and accumulating ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours on them, and Offices, with reverence and reſpect ſuitable to their deſerving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion, that God in mans firſt Creation, did by his omniſcience ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that in the generation of thoſe that are deſtin'd and adapted to govern, he hath diſtill'd ſome drams of gold in their compoſition; and in them that are to aſſiſt Kings and Superiours by their deliberate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110845:12"/>
counſel, and mature advice, ſilver; but the Nature of Peaſants and Mechanicks is tempered with Braſs and Iron. Which ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude the Philoſopher extends to the manners, nature, and capacitie of man.</p>
                  <p>For, although every man naturally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the iſſue of his loyns may reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him; yet ſometimes, though ſeldom, it happens contrary to his expectation: for Gold ſometimes produceth Silver, a more inferiour metal. Therefore it is requiſite, that a Prince ſhould be capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the natural diſpoſition and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Royal Off-ſpring, that their Iron may be converted into the Gold of a more noble diſpoſition: but, if neither good Education, Documents nor Precepts can operate upon their inclinations, ſo as to cauſe a Metamorphoſis, or Tranſmutation; the Government muſt be transferr'd to thoſe, whoſe wiſdome renders them more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For, it hath been prognoſticated, and the event hath been experimentally known to ſucceed according to the Prediction; That they that are ruled by ignorant, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Governours, come to ruine, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and confuſion. To prevent all which misfortunes, it is requiſite, that our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor be a natural Subject of that place or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110845:13"/>
Country where he governeth; no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner: of the ſame Country, becauſe that birth and being do not only oblige, but induce a man to believe, that it is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, juſt, and requiſite for him to ſpend his bloud in defence thereof, when occaſion is offered: <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum eſt pro patria mori;</hi> It is a ſweet and comely thing to die for ones Country. And how can it be that any man, of what conſtitution ſoever, ſhould not affect that place wherein his Parents, Neighbours, Friends, and Allies reſide; and that Country to which he is indebted for his Life, Name, and Honour, and every thing elſe that is either for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or neceſſity? <hi>Non nobis enim nati ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> (ſaith the Orator) <hi>ſed patriae;</hi> Our Country challengeth the greateſt part of us. And it is moſt certain, that Nature hath ſo deeply rooted the affection to their native place in the mind of man, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any good Subject timorous, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to lay down his life, and hazard his fortunes in her defence, if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Nay, it hath been ſo prevalent, that the moſt impious and unnatural perſons, that endeavoured the ſubverſion of the place of their nativity, the very ſight of their native ſoyl hath prevented their cruel
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110845:13"/>
enterprize. <hi>Veturia</hi> did diſſwade her Son <hi>Martius</hi> befieging <hi>Rome,</hi> only by reducing to his memory the love and reſpect he ought to bear to his natural Country; branding him with the name of impious and audacious, for being ſo highly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as to diſturb the quiet of that City wherein he was begot and educated; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unmindful of his Wife, Children, and friends that remained there. So no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table was the piety of <hi>Veturia</hi> to her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and no leſs was that of her Son in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving it; which had been ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to him at that time, through the cruelty of the Tribunes perſecuting the Nobility. <hi>Sertorius</hi> alſo entreated <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> to endeavour the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of his revocation; alledging, that he took it for a greater piece of honour to have the name of an obſcure Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, than that of Emperour in any other place of the habitable World. Well then might <hi>Naſo</hi> ſing,

The Obligation that devoteth and bindeth us to our Country, is great, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110845:14"/>
becauſe our goods, perſons and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are therein contained. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (as it is reported by divine <hi>Plato)</hi> judged it a crime of as deep a dye, to be guilty of ingratitude to the place of ones nativity, as to ones own Mother, to whom we are indebted for being: Nor can there be an offence ſo hainous, but the affection to our native Country ſhould allay and mitigate. Our Counſellor muſt be of natural birth: no Forreiner; becauſe their counſel or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is thought and accounted ſuſpicious and dangerous; which was the reaſon that mov'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> not only to exclude ſtrangers from their Council, but to drive them out of their Cities, leſt they ſhould aſpire at the dignity of Magiſtracy, and inſtigate or work upon the minds of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, ſo as to perſwade them to Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo mutation of Laws, Cuſtoms and manners might enſue, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seditions and Rebellions. Which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod the Venetians have diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; for, it is their ſtudy and their whole induſtry, to prevent their ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in Council, leſt they intruding under a falſe name or title, ſhould arrive to dignity and eminency in the Republick. Beſides, it is requiſite he be of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110845:14"/>
begotten of honeſt Parents; becauſe honeſt parents produce honeſt children, for the moſt part. He muſt be of the number of noble and free Citizens, who aſſumes his title from that Nobility that owes its original to Vertue; which he may partly challenge as his own, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as his Anceſtors. They therefore that are nobilitated and adorned with their own peculiar vertues, as well as with thoſe of their Predeceſſors, merit eſteem, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, honour and fame, above all others, and are to be highly reverenced; and the reaſon is, becauſe that Vertuous and good Parents, have a generous, good, vertuous and noble Iſſue: according to the Lyrick Poet,
<q>
                        <l>Fortes fortibus creantur, &amp; bonis,</l>
                        <l>Eſt in jumentis, eſt in equis Patrum</l>
                        <l>Virtus, nec imbellem feroces</l>
                        <l>Progenerant aquilae columbam.</l>
                     </q>
Now (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth) that perſon that comes of a noble race, is the ſtem of a noble ſtock, and hath the affluence of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune accompanied with Vertue, hath arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the apex or perfection, the very Quinteſſence of true Nobility. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110845:15"/>
it is a rarity to find one perſon ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them all; Vertue alone can by her own right and property <hi>nobilitare viros.</hi> As for revenues, large acres, ſpecious &amp; ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mannors, but no manners, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that we challenge from our Anceſtors, without vertue, they are ſo far from being ornaments, that they prove a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a ſtain to the Owner. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons render the name of their Predeceſſors obſcure; And through the vices of their Poſterity, are entombed in the grave of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion: Therefore it is better to aſcend the top of Nobility by a man's own vertue (ſaith the fluent Orator) than to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the opinion conceived of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; becauſe the Beginner of Nobility deſerves moſt praiſe and applauſe. He that is the off-ſpring of a noble Family, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves honour and eſteem undoubtedly, with this proviſo, that he make it the Butt and End of his Endeavours and Induſtry, to equal, if not excel, the Vertues of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Predeceſſors, and to gain unto himſelf more vertuous and glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. And infinitely are they to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that do ſo; for they are ſo far from obſcuring the Fame and Renown of their Fore-fathers, that they add a moſt reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

luſtre: to it by their own vertue yet verdant and bloſſoming. The Law of the <hi>Rhodians</hi> is worthy of commendation; for they enacted, that thoſe children that did lead a debauched life, not imitating the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their Parents, ſhould be utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, and their Lands by a Deed of gift freely diſpoſed of to the moſt vertuous of the Race or Family. It is an office of piety, to leave unto Poſterity a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our gratitude and thankfulneſs to our Anceſtors, whoſe heirs we are, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their external ſubſtance, (the goods of fortune, I mean) but of their virtue, glory, and renown: which is the true inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and the beſt of all terrene poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, 'tis not a ſtately Building hung within with coats of Arms, and badges of the honour of others, nor the vaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable pieces of Land belonging thereunto, but Vertue, that Nobilitates; As <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſings,

Moreover, as the exerciſe of our qualities is various, ſo are the degrees of Nobility.

And as in every Republick there are two kinds of Time, the one of Peace, and the other of War: ſo the Citizens are of two ſorts; the one fitted for Peace, and the other adapted for War: The former by Arms doth enlarge the Territories and bounds of his native Country, or at leaſt defend them from the invaſion of forraign enemies; the other by wiſe counſel and grave advice doth rule and preſerve it inviolable. Wherefore, a Commonwealth ſhould be compoſed of theſe two ſorts of men: for, as in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and proceedings of State-affairs, action followeth conſultation, and is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to it; ſo thoſe perſons, by whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture counſel and deliberate advice the Commonwealth was quietly, peaceably and diſcreetly governed, were of greater eſteem than thoſe that enlarged the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines thereof by War and Arms. <hi>Homer,</hi> the Prince of Graecian Poets, produceth <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> ſaying, He could ſooner ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and ſubjugate the City of <hi>Troy</hi> by the advice of ten <hi>Neſtors</hi> or <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> than by the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110845:17"/>
valour of twice as many <hi>Ajaces</hi> or <hi>Achilles. Pyrrhus</hi> likewiſe was heard to uſe this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion frequently, That <hi>Cineas</hi> by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence had won more Cities, than he with all his men of War had ever conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But, he that excelleth in wiſdom and martial knowledge, deſerves the Crown and honour above all: and though, as we ſaid before, it is Vertue that makes a man Noble, without the additional riches of Fortune; yet it is requiſite our Counſellor ſhould be wealthy; becauſe thereby he may be able to ſupply his Country, if compelled to wage war; for money is the ſinews and ſtrength of war. But good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> is the baſis and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolid wiſdom and prudence. It is therefore requiſite, that from their tender years they be inſtructed in all things that conduce to the accompliſhment of man, <hi>è cunabulis,</hi> as we ſay, even from the cradle and ſwathing clouts, for then are they moſt apt to imbibe and ſuck in the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Precepts that ſhall be exhibited unto them: for then <hi>anima eſt quaſi tabula raſa,</hi> like a blank or piece of clean white paper, capable of any vertuous or noble impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as it behoveth a Republick to be ſtored with knowing Subjects, ſo ought
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110845:18"/>
they to be diligent in their education, and provide them good Tutors, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, and chalk them out the way of Vertue. For, as a good husbandman dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently pruneth his plants, and loppeth off the ſuperfluous branches, when the ſeaſon requires it, that they may grow the faſter; ſo the Commonwealth, that may juſtly be termed the Parent and houſewiſe of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ought to be extraordinary diligent to provide for the careful and vertuous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth, by lopping off the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous branches of vice, and engrafting them on the ſtock of Vertue. The <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> uſed to elect Magiſtrates out of the number of their grave, wiſe and ſober Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and call them publike Tutors, which might ſerve to educate and train up their younglings; and were alwaies reverenced by them, being judged vertuous men in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and well skill'd in military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. And the ancient Romans were as ſtrict and careful in this point of educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Lacedaemonians. <hi>Cato</hi> was ſo diligent in the nurture and education of his Son, that he diſdained not to receive him into his tuition, and take him into his pupillage or guardianſhip as ſoon as ever ripeneſs of age had fitted him for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110845:18"/>
And although at that very time he kept <hi>Chilo</hi> the Grammarian, and one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in that art, in his houſe, to inſtruct his Children, yet he had not permiſſion to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, but that was left to the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Father. Beſides, he diſdained to be engaged to a School-maſter for the inſtruction of his Children altogether; wherefore he taught them the Laws, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Cuſtomes of his own as well as other Nations; as alſo, how to dart, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his Arms, ſwim, (which was ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much in eſteem; for, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> when he would ſet forth an abſolute <hi>Dulman</hi> or <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

He never ſpake any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean or paſſionate word before his Son, but was as circumſpect in his language, as if the Veſtal Virgins or Prieſts were in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; obſerving that ancient rule,

And this was the oeconomique or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique diſcipline of <hi>Cato,</hi> and of the major part of the Romans, eſpecially of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, in the education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. In like manner the Philoſophers of <hi>Greece</hi> compoſed plaies for the inſtruction of youth; which is preſerved to this very day among us, (though that cuſtome for ſome years was almoſt obſolete and out of requeſt.) Nor were they only capable of indoctrinating, or laying down the tenets that are neceſſary to a happy and good life, but they were of ability to inſtruct in the Laws and manner of Government: Yea, this our preſent Age hath ſome Seminaries of Learning and Vertue (according to the Graecian cuſtome) the Univerſities of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> (though lately ready to expire, and almoſt demoliſhed by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, who hated all book-learning (as they term it) becauſe their crimes were ſo hainous, that they went beyond the mercy of the book.) Hither Youth might reſort, as unto a Harveſt of Science and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and might reap a crop of Vertue and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110845:19"/>
good Diſcipline. But it were to be wiſh'd, that the Doctors and Tutors in our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities would inſtruct their Pupils in the art of living, and not diſputing well altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for, ſo might they deſerve prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Commonwealth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from all ſolid perſons,) and not take more delight in hearing a Praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricator or Jeſter, than a ſolid Philoſopher. In ancient times, Philoſophers enjoyned their Pupils ſilence, and taught it alſo; but our modern wits teach them only to talk or diſcourſe; which is the reaſon the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is filled with ſo many worded Orators, and prating Philoſophers.

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> with whoſe Fame the whole World hath ecchoed, had their primitive education in Schools of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature; and many others, which I omit. Thus it is apparent, that men ought to be trained up in Schools, that ſo they may be inſtructed in the Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: wherefore it ought to be the care of every State, Republick and Kingdom, that their Seminaries of Learning be as well furniſhed and ſtored with Vertues, as the Citizens ſhops are with wares and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Now then, we ſee that good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation is requiſite, and accompliſheth our Senator. Beſides, he muſt have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Vertue; for if not, his evill diſpoſition will hardly be bettered by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy: for, the nature of man prompts him to evill; and he finding himſelf ſtrengthned with the Science of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, is more expert, and gains more skill to palliate and plead for his bad actions: for the beſt of Sciences poſſeſſed by a man of an evil diſpoſtion, is depraved, and, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to its own nature, is a help to, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of evill counſel. So that it may be maintained, that good inſtruction beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon an evill nature, is oftentimes ill employed, and ineffectual. Though it is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110845:20"/>
moſt certain, that Education prevails much with tender years, changing it from vice, and molding it according to the form of Vertue. <hi>Diogenes</hi> being demanded, How a man might lead a peaceable and quiet life; Replied, firſt, He muſt fear the Deity, who is the Author of all felicity. Secondly, He muſt beſtow good education on his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the want whereof makes them ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and diſreſpectful to their aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thirdly, He muſt avoid ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his friends, which of all crimes is the moſt odious and comprehenſive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining within it ſelf a whole bundle of offences. <hi>Ingratum dixeris, &amp; omnia dixeris.</hi> Mention but Ingratitude, and you have epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized all ſins in a word. Moreover, it is neceſſary that Children be inſtructed in the rudiments of Grammar, Rhetorick and Logick, whereby they may underſtand the property of ſpeech, and the excellency thereof, as alſo defend it by argumentation. Thus may he underſtand the Art of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which is perfected by uſe, diſcourſe, and ſurveying the works of Poets and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators; and being thus inſtructed, he will ſhake off thoſe petty inconſiderable things that are underſtood by every mean capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and take into conſideration matters of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110845:21"/>
greater weight and importance. And the mind, beginning to know her ſelf, ſeeks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the true food and nouriſhment that will ſatisfie and content her, which is Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; of which in this enſuing Chapter.</p>

                  <head>The knowledge of Arts and Sciences required in Senators; and particularly, that of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</head>
                  <p>PHiloſophy is the food and medicine of the mind, affording it Vertue as Aliment, and healing all ſorts of maladies and diſturbances that are incident thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, making a perfect path-way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The reaſon is, becauſe that then the mind ſhaketh on the terrene incumbranees that uſually clog the body, and meditates upon things Divine and Coeleſtial. This knowledge of Philoſophy is of two ſorts; the one conſiſts in the ſubtilty of Nature, and is ſubject to the univerſal contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all men: The other demonſtrateth and laies down the true inſtitution of men and manners, ſhewing how Republicks and Kingdoms ought to be regulated, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110845:21"/>
private Families ordered. To the firſt theſe parts of Philoſophy belong: Phyſicks or natural Philoſophy, Metaphyſicks or Divinity, and the Mathematicks; and to the other, Ethicks, Politicks and Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks. Nor is the <hi>finis</hi> or end of theſe two ſorts of Philoſophy altogether diſcrepant, ſince they both tend to the perfection of man: yet in this they differ, that the one endeavours it by Contemplation, and the other by Action; the one by Theory, and the other by Practice; whereof a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble felicity doth ariſe, the one private, and the other publike. Now, thoſe that place felicity in the exerciſe of vertue for the good of the Republick, the more publike it be, the more praiſe-worthy it is judged; becauſe a multitude receives benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and not one ſingle perſon. Yet we are neceſſitated and compelled to confeſs, that contemplation on felicity hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminency, becauſe it inſtructs in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal efficient cauſes of all things and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. God alſo without action, by his perpetual and divine contemplation and preſcience, foreſeeing all things, doth by his own example move Philoſophers to prefer divine contemplation before all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane action and felicity. That Philoſophy
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110845:22"/>
is neceſſary in a Senator, for the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure management of State-affairs, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what follows. Philoſophy is the eternal, immortal gift of the Creator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing us in the knowledge of all things both divine and humane; as alſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vertue and vice: ſo that he that (as in a glaſs) peeps therein, and then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and meditates upon it, ſhall ſee the forms, <hi>Idaea's</hi> and Images of all things; and perceive a reſemblance or repreſentation both of body and mind. It was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without cauſe ſtyled by fluent <hi>Cicero,</hi> Univerſal knowledge, the conduct of life, the ſearcher of vertue, the expeller of vice, and the <hi>Panacea,</hi> or health of the Soul. For indeed, there is nothing in the world to be thought or acted, either in Court or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of great or ſmall importance, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Philoſophy, as the Nurſe of all conſultations, actions, and reſolutions: which if you make your rule to walk by, all your words and actions will be judged ſober, wiſe, diſcreet, and in all reſpects perfect, as far as man can be. For, in what Country ſoever the People have a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to their Prince, or one that is counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Philoſophers; war, diſcord, or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is ſeldome found. But, methinks I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110845:22"/>
hear ſome Phanatick lay this Objection in my way, as a ſtumbling-block to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Doſt thou imagine, Sir Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher (that's as good as Mr Doctor, an uſual phraſe among them) that the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Kingdoms and Republicks, or the wiſdom of Kings and Governours proceeds from thy lazy idle diſcipline? (Raſh, illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate fellows, they never conſider that the ſweat of the brains is greater than the ſweat of the brow) whenas that Art is but a meer juggling, prating ſcience; not that knowledge whereby men arrive to their intended felicity. How canſt thou be ſo impudent (the Omer of reſpect they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to every one is Thou and Thee; and if it lay in their power, they would take away two as neceſſary Pronouns, Thine and Mine) as to dare to infect the Kingdom (Commonwealth, I ſhould have ſaid; for the name of King is enough to fright them into convulſion-fits) with that that will prove the ruine and deſtruction of it? For, as thou haſt filled the Schools with debate and contention, ſo wilt thou rend the ſtate with diviſions; and though it may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued out in the Univerſity without blows, yet canſt thou think, that it will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a Commonwealth without the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110845:23"/>
effuſion of bloud? How ſhall the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Republick be maintained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Philoſophers, whoſe opinions carry ſo much variety, dubiouſneſs, and diametrical oppoſition? Which of all the Philoſophical Sects ſhall our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth be guided by; the Platoniſt, Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick, Stoick, Cynick, or Epicure? Now, they that differ about the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> do they not diſſent in the ſubſtance of Philoſophy? Therefore I am clearly of opinion, That they who relie ſolely on Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, are rather to be excluded than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to govern in any State or Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick whatſoever. Is it conſentaneous to reaſon, that he ſhould be a Legiſlator, that approves of no Law, but what is of his own preſcription, relying wholly upon his own reaſon, or rather phancie and opinion; conceiting all perſons, himſelf excepted, brutiſh and irrational? Is not this the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and diſpoſition of your philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal crew? Did <hi>Diogenes, Zeno,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus</hi> ever deſerve to ſit at the Helm of State? To which I reply; There are two ſorts of Philoſophers whom I judge altogether unfit to govern: the firſt are they that have only had a ſmack of Philoſophy, ſo that the thirſting heat of their vitious
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110845:23"/>
deſires and appetites is not quenched by vertue; and they themſelves lead lives quite contrary to the Precepts of Philoſophy, for want of good ground and ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in that Science. Another ſort of Philoſophers there is, quite contrary to the forementioned, who having <hi>à tenera aetate,</hi> from their very youth been converſant with Philoſophers, and ſtudied Philoſophy, do waſte away their daies in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative part only: ſuch kind of Philoſophy, which conduceth not to the emolument &amp; benefit of the Commonwealth or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is altogether improfitable. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be learned, wiſe, and have turned over moſt Authors, and can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all their Precepts and rules; yet they applying their minds to contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not being experienced in civill affairs, are unfit for Government. Now theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Philoſophers are juſtly called <hi>Sapientes,</hi> but they are not <hi>prudentes;</hi> as Geometricians, Mathematicians, and all the Society of natural Philoſophers. In like manner <hi>Diogenes, Zenocrates, Chryſippus, Carneades, Democritus, Metrocles, Ariſtippus, Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Thales,</hi> were wiſe men, and of profound knowledge; but not prudent; becauſe their manner of wiſdom and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110845:24"/>
did prompt them to recreate and content themſelves in obſcure, ſecret and hidden matters, contrary to the nature of prudence: and though theſe Sciences in themſelves are good and commendable, yet are they impertinent and unprofitable to the State, when kept cloſe to themſelves, and not employed for the publick good. Now, prudence conſiſts in thoſe things that require deliberation and counſel: yet, if thoſe contemplative Philoſophers had not debarr'd themſelves from humane Society and converſation, but ſought after em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in publike affairs, as <hi>Pericles, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Lycurgus, Plato, Demosthenes, Cato, Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and others did, they had no doubt been men of incomparable wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which <hi>Socrates</hi> (though herein he contradict <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> ſtyles the only vertue; meaning (as I conceive, with ſubmiſſion to more mature judgements) that no vertue can be or continue without it. <hi>Bion</hi> was of opinion, That Prudence did excel all other vertues, as far as the ſight doth the reſt of the ſenſes; affirming that vertue to be as proper and frequent in old men, as vigour and ſtrength in thoſe that are young. Wherefore it is requiſite that our Senator be endued therewith; for he can neither
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110845:24"/>
ſpeak nor act any thing ſutable to his age and gravity, if he be not, as with ſauce, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned therewith. The Latines call this vertue <hi>Prudentia, à providendo,</hi> from foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come, diſpoſing of thoſe that are preſent, and recollecting things paſt. For, he that doth not ruminate on things paſt, is altogether unmindful of his elapſed life; and he that foreſees not things future, is ſubject to many perils, and apt to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by every misfortune. Prudence (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is the knowledge of things good, evill, and indifferent; conſiſting wholly in the choice of that which is to be embraced, as alſo in that which is to be eſchewed, or carefully avoyded. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> it is a habit coupled with perfect reaſon, apt for good action, and exerciſed in thoſe things which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil, and may evene or happen to man during this life. Therefore contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative wiſdome differs from Prudence in this, that the former exceedeth not the bounds of contemplation, and the latter is wholly exerciſed in action, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of humane affairs. <hi>Plato</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that there are two things obſervable in the life of Man; The firſt is, For a man to know himſelf: And the ſecond, To know
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110845:25"/>
and underſtand all things: Therefore let our Senator be ſtored with this wiſdom, <hi>viz.</hi> of knowing himſelf; for without it, no reaſon, vertue, action or cogitation can be reputed good or perfect. By the help of this wiſdom, the prudent man firſt ſettles and orders his own affairs; in which skill if he be deficient, he muſt not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the name of fool. Now, under Prudence is comprehended or contained the skill of well-regulating domeſtical bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and the knowledge of enacting and making Laws, civill wiſdom, and policy in conſultation and judgement. Which is the reaſon why <hi>Cicero</hi> termeth the prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of oeconomiques, or houſhold, domeſtical, and the fame in State-affairs, civill wiſdom. And to the end that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator may ground his wiſdom upon a ſolid foundation, whereunto his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may have recourſe for reaſon to ſteer him to the truth; let him alwaies have before his eyes theſe things, honeſty, and profit: So that whatſoever he acteth or affirmeth privately, or publikely, may be directed by them both: for, all things that can be either conceived by reaſon, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by truth, are included within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of theſe two. Wherefore it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110845:25"/>
that he be furniſhed with a peracute wit, and ſolid underſtanding, that he may dive into the abſtruſe nature of things, and find out what is honeſt and profitable; leſt the mind hoodwinckt with inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and deſires, ſeduce the judgement, and lead him from the path of truth. And many there are, who finding themſelves to have depraved their reaſon, by giving the reins to their looſe affections and luſts, do fall into erronious opinions quite oppoſite and contrary to wiſdome. Whence it follows inevitably, that they are not only cheated in their choice of that which is honeſt and profitable, but are blindfolded with the love of that which is abſolutely diſhoneſt and unprofitable. To prevent which errour, two things are to be taken into conſideration. Firſt, Not to take things unknown for known, and praecipitantly aſſent unto them: Next, Not to give way in the leaſt to any evill cuſtome; (for, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo</hi> or <hi>uſus ſecunda natura;</hi> Cuſtome doth tyrannize over the nature of man;) or to walk contrary to the rules of vertue. A thing that may with facility be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a Senator, if he conſider the good and welfare of the Commonwealth, which is the <hi>Meta</hi> or ſcope that all wiſdom
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:110845:26"/>
and counſel aims at: nor can the Natives of his own Country, nay, wiſdom her ſelf, require more at his hands, or expect more from him, than induſtry in preſerving the ſafety and felicity of the place of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. But now it lies upon me to prove what Philoſophy beſt befits a Senator.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſince the felicity of every Counſellor, and the quinteſſence of all knowledge conſiſts in action, it ought to be his care and ſtudy to be exquiſite in that part of Philoſophy which preſcribeth the rules of regulating mens actions, and the Science of Government; to the end, that he may underſtand what is the beſt courſe of life; what is neceſſary and requiſite for the adminiſtration of publike and private affaires, and be skilful in ordaining Laws, correcting Judgments, and governing of People. Let him therefore be expert in that part of Philoſophy that inſtructeth the management of mans life, and the Art of Conſultation. For otherwiſe what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will he be able to give <hi>de vivendi ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> of the beſt way of living, according to the rules of vertue, that is uncapable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you a definition thereof? What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe can ſuch a one make concerning Counſel, Juſtice, Fortitude, Temperance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110845:26"/>
or Wiſdom? How ſhall he appeaſe the mutineers, ſuppreſs ſedition, or mitigate the rigour and ſeverity of the Laws, or proceed according to the rigour thereof, when he is ignorant of the precepts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Prudence? What counſel or advice can he afford either of War, Peace, or Contracts, that underſtands not when War is lawful, or unlawful; Peace juſt, or unjuſt; and Treaties honorable, or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable? Whenas he ought not only to conceive all the Precepts of vertue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and to underſtand them by name; but to exerciſe and put them in practice. The ſum of which knowledge is contained in the Ethicks, Politicks, and Oeconomicks; from theſe, as from a Magazine or Store-houſe, he may furniſh himſelf with all Rules, Directions, and Precepts, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of vertue, and the government of a Kingdom, as alſo the order of a domeſtical life. And though all this while we plead for the neceſſity of Philoſophy in our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, yet are we clearly againſt the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sects of Philoſophy; nor is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but rather injurious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, that the minds of men ſhould be divided into ſeveral whimſies and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt therefore, we extirpate Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110845:27"/>
Becauſe it being grounded on, and ſupported by ſenſual delights and pleaſures, ought not to be in him whom we elect for our Senator. The Stoick we do not blame or accuſe; yet we hold it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that their Tenets be exploded, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for our Counſellor; in regard that (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) they maintain the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to be the only wiſe man, and that all other perſons are but Thieves, barbarous, and infatuated. For, it were abſurd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him a Senator, that is of an opinion there is no wiſe Counſellor, Freeman, or Citizen, himſelf excepted. And though there hath ever been a diſſention between the Stoick and Peripatetick touching the <hi>Summum bonum:</hi> yet we adhere to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they are the beſt Tutors of Vertue and good Manners, and the moſt noble, valiant, wiſe, diſcreet Captains: Counſellors, Emperours and Kings have iſſued out of that Society. Beſides, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that our Senator be well read in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and exerciſed in all humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For firſt, in Hiſtory he will find out the notable ſayings and acts of wiſe men, that have lived in elapſed time, which are not ſo plentifully found in any Books, as in the monumental Annals, and Chronicles
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110845:27"/>
of fore-paſt Ages. This was the reaſon that moved <hi>Tully</hi> to call Hiſtory, The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, the light of truth, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of life, and the Herald of Antiquity. For, can any perſon paint out ſo fully to the life, or give ſo perfect a delineation of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Fortitude, Juſtice, Continence, Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and contempt of death, in an eloquent and fluent Oration, as may be read in the actions of <hi>Cornelii, Valerii, Fabritii, Curii, Decii, Mutii,</hi> and others? What noble <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> have our modern times produced! Hath not the Politick <hi>Monck,</hi> Noble <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and Loyal <hi>Montroſs,</hi> been ſingular and almoſt unimitable for their Policy, Valour, and Magnanimity? From theſe, and the like, he may make an extract of the moſt exact civill knowledge, and direct himſelf in the management of State-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Beſides, Policy muſt be one of his chief ſtudies: and he muſt be expert in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the tranſactions of Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the humors, diſpoſitions, and temper of all mens ſpirits, the Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Commonweals, and civill So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties: it is alſo neceſſary, that he be perfect in all Ordinances, Acts and Laws, either for Peace, War, Proviſions, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Subject, the adminiſtration of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110845:28"/>
the State, or the nature of men: as alſo to underſtand, what exalts, and what aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the mind; what Vertue is, what Diſcipline and Education is moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for youth; what Cuſtoms muſt be ratified or made firm; what duty we owe to God, and what reverence to Religion, and Allegiance to our Soveraign: in all which, we have a <hi>Monck</hi> among us of late (though none that ever entred into Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Orders) who will ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us. Nor muſt he be ignorant in Leagues, Contracts, and Alliances with Forraign Princes and Potentates: Since ſuch proceedings are dayly found in Kings Courts. Well therefore did <hi>Antonius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Senator or Counſellor, in theſe words: He is one that ought to underſtand by what means the Kingdom or Republick receives benefit; and when occaſion offers, to put them in practice. And, ſuch were in <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Lentuli, Gracchi, Metelli, Scipiones,</hi> and <hi>Lelii.</hi> Now, he that is well practiſed in the Law, hath experience in War, or skill in oeconomicks, or domeſtick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, deſerves to be promoted to the dignity of a Counſellor. Eloquence is alſo a great ornament to our Senator; but of that and ſome other qualifications, more at large in the enſuing Chapter.</p>

                  <head>Of Eloquence, Clemency, Piety, and other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues neceſſary to the accompliſhment of a Senator.</head>
                  <p>THeſe moſt noble Sciences and Arts will be infinitely adorned in our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor by the addition of Eloquence, which is the true ornament of wiſdom. For, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this accompliſhment, all things elſe are as it were dead, till they do flouriſh by the help of Rhetorick; And an eloquent, terſe, and curiouſly-penn'd Oration doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend the Author, but the private and publike benefit is oftentimes promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby. It is this that appeaſeth with her neat-ſpun blandiſhments the fury of our enraged enemies. Now, whatſoever he pronounceth, it muſt be done grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, adviſedly, eloquently, readily, and with comely geſture; for this, according to the Poet,
<q>—Emollit animos, &amp; temperat iras.</q>
The ſupple oyl of an inſinuating Oration
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110845:29"/>
will heal the wounds of a mutinous Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and reduce them to their former obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Next unto Eloquence, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and inſight in the Law is required; the end whereof tends to the conſervation of Equity. And indeed, who can with greater wiſdom decide a cauſe or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie? Who can better appeaſe ſedition, (the poyſon of a Kingdom) or more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally defend the Laws, Cuſtoms, Rights and Priviledges of the People, than he that is skill'd in the Law? Well then may we ſay, as it hath been affirmed heretofore, That the Habitation of a learned Lawyer is the Oracle of the City. Now, the Law in all Kingdoms is bound to tye every man to his duty, and to defend them ſo long as they continue vertuous and faithful. But, it is not ſufficient only to enact Laws nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that puniſh or recompence men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to demerits; but, to compoſe Laws, Cuſtoms, and Exerciſes (as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians did) wherein the People may take delight: beſides, ſuch judgement muſt be uſed in the preſcribing of Laws, that therein all occaſion of offences may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. For, as the Phyſician by his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines heals the maladies of the body; ſo the Counſellor ought by good and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110845:29"/>
Laws to cure the diſtempers of the mind. Yet they are not to be approved of, who perceiving an inconveniency grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, immediately fall to execution, without conſidering how the ſame miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign may be utterly extirpated: For it is more conſonant to reaſon, for a Senator to endeavour the reducing men to juſtice and honeſty, than to ſtudy how to execute them for every offence committed. What man can be ſo inhumane, that would not rather remove the cauſe? and then aſſuredly the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect would ceaſe. Who would not rather provide corn for the poor, than through the want thereof force them to turn Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſend them to execution for it? And who is there, that ſeeing the Kingdom overſpread with debauchery, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle addicted to licentiouſneſs, would not endeavour to correct and reform theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities by pecuniary mulcts, ſooner than by penal Laws? Therefore, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, if thou wilt remove Covetouſneſs, take away her Mother, Execeſs. Wherefore he muſt have all the commodities and diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of his Country before his eyes, and then he may be ſo expert in State-Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery, as to heal the ſores and wounds wherewith the body politick is oftentimes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110845:30"/>
troubled. Yet we deſire not that our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould be a pleader at the Bar, Proctor, or Advocate, becauſe that moſt of that Tribe (Charity forbids me to ſay all) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercenary, are many times the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of falſhood and injuſtice, bearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them minds and tongues principled againſt juſtice and truth. Indeed, it is a difficult piece of buſineſs for him to be a Lover of equity and truth, whoſe tongue hath been accuſtomed to walk for lucre. Not but that many famous Counſellors have been found among thoſe gowned Gentlemen; but all men are incident to failings, of what profeſſion or function ſoever: nor is this to be imputed to them alone, there are others that ſhake hands with them: But enough of that. Civill Diſcipline falls next under our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby he is inſtructed how to lead his life diſcreetly, and to govern his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with gravity and juſtice. Now he was termed a civill man among Philoſophers, who by vertue and wiſdom was enabled to command civilly; and he oftentimes had the authority of making Laws, and governing of Subjects. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth hath framed two ſorts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline; the one relating to the exerciſes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110845:30"/>
of the body, and the other of the mind: the diſcipline of the mind he called <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi> and that of the body <hi>Gymnastica.</hi> Now, by the harmony of Muſick, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands a certain concord or conſent of mind, wherein all actions do amiably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vertue, and vertue with them; which <hi>Copula</hi> Law and Philoſophy make up in Man: for hereby we are capable of judging what is honeſt, and what diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; what juſt, and what unjuſt; what is to be loved, and what to be loathed: and beſides, what duty we owe to our Parents, Princes and Magiſtrates. By <hi>Gymnaſtica,</hi> he means the exerciſes of the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the vigour and ſtrength of man is much helped and encreaſed. This conſiſts in leaping, running, wreſtling, hunting, riding, darting, ſwimming, to be both right and left-handed; in brief, all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary exerciſes and honeſt recreations are contained in this word <hi>Gymnaſtica.</hi> It is very neceſſary and requiſite in all ſorts of men (much more then in our Senator) to conjoyn the exerciſes of the body with the vertues of the mind, and to mix Fortitude with Temperance. For, as by the one, Man aſpireth to that which is noble; ſo by the other, he thinks it no
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110845:31"/>
derogation to him to be humble; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> he inclines neither to this ſide, nor that; ſo that he ſhall never dare, nor doubt too much. And as by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude we are able to repulſe injury, ſo by Temperance and Moderation we abſtain from offering injury. By the former, we are prompted to an honeſt becoming vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; by the latter, we are inſtructed to check and curb hair-bain'd fury, and to quench the flames of a vindicative ſpirit. Now, it is the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that the Muſical and Gymnaſtical Sciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to theſe qualifications; For to the one, Temperance, and the other Vertues may be referred; to the other, Fortitude of body, and magnanimity of mind. Wherefore it is convenient, that they be both united, and walk hand in hand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Gymnaſtick Exerciſes alone, create firmneſs; and Muſick of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets too much mildneſs and effeminacy: but both twinn'd and coupled together in any man, do mould him according to the ſhape and perfection of Vertue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every perſon that would be thought fit for counſel, muſt be thus exerciſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby he is adapted both for peace and war; and to this very purpoſe was he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110845:31"/>
born; for he muſt be as able to perform the Office of a Commander, as a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor: notable therefore, and worthy the mentioning, was that Roman Inſtitution, which impoſed a command upon them to train up their noble and honourable Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to be Counſellors at home, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains abroad: which is the reaſon, that <hi>Rome</hi> encloſed ſo great a number of Sage Senators and ſtout Souldiers within the circumference of her walls: Inſomuch that <hi>Cyneas,</hi> the Embaſſadour of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> having had audience of the ſplendid and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Senate, reported, that in <hi>Rome</hi> he had ſeen an Aſſembly of many Kings. Nor can they be skill'd in commanding, if the Subjects are not exerciſed in obedience; which is performed by their love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Magiſtrate, as well as obeying their Commands; all which proceeds from the due execution of Laws: and the firſt ſtep that leads up to the Temple of Vertue, is to ſubmit to the Law, and the Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: for the Law of every Kingdom, State, or Republick, is nothing but vertue, and a good <hi>decorum</hi> in the leading of our lives, reduced to certain rules. <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> hearing it related that the reaſon why that Commonwealth flouriſhed ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110845:32"/>
much, proceeded from the Kings skill in Policy and Government; replied, No ſuch matter; for the true reaſon is this, The Subjects are well exerciſed in their duty and obedience to Superiours. And (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath it) to obey the Magiſtracie and the Laws, to undergo all dangers and travels with patience, to fight manfully, and die voluntarily, was the chief point of the Lacedemonian diſcipline. And herein they were all trained; to the end, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus inſtructed, they might know how to defend their Country in time of War, govern it in time of Peace; and ſuch as live privately, to employ their vacant hours honeſtly, that is, in the proſecution of Learning; obtaining a becoming geſture, muſick, painting, vaulting, and the like, that they may keep themſelves in action, and be freed from that groſs imputation of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. It behoves him alſo to be witty and docible. Now, Wit is a certain natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral force of reaſon, able to conceive what is rational; which, although many times it be not helpt by induſtry, art or memory, yet it is powerful of it ſelf, and without learning may burniſh a man. Wherefore he muſt ſo know his own wit, as to become ſharp in reaſon, and finding out the cauſes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110845:32"/>
of things: which of it ſelf is a happineſs, and that a great one too; as the Poet ſings,
<q>Felix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas.</q>
Nay, wiſdom her ſelf, whereby we firſt conceive all things, ſprings from acuteneſs of wit: Now, they that are adorned with them both, are termed ingenious; and that wit is the beſt, and moſt to be commended, which is conſtant, ſtrong, ſharp, pleaſant, and natural. Now, the edge of ingenuity is very much acuated by the whetſtone of docility and memory: By the one, we are taught to make a conſtruction of thoſe things that are laid before us; by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we retain whatſoever proceeds from our invention, or the expreſſions of others; therefore it is requiſite our Counſellor ſhould be well exerciſed in theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments: for, it is an argument of a dull, ſlow, ignorant perſon, not to have a quick conception of what is ſaid, and a tenacious memory to recollect what hath been ſpoken by others. Now next, he muſt have Underſtanding: For as wit is the ornament of a Senator, ſo Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the light of wit, by which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110845:33"/>
all things, or their <hi>Idaea's,</hi> whether true or falſe. For, by common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we comprehend the knowledge of things, and thereby paſs a judgement on them, and conclude, all that is honeſt is to be referred to vertue, and what is unlawful or diſhoneſt, to vice: yet this underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not ſeparated from the Senſes, who are, as it were, Interpreters and Reporters of knowledge; yet muſt we be careful to avoid being deceived by ſenſual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is frequently known, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art or ſubtilty, ſingly or joyntly, play the cheat with us; which errour is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently avoided. Beſides, he muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, not only in private, but publick chances and events: For he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to foreſee all bluſtring ſtorms that may be injurious to the State, and ſtudy the preſervation of every member thereof. This that we call circumſpection, is a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and mature conſideration of things to be practiſed or acted; and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as well in the ſerene time of peace, as in the bluſtring ſeaſon of war; becauſe that wiſe circumſpection diverts the force and fury of Fortune, and we are ready to ſubmit to grave counſel and advice. In this vertue <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> did excell; for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110845:33"/>
he according to the Poet, by procraſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lingring delay, preſerved the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man State.
<q>Unus homo nobis cunctaendo reſtituit rem.</q>
But on the contrary, <hi>Flaminius</hi> relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the arm of ſtrength, and his courage, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſpectly aſſaulted <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to his great diſadvantage and prejudice. So <hi>Q. Scipio</hi> the Conſul, with divers that might be mentioned, through their incircumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were infeſted by the <hi>Cimbri.</hi> And it is as uſeful in time of peace: for the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould be eyed like <hi>Argus,</hi> and <hi>Lynx-</hi>ſighted, to pry narrowly into thoſe things that might ariſe to the diſcommodity of the Commonwealth, and make a diſcovery of them; otherwiſe, he cannot prevent the ſeditions, wars, and calamities that dayly happen to the prejudice of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Some men are ſo ignorant and blinded with ſuperfluity and pleaſure, that they can hardly diſcern things that are placed before their eyes, much leſs foreſee them; which ſort of men, as perſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to their private more than the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like intereſt, are to be exempted from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For, though they underſtand
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110845:34"/>
that through want of circumſpection war threatens a Nation, the people are capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, the Country run over and ruinated, Towns ſack'd, Houſes burnt, fields waſted, Temples profaned; yet uſe they no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, counſel, and medicine, either to cure or cool their fury or rage. But the grave Counſellor ſtudies by what means to continue the common ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a Country or Kingdom: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth, that the rage of a barbarous enemy may be beaten back or reſtrained by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, Pallizadoes, and Garriſons; that Caſtles and Bulwarks may be erected, the places of defence fortified, and all breaches ſtopt up; all which thus ordered, check the fury of an inſulting enemy, and annihilate his barbarous deſign and intention to bring all to deſtruction. Now there being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of well-trained Citizens, armed and ready to oppoſe, the Commonwealth is thereby fortified, (and the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians call ſtout men the walls of <hi>Sparta)</hi> diſdaining the force of forrein enemies, and preventing their offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <p>As for his Speech, he muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious, curt and grave, in all his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that he pens, or Speeches that he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110845:34"/>
makes; as <hi>Horace</hi> adviſeth him,
<q>In verbis etiam tenuis, cautuſque ſerendis.</q>
For, a raſh inconſiderate ſpeech, is not ſo ſoon called back as pronounced; and the unadviſed utterance thereof, may prejudice the Commonwealth, and afford the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor matter of repentance. And the reaſon is this, becauſe in an <hi>extempore</hi> ſpeech we pour out and divulge many things that are to be concealed.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt our Senator be overſwayed by Paſſion; for, paſſion is like falſe poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Verſe, nine faults at leaſt. Now it is the nobleſt piece of wiſdom under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, for a man to monarchize over himſelf, ſo as to ſubjugate and conquer his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to that known verſe,
<q>
                        <l>Fortior eſt qui ſe, quam qui fortiſsima vincit</l>
                        <l>Moenia—</l>
                     </q>
It is a greater piece of valour for a man to ſubdue and curb his hair-brain'd paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than to conquer the ſtouteſt enemy. Beſides, when he is put upon a parley with the enemy, a treaty with Embaſſadors, or a conference with neighbouring Princes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:110845:35"/>
he muſt be very circumſpect; for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to diſcover ſecrets by conjecture, and fiſh out the deſign intended by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſigns. Wherefore he muſt have a conſtant fixed reſolution, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed countenance; for the changing of the countenance, motion of the eyes, and variety of geſture, are the bewrayers of mens minds, as <hi>Gondamore</hi> well obſerved; and indeed, <hi>facies eſt index rerum.</hi> One may ſoon read a mans mind in his face, and by the calculation of his looks gueſs at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. And as he muſt not be too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, no more muſt he be altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, unleſs the reputation of the matter or perſon compel him to it; Since it is very unſeemly, and beneath the gravity of a judicious Senator, to maintain a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie againſt an apparent truth. Neither would we confine him to an abſolute ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or padlock his mouth, ſo as to debar him of that excellent gift of ſpeech; for, thereby he may be thought ſtupid or effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, ſince the one is imputed to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the other to a kind of maidenly modeſty, or misbecoming baſhfulneſs. Therefore he muſt uſe a mean between both; yet ſo, that he be a greater hearer than ſpeaker: Nature beſtowed on man a pair
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110845:35"/>
of ears, and but one ſingle tongue. Yet, notwithſtanding all this, it muſt needs be judged as great a piece of diſcretion to know when to be ſilent, as well as how, where, to whom, and in what place to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Next, Sagacity and craftineſs is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: for, War was never more politickly managed, Armies more ſecurely gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor the plots and machinations of ſubtile enemies more wiſely undermined, or overthrown, than by the vertue of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which he that wants, can no way be termed a Captain General. Now, Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is a ſharp and pleaſant conceit; and as it is the property of a wiſe man to conſult well, ſo it is the part of an apprehenſive ſpirit, ingeniouſly to underſtand, and paſs a ſolid ſentence or judgement of what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaketh. And as he muſt be quick of apprehenſion, ſo it is likewiſe neceſſary that he be crafty and ſubtill in ſearching and prying into the thoughts of Subjects, to the end he may underſtand what they deſire, what they expect or hope for, and what their inclination binds them moſt unto. By which means, he will not only keep the Subject cloſe to his lawful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but alſo by knowing their intended
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110845:36"/>
conſpiracies, prevent the evil thereof. For, ſometimes debauched Subjects aime at the deſtruction of ſober ſolid perſons; induced thereunto, or rather ſeduced, by hate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or inſolency; ſometimes becauſe they find themſelves inferiour to others in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, dignity or authority; and ſometimes becauſe they imagine themſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, and of little or no eſteem in the Kingdom, Republick, or State wherein Providence hath allotted them their being and reſidence: And ſo by theſe means, create war, and cauſe ſedition, and reduce the State to an apparent hazard. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing theſe commotions and cogitations of wicked men, he muſt be cloſe and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not dealing openly, or by direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but rather by ſoft perſwaſion, kind admonition, earneſt entreaty, or favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chaſtiſement, reduce them to a better temper, and furniſh them with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt principles. But, if he deal with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory ſtubborn people, he muſt menace them with authority, and terrifie them with ſeverity, that ſo he may divert them from ſuch execrable enterpriſes; perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meditating on the conſervation of the Commonwealth, which is conſummated by his endeavour for the felicity of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110845:36"/>
and his extirpation of ſedition and diſcord, with their efficient cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that a man may ſpeak doubtfully upon any occaſion twice, and be excuſed: but if he trip the third time, he is permitted to ſpeak no more in that cauſe. Nor muſt he be tedious or prolix; for a long-winded Oration, cram'd with cart-rope ſpeeches, longer than the memory of man can fathom, doth but talk them into dulneſs, and ſooner ſtupifie their minds than quicken their attentions. And he muſt likewiſe ſuit his diſcourſe to the capacity of his Auditory; for, he prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals a Mine of Excellency (ſaith one of our Learned Gentlemen) that waſts a terſe Oration to an ignorant aſſembly, where <hi>Mercury</hi> himſelf, were he Orator, would loſe his labour. Therefore as his ſpeech muſt not be over-long, (a fault that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſometimes found <hi>Cato</hi> guilty of, and reproved him for) no more muſt it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured with aenigmatical ſentences, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate words, which puzzle the Auditors rather than profit them; and by labouring in the explication of the terms, make them forget the ſubject and matter of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>Now it importeth not much whether his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110845:37"/>
ſpeech be penn'd or rehearſed; yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons written are more ſolid, and penn'd with more diligence, if the matter require a long Oration.</p>
                  <p>His voice ſhould be manly, promiſing of gravity, not effeminacy, clear and audible; not ſo low as cannot well be heard, nor ſo loud as to be term'd bawling.</p>
                  <p>And as he muſt be moderate in his ſpeech, ſo it is requiſite that he be of a temperate mind. Now, Nature hath ſo ordered it, that there is a kind of combate or contention between the mind and body of man, ſuſpending and diverting his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the true end of vertue. For, the alluring irretiating luſts of the body do labour to oppreſs and enſlave the mind; and the mind armed and fortified with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doth endeavour to reſiſt and oppugn them: and that vertue of mind is called Temperance, which is employed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all pleaſures, eſpecially thoſe that are known by the ſenſes, as Taſte, and Touch; yet doth it not generally deteſt all pleaſures, but only thoſe that thwart ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and reaſon. Now, ſome pleaſures there are by nature lawful, and others unlawful; and both incident to the mind, as well as the body. The corporeal pleaſures are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110845:37"/>
bred up and born with us, ſo that with difficulty are they reſtrained, eſpecially in thoſe men that take more delight and complacency in the exerciſes of the body than thoſe of the mind, which renders them brutiſh and ſenſual. Therefore the body muſt ſubmit to the checks and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulment of the mind, and by this means man may attain perfection. All Vertues conduce to the felicity of a Kingdom, but Temperance alone is the preſervatrix of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; for it keeps the State from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which oftentimes ariſeth from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and immoderation, and hath ſubverted many famous Cities and Countries. Now every Senator ought to furniſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with ſuch Laws as may puniſh riot and exceſs, leſt the Subject being poyſon'd therewith, Covetouſneſs ſpring up among them, the mother of all Vices. We read, that in <hi>Rome</hi> there were Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances made and enacted againſt exceſs both in expences and apparel. The Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians did alſo keep their feaſts in publike places, that no man ſhould dare to be waſtful in the ſight of other Citizens, and ſo encourage them to an imitation of their luxuriouſneſs or extravagancy. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Gallia Belgica</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110845:38"/>
of no Law nor Cuſtome that might make the people effeminate. And at this day, licentiouſneſs and immoderate expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are inhibited by Law in ſome parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> And ſince the luſts of men are inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable, (as appears by <hi>Catiline</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-conſpirators, who being thriftleſs and licentious perſons, attempted to make war againſt the Commonwealth) they muſt be held in with the bridle of the Law. And the Senator muſt be free from intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancy, that ſo he may be an example for others to follow and imitate; wherein let him take pattern by the ſeverity of the <hi>Cenſores,</hi> who were the Maſters and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of civil temperance and modeſty: and ſo by private admonition, as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like caſtigation, he may withdraw them from intemperance. Nor is this vertue without her Concomitants, Modeſty, Baſhfulneſs, Honeſty, and Continency. And by theſe, mans life is beautified, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made happy. Modeſty (ſay the Stoicks) is a vertue that containeth the knowledge of decent ſpeech and action. And whatſoever we ſpeak or do, we ought to obſerve a mean, leſt we expatiate on a ſubject more largely than neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, forgetting the Counſel of <hi>Solon, Ne</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:110845:38"/>
                     <hi>quid nimis.</hi> Wherefore tye your ſelf to a comely <hi>decorum</hi> in all your words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, compoſing your countenance, eyes, geſture, motion, and your whole body to a modeſt poſture, that the ſimplicity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of your intentions may thereby be made manifeſt and apparent.</p>
                  <p>Baſhfulneſs ſometimes gains a man much commendation; and this qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion renders a man honeſt, and induceth him to lead a good life, becauſe in all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it inſtructs how to avoid all reproach, obloquy, and villany. And as Juſtice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the wronging of a perſon by act or deed; ſo Baſhfulneſs teacheth a man not to be offended: for a good man doth not only voluntarily abſtain from doing injury, but is, as it were, frightned from it by Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet I mean not here, that Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is frequent with young men, and Offenders, becauſe they are compelled or conſtrained to that kind of ſhamefac'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that perturbation of mind doth misbecome a grave and temperate perſon; But that that we hunt after, ariſeth from a vertuous diſpoſition, and ſo gets a certain habit or exerciſe, accompanied with a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolution to avoid all evill: ſo that if at any time through ignorance an errour be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110845:39"/>
committed, we remain aſhamed; which is commendable. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> engaged with <hi>Pompeius</hi> the younger at <hi>Corduba,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his men ready to retreat, and ſeek for refuge by their heels, ſteps out into the front, and there in perſon behaved himſelf manfully; which the Souldiers ſeeing, could not for ſhame but turn about, and face the enemy again; being, partly by the valour of their General, and partly by their own ſhamefac'dneſs, inſtigated thereunto.</p>
                  <p>There is in man a certain natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of honeſty, prompting and ſpurring him on to the performance of all lawful actions, and diverting him from the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of what is unlawful; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from vertue; and therein her dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity reſteth, though ſometimes it ariſeth from fame, glory and opinion. Now, he that through diligent obſervation under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth what is meant by meaſure, order, and gravity, and obſerves this ſweet <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> in his words and actions, making it his chiefeſt care not to think or ſpeak any thing unſeemly, effeminate, or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be termed honeſt; and the power of honeſty is ſo great, that of it ſelf it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to diſſwade men from an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:110845:39"/>
Among the number of vertues required in our Senator, Continency &amp; Abſtinency challenge no mean place; for, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contemn the <hi>illecebrae,</hi> or allurements of inordinate deſires, but alſo withhold our eyes from beholding, or our hands from faſtning on them. Nor is there a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacle, than to ſee men contented with what nature and induſtry hath allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without coveting what appertains to others; which they might eaſily do, did they but conſider, that <hi>Natura pauc is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> Nature will be ſatisfied with mean commons. <hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi> is highly extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his continency, who converted no part of the vaſt wealth that was brought out of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe, but delivered the whole into the publike Exchequer; chooſing rather to be termed poor, than branded with the name of deceitful: And after his expiration, his goods being ſold under the Launce <hi>(uti mos erat,</hi> according to cuſtome) there was not left a ſufficient competency for his Wife to live on. The example of <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> is admirable, who in his greener years, at the taking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> being but twenty years old, had there (among many other captives) a Virgin of incomparable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110845:40"/>
beauty, yet did he not offer to deflower her, but gave her to a man unto whom ſhe was formerly betrothed; and beſtowed all that gold upon her for a dowry, which her friends offered for her redemption. We therefore judge it neceſſary that our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be continent, imitating <hi>Pericles</hi> in his advice to <hi>Sophocles</hi> his Aſſociate, and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at <hi>Rome;</hi> who fixing his eye on a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Roman Damoſel, whom they met ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally in their way to the Senate-houſe, and being ſomewhat too large in her commendation; told him, that a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt not only keep hands free from corruption, but alſo chaſte eyes, that caſt no wanton glances, becauſe they are grand inſtigations to luſt. Wherefore, it was judged an act of diſcretion in <hi>Cato</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, to turn <hi>Lucius Quintus Flaminius</hi> out of the Senate for his incontinency; becauſe he being Conſul in <hi>France,</hi> permitted a common Strumpet, at her requeſt, to ſtrike a Priſoner that had his Sentence paſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence. Nay, <hi>Manlius</hi> was deveſted of that dignity, for kiſſing his own Wife in the ſight of his own Daughter. And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius</hi> for adultery, and light actions, was excluded from fitting (had it been ſo with us, <hi>Henry Martin</hi> had never reſted ſo long
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:110845:40"/>
in the Parliament-Houſe.) I omit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, with many more, who by their continency gain'd no leſs honour than by their martial tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</p>
                  <p>Now, it is moſt certain, that there is nothing brings more diſhonour to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Senator, than a leud, debauched, incontinent life; becauſe it procureth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate obloquy or reproach, and defaceth, or at leaſt blemiſheth the Majeſty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> ſpun out his daies among the Diſtaff-bearers, I mean women, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all his time in incontinent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, waſting both his internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſubſtance upon wanton women, and the pleaſing his guſt; as appears by that Epitaph, which, living, he commanded to be engraven on his Tomb,
<q>Ede, Bibe, Lude.</q>
Which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> chancing to ſpy, ſtopt, and read; and ſmiling, ſaid, It was fitter to be fixed on the grave of an Oxe, than the Tomb of a Prince.</p>
                  <p>All pleaſures that are not reduced to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and honeſty, are reproachful; and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110845:41"/>
thoſe above all, draw men to vice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs moſt, that are diſcerned by the touch and taſte. Wherefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor muſt be careful, that neither his own, nor the life of his Subjects, be implunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mire of voluptuouſneſs and obſcenity; which may be ſoon effected, by removing all occaſions of intemperancy. The Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians uſed to ſhew their drunken ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their children, that they, beholding their ſordidneſs and beſtiality, might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the vice of exceſſive compotation. But it were to be wiſhed that we could follow, as well as read theſe inſtances. Great was the moderation and temperance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients in their diet; for, they lived not to eat, but did eat to live: Though in theſe our modern times the plague of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is ſo epidemical, that more men are infected with, and periſh thereby, than by the rage or fury of war; and it is the mode for them to drink other mens healths ſo long, till at laſt they drink away their own. Who would not then commend <hi>M. Curius</hi> the Roman Senator, that had rather the Embaſſadors ſent by the Samnites ſhould find him at a homely ſupper, quenching his thirſt in a woodden Bowl, than ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or accommodated with all the variety
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110845:41"/>
Nature or Art could afford? Nay, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Gold they preſented him with; ſaying, I had rather command thoſe that are rich, than be rich. I need not mention <hi>Fabricius, Fabius, Tubero, Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> whoſe temperate and ſober lives have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized their names. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> went not without a reproof, for preſenting his Gueſts with a boyl'd Peacock, at a Supper prepared for the Augurs. And <hi>Caſsius</hi> was thought intemperate, for drinking a little water in publike, and not enduring thirſt for a ſmall time. Yet do we not tye our Senator to ſo much ſtrictneſs, but only to moderation in all things. <hi>Duronius</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Senate, becauſe that he being a Tribune, made null the Law for the reſtraint of feaſting.</p>
                  <p>Surely, the Roman State was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy in ſuch Senators, that were not only Maſters of Counſel, but Tutors of Vertue and good Manners. Now, that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were temperate, even to admiration, may be conjectured from what is reported of them: when the preſents which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epire,</hi> after his overthrow, brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ſhewn, hoping thereby to gain the good will of the People, there was not one
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110845:42"/>
among them, that did ſo much as offer to ſtretch forth his hand to lay hold on any of them; ſo as that King ſaw himſelf twice vanquiſhed at once, as well by continency, as force of arms. But, when exceſs found footing in <hi>Rome,</hi> after the victory obtained in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that the people began to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonize through plenty and idleneſs; on a ſudden, the civil diſcipline of Temperance and Parſimony was neglected; and in lieu thereof, Avaritiouſneſs attended with a Legion of other vices, ſoon entred among the Roman Legions, and (if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Salust)</hi> brought their City to a ſad and lamentable Cataſtrophe. Nor indeed is there any thing that ſooner works the ruine of King, Kingdom, and Subjects, than exceſs. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing a Bill upon the door of a Prodigals houſe, which ſhewed it was to be let; ſaid, I knew very well that Houſe was ſo full of meat and wine, that ere long it would vomit out the Maſter. Now 'tis moſt certain, that immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate pampering, and exceſſive drinking, waſteth the ſtrength of the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiceth the mind. Notable is that Law of <hi>Solon,</hi> whereby that Senator was thought to deſerve death, that was addicted to the vice of drunkenneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:110845:42"/>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the Macedonian King being over-come with drink, paſt ſentence upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: ſhe forthwith made her appeal; and being demanded to whom, replied, To <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> being ſober. And without doubt, exceſs in drinking depraves the judgement of man; inſomuch, that Kings are made Slaves, old Folks become Children, Wiſe men are infatuated and made fools, and fools turned to mad men. But our Senator ſhall obſerve the old rule:
<q>—<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

A <hi>medium</hi> is to be obſerved in all things: we muſt eat and drink for neceſſity, not ſatiety; following the advice of the Poet <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who uſually ſaid, The firſt draught was of neceſſity, the ſecond of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity, and the third of madneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it were unſeemly in a Counſellor to have bloud-ſhot eyes, a furious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a ſtammering ſpeech; all which imperfections are the cuſtomary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of drunkenneſs: Nor will it become him, overcome with meat or drink, to ſnore away the night, but only to uſe both with ſo much moderation, as that they may only continue health, and make the body agile
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110845:43"/>
and fit for action. For, by moderate diet we find, not only the mind, but the body more ſubmiſſive and obedient; when as ſatiety and exceſs is the ſepulchre of the one, and the corruption of the other. We find <hi>Troy</hi> to be ruinated through the exceſs of the Inhabitants; when as otherwiſe it might have ſtood to this day:

But, although we diſcommend exceſs in both, as a thing misbecoming, and very hainous; yet our Senator muſt be ſure not to be avaricious, niggardly, and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſted, becauſe it is an argument of a baſe ſervile ſpirit, to debar himſelf of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and order that is required in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of ſuch a perſon. Therefore private exceſs muſt be baniſhed, and publike mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence maintained; and as needleſs and ſuperfluous delicacy is to be avoyded much more than penury and niggardlineſs; And, as immoderate expences are known to be prejudicial both to the Eſtate, Body, and Mind: ſo neceſſary and convenient fare is both comly and wholſome; and this muſt be obſerved with reſpect to the place, time and perſons. For, we read, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110845:43"/>
                     <hi>L. Tubero</hi> making a publike Feaſt, covered all his beds with the skins of Kids; and in ſo doing was judged indiſcreet, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the knowledge of what appertained to publike honour and dignity; and for this ſame fact, loſt the Office of Praetor. Notable was that quip that a Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon a Prince, to this purpoſe; who with his noble retinue being invited to a Collation, the Prince altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any mode uſed at Court, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed common civility, ſuffered them to be ſeated without cuſhions; which the Duke perceiving, put his Cloak under him in lieu thereof; and all his followers in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, did the ſame; and after their repaſt, left their Cloaks upon the ſtools, and were departing: at which the Prince ſomewhat amazed, told them, they forgot their cloaks: No, no, replied the Duke, an't pleaſe your Majeſty, it is not our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to be ſo uncivil, as to carry our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions along with us: then did he begin to underſtand the miſtake, and went away aſhamed. Next to Temperance, Juſtice is a Vertue to be very much followed by our Senator; of which in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <head>Of Juſtice and her concomitants, which our Senator ought to be adorned with.</head>
                  <p>NAture hath made all things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good, certain, perfect, and in all reſpects abſolute; which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that induced the Stoick to believe, that to live according to Nature was the chief felicity of man: for, Nature is the Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrix &amp; Tutoreſs of perfect life, inſtructing us in our obedience to the Author thereof. Now, this harmony of Nature may be fitly called Juſtice; for, this is that Vertue (and indeed <hi>Regina Virtutum,</hi> the Queen of all Vertues) which labours in defence of the Law, and preſervation of the conſent of Nature; ſince whatſoever complies with Nature, is Juſt; and what diſſenteth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Such men therefore, that follow the dictates of Nature, are juſt; being it is contrary to Nature to think ill either of God or Man. Whereupon Juſtice is of three ſorts, (though there be many ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions) Natural, Humane, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:110845:44"/>
The firſt foundation of Juſtice natural, proceeds from Nature her ſelf; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us to do as we would be done by: <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</hi> This natural equity commandeth us to abſtain from doing injury, or offending of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever. And by this ligament, men are conglutinated or co-united with a mutual affection and bond of amity. In that Age, which is known by the name of <hi>Aetas aurea,</hi> among the Poets; by the help of natural Juſtice only, deceit, fraud, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury had no reſidence upon Earth; they were <hi>non-entia,</hi> no ſuch things to be found in Nature. Then was there no ſedition, tumults, or hatred; but benevolence, fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, true love, and real affection. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers Profeſſion was not in uſe, pleading and wrangling was unknown to them; for, equity and Juſtice determined all things, and all things were common; every man thought that his own goods did belong as much to his neighbour as to himſelf. They that lived in that Age were enforced and confined to vertue and honeſty, becauſe they knew not vice, and by natural inſtinct were ſtimulated to the exerciſe of Juſtice. Of this happy time <hi>Ovid</hi> ſings moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently.

But, as ſoon as the Sun of truth declined, and began to be obſcured with the caligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous miſts of vice; immediately the minds of men were depraved, and they headlong without fear or wit implunged themſelves into an Ocean of filthineſs. Then every man ſhielded himſelf againſt Vertue, quite contrary to his former principles; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was a practice among them, lawful, to ſcandalize and prejudice all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether in goods, or good name; to lead a brutiſh, inhumane life; abuſe that excellent gift of Reaſon, and employ it in the exerciſe of vice; as the ſame Poet hath it,
<q>
                        <l>Protinus erupit venae pejoris in aevum</l>
                        <l>Omne nefas, fugere pudor, verumque, fideſque,</l>
                        <l>In quorum ſubiere locum, fraudeſque, dolique,</l>
                        <l>Inſidiaeque, &amp; vis, &amp; amor ſceleratus habendi.</l>

And ſurely that deluge of impiety had over-run the whole race of mankind, had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110845:45"/>
not the force of nature and reaſon in ſome few, oppoſed, and ſtood as a trench againſt the fury of this inundation. That ſmall reſidue of men (proclaiming war againſt vice) did ſo work upon them (that lived like brutes) by perſwaſion, as to reduce them to humanity; informing them how to live, not only by words, but alſo by works; what Civility, Vertue, and Honour was, and what was the original of Laws in Cities and Countries: ſo that hereby they might be inſtructed in thoſe things that were good, honeſt, and civill. From hence the precepts of vertue took their original, and vaſt volumes of the duty and manners of men were compoſed. This conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane nature and the Univerſe, was epitomized in one word by the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or wiſdome; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof were termed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who afterwards (according to the example of <hi>Pythagoras,)</hi> named themſelves Philoſophers. And by this means the light of humane reaſon and nature, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negroed with the clouds of vice, did reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume its priſtine luſtre and ſplendor, and endowed us with the knowledge of divine and humane things; which knowledge is called Philoſophy. Thus was that golden
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110845:46"/>
world reſtored. Now, that duty which natural Juſtice prompts us to obſerve to our Parents, is called Piety; which was the reaſon, that <hi>Aeneas</hi> by the <hi>Homer</hi> of our Latine Poets was ſtyled Pious <hi>Aenaeas.</hi> The Daughter of <hi>Cimon</hi> was adorned with this Vertue; for ſhe fed her Father with her own milk, being condemned to die, and thereby did eternize her name. This Juſtice doth alſo oblige us to nouriſh and cheriſh all perſons in diſtreſs; defend and govern himſelf: for, he that by wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy deſtroys himſelf by famine, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or violent death, is judged an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and no friend to Nature. By this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice natural, we are engaged to relieve and refreſh our neceſſitated friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and by generation to propagate poſterity; which is called <hi>nodoſa aeternitas:</hi> propagation is a knotty Eternity; for, by the iſſue of our loyns we do as it were tye a knot, and thereby lengthen our name and family. <hi>Socrates</hi> defineth this natural Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice thus: It is the Science of good and evill according to nature; which that man that exerciſes, deſerves the term of a good man; and if he communicate it to others, the title of a good Citizen; becauſe then he is not only beneficial to himſelf, but to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110845:46"/>
others alſo. They that Nature hath been ſo prodigal unto, as to beſtow ſingular gifts, and incomparable endowments on, ought to tranſcen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> all others in this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juſtice, as much as they do in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts; otherwiſe they will have but a mean repute (if any at all) in the world.</p>
                  <p>The next is Juſtice divine; whereby we are obliged and bound to acknowledge, love, honour, reverence, adore, and worſhip God: And it hath pleaſed Nature to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant this knowledge in man; as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe would intimate unto us, that all other creatures do only feed and pamper their bodies, whenas Man ſhould aime at a more noble marke, <hi>viz.</hi> the Deity. Nor is there any people upon earth but adore ſome God or other, and hold it a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon every one of them ſo to do. Now all the ſubſtance and force of this Juſtice is contained in Religion, which is the worſhip of God. But being that is a different ſubject from what we intend to expatiate on, we ſhall leave the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>Humane Juſtice, which is alſo termed ſometimes civil, is of an obſcure and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den nature; for, although it receive its
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110845:47"/>
being from Juſtice natural, and therefore the precepts and uſe thereof carry little or no ſeeming difficulty along with them: yet is it not truly conceived, unleſs it be by ſuch who are either endued with a kind of divine nature, or have been employed in all ſorts of vertue. For, this Vertue requireth a Learned, Wiſe man, who reaſonably, conſtantly and voluntarily practiſeth it. And ſuch our Senator ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>All civil Juſtice conſiſts, partly in the preſervation of humane ſociety, and is partly exerciſed in a Court of Judicature. This Vertue approveth of no unlawful, cruel, or barbarous action; but embraceth honeſty, tranquillity and peace; endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to keep men from ſedition, malice, and enmity; not coveting <hi>aliena bona;</hi> but, <hi>unicuique ſuum tribuens;</hi> gives every one their due. By this Vertue our Counſellor becomes a defender of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Protector of the innocent and Orphans; and a debaſer of the proud and haught: a Lover of thoſe that are good, a friend to truth, and an enemy to vice, and conſequently to vicious perſons. The foundation of this Vertue is fidelity; which <hi>Cicero</hi> defines to be a conſtant and true performer of promiſe. A juſt Senator
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110845:47"/>
therefore affirms the truth, ſticks cloſe to his promiſe; ſtandeth to compacts; reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what he borrows; and is not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be faithfull by Law, teſtimony, or oath, but by his own free will and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; labouring to keep under injuſtice, and to ſee that the weaker ſort be not over-powred by the ſtronger; that might over-come not right. Valiant men, in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſerve to be crowned with reward; and idle, puny-ſpirited ſubjects, the laſh of puniſhment; and by theſe two, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preferment, the benefit of a Commonwealth is infinitely promoted. In the diſtribution of offices, he is directed by the rule of uprightneſs and equity; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be greaz'd in the fiſt with bribery, reputing thoſe worthy of moſt ample ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who can lay claim to the greateſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Which is a thing to be very much inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on in a Kingdom, or Republick; becauſe, <hi>Honos virtutes praemium,</hi> Honour is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of vertue; and as due to a deſerving perſon, as wages to an hired ſervant: which was the reaſon, that wrought the Antients to erect ſtately Images, triumphal Arches; and publike ſepulchres, open commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like, were conferred on men of ſervice and deſert. Now they that are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110845:48"/>
nobly educated, vertuouſly enclined, grave and ancient, deſerve honour and reverence; and that either by bowing the head or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in giving them place: And, as goods are of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> goods of the mind, goods of the body, and goods of Fortune; ſo they are all in conferring of honour to be reſpected. Therefore thoſe of the mind aſſume the firſt place; thoſe of the body the next, and thoſe of Fortune the laſt, as the meaneſt in value and worth, though now adaies of moſt eſteem in the eye of the World. All theſe things our Senator muſt be skill'd in; and in the diſtribution of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conferring of honours, he muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve equality, the balance of Juſtice; wherewith every mans manners, vertues and actions are poized and examined. In which he muſt be very circumſpect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byaſſed, leſt he prove partial, leaning to one ſide more than another; and ſo come off with the term of an unequal Judge. For, he that beſtows honour, and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates favours upon the undeſerving, doth a manifeſt injury to thoſe that can plead de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert; and ſo by conſequence is an unjuſt Judge. Wherefore Philoſophers give us a definition of this juſtice, as followeth: It is an habit of the mind deſtined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110845:48"/>
utility; giving honour to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that may be judged worthy of it. And among thoſe vertues that plead for an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in humane ſociety, equality is neither the laſt, nor the leaſt; ſhe exerciſing the office of a Handmaid or Lady of honour to that Queen of Vertues, Juſtice: Nor doth ſhe remove a hairs-breadth from her, but ſticks cloſe to her principles and precepts. Now this equality in juſt pondering and weighing things, and perſons, uſeth a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of proceeding; the one ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the other common; one judging by number, weight, and meaſure; the other more difficile and ſecret, that is, weighing every thing by reaſon and judgement. Which knowledge is only attained by wiſe men, and thoſe that are exerciſed in great affairs, and matters of importance and weight; and the other by thoſe that are chiefly employed in barrating, buying and ſelling. Let our Senator be skill'd in that knowledge that proceeds from reaſon and judgement, that he may thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how to diſtribute offices, confer honours, beſtow gifts, what is due to every perſon, juſt, good, and indifferent in all things, perſons, and places. This equality is an excellent qualification, and of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110845:49"/>
uſe and ſervice in a Kingdom. And where Counſellors are ignorant therein, we find but raw and weak conſultation, and all things managed at randome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing of certainty; to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of publike ſociety.</p>
                  <p>Another kind of juſtice there is, which is commonly called juſtice forraign, not much unlike this before mentioned, chiefly converſant about judgement; whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the Law, and whoſe prop or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is the judgement of wiſe, ſolid, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Senators. Before ſuch time (as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned) that written Laws were found out, each man was his own Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and preſcribed his own peculiar Laws, not diving into the books of Law-makers or Doctors for precepts or inſtructions: For, then that pure and immaculate Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Juſtice had her reſidence in the mind of man, dictating unto him Laws and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, whereby he led an upright life, without exerciſing any fraud, deceit or colluſion. But, as ſoon as men, tired with the ſtrict diſcipline of juſtice, began to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet their neighbours goods, offer injuries, and neglect the reſtauration of what they had taken no upon credit; immediately hate, diſſimulation, enmity and war ſprung
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110845:49"/>
up, and gave way to the invention of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial weapons, as well offenſive as defenſive; and that in ſo furious a manner, as might force Juſtice, nay, compel <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf to give place: thus, as ſweet-tongued <hi>Ovid</hi> ſings,
<q>—Terras Aſtraea reliquit.</q>
She made her ſelf wings, and flew to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ſanctuary, whereever ſince ſhe hath taken up her habitation. And hence it is that we have recourſe to heaven in our dayly Orizons for juſtice. <hi>Homer</hi> uſed to term Kings inſpired with the wiſdome of good Government, Sons of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and we ſtyle them, Gods Vicegerents. And ſince reaſon cannot prevail with us ſo far, as thereby to lead a quiet, peaceable, and juſt life; we muſt have recourſe to juſtice; who by her Laws admoniſheth, corrects, and honours us, preparing rewards for good, and ſtoring up puniſhments for evill actions. This juſtice (according to <hi>Ulpia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus)</hi> is a conſtant deſire, or fixed reſolution to beſtow upon every man that which of right belongs unto him. Now the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enacting of Laws, appertains to a Counſellor, as the moſt diſcreet perſon, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110845:50"/>
fit for that office. And <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth, that theſe things are to be obſerved in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Laws, Acts, or Ordinances. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator muſt enact them with a paternal love, that may cauſe a reciprocation of fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duty: not with a Lordly, tyrannical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet framing them to the terror of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, who neither regard Law, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; according to that known Hexame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<q>Sic volo, ſic jubeo; ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</q>
My will is the only Law that I own or acknowledge. Beſides, he muſt be ſure that his Laws contain no more preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of commands, than diſcipline of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that the ſeverity of the one may be mitigated by the gentleneſs of the other. And the intent and end of all Law is, that men may be felicitated thereby, as far as comes within the compaſs of humanity; and that offenders may receive a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſutable to their crimes, of neceſſity, and not on ſet purpoſe: which moved <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> to make a triple diviſion of legal precepts: To live honeſtly, prejudice no man, and give to every one his due. He therefore that doth abandon the Law, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110845:50"/>
follows the dictates of his own corrupt will, contemning the Statutes of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is guilty of a notorious crime, as well as he that denies God, Nature, or Reaſon. <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> that ſtream'd away his time in tears, was wont to ſay, That all men were as deeply engaged to defend their Laws, as the walls of their City; and his reaſon was, becauſe that a wall-leſs City might be preſerved, but a Lawleſs one could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by all the ſtrength of humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For by Laws they expel idleneſs, the mother of Vice, which renders the mind effeminate, and makes it grow wanton. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid as truly, as pithily, <hi>Nihil agendo, male agere didicerunt:</hi> By doing nothing, the people learn'd to do ill. <hi>Diodorus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a certain Law that was among the Aegyptians, whereby every Subject was compelled to give in his name to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, withall declaring what kind of life he moſt affected, how he lived, and what Art he exerciſed: And if he were found to give a falſe account of his life, he was put to death. <hi>Draco</hi> ſeeing the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens waſteful, made a Law, that he that was found idle ſhould be executed; which being too ſevere and rigid, <hi>Solon</hi> did qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie, puniſhing that offence with infamy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110845:51"/>
only. By the imperial Law it is provided, that idle, ſloathful, and thriftleſs Subjects be either whipt to death, or enſlaved. In every Kingdom there are certain exerciſes both for peace and war: Some are bred up Clergy-men, Counſellors, and Judges; others, Captains, Commanders, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: that ſo the Kingdom may be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Subjects in Peace or War, and by their actions the Country may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the invading enemy, and her Territories or skirts enlarged. Nor muſt Laws be often altered; for, as ſoon as the people perceive any mutation, their minds being prone to innovation, they preſently deſire all the reſt be changed and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; though ſometimes neceſſity requires that they be corrected or reformed. The leaſt mutation in a Kingdom, is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, breeding a contempt of Laws, and ſedition alſo. Wherefore the <hi>Locrenſes</hi> had a Law, that if any man did invent a new Law, he ſhould propoſe it to the people in publike, with a halter about his neck; to the end, that if it were judged pernicious or unprofitable, he ſhould be forthwith hang'd, as an Author of evill. And it doth very much concern Princes and Counſellors to walk according to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110845:51"/>
thoſe Laws they ordain; for it is odious to be <hi>Legiſlator; &amp; Legis violator;</hi> a Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and a Law-breaker: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that Subjects ſo much look upon, as the lives of their Superiors.
<q>Regis ad exemplum totus componitor orbis.</q>
All Nations, all the World over, follow the example of a King: which if he ſteer his actions according to Juſtice, finds Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects obedient and loyal, who will keep cloſe to their allegeance. <hi>Seleucus</hi> made a Law, that whoſoever was taken in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be deprived of both his eyes. Afterwards his Son was found guilty of that Crime: his Subjects went to mediate, deſiring him to ſign his pardon; but their ſuit prevailed no otherwiſe, then that firſt he cauſed one of his Sons eyes to be put out, and then one of his own; that ſo the ſeverity and reputation of Law might be obſerved, and that the force thereof might be in more eſteem than the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men. The ends why Laws were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, were two: The one, that men may underſtand Juſtice, and have entertainment among them; the other, that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. The firſt, is the duty of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110845:52"/>
who frameth the people in the mould of Vertue. And the ſecond is the Office of the Judge, who is to ſuppreſs the exorbitancies of offenders, and preſerve the rights and priviledges of his Country. Now it often falls out, that dubious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and thoſe matters of concernment too, are brought before a Judge; expecting his determination. Wherefore he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that to equality, which he thinketh unequal: not unlike a line cut into unequal parts, and that part which is found too long is cut ſhorter, and ſo added to the other: So doth the Judge, who is the Living Law and Oracle of the Kingdom. Nor muſt he paſs a ſentence upon any matter, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide any cauſe, before he hath heard both Plaintiff and Defendant, and examined all their Witneſſes: For, as <hi>Seneca</hi> hath it moſt excellently,
<q>
                        <l>Qui ſtatuit aliquid parte inaudita altera;</l>
                        <l>Aequum licet ſtatuerit, haud aequus fuerit.</l>
                     </q>
He muſt be voyd of all paſſion, hate, or partiality: one that ſcorns bribery, will not be daunted with menaces, or threatned out of the truth, or moved by the ſubtilty of adulation: for, where a Judge, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110845:52"/>
or Senator is ſubject to paſſion, there is little, or indeed no Juſtice in his Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: nor is there any one thing that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a Commonwealth or Kingdom more, then corrupt and unjuſt Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice of old was by Philoſophers pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like a beautiful Virgin, having a ſevere grave countenance, penetrating eyes, a chaſte look, inclining to gravity: which Image carries this repreſentation, that Judges ought to be incorrupt, chaſte, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, ſharp-witted, good, grave, conſtant and inexorable. <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> cauſed the skin of an unjuſt Judge to be flea'd, and hung up in the Court, as a terror to all thoſe that were unjuſt in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>Solon</hi> being demanded, How a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom might beſt be preſerved; anſwered, By the Peoples obedience to Superiour au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Magiſtrates ſubſcription to the Law. And <hi>Bias</hi> uſed to ſay, That place was moſt ſecure, where men ſtood in awe of the Law, no leſs than of a Tyrant. It is a ſhame and reproach to a Nation to have Laws, that like the Spiders web, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the weak and ſimple, and let the ſtrong and mighty eſcape. Which our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator muſt very diligently obſerve, and continually provide that the Laws be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved inviolable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:110845:53"/>
Juſtice admits of another diviſion among Moral Philoſophers, and that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive and Commutative. Juſtice Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive, is that that reſpects equality in the diſtribution of reward or puniſhment, according to Geometrical proportion. For, as there are ſeveral degrees of crimes and offences perpetrated by the impious; ſo there are likewiſe of the merits of deſerving and vertuous perſons; In regard that the circumſtances of perſons, places, and time, do oftentimes aggravate the crime. As for inſtance; He that offends a Magiſtrate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a higher puniſhment than he that offends a private perſon: And he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an inſolency in the Church during divine ſervice, or in Court before a Judge ſitting upon the Bench, muſt be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely corrected, than if theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did not accompany the fault. And in like manner, the different conditions of men in the diſtribution of recompences, or conferring of honours, muſt be narrowly conſidered and pried into.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is apparent, that in the diſtribution of honour, as well as in the inflicting of puniſhment, this Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proportion muſt be obſerved; becauſe that by this means we obſerve the ſame
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110845:53"/>
proportion between perſons, as we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things; and though there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of meaſure, yet will there be an equality of reaſon. As thus: He that hath a double ſhare of merit, twice as much as another man, deſerves a double recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence according to the Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which differs from the Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, obſerved in Juſtice Commutative: for the latter reſpects the equality of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and things diſtributable, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the merits or demerits of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice Commutative is that that looks upon equality and faith in contracts, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, humane commerces and negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as buying, ſelling, borrowing, and the like. As for example; the ſame ſort of wine, oyl, corn, cloath, or other vendible commodities, is ſold to a Magiſtrate as well as to a Mechanick. But now let us come to her Concomitants.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of Piety; by which we pleaſe God, and get repute among men. <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> to get credit by the Religion that he framed for the Romans (counterfeiting Piety) induced them to believe that he and his Wife <hi>Aegeria</hi> uſed to convene with the Gods in a certain place conſecrated to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:110845:54"/>
                     <hi>Camena,</hi> and there did receive the Laws and Religion the Romans were to follow: ſo that they that neither by the ſoftneſs of perſwaſion, nor the violence of compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be reduced to Religion; by a counterfeit colour of Piety were brought to be very religious. And if ſo among them, how will the true Religion prevail among us that are Chriſtians? Yet in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion two things are to be declined, <hi>viz.</hi> hereſie and ſuperſtition; which vices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert weak inſtable perſons. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a certain kind of Piety due to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by which we obey, reverence, and reſpect them.</p>
                  <p>Innocency is another of her Aſſociates; which Vertue affects ſimplicity, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſſimulation and hypocriſie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, fawning Sycophants, that Dog-like will <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, fall down under your feet, and ſeem to adore you; Diſſemblers, that hold with the hare, and run with the hound; carry fire in one hand, and water in the other; and tale-bearers, that are <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum pleni,</hi> full of chincks, no ſooner a ſecret can be committed to their keeping, but it drops from them like water through a ſieve; ſuch perſons are to have no place in the Catalogue of our Senators. And as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:110845:54"/>
no man might have admittance into the Temple of <hi>Ceres Elucina,</hi> but he that was innocent; there being this Superſcription over the Portal, <hi>Let no man enter but he that knoweth his own innocency:</hi> So into holy Council, which is the Temple of Juſtice and Truth, let no man have admittance, but he that is innocent, and of integrity. His mind muſt be open and ſincere, not obſcure or deceitful, ſaying one thing, and meaning another; his thoughts and his words muſt be Relatives; his tongue muſt be the true interpreter of his mind; and his face not ſhrowded with a fained diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, but full of natural ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Courteous he muſt be; for an affable debonaire diſpoſition will ſcrue it ſelf into the good will of all men. He muſt hear with patience, and reply with diſcretion; free from all ſowerneſs and inſolency in words or action.</p>
                  <p>Benignity is another thing neceſſary; for as God is kind and gentle to us, ſo muſt we manifeſt our ſelves to thoſe that are a ſphere below us. He muſt therefore be gentle, mild, and of a ſweet diſpoſition: not auſtere, ſupercilious; and as <hi>Timon</hi> was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, A man-hater. For as to the Moderator of all things, Religion and Piety
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:110845:55"/>
is due; ſo is love and benevolence unto men.</p>
                  <p>Next, Clemency; which properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to Magiſtrates, and men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for by vertue hereof, the heat of their diſpleaſure towards Malefactors is abated, and they themſelves qualified. Her oppoſite is Cruelty, and bitter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity in puniſhment; a quality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Tyrannical and inhumane perſons. <hi>Draco</hi> was ſo rigid and ſevere, nay (I may ſay) cruel, that he inflicted death upon idle perſons, as well as Murderers; and being askt the reaſon, replied, becauſe he thought that puniſhment due for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a petty offence; and for thoſe of a higher nature, he could not invent any great enough. But <hi>Scipio</hi> much more cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pitiful, could ſay, That he had rather be inſtrumental to the ſaving of the life of one ſingle Citizen, than to the ſlaughter of 1000 Enemies. And indeed for a Magiſtrate to be perpetually puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, is as reproachful, as to ſee Phyſicians alwaies killing their Patients with their Quackſalving and Emperical tricks. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Clemency in a Governour creates a kind of baſhfulneſs or fear of offending in any perſon. Yet Clemency muſt be ſo uſed, as that ſeverity, if need be, muſt not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:110845:55"/>
neglected: for no Country can be well governed without it, by reaſon of the different diſpoſitions of men; for a harſh word ſtrikes deeper with ſome, than a ſhrewd puniſhment with others. Over-much clemency was an imperfection that the Stoicks would have all wiſe men to want; alledging, that it was an argument of an ignoble mind, condeſcending and ſubſcribing to the guilt of other mens crimes and offences: and therefore ſuch men may be aſſimilated to fond fooliſh women, that would have Malefactors freed from the laſh and rigour of the Law, becauſe Crocodile-like, after the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an hainous offence, they can drop a deceitful tear.</p>
                  <p>Next, Liberality. Among ſome of thoſe Vertues that were conſtellated in <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> this is not the leaſt; that before his return from any place, he obliged ſome perſon or other to him by his liberality.</p>
                  <p>The Son of <hi>Titus Veſpatianus</hi> was wont to ſay, That that day wherein he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſome benefit, was utterly loſt. Now in giving, theſe two things are obſervable; to forget the benefits we beſtow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member perfectly what we have received: for ingratitude is a black crime; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:110845:56"/>
                     <hi>dixeris, &amp; omnia dixeris;</hi> Name but Ingratitude, and you epitomize all crimes in a word.</p>
                  <p>Magnificence is the next concomitant of Juſtice; which Vertue conſiſteth in large expences, and great gifts; differing from Liberality in this only, that the one is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſmall and mean, the other in large gifts. Now it is obſervable, that Magnificent men uſually erect Churches, build Cities, Towns, and Villages, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelves about ſuch things as may either redound to the glory of the Creator, or elſe augment the fame of the Author. And though Parcimony be judged a noble revenue, yet muſt not our Senator be ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious, as altogether to forget liberality, or Magnificence; and ſo degenerate into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, which is a malady incurable: which as <hi>Salust</hi> hath it, doth effeminate both body and mind: Delighting it ſelf in two things, giving nothing, and receiving much: and yet exceſs muſt be avoided; ſo that the middle way is beſt. The advice of <hi>Apollo</hi> to his unſatisfied Son <hi>Phaeton</hi> is very good,
<q>—Medio tutiſsimus ibis.</q>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:110845:56"/>
Therefore that no man might exceed a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming moderation in expences, it was provided by a Law at <hi>Rome,</hi> that no Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould be indebted above a certain ſum of money preſcribed. Which order was taken, to remove exceſs and ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in expences. <hi>P. Rufinus</hi> was depoſed by the Cenſors for having 10 <hi>l.</hi> weight in Silver. And <hi>Aemilius Lepidus</hi> having ſpent 6000 <hi>l.</hi> in building a houſe, was deveſted of his Senatorſhip. So ſtrict were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans, leſt the Senators exceſs ſhould move the Plebeians to the ſame ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity. Yet we allow a Senator far more liberty than ſo; for, our Laws do not ſo narrowly confine them.</p>
                  <p>Next, Friendſhip; which is abſolutely neceſſary: for, ſince man is a civil perſon, and a lover of ſociety, he cannot be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of other mens converſation; from hence, as from a ſource or foundation, all amity, marriage, or conſanguinity doth flow: And he that endeavours to deprive a Kingdom of united friendſhip, doth in a manner ſnatch the Sun out of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Friendſhip is of an uniting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregating quality; for as cold congeals a multitude of waters into one cake of Ice, ſo Friendſhip makes of many one; which is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:110845:57"/>
by <hi>Laelius</hi> defined to be a perfect conſent of things divine and humane, in all love, charity, and affection. Yet are we not to entertain any perſon at the firſt ſight <hi>(pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma facie,</hi> as we ſay) as a friend; we muſt firſt, according to our Proverb, eat a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel of ſalt with them, that ſo we may dive into their diſpoſition, and know what metal they are made of. It is the opinion of the Philoſophical Tribe, that that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is moſt ſure, and beſt grounded, that is nouriſhed by ſimilitude of temper; for where mans delight is one and the ſame, his affection cannot be divers. Such friends were <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus; Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades; Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> with many more that might be mentioned. The friendſhip of the two laſt was ſo great, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> did earneſtly deſire to make a third perſon, that ſo there might be a Trinity of friends linked together with the ligament of love. Few friends are beſt; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perfect friendſhip is inconſiſtent with multiplicity of perſons: and indeed they that delight to aſſociate themſelves with many, are not accounted friends, but ſociable; for it is one thing to be a lover of converſation, and courteous in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of all perſons; and another thing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:110845:57"/>
to be a friend to one whom we make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion, one who is the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript wherein we write all our ſecrets. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was heard to uſe this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on frequently, That a man ſhould not leave the Court till he made an addition to the number of his old friends by gaining of a new one; but this obſervation tends more to the obtaining of the common good will of men, than perfect friendſhip. Now true friendſhip requires three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Vertue, from which we muſt never ſwerve; Next, Pleaſure, which proceeds from familiarity and ſweet converſation, ſtealing away the tediouſneſs of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hours. For, <hi>amici fures temporis.</hi> And laſtly, Profit; whereby one real friend may accommodate another with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, when ſtimulated by that Tyrant neceſſity. Though it be the cuſtome of the World to fawn upon a perſon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with the affluence of all terrene comforts, and hath high and mountain'd fortunes; but when he is at a low ebb, then they uſually forſake him with a <hi>Benedicite,</hi> or God help you. Nor can you try a real friend better, than in the kick of malignant chance: Then, if he deſerves that name, he will ſtick cloſe to you; if not, ſcoff
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:110845:58"/>
at your meanneſs. Well might the Satyriſt ſay,
<q>
                        <l>Nil habet infelix paupertas durius inſe,</l>
                        <l>Quam quod ridiculos homines facit.—</l>
                     </q>
As if the Poor man were but fortunes Dwarf, (ſaith one excellently) made low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the reſt of men, to be laugh'd at. Yet, if any thing that is unjuſt be reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by one friend of another, it is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſſwade, rather than encourage him. <hi>Pericles</hi> being deſired by a friend to aſſiſt him by bearing falſe witneſs; replied like a Chriſtian more than a Pagan, <hi>Tuus ſum uſque ad aras;</hi> I am yours to do you any courteſie that comes within the limits of my power, as far as Religion gives me leave: intimating thereby, that he would aid his friend ſo far as juſtice, equity, or divinity would permit, and no farther. Now by the concatenation of amity, and co-union of Senators, the Kingdom is as it were linked together, and ſo ſtrengthned. Whenas, who can expect concord or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love between Subjects, when Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are diſagreeing and at variance? <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> were enemies, yet whenſoever they went out on publike
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:110845:58"/>
Embaſſage or Commiſſion, being arrived at the borders of the Athenian Land, there they laid down all contention and former enmity; though after their return home they did often renew their old grudge and diſpleaſure. To forget injuries received, is a noble part, and an argument of a royal ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Out of Friendſhip ariſeth Concord, which is nothing but civil amity: and a conſpiracy or plot among all degrees of men to maintain Liberty, Law, Juſtice, Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Religion and Quietneſs in a Kingdom. Wherefore the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> did uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſit in the Houſe of Concord, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thereby, that in Council nothing ſhould paſs contentiouſly. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> being asked why <hi>Sparta</hi> was not environed with walls; informed the Queſtioniſt, that the Citizens lived united; and ſhewing him the men, ſaid, Behold the walls of <hi>Sparta. Scilurus</hi> bleſt with a numerous off-ſpring, fourſcore Sons, before he expired, produced a bundle of arrows, and bid them break them all at once: they replied, It was abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: then took he the arrows from them one by one, and ſo brake them all; thereby exhorting his Children to live in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:110845:59"/>
concord, for ſo they might be invincible and happy; whenas otherwiſe they would be ruinated and diſperſed.</p>
                  <p>In like manner <hi>Mycypſa,</hi> King of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> being on his death-bed, aſſembled all his Children, and left them this golden Sentence as a Legacy: <hi>By concord the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt inconſiderable things encreaſe; but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt conſiderable by diſcord come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hoſpitality is a companion to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Concord, which entertains ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as friends, with courteſie and affability; which Vertue redounds very much to a mans credit and reputation. The priviledges belonging thereunto are ſo conſiderable, that the Romans obſerved the performance of the rights thereof even to their very enemies; and would never joyn in battel with them, till ſuch time as the Priſoners to whom they were indebted for food, were manumitted. <hi>Plato</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it was impoſſible to reduce his Commonwealth to a happy condition by any other way but amity, concord, or hoſpitality; brought down all Laws and Cuſtoms to friendſhip, making all things common, that ſo mutual ſociety and love might be conſerved; affirming withal,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:110845:59"/>
that that brace of words, <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> were like a pair of Engines framed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to unhinge the whole World.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſince it is manifeſt, that man, whilſt he lives, floats in a turbulent Sea of vexations and misfortunes, ſubject to perils as conſiderable for their number as their weight; and that we muſt overcome them by patient ſuffering, or manfully revenge them; we muſt next diſcourſe of Fortitude, which is able to ſupply us with weapons to defend us againſt the aſſaults of the mind and fortune. A Life free from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of diſcontent, is aimed at by all, but impoſſible to be obtained by any: for Nature hath ſo ordained it, that care, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moleſtation is interwoven with the web of our life; ſo that as our more groſs part, the body, is burthened with labour and toyl; ſo our more ſpiritual part, the mind, is diſquieted with diſcontented imaginations. Nor indeed can we tell how to relliſh Vertue, unleſs we firſt taſte of diſcontent; for, the clouds of ſorrow being overblown (like reſt after labour) the fruit of felicity is much more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſing. Vertue is not a Lady that loves to ſmother her ſelf in down, and lie at her eaſe;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:110845:60"/>
                     <q>—Petit ardua virtus:</q>
But ſhe affects induſtry, triumphing in the midſt of moſt imminent danger: which made <hi>Hercules</hi> forſake the path of pleaſure, becauſe it was wide, broad, and eaſie to be traced; and turn into the way of Vertue, whereunto the paſſage is hard, and the aſcent difficult. Nor muſt we only deſpiſe all labours and difficulty in aſcending the Pyramid of Vertue; but when we are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed therewith, we muſt with far more courage and magnanimity endure all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, ſorrows and afflictions. Now there is no misfortune, how great ſoever, but ſhe can withſtand, and with her own power overcome. This excellency of mind is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fortitude, an affection that ſubmits to Vertue by conſtant and patient ſuffering. The nature and ſubſtance of Prudence, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Temperance, is ſoft and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate without Fortitude: for it is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to think and act only; but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Vertue is to think and execute conſtantly, manfully, and valiantly. All commendation due to Fortitude, conſiſteth in Domeſtical, and Publike or Military actions. Domeſtical Fortitude adorns a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:110845:60"/>
Man; and her quality is to remove all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind, Fear, Sorrow, Anger, Voluptuouſneſs, and every other exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affection. Fortitude Military conſiſts in undergoing all perils and dangers, all labour and hardſhip, that ſo a man may be able to look death in the face, if his country or a good cauſe require it. He muſt look to lie ſometimes at the ſigne of the Star, and have his bed feathered with the down of Heaven; lie down a Man, and riſe a Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball; gnaw Match, inſtead of Liquoriſh; He muſt fear nothing; contemn all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and be reſolved to ſuffer whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can befall him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is the duty of our Senator to be ſo couragiouſly affected and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that all his gifts of body and mind be as with a certain ſauce ſeaſoned with Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; for, as without ſalt all meats, ſo all Vertues without Fortitude are judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury. This is that which defendeth both body and mind from the cruel ſhock of misfortune. This is that which renders us quiet and peaceable in Prudence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in Temperance, and ſtout, valiant and invincible in Juſtice. Yet is there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be declined in this Vertue; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fool-hardy, proud, raſh, timerous, ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:110845:61"/>
or puny-ſpirited; For, he that intends to gain the reputation of valiant, muſt be pricked forward by no other ſpur than Glory, Renown, or Vertue;
<q>—Immenſem gloria calcar habet.</q>

                  <p>The People of <hi>Numantia</hi> choſe rather to be maſſacred, than yield to the merciful enemy; and the Saguntines were guided by the ſame Precepts: but we muſt never act any thing deſperately. Well might that Roman <hi>Demoſthenes Cicero</hi> ſay, <hi>Injuſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimam pacem bello juſtiſsimo antefero;</hi> I prefer the moſt unjuſt Peace before the moſt juſt War. Now he that deſpairs, flees from Fortitude; and it is an argument of a dunghil-ſpirit, to ſeek death by ſhewing the heel through fear and puſillanimity. But a valiant man deſpiſeth life judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fighteth ſtoutly; not as one deſtitute of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:110845:61"/>
all hope; but, becauſe he is grounded on this perſwaſion, that it becomes him ſo to deport himſelf: which moves him rather to chooſe an honourable death, than blur his life with the ſtain of reproach. This Vertue hath many Concomitants, which with ſome other qualifications ſhall be the ſubject of the enſuing Chapter.</p>

                  <p>THis Vertue, as is before mentioned, wants not her retinue of other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick actions embalm the memories of Magnanimous ſpirits, and preſerve them ſweet and freſh, maugre the malignity of fickle Fortune, or the ſucceſſion of Ages.

                  <p>Beſides, our Senator muſt beſtow gifts voluntarily and liberally, and receive them with a modeſt bluſh, and a kind of unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling willingneſs, following the counſel of <hi>Heſiod,</hi> who teacheth, that a good turn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſhould be returned with Intereſt; for the Recipient is inferiour to the Donor. <hi>Taxilis,</hi> an Indian King, meeting with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:110845:62"/>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> informs us) accoſted him in this manner: <hi>Noble Monarch, I challenge you, not to war, or duel; but to another kind of combat: if you be our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, receive a benefit; if our Superiour, beſtow one on us.</hi> To whom <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, as the Story farther informs us, <hi>This contention is laudable, and ſuits with Our Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for we ſhould endeavour to exceed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in well doing:</hi> and cloſed theſe words with an embrace; ſuffering him to enjoy his Kingdom, with additions. Among thoſe of the more noble extract, let him behave himſelf with a well-balaſted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, and be the diſcreet Herald of his own praiſe; but among thoſe of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour allay (the vulgar I mean) he muſt abſtain from ſo doing, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects: for in the one, it attracts love; in the other, it cauſeth hatred.</p>
                  <p>Next, it behoveth our Senator in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and events to be conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and not like <hi>Proteus,</hi> capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all ſhapes. The conſtancy of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> deſerves no mean commendation, conſidered as he was a Heathen; for <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the Tyrant, demanding his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in marriage, he retorted, That he had rather ſee her wedded to her Grave, than
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:110845:63"/>
to a Tyrant: and having ſlain her, he was re-demanded, whether he had changed his opinion; he replied, He was ſorry for the fact, but glad that he had ſo expreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Who can but admire the conſtancy of <hi>Cato?</hi> Who, if we may relie upon the Records of the Ancients, was ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to keep the ſame countenance, as well when he was repulſed and accuſed, as when he was Praetor: being ſtill immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Counſel, War, at the time of his Death, and when that pannick fear ague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhook his whole Country; <hi>Caeſar</hi> being victorious, and as a Tyrant uſurping the Government of the Republick. <hi>Xantippe,</hi> who was the <hi>Billingſgate</hi> Wife of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the wife Philoſopher (if a modern title may be applied to an ancient ſcold) could utter this to his eternal honour, that ſhe alwaies obſerved he went out and returned with the ſame countenance; for indeed, he was ſo rarely qualified, that no violent or impetuous guſts of adverſity could ſhake him out of his conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed temper. Merit will be crowned with her deſerved bayes, <hi>Velit nolit invidiae,</hi> in ſpight of fate; or elſe her very enemies will lend a helping hand. It becomes him therefore to be a fixed ſtar, no Planet, in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:110845:63"/>
his own Sphere; like <hi>Regulu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> who rather than the Captives ſhould be reſtored, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered himſelf into the hands of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi> It is reported, that when <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontos,</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> had vanquiſhed <hi>Anaxarchus;</hi> he told him, he might <hi>proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu,</hi> as he pleaſed, torment and wrack his body, but he could never prejudice the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his mind; that would be ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable. Yet he muſt be wary that his conſtancy extend only to juſt cauſes and ends; for to defend any conceit by ſtrength of ſophiſtical diſſertations, againſt the opinion of wiſe men, is an argument of a perverſe and obſtinate, no conſtant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: For in vain were all our conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if like the River <hi>Euripus,</hi> they ebb and flow at no certainty. In Council, as he muſt be active, ſo like a ſtone he muſt be mute, and not divulgive, becauſe there paſs many things in conſultations which are to be communicated neither to ſtrangers, nor domeſtical friends; and it is the property of a light and unſettled head, to blab all myſteries ſpoken in Council: as if they could receive nothing, but like ſqueamiſh ſtomachs they muſt immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt it up. The Romans would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Senators <hi>Pedarii,</hi> when they had any weighty matter in hand, nor any of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:110845:64"/>
the Clerks to be preſent; but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves debated it. At firſt, indeed, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-houſe was open to all young men, that were deſcended of the <hi>Patricii;</hi> till after that noble and memorable part acted by <hi>Papyrius,</hi> they were forbidden; leſt through the unſetledneſs of greener heads, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of State ſhould be divulged, and the Republick thereby damnified: who being one day queſtioned by his Mother, what matter was ſo long in debate among them, and compelled to give ſome anſwer; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied merrily, Whether it were more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Common-wealth, that one man ſhould have two Wives, or one woman have two Husbands: and ſo by diſſembling the truth, came off handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſatisfying his Mother without prejudice to the Senate or the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>The next Concomitant of Fortitude is Patience, which (according to <hi>Tully)</hi> is a voluntary and continual enduring of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe fortune, either for credit or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; which are the two Poles about which the World moves; and the uſe hereof is in war greateſt. For they that are Men of war, Souldiers, adventure their lives for their Country, and undergo all perils and dangers whatſoever, with a patient,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:110845:64"/>
reſolute, and undaunted mind.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Coriolanus</hi> had taken it patiently when he had a repulſe for aſpiring to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, he had manifeſted himſelf diſcreet, and his life had not been attended by ſo many diſaſters. Patience is the <hi>Panacea</hi> of all griefs: ſor things paſt that are irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, may be endured, though not amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He that cannot undergo the bitter chance of misfortune, is but a bearded wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: yet in the exerciſe of patience, we muſt be very circumſpect that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and greatneſs, the quantity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of injuries do not diſcompoſe us: for, <hi>Laeſa patientia fit furor;</hi> Patience abuſed is turned into fury.</p>
                  <p>Confidence is another of Fortitudes Aſſociates, which is a certain conceit or aſſurance of mind that we ſhall have fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſucceſs; encouraging, and fetting us forward to the atchievement of noble and heroick performances. He that is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is a perfect ſtranger to cowardly fear. It is ſtoried of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that ſeeing <hi>Caius Crastinus</hi> prepared for the Pharſalick war with hope of ſucceſs, asked him what he thought would be the event of the battel: whereunto <hi>Craſtinus</hi> (holding up his hand armed) anſwered, <hi>Caeſar, thou ſhalt be</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:110845:65"/>
                     <hi>victorious, and have cauſe to commend me dead or alive:</hi> which accordingly fell out, and he was ſlain in the skirmiſh; whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> aſſembled his Army, and made an Oration in his praiſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, that men, according to the ſucceſs they have already had, judge of the future in their proceedings. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that <hi>Antonius</hi> was alwaies accompanied with an Egyptian Philoſopher, who, by the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of mens looks, would give a ſhrewd gueſs at their diſpoſition, fortune, and deſtiny: He did very much expatiate upon the felicity of <hi>Antonius,</hi> but more upon that of <hi>Octavius;</hi> ſaying, That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that waited on <hi>Octavius</hi> was more powerful than that that attended <hi>Antonius;</hi> which he conceived, becauſe in gaming, Cock, or Quail-fighting, he had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hap, and was moſt fortunate; beſides other conjectures. It is thought, nay, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that every King, Prince, and Perſon hath a certain Guardian Angel; which Spirits are by <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> called <hi>Genii;</hi> and by others <hi>Lares, Daemones, Lemures;</hi> and by us, <hi>Angeli:</hi> which, as they affirm, aſſiſt them in battel, and inform them what is to be done. Of which there are two ſorts, the one good, the other evill. We read that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:110845:65"/>
                     <hi>Uladiſlaus Jagelonus</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> in the <hi>Pruſsian</hi> war againſt the Germans, ſpied an Angel armed aſſiſting him; whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly called <hi>Divum Staniſlaum:</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this ſpectacle, he fought reſolutely, came off victorious, and in ſpight of the Tyrants fury delivered <hi>Pruſsia. Plutarch</hi> tells us of an evil Angel that ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <hi>Brutus;</hi> who being in conſultation about the management of war, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a man ſtanding before him of a prodigious bulk: he demanding of him, Who he was; received this anſwer, That he was his evil Spirit, whom he ſhould ſee in the <hi>Philippick</hi> war: which proved true; for thereby he did not only prognoſticate his ill ſucceſs, but his death alſo, which accordingly happened. That the Romans relied much upon the predictions of their Spirits, appears, by the Inſcriptions of the Roman Coyns: <hi>Genius Auguſti, Genius Senatus, Genius Populi Romani;</hi> and thereupon <hi>Ovid</hi> ſings,
<q>Et vigilant noſtra ſemper in urbe Lares.</q>
But to paſs by all theſe Phancies; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conduceth more to the perfecting of a Conquerour, than Confidence; which our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:110845:66"/>
Senator muſt be endowed with; for many times all other helps and hopes fail, when this remains for the laſt Refuge.</p>
                  <p>Security brings up the rear of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of that Noble General Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; which as it is the end of a good, ſo is it of a valiant life; and hereby we gain tranquillity of mind. He that hath Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is in the ſame condition he was before his Birth: my Author is <hi>Cicero.</hi> Now, this Security tends to a peaceable and quiet life in a Republick, which is commonly termed, Common Felicity. Yet our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity muſt have a better foundation than an airy conceit; Sloath, Careleſneſs, or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. <hi>Pompeius,</hi> being Commander of numerous Forces, and going to wage war with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſeem'd ſecure; yet ſome of his captains, that feared the vigilancy of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> adviſed him to be diligent: to whom he ſaid, All was ſecure, and they might <hi>in utramque aurem dormire,</hi> take their reſt, and ſleep ſecurely. But this Security cauſed his flight, and by conſequence his overthrow. This is an errour incident to moſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Republicks; who being ruſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with peace, and grown hoary, as it were, with quietneſs, think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, when as they are ſloathful, cowardly, dull, and negligent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:110845:66"/>
The Roman Empire was extreamly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by their Vertue Military; inſomuch that their Eagles flew as far, if not father, than the current of their Laws did run. This <hi>Metropolis,</hi> from the time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> till the reign of <hi>Octavius Augustus,</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unarm'd. But <hi>Octavius</hi> finding a general peace all the World over, cauſed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Janus</hi> (which ſtood open in time of univerſal peace only,) to be ſhut; as if thereby the State ſhould be for ever ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Martial tumults. <hi>Rome</hi> being by this means ſecured, no ſucceeding Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour opened the Temple of <hi>Janus:</hi> ſo that from that time the People embraced an idle lazy life; whence it followed, that in proceſs of time all Countries, Cities and Kingdoms ſhook off the Roman Yoke, and purchaſed their own liberty; whereas ſhe, quite-diſarm'd, became ſubject to the <hi>Goths.</hi> We therefore approve of no other Security in our Counſellor, but ſuch, as wanteth not care and proviſion to repel danger and misfortune when they begin to encroach upon us. And happy is that Kingdom, that in time of peace prepares for war. It will not be amiſs, I preſume, to inform you what men are to be judged va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and the rewards due unto ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:110845:67"/>
ſo judged. Some there are, that only led with love to Vertue, grounded upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Principles, chooſe rather to hazard their lives and bodies in fight, than in time of neceſſity to abandon their Prince, Country, or Friends. We find it recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Roman, German, and French Captains did alwaies animate their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fight, with perſwaſions of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious power of their great Forces, the Valour of their General, the Virtue of their Anceſtors, and the numerous ſpoils taken from the enemy: but the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Polonia</hi> uſe no other argument or compellation than this; Let every perſon be mindful of his own Virtue, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar reputation: which only Sentence did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>Polonians,</hi> whoſe fixed reſolution it is to fight till Victory ſeats her ſelf upon their Banners, or die in the Field. Now, he that ſtands thus affected to Vertue and Honeſty, may lawfully be termed Valiant. Which ſort of men are not to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their reward, and badges of honours, as Enſigns of their Loyalty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to their King. It is but reaſon and equity, that after the turmoyls of War, they ſhould be cloathed with long Robes, and enjoy the tranquillity of a ſerene, quiet
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:110845:67"/>
and peaceable life. In <hi>Rome,</hi> all ſuch Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were adopted Senators, as brought home any ſpoyl that did belong to the Perſon of the enemy, or that wore a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for ſaving a Citizen in fight. Thoſe that had born office in the field for the ſpace of ten years, were admitted to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrates. Nay, <hi>Regulus</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the dignity of a Senator, was ſo much diſturbed at the affront, that he tore his cloaths, and manifeſted the wounds of his body that he had received in battel; thereby claiming a place in the Senate-houſe; and made a ſuccinct relation of thoſe martial ſervices he had done for the good of his Country; which wrought ſo much upon the Senate, that he was re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his former dignity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> affirm, that anger is <hi>Cos fortitudinis,</hi> the whetſtone of Fortitude; and men lightly moved thereby, attempt all things with the more vivacity and ſprightlineſs. Yet our Senator muſt be careful that he avoid all fury and outrage in the uſe thereof, leſt he be branded with madneſs, and loſe the title of Valiant; which may be effected by making Anger a Companion, no Commander of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. There is nothing more misbecoming
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:110845:68"/>
any man (eſpecially a Counſellor) than Anger: for he that is overſwayed with that furious paſſion, becomes like a brute beaſt, whoſe property it is to ſeek revenge in the heat and height of fury. Wherefore in all enterpriſes, let Honeſty bring up the front, or be Commander; and Anger be Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General. <hi>Plato</hi> the Divine calls An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, The Sinews of the mind, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe is ſtretched and ſcrued up, and by Lenity let down. And he that engageth with an enemy, prompted to his enterprize by no other inſtigation than Anger, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the name of Cholerick, and not Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; becauſe he undertakes the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his affairs, moved thereunto by a certain perturbation of mind, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or honour. Wherefore it was well ſaid by the Epicure, <hi>Anger is the iſſue of Madneſs;</hi> which is a prejudicial to the health of the body, as the perfection of the mind. Some there are that aſcribe more to Fortune, than, if rightly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhe can lay claime to; and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with this conceit, only cry out <hi>Victoria,</hi> before they do <hi>claſsicum canere;</hi> which, as we ſay, count their Chickens before they be hatcht. For although the force of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be great, and moſt conſiderable in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:110845:68"/>
War, (becauſe it is moſt prevalent in thoſe things where reaſon is leaſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) yet muſt we not rely upon her ſo much, as altogether to forſake all advice and conſultation; for, thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by reaſon, want not the Auſpices of Fortune. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſuing for peace with <hi>Scipio,</hi> expreſſed himſelf as followeth; I have been inſtructed by good and bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſo well, that I am ſenſible it is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to relie on Reaſon, than Fortune. For ſhe often fails when a man is come to the laſt pinch of extremity; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more fickle and inconſtant; ſhe's a Female, and will wax and wane twice in a minute; and blinds the judgement of thoſe that bridle not her head-ſtrong fury. Therefore let our Senator be <hi>ſuae fortunae fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the hammer of his own fortune; and make way for his ſucceſs by his valour and magnanimity, and then ſhe will afford aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; for ſhe lacqueys reaſon, as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow doth the body. It is the opinion of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that in war evill fortune accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the bad, and good fortune the good. <hi>Alexander, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> were fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but not ſo much through the aide of that fickle Lady, as the aſſiſtance of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the benefit of Vertue. Yet he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:110845:69"/>
behaves himſelf wiſely, that takes Fortune and Opportunity when it is offered: for, <hi>poſt est occaſio calva;</hi> he muſt take her by the foretop, becauſe ſhe's bald behind; and once paſt, is paſt recovery. Now, ſome there are, that if they find ſucceſs in their undertakings, immediately aſcribe all to Fortune as the Authoreſs, as is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet there is no man that may be termed wiſe, but ſcorns to make her the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectreſs of his actions.</p>
                  <p>Now, to the perfection of our Senators body, (for we have already diſcourſed of the endowments of the mind.) The goods of the body conſiſt partly in the whole body, and partly in ſome particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: Health, ſtrength and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are required in the whole body; but perfect ſence, and agility, and activeneſs in ſome peculiar members only. And as there is a conſent or harmony between the body and mind; ſo is there a certain cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency and ſimilitude between the vertues of them both. Health reſembleth Juſtice; becauſe it reduceth the different conſtitutions of the body to an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, and they both conſpire to make the body and mind perfect. Strength is compared to Fortitude; becauſe they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:110845:69"/>
mutually aſſiſt one another in the undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of perils and dangers. Soundneſs of body is aſſimilated to Prudence: for as Prudence makes a reconciliation between all opinions and judgments, till they ſhake hands; ſo in a ſound body, all parts unite their forces together, to make it up perfect. Health doth very much avail; for in all our actions ſhe ſets us forward with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and delight; whereas ſickneſs debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the body, and hinders it from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a deſign: She's not to be had by price, ſaith the Lyrick Poet,
<q>
                        <hi>—Non gemmis neque purpura venale nec auro.</hi>
                     </q>
Neither Gold nor Silver can purchaſe it. The multitude of Acres will not cure ſo much as the head-ach; nor the tumbling over of your Bags, the rich-Gout, Stone, or Collick. It is a free gift of the Creator, as from the prime efficient; but good diet and exerciſe is the ſecundary cauſe: Therefore our Senator muſt take heed leſt he deſtroy or loſe this ineſtimable Jewel by Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy. Health (ſaith the Prince of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) is maintained by knowing a mans own body, and taking an obſervation of thoſe things which agree or diſagree moſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:110845:70"/>
with the natural conſtitution; as alſo by continency in diet, and contempt of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: what elſe remains, muſt be fetch'd out of the volumes of thoſe two famous pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius, Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates. Diogenes</hi> uſed to laugh them to ſcorn, that thought to procure health, being diſtempered, by ſacrificing to the Gods; and yet wallow all their life-time in debauchery and exceſs. Let our Senator therefore be, as the Phyſicians term it, Sanguine or Cholerick; for thoſe humours encline men to be ingenious, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, healthy, and of large memories. <hi>Ariſtatle</hi> ſaith, Melancholick men are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe they being ſubject to anger, are apt to have divine cogitations, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found thoughts; yet are they to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Council, becauſe the humour moſt predominant in ſuch perſons is cold and dry; which makes their conſultations ſolitary, ſowre, ſad and dull: for a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly perſon is nothing but a lump of quickned care; whereas the merry ſoul is blithe, pleaſant, affable and debonair. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> chancing to meet with that paſſage in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that melancholick perſons were ingenious; with a ſmile, ſaid, He rejoyced extremely, that Nature had favoured him
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:110845:70"/>
ſo far, as to make him dull witted, and not melancholick. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being deſired to take heed of a corpulent, merry, jovial perſon; ſaid, Such perſons were not to be feared, but thoſe rather that were ſad, of a ſwarthy meagre complexion; pointing to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius.</hi> Nor do we approve of phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick perſons, as fit for Senators; leſt their croſs humour be a diſturbance to all the reſt, and ſo prove offenſive: for, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the phlegmatick is Saturnine, ſlow and dull; ſo likewiſe is the diſpoſition of their mind.</p>
                  <p>Good proportion and comlineſs of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is requiſite in our Senator; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Poet,
<q>Gratior eſt pulchro veniens &amp; corpore virtus.</q>
Now I call that comlineſs in him, which ſhews him to be manly, and not effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, in tall perſons there is no great vertue, and in the ſhort or low of ſtature, little; therefore let him be of a moderate ſize. His body muſt not be groſs, nor yet lean and dry, like a Skeleton or Anatomy. For, the former is unapt for travel, and the latter over-weak to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure hardſhip. Beſides, great notice ſhould
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110845:71"/>
be taken of thoſe that Nature hath mark'd with any deformity, or defect of Member, as the want of an eye: For ſuch perſons are counted crafty and ſubtile, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Conſultation, (had this been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among us, <hi>Hewſon</hi> had never ſate ſo oft in Council.) Yet, notwithſtanding all theſe niceties of features and comelineſs, if any ſuch perſon, though deformed in body, be perfect in mind; he ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: for the excellency of Vertue over-comes the imperfection of Nature. And though the inward diſpoſition is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times known by the outward complexion; yet is not the conjecture of the virtues of the mind by the lineaments of the body ſo certain, but that it may fail: for many there be, who are rough-hewn without, but neatly poliſht within. Nor can deformity of body blemiſh the mind, though the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the mind beautifie that of the body. Nor doth Vertue confine her ſelf either to beauty or deformity, meanneſs or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ſometimes dwels with ruſſet hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, in the low cottage, as well as with plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med gallantry in lofty Palaces. So that not the countenance of a Senator is altogether to be regarded, but his mind and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:110845:71"/>
Now, to the Robes and Veſture of our Senator: He muſt be decently apparelled, according to his degree and dignity; for the comely ornament of a garment adds a reverence to his perſon; and by his Robes he is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſorts and kinds of perſons. The Roman Senators wore a Garment ſet full of ſtuds or tufts of Gold; and on their Hoſe did they wear the form of the Moon; which was the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance or hadge of great honour. This kind of Ornament the Romans were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to other Nations for, according to all probability; for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet foretold the Noble women of <hi>Judaea,</hi> that God would take away thoſe Moons and Ornaments of the Hoſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alledgeth four cauſes of this faſhioned Hoſe among the Romans, which for the Readers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and recreation I ſhall here rehearſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe their ſuperſtition taught them, that the ſouls of their <hi>Heroes</hi> ſhould be led the neareſt way to Heaven by the light of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was, that the Sign of the Moon did manifeſt their deſcent from the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who came into <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were ſo lunatick as to imagine themſelves more ancient than the Moon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:110845:72"/>
The third cauſe that mov'd them to the wearing of the Moon, was, to the end that in proſperity it might be as a <hi>memento</hi> unto them of the mutability and inconſtancy of Fortune. For, as the Moon is ſometimes partly lightned, and partly darkned; ſo no honour or felicity can be ſo clear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent, but it may ſomtimes be overcaſt with clouds of obloquy and malice.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe was, that as the Moon drinks in all her light from the Sun; ſo ought all men to think themſelves indebted to heaven for their wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who affirm, that the Roman Senators did not wear the figure of the Moon, but the proportion of the letter <hi>C.</hi> as though the hundred that <hi>Romulus</hi> choſe to be <hi>Patres</hi> (as he call'd them) ſhould thence take their Title. It hath ever been a Cuſtom in all Kingdoms, Republicks, and well-govern'd States heretofore, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Degrees of men by their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and without doubt this is of much moment to make them conſtant and ſettled in their profeſſions. Among the Romans no man might be adorned with Purple, but Senators, Magiſtrates, Prieſts, and the Younger ſort that were of noble ranke and quality. I omit the mentioning of Rings,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110845:72"/>
Chains, and Bracelets, which were beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on vertuous perſons, advanced to digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as encouragements. Though theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms now adaies are obſolete, ſince the alteration of vertues, manners and times; for <hi>Jone</hi> is as neatly trickt up as my Lady, and the Artizan as the Gentleman: It is moſt certain, that by ornaments and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional titles of honour men are put in mind of their duty; and thereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute all things with the more eagerneſs and diligence. Scepters, Crowns, Chains, Rings, Gowns, Robes and Saddles, are no dignities, but the badges of Dignity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are ſtirred up and encouraged to perform what is requiſite in the office and place whereunto thoſe Badges belong. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Livy)</hi> intending to take the Government of a ſtrange People upon him, did adorn himſelf with his majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Robes, and called twelve Lictors with Maces, to attend upon his perſon, that he might thereby appear with greater pomp and oſtentation, and ſo captivate the hearts of the people: for the Vulgar (like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) are hugely taken with the outward face and appearance of things; and mind the outward bark more than the inward ſubſtance. Our Senator therefore ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:110845:73"/>
ſuch a <hi>decorum</hi> in his apparel, as not to encline to lightneſs or fooliſh gallantry, ſo to decline all ſlovinglineſs and ruſticity: As he muſt not be like the Frenchified Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, who when he hath once ſeen <hi>Paris,</hi> comes over metamorphos'd both in body and mind; dancing out an entertainment to his friend with a giddy feather in his Crown: no more muſt he be like the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bak'd-peaſant, who underſtands nothing of ceremony or civility beſides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his plough, and underſtands no other Gammut but <hi>Hay, gee, ho,</hi> which he ſigns to his country Teem when they draw the Plow that furrows the face of the Earth. He muſt ever obſerve ſuch a comly neatneſs, as may ſpeak him man, and not woman; utterly declining and abhorring all nice curioſity.</p>

                  <p>THe major part of the wiſdom of a Counſellor conſiſts in the knowledge of the Manners, Laws and Cuſtoms of all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:110845:73"/>
Nations; which is beſt attained by forrain Travel, as <hi>Homer</hi> ſings of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>Dic mihi Muſa virum captae poſt tempora Trojae,</l>
                        <l>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit, &amp; urbes.</l>
                     </q>
And indeed, there is nothing accompliſhes a man more than forrain Travel. <hi>In motu melas.</hi> There is a certain kind of harmony in motion. And as the Maſter of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hath it, <hi>Plebeiae ſane ſunt iſtae animae, quae ſuis affixae trabibus domi reſident; illa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinior, quae coelum imitatur, &amp; gaudet motu.</hi> Thoſe are dunghil ſpirits, that live confin'd to the narrow round of the place of their nativity; and that ſoul is of a more noble allay, that like the Heavens rejoyceth in motion. Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> writes, that a mans beſt friends in Travel is his coyn: yet under favour, notwithſtanding the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſo learned a Grandee, if a man be accompanied with too many of theſe friends, his journey will be <hi>motus trepidati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis;</hi> for according to the nipping Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
<q>
                        <l>Pauca licet portes argenti vaſcula puri;</l>
                        <l>Nocte iter ingreſſus gladium, contumque timebis,</l>

                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:110845:74"/>
Whereas, as he immediately affirms,
<q>Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.</q>
The indigent Traveller ſhall ſing before a <hi>Qui va la?</hi> or High-way-man. Yet would not we have our Counſellor ſo deſtitute of money, as thereby to expoſe himſelf to hardſhip and diſtreſs; but ſo handſomly accommodated, as that he may take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of all Countries with honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Yet in travelling, he muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that he only come over again furniſhed and full fraughted with thoſe Laws and Cuſtomes that are honeſt and civil, and leave thoſe that are erroneous and evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. For,
<q>Terras, non animos mutant, qui tranſmare currunt.</q>
Or at leaſt they ſhould do ſo, and not like ſome green heads that corrupt themſelves, and learn nothing but the ſuperſtitious Idolatrous ceremonies of other Countries, and be ſure to retain what is bad, though it prove to their own prejudice and ruine. He muſt be very exact in informing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what Laws, Juriſdictions, what order of life, military Diſcipline, civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:110845:74"/>
and domeſtical life is in every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on practiſed. He ſhall take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſituation of Countries and places, the building of Cities, their Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Strength and Ammunition. Let him alſo underſtand the vertue of every Prince; how his People ſtand affected to him, and upon what terms; the wiſdom of their Senate, the form and method of their Conſultations, as far as without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to himſelf it may be pried into; the nature and ingenuity of the people; what vertues they adhere to, and what vices they are moſt addicted unto; what Learned men, Souldiers and Commanders are in every Country to be found out; that ſo by the report of them to his own Nation, the beſt precepts may be cull'd out, and the reſt rejected. Yet he muſt take heed, leſt by the new-fangled faſhions that he brings over, he make not the people effeminate, and careleſs of their own Laws, Cuſtoms, and ancient vertues: for as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Est natura hominum novitatis avida:</hi> Man's nature prompts him to embrace Novelty, which oftentimes proves pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and tends to the moleſtation of the Kingdom, Republick, or State. Many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous perſons have taken delight in travel,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:110845:75"/>
as <hi>Neſtor, Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, out of love thereunto, <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> that merrily paſſed his time away, travelled all over <hi>Aegypt, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> thereby hoping to obtain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſo their minds being ſtored with variety of obſervation, they might be the more accompliſhed, and remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their own fortune. The words that <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reports to be written upon the Tomb of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> are worthy the quotation and remembrance; which are theſe, or to this effect: <hi>Oſiris Rex ſum, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turm antiquior filius, qui nullum orbis locum reliqui, quem non attigerim, diſcens ea omnia, quae generi humano utilia ſunt, &amp; neceſſaria.</hi> But if he want money to ſupport him in travel, let him employ his time in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Geography, and Coſmography: And a ſmack he may have of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; but to conſume much time in that Science, is judg'd, by ſome, ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a Senator. The field of knowledge is unmeaſurable and infinite; which was the reaſon that men applied themſelves to one particular Art or Science. <hi>Aliquis in omnibus,</hi> and <hi>nullus in ſingulis,</hi> is no fit Motto for a Counſellor. Wherefore, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Juriſdiction of our Senator two
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:110845:75"/>
ſorts of Countries; the one is that which containeth both God and Man (not as if we preſcribed God his place of reſidence, but we ſpeak here according to vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities) not limited within the bounds of <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> or <hi>Africa;</hi> but is only ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the poſting Sun. The other is the place that Nature hath deſtined for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence or being, as <hi>England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. For it belongs unto him to take a ſurvey of the order and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Macrocoſm,</hi> the univerſal World, which the Latines call, <hi>Majorem Mundum;</hi> as well as the <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> or little World, where he hath his habitation and abode, which they term, <hi>Minorem mundum.</hi> And when the mind is diſmanacled of thoſe worldly incumbrances which uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the body, and by Travel and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is perfected, as much as lies within the verge of humanity to be; ſhe officiates as ſhe ought, affecting Vertue, and diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Vice, ſuppreſſing the luſty inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the fleſh, and like a Monarch curbing and giving Laws to all exorbitant affections. Nay further, when the mind hath pried into the nature of the Heavens, conſidered their harmonious motion, knows the circumference of the Earth, her
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:110845:76"/>
Longitude, Latitude, and the rarities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein; hath plough'd the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd Ocean, and ſeen the wonders of the deep, underſtands their cauſes, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ends; what is the order and beauty of the glimmering Lights of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and what influence they have upon ſublunary bodies: what cauſeth the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or <hi>deliquia</hi> of the two Grand Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Sun and Moon; the reaſon of their Riſing and Setting, their Diurnal, Nocturnal and horary motion; what is the generation and corruption of all things; what the nature of the Elements, of Animals, and the vertue and beauty of that innumerable number of fragrant herbs that uſually adorn the Earth: when, I ſay, all theſe things are underſtood by one ſingle perſon, and God acknowledged the Supreme Author and Governour of them all; Shall not that Perſon be judged a Prince, rather than a meer Inhabitant or Citizen of the World, that is of ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and polite an underſtanding? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yes. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who by the Oracle at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi> was pronounced the wiſeſt of Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, being demanded what Country-man he was; replied, <hi>A man of the World;</hi> not confining himſelf to any particular
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:110845:76"/>
place or Country; for he thought himſelf to be an univerſal Prince. The ſame <hi>Laerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> reports of that Tub-hugging Cynick <hi>Diogenes. Omne ſolum forti patria,</hi> is an old ſaying; and <hi>Omne ſolum ſapienti patria,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as much truth with it, as the former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. The whole World is a Wiſe man's Country: 'Tis a City that comes not under the tyrannous ſcourge of any <hi>Nero, Domitian,</hi> or <hi>Caligula;</hi> Nor can be envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with walls, but is ſurrounded with the univerſal Circle, governed by a comly order, and natural <hi>decorum,</hi> as it were with a Law certain and inviolable, palizadoed with no other fortifications than the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Citizens or Inhabitants of this place are termed Philoſophers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded only by themſelves, fortified with invincible minds, and ſufficiently arm'd againſt the griping talons of penury, or any other misfortune that can ſeize upon man. Such Perſons (nay, Princes as theſe, I may ſay, without entrenching on the Royal Charter of Kings) no fury of War can terrifie, no Faggot frighten, nor Axe diſturb; for they are all valiant, reſolute, and beyond the prejudice of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Now, to the Age and Gravity of our Senator. They that have penned any thing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:110845:77"/>
of the life of man, did uſually confine it to a certain proportion of time. <hi>Plato</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth eighty one years; <hi>Solon,</hi> eighty; others affirm, that the continuance of mans life extends but to ſeventy, referring all to the number ſeven, becauſe it frequently fals out, that every ſeventh year ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or change appears in the body. The firſt ſeven years, Childrens teeth fall out; The next ſeven, their hair grows; The third, their body comes to its proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and height; The fourth, they encreaſe in bulk and thickneſs; The fifth, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at their full ſtrength and virility; The ſixth, they find themſelves addicted to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight; The ſeventh, they come to the maturity and ripeneſs of wit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; The eighth, they begin to be termed aged, or ancient; The ninth, weak and feeble, beholding to the ſupport of the ſtaff, and the help of Spectacles; And the tenth, they have one foot in the grave, and are reckoned to be <hi>è peculio Proſerpinae,</hi> of <hi>Proſerpina</hi>'s fold. Others there are, who maintain that this change happens every ninth year, and ſo aſcribe the alteration thereof to every unequal number till twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and one. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the ſilent, called the eightieth year of mans Age fatal, dividing it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:110845:77"/>
into four times twenty, as followeth: Childhood, continues till twenty; Youth, other twenty; Man's eſtate, the other twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and old Age, the fourth, which puts a period to all. Some again compare Mans Age to the four Seaſons of the Year: Childhood, is compared to the Spring; Youth, to Summer; Manhood, to Autumn; and Old-Age, to Winter. <hi>Varro</hi> divides Man's Age into four degrees, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends every of them within the number of fifteen: Childhood (ſaith he) laſts till fifteen, for ſo long Children are weak and tender; Youth, till thirty, becauſe till that Age men encreaſe and grow in height and thickneſs; Ripe Age till forty five, for ſo long ſtrength of body continues, and men are then fit to be employed in publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; Old-Age begins at ſixty, and then the body is impotent, crazy and decay'd; ſo that they are not fit for State-employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lingring, and conſuming till death come and trip up their heels, as he did all their Anceſtors before them. To this divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mans Age we aſſent; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction by number doth principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Phyſicians; for they in exhibiting their medicines, obſerve certain critical daies. But our opinion is, that the forty
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:110845:78"/>
fifth year of man's age is moſt ſuitable for Conſulation; becauſe then the ſtrength both of body and mind is arrived to the very height. Beſides, it is the middle age of Man; and at that time, if ever, the mind is perfect in judgement and experience, leſs attracted with brutiſh affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and leaſt of all tranſported with rage, fury, or paſſion. When old <hi>Rome</hi> was in her glory, and ſhone with all her ſplendor, Senators were choſen at that Age, being then moſt perfect in body and mind: yet dare we not deny, but that ſome men may be termed Aged at thirty; that is, are both prudent, grave and wiſe. And we find it upon record, that ſome, though very few, were created Senators by the Romans before the thirtieth year of their Age; which we do not diſallow, in regard that men may be reputed ancient for vertue as well as number of years: yet care muſt be taken that the Kingdom be governed chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by mature and grave Head-pieces; for as <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, that Kingdom is moſt happy that hath ſtore of young mens Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and old mens Laws. Pertinent is that of <hi>Euripides</hi> to this purpoſe: <hi>Dictum eſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſtu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> facta Juvenum, caeterum magis valent concilia Senum.</hi> In <hi>Athens</hi> no perſon was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:110845:78"/>
created Senator before he was fifty years old. And in <hi>Rome</hi> it was permitted for any man of ſixty to enter the Senate-houſe, though he never came to the Senatorſhip by choice or election; and after that year, it was left to his pleaſure to be preſent or abſent; ſo that they did neither bind him to, nor bar him from coming to Council. A good, though ancient Cuſtom; for every man, though he hath ſeen as many Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as hoary-headed <hi>Neſtor,</hi> ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf <hi>pro poſſe ſuo,</hi> according to his utmoſt ability, for the benefit of his native Country. <hi>Plato</hi> is of opinion, that men muſt learn till Age ſnow white hairs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads. <hi>Nulla dies ſine linea;</hi> that day is loſt, in which a man hath not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his knowledge. Yet we prohibit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, doting perſons, whoſe judgements are as crazy as their bodies; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe their counſels and conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for the moſt part dubious, and are rather he ſitant conjectures than ſolid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, beginning every Sentence with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, perchance, peradventure, and the like: and this they do, as being ſenſible of their former imbecility and weakneſs, and ſo are unwilling to ſuffer a relapſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their juvenile and youthful errours and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:110845:79"/>
miſtakes. Yet, if they have only ſo many years over their heads as may render them grave, ſolid and wife, they are perfect in uttering their conceits: for by uſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience (which is the beſt School-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris) they have gain'd, as it were, a third eye, whereby they are enabled to pry into, and diſcern with the more vivacity, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and cauſes of things. And as every man is diſcovered by his ſpeech, ſo is the prudence and wiſdom of a Senator mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by uttering his opinion. <hi>Socrates,</hi> caſting his eye upon a Youth that he never had ſeen before, ſaies to him, <hi>Speak, that I may know thee:</hi> So may we ſay to our Counſellor, <hi>By the ſolidity of thy ſpeech, and the gravity of thy deportment, manifest thy ſelf unto us.</hi> Now his opinion muſt be delivered in ſignificant, but plain naked terms; not daubed over <hi>fuco Rhetoricae laſcivientis,</hi> with the paints of laſciviating Rhetorique, which becomes the Rhetorick School, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Parliament Houſe. But ſo much for his Age and Gravity.</p>
                  <p>Now to the Election of our Senator. Among the Romans (in the times of Yore Lords of the whole World) Senators were elected divers waies; for, they were choſen either by the King, Conſuls, Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:110845:79"/>
Tribunes of the people, the Cenſors or Chieftains. And the Cuſtome of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born natives is to chooſe Senators among themſelves, or elſe to commit the authority of Election to a ſingle perſon, who for wiſdome, gravity and dignity is judged the moſt fit, and that is the King; which the Romans did at firſt. <hi>Romulus,</hi> the firſt founder of their City, elected a hundred Senators; which cuſtome was followed by their ſucceeding Kings. But, when Kingly Government, through the inſolent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> the Raviſher, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, this power of election (according to the quality of the time) was ſomewhat changed, yet not given to a multitude; for till the State returned to the Baſis and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Government, Monarchy, Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were elected by Conſuls, Cenſors, Dictators, or Chieftains. In all which Elections, till the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> there is no mention made of lots; but the Fame, Family, Order, Office before born, riches and poſſeſſions, were moſt of all conſidered and reſpected. Now, ſince there is no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſion but comes far ſhort of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue for excellency in the choice of Senators, that muſt be chiefly look'd upon; becauſe they are reputed Defenders of the Law,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:110845:80"/>
Moderators of Liberty, and Conſervers of a Kingdom. And as the Republick or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is oftentimes infected by the vice and impiety of Magiſtrates; ſo is it antidoted, corrected and repaired by their vertues. Such are the People of every Country, as are the Manners of their Governours; and the Subjects are apt to Ape the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of their Prince. It was well ſaid of one, That the change of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Lives, and the alteration of Manners in Magiſtrates, would alſo work even to a mutation of the Cuſtoms, Inſtitutions and Rights, nay, of the Kingdom it ſelf. And to deal really with you, evill Princes are very much to be blamed, not in that they themſelves are guilty of any crime, for it is a Maxim in our Common Law, <hi>That the King can do no wrong;</hi> but that thereby the Subjects are prone to be feduced, and led away to the ſame exorbitancies; which may juſtly be ſo termed in them, though not in a King. And indeed, how can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within the liſts of poſſibility for a man to perſwade other men to be vertuous, when he himſelf is vicious? The Romans derided <hi>Scylla,</hi> who, though a man infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debauched, and wholly given up to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, did nevertheleſs admoniſh and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:110845:80"/>
ſtir up others to Sobriety, Temperance and Frugality. And who would not blame <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander?</hi> though he ſwam in a contrary ſtream, yet he allowed and gave tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Citizens for thoſe vices which he himſelf abſtained from and abhorred. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> deſerves commendation, becauſe he never impoſed the obſervation of that upon any man, which he himſelf did not firſt of all diligently follow. Yet in a free-State, (if any ſuch there be) it hath been obſerved, they have been directed by the ſuffrage of chance. This order of Election is obſerved by that Virgin, <hi>Venice.</hi> The like inſtitution <hi>Solon</hi> authorized among the Athenians for the choice of the five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Senators: For, out of every Tribe were ſo many elected, as were thought to deſerve that dignity; whoſe names were put into a Pot; and into another as many Beans, the one half white, and the other black: now ſo many as hapned upon the white, were pronounced Senators; and thoſe that chanced to light on the black, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed and diſmiſſed: which made <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> to call that Senate, <hi>Senatum à Faba.</hi> Beſides, it was obſerved among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans what Office he had born before his Election, and with what fidelity he had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:110845:81"/>
diſcharged himſelf of his duty: for they made choice of their Senators out of that number of men only, that were by them ſtyled <hi>Patres,</hi> which was, as it were, the Nurſery of Counſellors, that ſo they might be known to be men famous for ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exploit, or renowned for their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gravity.</p>
                  <p>Among us, thoſe that ſit in Parliament obtain that Dignity three manner of waies:

                  <p>They that come in <hi>per Breve,</hi> or by Writ, are theſe: Knights of the Shires, Burgeſſes, Citizens, Barons of the Cinque-Ports, and the King's Council.

Office, The Chief Crier of <hi>England;</hi> The Chief Uſher; The Chancellor; The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; The Chamberlain, and Barons of the Exchequer; The Juſtices of either Bench; The Steward of <hi>England;</hi> The Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Grooms, and all tyed by ſervice to be here done. The Stewards Office was to place the Lords; the Porter uſed to ſee there be but one door to enter in and go out at: And every one of the above-mentioned Officers, hath had his ſeveral Charge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively. Thus have you had a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our <hi>Sage Senator,</hi> of all the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that tend to his accompliſhment; his Duty, Dignity and Office diſplayed and laid open; the rewards due unto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him; the ancient Cuſtoms of the Romans and Grecians touching this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; their election and choice; as alſo their manner of ſitting in Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; how and by what means they obtain the Senatorſhip, or title of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men, according to our modern ſtyles, who were ſo termed, becauſe every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this High and moſt abſolute Court of Juſtice in <hi>England</hi> (from which there is no appeal to any other for redreſs) ſhould ſincerely and diſcreetly <hi>Parler la ment,</hi> as it is in the old Norman French, that is, freely
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:110845:82"/>
expreſs their minds for the benefit of the Kingdom. Nor are the Laws of this Iſland only, and the Liberty of the Subject conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Parliament, but thoſe of all well po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licied Kingdoms &amp; Countries elſe in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Germans have their Diets; The Danes and Swedes their <hi>Riicks Dachs;</hi> The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard calls his Parliament <hi>Las Cortes;</hi> And the French have (or at leaſt ſhould have) their Aſſembly of the three States, though it be now in a manner grown obſolete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the authority thereof was by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent devolv'd upon the King: it will not be altogether impertinent to give you a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct account of this memorable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which hapned as followeth: When our Nation had taken ſuch large footing in <hi>France,</hi> that they advanced as far as <hi>Orleans,</hi> and had forced their then Soveraign to fly to <hi>Bourges</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> for ſanctuary; the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the three States not being able to convene during theſe preſſures in full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, becauſe that by thoſe invaſions the enemy made into the very bowels of the Kingdom, the Country was altogether unpaſſable, ſo that the power that was inherent in the Parliamentary Convention, of enacting Laws, aſſeſſing the Subject with Taxes, ſubſidiary Levies, and other Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:110845:82"/>
was tranſmitted to the King, during the rage and fury of that war only; which proving of long continuance, that entruſted Authority began to grow habitual, and could never hitherto be taken from him; ſo that his Edicts ſtand in lieu of Acts of Parliament. Out of theſe foregoing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes this Concluſion may eaſily be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <q>That the principal Fountain whence the King derives his happineſs and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the Parliament: It is the great Conduit-Pipe which conveys unto him his Peoples bounty and gratitude; the trueſt Looking-glaſs wherein he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their loves. Now the Subjects love hath been ever accounted the prime Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of a Prince. In his Parliament he appears as the Sun in the Meridian, in the Altitude of his Glory, in his higheſt State-Royal, as the Law informs us.</q> But leſt we ſhould ſpin out too long a thread, and ſo wear the Readers Patience thread-bare, we will conclude this firſt Book, and make the diſcourſe which we allot for the ſcope and Subject of our next, run in another Channel.</p>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:110845:84"/>
a King can but make him a bad King; but he remains a King ſtill. If indeed, as one ſaith excellently, Kings held their Crowns by Indentures from the People, they were then diſobliged from their obedience to him upon his failing (in thoſe things whereunto he was ſworn at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) on his part; but if they receive their Crowns immediately from God, and that by him alone Kings raign, as is ſaid before, then they muſt ſtill ſtick cloſe to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, or elſe come off with the brand of Traytors. Our modern times have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with too many of that infernal rabble, who were ſo helliſhly wicked and impious, as to fight againſt their lawful Soveraign; and having got him in their clutches, ſlew him at his own door. But to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Athenians, (as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> writes in his Oration againſt <hi>Neaera)</hi> when <hi>Theſeus</hi> had contrived the model of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, being accuſtomed to chooſe ſome one out of the number of the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by a general conſent, manifeſted by holding up their hands, they elected him King. In ancient times, the election of Kings was ever held <hi>ſacrum &amp; divinum quid,</hi> a certain holy and divine action
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:110845:85"/>
among the very Heathens. <hi>Romulus,</hi> after the ſight of twelve Ravens (if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit <hi>Livy)</hi> or rather becauſe the lightning had pierced his body from the left to the right ſide (as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> hath it) was by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination choſen King; and that ordinance, called <hi>Jus Auſpiciorum,</hi> was religiouſly obeyed. Their authority hath been judged ever as divine as their election; for <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Iſocrates</hi> joyntly affirm, That he that governeth as a King, repreſents the Deity. The Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> were honour'd as Gods, and the people believed that they were the ſole and abſolute defenders of their Laws, Liberties, Lives, and Country. The ancient Latines called their Kings, <hi>Indigetes,</hi> that is, deified; (as <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> were) whoſe bodies after they were expired, could never be found. Kings are the Sons, not of the moſt voices, but of the moſt High; and as God is King of the whole Univerſe, ſo are they Lords of the whole Commonwealth. About their skirts they have this Motto written by the finger of God, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed.</hi> Nor did ever any Church-man, Chriſtian Father or Expoſitor, obtrude any other ſence upon this Text, than that it was meant of Kings, till ſuch time as the Puritan and Papiſt, both at a time, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110845:85"/>
that time bearing not above 100. years date, who began then to infect the world with this damnable doctrine, <hi>That it was Lawful to murder Kings.</hi> It is ſtrange that two ſuch contrary factions, that had ever been antipathetical one to the other, ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> agree in condemning the Lord's Anointed. <hi>Dieu &amp; mon Droit,</hi> is their Motto; <hi>God, and my Right:</hi> no body elſe have any thing to do with me. They have a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> to defend them from the aſſaults of rebellious Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Yet although Kings are counted God's Lieutenants, or Adjutant-Generals; the Council, Wiſdom, and Knowledge of Kings is not their own, but given them by God, who is the Author of every good and perfect gift, according to that verſe of the Holy Pen-man:

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince, I ſay, no King can with his own peculiar ſtock of wiſdom govern his Kingdom rightly (for it is the prerogative of the Almighty only to know all things that appertain to good Government,)
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:110845:86"/>
they have ever uſed to call unto their aid and aſſiſtance ſome wiſe grave men, by whoſe advice and counſel the Kingdom might be well regulated. Theſe men being as a mean between the King and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, do on the one hand, underſtand the Office of the King; and on the other, the Duty of the Subject; knowing what courſe muſt be taken for the preſervation of the Kings Honour and Royal Prerogative, and what belongs to the profit and benefit of his good and Loyal Subjects. Thus a King may govern all things well, not only by his own opinion, which may oftentimes prove deceitful; but by the general advice and counſel of others, whereby his judgement and reaſon is brought to perfection. And as the hand divided into many fingers, is thereby made more ſtrong and apt to lay hold on all things; ſo he that governs by the aid and aſſiſtance of Councellors, will manage all publike affairs, tending to the benefit of the Kingdom and Country whereof he is Soveraign, with the greater diſcretion and wiſdom: for a ſingle perſon is not able to manage all affairs without additionall help. <hi>Alexander,</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> conquered many Countries, and ſubjugated a multitude of Enemies. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:110845:86"/>
was excellent at the choice of places for Fortification. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was often atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſucceſs in Victory, but knew not how to make the beſt improvement of it:
<q>Vincere ſcis Hannibal, uti Victoria neſcis.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philopoemon</hi> was a brave Admiral at Sea; <hi>Cleon</hi> could manure lands and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; <hi>Cicero</hi> was a famous Orator; <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> a valiant General; <hi>Cato</hi> a grave Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and <hi>Scipio</hi> admirable both in peace and war. So were ſeveral others, that might be inſtanced: for every man (according to the Proverb) is a <hi>Roſcius</hi> in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Now when ſo many well-qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Heroes</hi> are bound up together in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, what a Conſtellation of Vertues will ſhine and appear there? And what firm Edicts and good Laws will there be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by them for the publick benefit and good of the Kingdom? which he is obliged to; for he is called <hi>Rex, à Regendo;</hi> but ſome will have it, <hi>à recte agendo.</hi> And it is clear, that one man cannot be ſo clear fighted as to perceive all; which proves that verſe of <hi>Homer</hi> to be true, rendred into Latine, thus:</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:110845:87"/>
                  <q>Bini conveniunt melius rem perſpicit alter.</q>
                  <p>Nor doth this any waies diminiſh his power and authority; for though many convene, yet he is ſtill the head of them all, and hath a negative voice; nor can any Act be paſs'd without his Royal aſſent or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. It is taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that there is much care and vigilancy required in a Monarch; for, he muſt not ſeek ſo much after his own profit, as the publike good and commodity of his People; he muſt obſerve the Laws, preſerve the Rights and Liberty of his Subjects, and maintain the authority and reputation of his Senate. For Kings were firſt of all inſtituted for the aid and aſſiſtance of the vertuous, againſt thoſe that are vicious: to them abſolute power is tranſmitted, to the end that they may revenge injuries, and be juſt Judges in all cauſes and legal proceedings. A good King ought to be as vigilant over thoſe whom Providence hath allotted him Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, as a Shepherd is of his Flock. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> calls King <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the ſhepherd of the People; and <hi>Plato</hi> in imitation of him, the Shepherd and Conſerver of Mankind. Beſides, he ſhould govern his People, not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110845:87"/>
as Maſters do their Servants, but as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do their Children; with Paternal care, not with rigid ſeverity or cruelty. And as it is cuſtomary with indulgent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſometimes to rebuke their Children, ſometimes to admoniſh and encourage them, and ſometimes alſo to correct and puniſh them; ſo ſhould a Prince behave himſelf toward his Subjects; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting himſelf ſometimes ſevere, (when moved thereunto) and at other times gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, affable and courteous, both for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his people, and the ſafety of the Kingdom; defending and enlarging the <hi>bonum commune</hi> with no leſs care than a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provides for the ſuſtentation of his Children. This makes the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kings and Tyrants: the one is ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the publike good, the other for his own private profit. The end of the Tyrants endeavour is voluptuouſneſs; but the Kings ſtudy is honour: Riches are the mark at which a Tyrant levels, but Vertue is the true <hi>Meta</hi> of the King. Tyrants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the aſſiſtance of ſtrangers, but Kings are guarded by their own loyal Subjects. <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what Subjects of his he moſt tenderly affected? anſwered, <hi>I love them better that</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:110845:88"/>
                     <hi>love me, than thoſe that fear me.</hi> And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon did he thus expreſs himſelf: for fear is uſually accompanied with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. A King is as ſecure by the love, good will and loyalty of his Subjects, as by the defence of Arms; and his Senators will ſtand him in more ſtead upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a Tyrants Souldiers. <hi>Trajanus,</hi> that great Emperour of the World, did alwaies call the Senate, his Father: for, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſually foretels the Son what may prove beneficial, and what injurious to him: ſo the Senate counſels the King, and inſtructs him how to conſerve his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and by what Laws and Ordinances it muſt be governed. This is the only way to keep the King from Tyranny, and the Subject from Rebellion. Now tyranny in the one, with rebellion in the other, will ſoon verifie that Dyſtich of the Satyriſt:
<q>
                        <l>Adgenerum Cereris ſine caede, &amp; vulnere pauci</l>
                        <l>Deſcendunt Reges, &amp; ſicca morte Tyranni.</l>
                     </q>
A good King knows how to irretiate and allure the hearts of the People to him by love and clemency, ſooner than by violence and compulſion. And good people know their duty and obedience: and if the King
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:110845:88"/>
through the ſins of the people be any way miſguided, they will bite their nails, and not ſcratch their heads; they know it is a crime inexplable, to quarrel with Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: the only way to live happy in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is this, firſt, to give God, and then <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due. But when Kings grow ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, then there is little or no allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Subject, but what they are compelled to; whereas that is far more to be eſteemed, that flows naturally and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily from the people; and this uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirs them up to ſedition, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to their utter ruine and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the downfal both of Kingdom and King: and the reaſon is, becauſe Tyrants uſe certain ſleights and State-tricks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Subject of liberty: Firſt, by clearing the Country of all good and wiſe men, either by baniſhment, impriſonment, or death; becauſe the vertue of good men reproves them for their vice, and renders them odious; whenas all they aim at is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enſlave the Nation, to the intent that they may proſecute their own luſt and pleaſure without obſtruction. Such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel as this, <hi>Periander</hi> poyſoned <hi>Thrafibulus</hi> with; who by his infernal Rhetorick endeavoured to perſwade him to cut off the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:110845:89"/>
higheſt ſpikes of corn; meaning thereby, that he ſhould cauſe the cream of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Nobility to be executed. The like ſubtilty did <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lucius,</hi> follow; who being ſuborned by his Father, pretended to be baniſhed, and fled fraudulently to the <hi>Gabii;</hi> where having ſcrap'd as much acquaintance as he judged convenient, ſent privily to his Father to know his will and pleaſure, and what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to be done in the buſineſs for his ſatisfaction: who conducted the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the garden, where walking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he with a wand in his hand ſtrook off all the heads of the Poppies before him; which being by the <hi>Nuncio</hi> reported to his Son, who had helliſh wit enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch damnable myſteries, ſoon put the chief of the Nobility to death, and by force and injuſtice uſurped the Government of the Commonwealth, and deprived the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their liberty. Another knack they have to prejudice their Subjects, by inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their meetings, conventions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, to prevent their ſtudy of honeſt diſcipline. Nay, farther, they often ſow diſcord among the people, to the end that filled with hate and private diſpleaſure, they may be ſtirred up to civil war and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:110845:89"/>
ſedition; who being thereby much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, and the war ceaſing, are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to pay for their pardon; and being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner fleeced both waies of their money, and reduced to poverty, become baſe minded, and altogether unfit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Lives, Laws, or Liberties. Theſe, and many more that might be numerated, are the plots and devices of Tyrants; all which, they imagine, tend to their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and to the promoting of their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſigns; whenas oftentimes it proves quite contrary, to their own ruine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal deſtruction: for if they mount them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too often on the Subjects galled back, they will undoubtedly caſt their rider, let him be never ſo expert a Horſeman. But Kings are of a quite contrary temper and diſpoſition: it is the good, and not the ruine of their Subjects they labour for; becauſe they underſtand ſufficiently, that the loſs of Subjects is the ſhaking off of their Crowns; and wanting their protection, they are left unarm'd to the mercy of the inſulting enemy. But we will now leave the lofty Subject of Kings to the fancy of a more ſublime wit, and the work of a more noble quill; and come to our ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which treats of the diviſion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals.</p>

                  <p>THe diverſity of Republicks proceeds not from Fortune, or Chance-medley, nor the diſpoſition of the Heavens, or the influence of the Stars upon things ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but every Government is framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the minds, tempers, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of men, their wits and education; though ſome aſcribe their variety to the ſituation of the Country or Climate where men have their allotted reſidence and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is confeſt, that ſometimes, through ſedition, faction, and civil war; Kingdoms are ſubverted, and changed into States; for the proof whereof we need not ramble far, ſince our native rebellions have lately ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted the truth hereof. Such is the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating condition of all worldly things, that miſchance waits at the elbow of good fortune, and vice is masked with vertue, that ſhe may not appear in her own native hew and deformity; for Man is prone to forſake v<gap reason="illegible" extent="3+ letters">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:110845:90"/>
him with an appearance of good. Sometimes alſo it falls out, that well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Republicks, through evill Miniſters, are either utterly extinguiſhed, or altered into other forms of Government. Hence it happens, that Kingdoms become Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>Optimacies</hi> come under the juriſdiction of a few; Popular States are perverted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to licentious liberty, and from that reduced into Tyranny; and this is the revolution of their Government, and original of their Cataſtrophe. <hi>Plato</hi> writes, that the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Commonweals is fatal, through the diſpoſition of the Heavens, and the operation or influence of Coeleſtial bodies upon Terreſtrial. But as we have already inſtanced, their variation happens from the variety of the minds of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. For ſome Countries abound with rich, others are cram'd with poor men. In ſome, there is ſtore of Nobles, Souldiers and Husbandmen; in others, plenty of Merchants, Handicraftſmen and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Now, whereſoever the number of Merchants, Artificers and Husbandmen ſurmount the reſt, that State uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth Popular: But where there is the greateſt quantity of rich men, there is eſtabliſhed the government of a few.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:110845:91"/>
Where the major part of Citizens be good, wiſe and vertuous, that State is apt to be governed as an Optimacy. There are three things (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> that contend for priority in Government: Liberty, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Vertue. For, Nobility (which ſupplies the fourth place) is the aſſociate of vertue and riches, becauſe the equal mixture of rich and poor men, make a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State. A faction of rich men, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Government of a few; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all three, <hi>viz.</hi> Freemen, rich men, and good men, is counted an Optimacie: ſuch was the Carthaginian Republick; for Rich men, Good men, and Noblemen were therein equally eſteemed. Now, it is the diſpoſition and deſire of ſome men to live, in Kingdoms rather than in any other State; who are ſuch men as are naturally ambitious of honour, vertuous, and fitted for action. The <hi>Cappadocians</hi> having enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kings for many years (whoſe Race was at length extinguiſhed) were profered by the Romans to have their State converted into popular Liberty; but they refuſed it: whereupon they appointed <hi>Ariobarſanes,</hi> their friend, King of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians followed the quite contrary courſe; for they affecting a Popular State, would
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:110845:91"/>
not allow of the Government by one, nor many. Yea, ſome there are that approve of Tyrannical Government moſt of all; as the <hi>Siculi</hi> of old, who were ever accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ruled by Tyrants, and ſo were almoſt all the people of <hi>Aſia;</hi> who being naturally ſervile, are even to this Age ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to tyrannical Government. Now, if any man demand, What a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is? This doubt cannot ariſe from the name, it being a certain order among the Inhabitants aſſembled together in one City or Country, and there reſiding; but from the variety and difference of Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: for as mens manners, delights and eſtates be various, ſo alſo is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Commonweals manifold. And though the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or end, is one and the ſame, <hi>viz. bonum,</hi> good; yet the <hi>Terminus d quo,</hi> or means whereby they aſpire to that good, are various, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Laws and Cuſtoms are of ſundry ſorts that are by them uſed. For, he that ſhall compare the Laws of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus</hi> enacted for the <hi>Miletians,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Minos</hi> made for the <hi>Candians;</hi> or the Ordinances of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> with the Decrees of <hi>Solon,</hi> the one writing of the Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian, the other of the Athenian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:110845:92"/>
may with facility underſtand their Laws to be divers, their Magiſtrates unlike, and the Form of their States very diſcrepant. The ſeven Wiſe wen <hi>(Thales</hi> excepted, who did not care for fiſhing in the troubled waters of State-affairs) intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral exerciſes, Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the peoples capacity, and their own pecular fancies, and by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry orders and uſes did execute them. Which variety of Government hath mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred matter of great controverſie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of opinion; Inſomuch, that the Learned, as well in our, as forrain Schools and Univerſities, have aſſumed the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſeveral ſorts of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, and confined them to a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; beſides, they have manifeſted which of them deſerve the greateſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ought to be embraced. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſeem to excell all perſons that ever wrote on this Subject: For they with ſolid judgement, and great reſpect to the nature of men, and the temperature of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Climate, have diſcreetly appointed Laws and Governments ſuitable to the diſpoſition and temper of the Inhabitants: therefore according to the opinion of theſe two famous Philoſophers, we will diſcourſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:110845:92"/>
of three ſorts of Republicks: The firſt is called, <hi>Monarchia;</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Ariſtocratia;</hi> And the third, <hi>Democratia;</hi> which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines term, <hi>Regnum, Optimatum Principatus, &amp; Popularis Reſpublica.</hi> The Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all things, by his Providence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, hath ſo ordered, that the faculties or powers of man's mind ſhould reſide in three parts of his body, repreſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by three <hi>Idaea's</hi> or Forms of Republicks; conſtituting Reaſon as ſole Monarch, or Lord Paramount of them all, to remain in the head, being the higheſt part. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, as moſt vigilant and apt to obey, he hath placed near unto it, in the breaſt, creating it a companion and helper to the head; which <hi>Plato</hi> calls, <hi>Vim iraſcendi,</hi> or <hi>affectuum ſedem.</hi> The third, reſembling a rude multitude, witleſs, froward, and full of ſenſual deſires, harbours beneath the heart, far remote from the other. In theſe parts of the ſoul, as in a Mirrour or Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, we may ſpy out three ſorts of Commonweals. The higheſt ſupplies the place of King, as deſtined and appointed to exerciſe authority over all. The ſecond, though in place inferiour, yet in quality is of no leſs regard, being well obeyed: for, where Reaſon ſwaies without the aid and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:110845:93"/>
aſſiſtance of the affections, all actions are weak and impotent. Juſt ſo a Senate want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſiſtance of Reaſon, which deports her ſelf partly as Captain, partly as a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in all actions and conſultations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes timorous and effeminate. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath therefore made a diviſion of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Reaſon, making one part abſolute and ſtanding upon its own Guard, and the other, as it were, depending and ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, like a Son that obeyeth the Father. Which <hi>Titus Livius</hi> hath ſignificantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in ſetting forth the errour of <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his unadviſed fight againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which <hi>Fabius</hi> reprehends in theſe or the like words: <hi>Souldiers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard, that he that of himſelf can rightly judge, deſerves the greateſt commendation: next unto him are they, that know how to ſubſcribe to the good advice of others: But he that can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſel, nor follow the counſel of others, is but an inch on this ſide a Natural, and of a very ſhallow capacity.</hi> The third part of man's mind reſembles a Popular Government, wherein the multitude hath authority to hear all cauſes, and determine or decide all controverſies, though many conteſts ariſe from hence to the prejudice both of the Country and Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:110845:93"/>
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writes alſo, that the Image or repreſentation of Republicks may be found out in private families; for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Father over his Children may be compared to Principality; becauſe Children are the Parents charge; he alone muſt provide for them all, and their faults are chaſtiſed, rather than ſeverely puniſhed by him; ſo ought a good King to demean himſelf toward his good Subjects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the God of Gods and Men, is by <hi>Homer</hi> ſtyled Father. The Husbands au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Wife may be compared to <hi>Optimacie;</hi> for the Husband ought to rule his Wife according to Juſtice, and command nothing but what may endure the teſt of the Laws of God and man. The State Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular is aſſimilated to brotherly Society; for they ought to live in equality, differing only in the degrees of Age. And as the Father that uſeth rigour and cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Children, is judged a Tyrant, and no Father; ſo that King, that by the oppreſſion of the Subject endeavours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his private intereſt, contemning all Laws, and living diſhonourably, puts off his Kingſhip, and is called Tyrant. A Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife living in diſcord, either through negligence, or obſtinacy, rejecting
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:110845:94"/>
the care of their Children, and domeſtick affairs, do thereby abuſe their authority, and become unworthy the name of natural Parents; ſo <hi>Optimacie</hi> abuſed, deſerves not that title. In like manner Brethren diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, neglecting their mutual profit, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting themſelves to ſloath and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are not to be accounted Brethren; no more is a Popular State ſo to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, if of ſuch a temper. Thus it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that through the default and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs of Superiors, true Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals are converted into falſe and contrary Governments. Policy, which by the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle, Reſpublica popularis,</hi> may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all ſorts of Republicks; becauſe that word is univerſal, and includes all civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Plato</hi> adds another kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that is, a King ſubject to his Laws; making Monarchy of two ſorts, and conſequently two Kings; the one bound and confined, the other free, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to any Law: this is his opinion of Monarchy, though not ours.</p>
                  <p>But now let us diſcourſe of the beſt ſort of Republicks, though it be a very hard task: to the accompliſhment of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended work, it is requiſite that a man
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:110845:94"/>
underſtand the beſt kind and order of life; for otherwiſe a perfect Commonwealth cannot be conceived: but what ſort of life merits the reputation of the beſt, as yet <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet in obſcuro</hi> among the major part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The Epicures, Stoicks and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks are of different opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſubject, and have divided the world by the variety of their Sects and whimſies. But our intent is to concur with the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks, becauſe their Schools have been the greateſt Nurſeries of good Governours. The Stoicks, that did ever wed themſelves to an auſtere life, ground their felicity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vertue only; which we diſapprove not, ſo that they conſent, that external goods, which both Nature and Fortune have made for the uſe of man, to the end he may thereby be the better accommodated, be joyned thereunto as neceſſary additaments; otherwiſe he cannot be perfect: and ſeeing that man's felicity is numbred among things that are perfect, and that thing is only perfect that wants nothing; ſurely, whoſoever deſires to be happy, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be fully furniſhed, ſo that his felicity may be abſolute, and no way deficient. Riches are very neceſſary; the liberal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtands in need of money to perform the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:110845:95"/>
actions of Liberality, and the juſt man muſt therewith reward and make ſatisfaction. The Warriour wants it; for according to the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</l>
                        <l>Argent is pugna telis, ac omnia vinces.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Epicure, he placeth his <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> in ſenſual delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; which is more becoming a beaſt, than a man. Whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes a joynt agreement of Vertue, and other additional ornaments, or external helps, moſt neceſſary for a well-regulated perſon.</p>
                  <p>Philoſophers affirm, that there are three ſorts of life: The firſt, conſiſteth in Action; The ſecond, in Contemplation; And the third, in Pleaſure. That which reſteth in Action, if not accompanied with wiſdom and vertue, proveth unprofitable, and is ſubject to many vices and imperfections. That which is employed in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not being accompanied with Action, is vain and ineffectual. For, as he that boldly looks upon the Sun when in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of his luſtre, is made blind with his vehement heat and tralucent ſplendor: ſo the mind of man, continually occupied
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:110845:95"/>
with the ſpeculation of ſublime myſteries, becomes ſtupid, heavy, and languiſhing. He therefore that deſires the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, muſt lead a civil as well as a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical, an active as well as a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life; the mixture of which two, makes man happy and fortunate. But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights only in ſenſuality, abſolutely forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he was ever qualified with the gift of reaſon, may be ſaid to repreſent man, as to his outward complexion or bluſh; but he wants the true and proper nature of man.</p>
                  <p>Hence ariſeth the diverſity of mankind; for ſome are born free, noble, wiſe, and fit for government; others, ſervile, booriſh, witleſs, deſtined to ſervitude and bondage. <hi>Plato</hi> hath it, that God in Man's Creation had ſo ordered, that in the generation of thoſe that are apt to govern, he hath mixed gold; of them that are appointed as aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to Governours, ſilver; And the nature of Plough-men and Artizans is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Braſs and Iron: which ſimilitude <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> applies to the manners and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of men. For, although every man doth naturally deſire that his children ſhould reſemble him; yet it often happens, that ſilver is the iſſue of gold, and ſome
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:110845:96"/>
metal of a more inferiour allay, the iſſue of ſilver. It is therefore very requiſite, that Princes pry into the nature of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they may underſtand their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and they that are like Iron may be converted into gold; or that proving impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the government may be allotted to others: for it hath been oraculouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, that thoſe Countries that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Braſs and Iron, ſhould periſh and come to confuſion.</p>
                  <p>But now as to <hi>Optimacie,</hi> it conſiſts in a certain number of vertuous Citizens (or at leaſt ſhould) becauſe they govern the Republick according to the Rules and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of the Law; whereas in popular States all things are contrarily managed: for Liberty being the end thereof, the State is ruled according to will and popular fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without the conſideration of vertue or reaſon. In ſuch Cities, men are called good, becauſe they are profitable or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the Commonwealth, not for their being endowed with honeſty, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the action of vertue; ſo that vertue there is meaſured by publike profit, not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; for Popular Juſtice, called <hi>Jus popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare,</hi> is where honour is conferred upon perſons, not according to the vertue of him

that receiveth, but the number of thoſe that give it; who think thoſe things to be moſt equitable, that are ſo according to the Vogue of the multitude, not as Juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us; and that to be honourable, which hath the repute of popular fame, or approbation of the Multitude. And though it muſt neceſſarily be granted, that there is corruption in all Republicks; yet is it frequently known in Popular States, and that more than in any other kind of Government: for if any man well-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled chance to have his reſidence or abode in any ſuch State, and he out of natural reaſon only diſguſt the Plebeian inſolency, and by admonition, reprehenſion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſtrives to reduce the Citizens or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to a more vertuous and religious courſe of life, he is inſtantly branded with the name of an enemy to the State, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the Law of <hi>Oſtraciſme;</hi> and many times it falls out, that he comes to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Many famous Citizens of the popular States of <hi>Greece</hi> were hereby afflicted, as <hi>Aristides, Thucydides, Socrates, Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Damon;</hi> and at <hi>Rome, Camillus</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> had the ſame meaſure dealt them. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> deſerves a monument that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to perpetuity, for his ſingular vertue
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:110845:97"/>
and wiſdom; who for his integrity of life and converſation, was ſirnamed <hi>Juſtus.</hi> And at that time when the Law of <hi>Oſtraciſme</hi> was in force among the Athenians, a rude, booriſh, beef-brain'd fellow, with a ſcrole of paper in his hand, chanced to meet him, who with much importunacy would have forced him to write his name therein. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> being aſtoniſhed at his earneſt and ſtrange requeſt; asked him, <hi>Whether any man could ever ſay he had injured any perſon? No,</hi> (replied the fellow) <hi>all the reaſon that prompts me to my demand, is only this, I ſtomach your Sirname,</hi> Juſtus. It is reported by <hi>Cicero,</hi> that the <hi>Epheſi,</hi> at the baniſhment of their Prince, <hi>Hermodorus,</hi> pronounced this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: <hi>Let us not excel one another; and if any do contrary to what is herein ſpecified or mentioned, he ſhall no longer reſide among us, but must procure ſome other dwelling place.</hi> Strange Cuſtoms of Popular States! <hi>Plato</hi> (as we have already inſtanced) ſaith, <hi>That no State can be long liv'd that is governed by Iron or Braſs;</hi> that is, by phanatick or infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated perſons; who being altogether unfit for Government, ſeem to be born to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb, rather than obey. For they, after ſome petty or imaginary ſucceſs at war, growing inſolent and tympanous, have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:110845:97"/>
alwaies ſome flattering Tutors, and collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing popular Captains to extol their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ready at hand; who immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this allured, or rather caught with the golden bait of glory, reject the authority of their wiſe governours, rebelling againſt their Superiours, and ſo uſurping their lawful power, take it into their hands, and manage it according to their own corrupt wills and depraved judgements; which is the cauſe that ſuch States ſoon expire, and that oftentimes in their very infancy: for through the diverſity of minds and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, they become void of counſel; and after a continued ſeries (if it laſt any conſiderable time) of inſolency, contention and faction, they become ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive either to a few, or elſe to ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon. Thus did the Athenians, who having obtained the victory in a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sea-fight againſt the <hi>Medes,</hi> bladder'd up with pride from their ſucceſs herein, it cauſed ſedition and tumultuation in that State, notwithſtanding the contrary endeavours of the more ſober to prevent it. Nay, the original of States Popular ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſeth from rebellion attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Royal Party, as it frequently happened at <hi>Rome:</hi> and at other times it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:110845:98"/>
falls out, when the people through tyranny are exaſperated, and made deſperate by the rigour of their Princes or Governours; for then by force of arms againſt their King, they begin to mould a new-faſhioned Government among themſelves; which the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> not many years ſince, have done. As to Oligarchy or Tyranny, we ſhall not extend our diſcourſe, but paſs them by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we judge ſuch kind of Government to be altogether unjuſt, inſupportable, and quite contrary to a vertuous and civill life.</p>
                  <p>Now, as to the diſcovery of the moſt notable and imitable Commonweals and Kingdoms in the habitable World, that ſhall be the ſubject of our enſuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <head>Wherein is contained the various Forms of the moſt memorable and famous Commonweals and Kingdoms in the World.</head>
                  <p>THe excellency and pre-eminency of every Nation or Republick may eaſily be underſtood by the Government and

                     </gap>imſies of their own natural fancy; and conſtantly perſevere therein, without ſo much as the appearance of change or variation: it is an apparent and clear argument of female frailty, far derogating from the dignity of Man, to be ſo fickle and inconſtant, as to ſeek after variety; but to be fix'd and grounded, is an argument of a noble reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, as for the Commonwealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> we ſhall paſs that by, becauſe it is uſually ſaid, that ſuch a Government as his, neither is, hath been, nor ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The Athenian Republick was firſt made as followeth: That People being diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and haunting the woods and fields like brute Animals, were firſt by <hi>Cecrops,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by <hi>Theſeus</hi> confined to a City, which was then called <hi>Cecropia,</hi> now <hi>Athens,</hi> and at length reduced to a Kingdom, deſcenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Poſterity. But what authority the Senate had under thoſe Kings (which order did repreſent the <hi>Optimacie)</hi> cannot be manifeſted or apparently known, by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:110845:99"/>
reaſon of the length of time, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of years ſince elapſed, as alſo the paucity of thoſe Writers that have any waies diſcourſed thereon. Yet we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Kings had in thoſe daies their Sages or Wiſemen about them, and made uſe of their counſel in the management of their political affairs. The Kings of that Age (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> writes) did rule by conſent of People, and with their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges did many times determine thoſe things whereof they themſelves were doubtful. Yet that Government was of ſhort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for, in tract of time (which alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all things) it was committed to the multitude, whoſe force and power did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſubvert the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>The Lacedaemonian State ſeemed to contain all the three ſorts of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> King, Nobles, and People; the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were their Senators, and the People were the <hi>Ephori;</hi> for they were alwaies elected out of the number of popular men. Now the Lacedaemonians are very much extolled, in that for the ſpace of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years compleat, they have continued without any alteration of their Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, or Government. But the Venetians in that reſpect may challenge a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:110845:99"/>
of glory, for they have till this very preſent Age of ours conſtantly lived under one Form of Government and Governours the ſpace of one thouſand years, and better.</p>
                  <p>Now the Venetians in framing their Republick, do include within the name of People, Gentlemen and Citizens; being very careful to oppoſe any other, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or dare uſurp that title, becauſe they only are capable of Magiſtracy. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is choſen out of that number that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents an <hi>Optimacie,</hi> and is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it were, of that State. The Duke is elected out of that number that reſemble Kings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polybius</hi> doth very much extol the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy, becauſe it was made up of the King, Nobility and People; ſuppoſing that by this means the King for fear of the People durſt not become inſolent; and the People, out of reſpect to the Senate, durſt not diſobey the King. Which Form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick is accounted moſt juſt. For as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony is made up of Treble, Mean, and Baſe; ſo the beſt and ſureſt agreement among men, and the moſt ſtable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is eſtabliſhed by the mixture of the Beſt, the Mean, and the Baſe people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Romulus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Livy)</hi> being (as we have
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:110845:100"/>
already mentioned) by conſent both of God and men elected King, though the State was then but an <hi>Embryo,</hi> refuſed to have the reins of Government lie altogether upon his own ſhoulders, and did therefore call unto his aſſiſtance one hundred Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who out of reſpect to their Age and Gravity, were called Fathers. And leſt the People ſhould ſuppoſe that they were hereby deluded, miſled, and defrauded of all honour, and thereby envy and maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might enſue, to the prejudice of the King or Senate; He made them Judges, and gave them full power and authority to ſit and determine War, and conclude peace, with many other priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed. And if this model of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had ſtill continued in <hi>Rome,</hi> there had not been ſo great an effuſion of bloud in aſpiring after Liberty and enlarging the Territories of the Roman Empire; Nor had the happineſs of that Country been ſhaken with ſo many ſeditions, which did at length work her ruine and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for ſhe was obſerved to be very little acquainted with peace all the time ſhe ſtood upon her own legs, ever ſince ſhe was able to go alone.</p>
                  <p>But now let us take the Governments of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:110845:100"/>
our Age into conſideration; and firſt, of the French Monarchy; which owns a King, who rules <hi>ad placitum,</hi> at his own diſcretion: and although his authority come not under the laſh of the Law, yet like an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt Prince, he acts nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Law, or Honour. In his Kingdom, the Noblemen, which they call Peers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent an <hi>Optimacie:</hi> the People are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three ſorts; Gentlemen, Clergy-men, and the popular Multitude; and a choice number of theſe three aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Kings Edict or Command, determine matters of greateſt importance in the Kingdom. This Council was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently called <hi>Panceltium,</hi> as the <hi>Aetolians</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med theirs <hi>Panaetolium,</hi> and the univerſal Council of the Ionians was termed <hi>Panio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium;</hi> though ſince, as we have already hinted, by reaſon of the Engliſh wars there, the King got all authority into his own hands, ſo that his word carries as much force and validity with it, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acts of Parliament, which were their three Eſtates conven'd and met together.</p>
                  <p>As for the Spaniſh Monarchy, the King there hath Soveraign authority and power; the Council-Royal repreſents an <hi>Optimacie;</hi> and the three prime Orders of Knighthood
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:110845:101"/>
may be compared to the popular State. For the Order of St <hi>Jago, Collatrava,</hi> and <hi>Alcantara,</hi> aſſembled with the King, decide the moſt important State-controverſies and affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Monarchy of <hi>Polonia</hi> conſiſts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of theſe three ſorts, <hi>i. e.</hi> The King, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and People; but it is to be noted, that this word People here, denotes only Knights and Gentlemen. The Union and Fellowſhip of theſe orders is ſo admirable, that the King without the advice of his Council and their authority, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nor can the Council determine without the King's approbation, and the Peoples conſent. In this Kingdom, the Laws are of ſo great force, that every man religiouſly ſwears to keep and obſerve them; and if any perſon act contrary to that Oath, he is accounted unjuſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. Now that Oath by which they ſwear to be ſtrict in the obſervance of their Laws and Liberty, is in their vernacular language called, <hi>Captue;</hi> which is as much as <hi>Tegmen capitis</hi> in Latine: for, as the head is kept in health, and preſerved from the injury of the nipping weather, by being covered; ſo by vertue of that Oath, their Laws, Lives, and Liberties are conſerved; and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:110845:101"/>
it, no man is ſo fearful, as not to venture his life againſt Tyrants, and all ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cut the wings of publick Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Happineſs. This people enjoy great freedom; being principled with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that to live according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Law, is the moſt abſolute Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the World. In this Kingdom, the Prince follows not the <hi>dictamen</hi> of his own will and fancy, but ſticks cloſe to the Rule of the Law. In waging war, or concluding peace, he makes uſe of his Council; never tranſgreſſing Law: which works this effect, that the Kings perſon is not only honoured among the people, but had in high reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and eſtimation; ſo that he may be ſaid to be adored, rather than obeyed. And who indeed is there, that would not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, honour, reſpect, and reverence that Prince, that in governing ſteers himſelf by the <hi>Cynoſure</hi> of the Law, contented to be led by the Line of reaſon, directing himſelf in all his undertakings, according to the prudent and grave advice of his Senators? Authority thus uſed, creates a general love, liking and conſent among the Subjects. To conclude, the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> ſeems ſuch a Prince, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Legiſlators have deſired to bear ſway
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:110845:102"/>
in all well-regulated Commonweals and Kingdoms, and ſuch as both God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approve. The Senate here bears the Image of <hi>Optimacy,</hi> and hath much power and authority; for they being choſen out of the wiſer ſort of Nobles, they only, I ſay, conſult with the King about State-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. Their authority is not unlike the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motimi</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or the <hi>Ephori</hi> of <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> The Gentlemen of <hi>Polonia</hi> reſemble the Popular State; for on them is impoſed a great part of the Government, and may be ſaid to be as a Seminary from whence iſſue both Counſellors and Kings.</p>
                  <p>The Empire of <hi>Germany</hi> conſiſts of the Emperour, Princes, and People; which being governed by divers Potentates, and their policy being ſcattered into ſundry Governments, comes not eaſily within the reach of a conciſe deſcription.</p>
                  <p>The quondam Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> now called <hi>England,</hi> obeyeth one King; who ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth Senators, unto whom the reſidue of Nobles, and ſome of the Popular Order being joyned, make one Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is called in our <hi>Idiom,</hi> a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But native modeſty forbids us to proceed any farther upon this ſubject; whoſe <hi>Encomia's</hi> we judge to be a Theme
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:110845:102"/>
far more ſuitable to a forrain Pen.</p>
                  <p>One difficulty there remains ſtill, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution whereof we have reſerved for the cloſe of this Chapter; and that is this; What a Citizen is, which we have ſo much all along diſcourſed of? To which we anſwer:</p>
                  <p>That this word Citizen hath had ſeveral acceptations among Writers. Some have called the whole number of Inhabitants by the name of Citizens. Others, only thoſe that are deſcended of Noble and free-born Citizens. Some call them Citizens whoſe Fathers were free-born within the City; Others would have them to fetch their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree more remote, from their ancient Grandfathers. And ſome are of opinion, that forrainers received into the Society of Citizens, and naturalized, or Denizen'd, deſerve the name of Citizens. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> terms them Citizens, that are capable of publick Offices in State, and are deſcended of free and honeſt Parentage. In popular States, all they are uſually called Citizens that dwell in the City, as well Poor, as Rich; Bad, as Good; none being Bond-men; for every one is capable of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe there is an univerſal parity among them. Of this nature was the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:110845:103"/>
Athenian Commonwealth (before ſpoken of) ſo long as it was ſubject to Popular Government; and the Cantons of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſteer the ſame courſe even to this very Day. And divers Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> there are, called free; where the Inhabitants live popularly, ſecluded from Gentlemen, and noble Citizens. In an Oligarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are moſt reſpected for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and ſubſtance, they that are moſt rich are reputed Citizens, though they are diſhonourable, becauſe careleſs of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and make it their whole ſtudy to be rich <hi>Quo jure, quaque injuria,</hi> by hook or by crook (as we ſay) right or wrong, no matter which way they obtain it; to the end that they may come to dignity and preferment, not as wiſe and vertuous, but as rich and wealthy perſons.</p>
                  <p>Among the Romans, there were ſeveral ſorts of Citizens; Some were called <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipes,</hi> ſome <hi>Coloni,</hi> and others <hi>Latini;</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them retaining thoſe conditions that were allotted them by the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some whereof were free, ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate, and ſome Stipendiary. Some were created Citizens <hi>pleno jure,</hi> which was by voice; and they were thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all honours; Others, <hi>Jure honorario,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:110845:103"/>
which were of the number of thoſe that were admitted into the the City without the ſuffrage of the people; and they were <hi>honoris gratia</hi> called Citizens, as the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani,</hi> and <hi>Equites.</hi> He likewiſe was counted a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe name was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Cenſors, and was an Houſe-keeper. By all which it is perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and evident, that in all Republicks they were properly called Citizens that could plead a right to Office, and could give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage in the State; whereas he that wants theſe priviledges, is rather to be called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, or Client, than Citizen. In Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies and Ariſtocracies thoſe are Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that are vertuous. In the latter, good and vertuous men only govern; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, one alone, that for Bounty, Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Magnificency excels all others. Thoſe people which are naturally Slaves, or wickedly debauched, do for the moſt part obey Tyrants, and that Government is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Imperium deſpoticum:</hi> Yet are not all they to be judged Slaves, that are encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the power and oppreſſion of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, if they be not withall baſe minded and vicious. For we read of many Citizens that have freed themſelves and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from ſervitude, by ſlaying or expelling
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:110845:104"/>
the Tyrants; and if they found their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were herein fruſtrated, they choſe rather to loſe their lives than their Liberty, as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> did, with many other Romans. Thus we have given the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and diviſion of the ancient States Popular, Republicks and Kingdoms; in the next Chapter we ſhall demonſtrate the new models of Government ſet up by the rebellious ſince the late unhappy wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King and Parliament.</p>

                  <p>He, to raiſe himſelf on the top of the Pyramid of honour, trampled over the heads of the moſt Loyal Subjects of the Realm; made a foot-ball of a Crown, and endeavoured utterly to extirpate the Royal Progeny, Root and Kind, Stem and Stock: Nay, I will be bold to ſay, if that an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Babe had been born with <hi>Vive le Roy</hi> in his mouth, he muſt have been food for his

His infernal plots and machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had wrought the utter ruine and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Country, had not Providence divine cut him off, to the general benefit and rejoycing of the Nation. Engliſh ground groaned with the burthen of this inhumane Tyrant. It was not enough that the Engliſh ſhould be ſcourged, but the whip muſt lye before them; it was not ſufficient that he ſhould be the Author of all their woes while living, but they muſt live ſubject to his Tyranny and oppreſſion; and like ſo many mutes, condeſcend to all his actions by ſilence, not daring to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt diſlike, though it thwarted their diſpoſition never ſo much. He was a rod of their own making, and they were content to untruſs whileſt he whipt them. In vain it was for the moſt accurate wit to plead Reaſon or Law againſt the Sword: the Tongue is too weak a weapon for the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:110845:106"/>
Dagger. During the uſurpation of this ſame helliſh Tyrant, what a Chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion beſpread the face of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How was all the Land benegroed with more than the Egyptian darkneſs of perſecution? The whole Country was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in clouds, and ruine hung over the heads of the people, by as ſlender a thread, as the Sword over the head of <hi>Damocles</hi> at the Banquet. The whole Land was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed in deſpair, and little or no hope of a reſurrection, till a divine hand wrought it by his long-expected death: and it is the Cordial wiſh and hearty deſire of the loyal Pen-man, that all his Majeſties and the Kingdoms enemies were as ſtately interred as he was. Had he deſerved an Epitaph, we would have ſtretch'd hard but our brain ſhould have furniſhed him with one; but ſince he was ſo unworthy, we hold it as great a diſparagement to our quill to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a Copy of Verſes on him, as he was a grief and trouble to the Loyal Party of the Nation. And indeed, how can any Son of <hi>Phoebus</hi> employ his time ſo ill, as to ſalute his dead corpſe with an Epitaph, that was ſo great an enemy to them when living; Who had a real deſign to extirpate all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, and implunge us into as deep a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:110845:106"/>
gulph of ignorance and profaneneſs as the Turk is caſt into? he hated all Learning, and the Learned, becauſe his crimes were ſo black and horrid that they went far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the mercy of the Book. He granted a toleration for all Religions, becauſe his own was to chooſe; and that he might not offend the tender Conſciences of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Zealots and Favourites, who were true Vaſſals to the Luſt and Villany of ſuch an imperious Uſurper. Honeſty was ſo much out of faſhion, that he that was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous was a Malefactor, and deſerved death; for Knavery was <hi>à la mode;</hi> and you know the old Saying, <hi>It is as good to be out of the World, as out of the Faſhion.</hi> An honeſt loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subject was as much hooted and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, and judged as ridiculous an Object, as a Spaniſh <hi>Don</hi> in his Country Garb at <hi>Paris.</hi> An honeſt man was as ſtrange a ſight in <hi>England,</hi> as a Horſe in <hi>Venice,</hi> or a Beggar in <hi>Holland;</hi> and he was as like to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his favour, as a Spurrier was to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But ſince he is in his grave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we will not rake up his aſhes any farthe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

jealouſies) he ſhall lie ſecure; for we intend to diſturb him no farther.</p>
                  <p>After the death of this Britiſh Idoll, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the fourth his Son peep'd out; who had no fault ſo great, as that he had him to his Father; for it was generally believed, he would be but Tenant to the Right Landlord, or the <hi>Stuarts</hi> Steward, to ſet all things in order till he was reſtored. But alas! he prov'd but a fortnights wonder; no ſooner up, but down; his depoſition (if we may credit report) was the womaniſh plot of weeping <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Lady; who ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach'd it that his preferment ſhould be greater than her Husbands, though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to little purpoſe: &amp; indeed, it is ſeldom known that female counſel ever arrives to any better ſucceſs; nor is there any reaſon that the Diſtaff ſhould be a companion for the Scepter. A Kitchin was a great deal more fit for her than a Throne, though ſhe had ambition enough to perſwade her ſelf that ſhe deſerved the name of a Princeſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet had <hi>Richard</hi> been heir of his Fathers parts (though it was well he was not) he would ſoon have fruſtrated all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and come to as much height and greatneſs: But he had not enough of the Rogue in his Compoſition, to make up a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:110845:107"/>
damned Politician. He was fitter to bear a Hawk on his Fiſt, than to hold a Scepter in his hand. A ſedentary, retired, Country-life, was far more ſuitable to his temper and diſpoſition, than a tumultuous City-life. He was altogether ignorant in that ſo much practiſed profeſſion of piecing the Lion with the Foxes tail; which no doubt he might have done, had he been as well read in <hi>Machiavil</hi> as his Sire was. He was not much read in Politicks, as appears by the ſmall term of time that was allotted him to play the Protector. But no matter, it was well it fell out ſo: he is like to fare the better for it, in the judgement of the moſt cenſorious. Beſides, it was what ſuited with his phancy (according to relation) better than all the uſurped power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Predeceſſor. <hi>Exit</hi> Protector, he was but like a Pageant, a King in a Play; he only appears upon the Stage, makes a leg, and takes his leave of you: but what comes next? The State<hi>-Groteſcoes</hi> will ſoon reſolve you, the buſineſs is already hatch'd; room for a Committteedom, which being the ſecond branch of this tripartite Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, challenges a place in the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Richard</hi> (as the Major part of the Gentry do) had retired himſelf to his Country-houſe for a mouth-full of freſh Air, there ſtarts up another kind of Government, hatch'd by a Committee of Safety; (of ſlavery, they meant) who were a rude rabble of Factious, Illiterate, Phanatick, Diſloyal Rebels; a knot of <hi>Knipperdolings;</hi> of the ſame ſtamp with that German Botcher, <hi>Jack-a-Leyden:</hi> the very <hi>merdaille</hi> and excrementitious off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of the Nation: during which time we might be ſaid to be the true <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes;</hi> for the Shooe was placed above the Head: and the Nation troubled with ſuch a State-Apoplexy, or Political Meagrim, that it would ſoon have reel'd to its deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (being drunk with Rebellion) had not the Heavens made a reſtautation of our priſtine Laws and ancient Liberty, by the re-eſtabliſhment of our moſt gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. Thus did they wheel about the Circumference of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:110845:108"/>
till they hit upon the Center, <hi>viz.</hi> Monarchy. How like a ſenſeleſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did the Nation lie, during this ſtrange unheard-of Government? Nor was it a wonder; for how can the Members live without their Head? Miſerable and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable was the condition of the Natives, ſo that they became ridiculous to their Neighbours; Law lay bleeding, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice run quite contrary to her Inſtitution. Learning was of ſo ſmall eſteem and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that it was thought an incumbrance and prejudice to him that could boaſt of it. Divinity was quite out of date; Churches were pulled down for Edification; To rob Cathedrals ſacrilegiouſly, was Piety; The Temple was converted into a Stable; ſo that it might well be ſaid, that Horſe and Man ſerv'd God alike. The Pulpits were hung with blew Aprons, and <hi>Cheapſide</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced better Preachers than <hi>Cambridge.</hi> No Order nor <hi>Decorum</hi> in Gods houſe, but all things ſluttiſhly handled; as if the Queen of Sciences, Divinity, muſt be cloathed in filthy rags. As if the Father of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges underſtood no Language but Engliſh, the Latine and Greek Fathers muſt not be quoted, but were almoſt come to the Chandlers ſhops to make waſte Paper.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:110845:109"/>
No Prayer but what was by the Spirit: Bold audacious Villains, that dare aſcend the Pulpit, and there talk with God <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi> And indeed, moſt of theſe Spirit-mongers made moving Sermons: for not a man of underſtanding in the Church, but would go out before they had done. The Orthodox Clergy were diſ-reſpected, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated, reviled, impriſoned, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what not? But why, or wherefore, no one knew: as ſqueamiſh as theſe Sectaries ſeemed to be, they could ſwallow down fat Benefices, and never diſgorge them. The Steeple-Houſes muſt down, they were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious buſineſſes; They ſay, their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I ſay, their large Conſciences promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to theſe ſacrilegious actions; and all for the promoting of their own filthy lucre and ſelf-intereſt; which made them convert thoſe Church-Utenſils that were conſecrated to Sacred uſes, to their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and profit. Theſe foul fiends haunted ſacred grounds moſt, not out of devotion, but gain; Thus was it their dayly practice to learn to leap over Steeples: and whereas we uſed to ſay, <hi>Lord encreaſe our Faith;</hi> we might then heartily cry out and ſay, <hi>Lord decreaſe our Faiths;</hi> for we had then ſo many among us, that if a Jew or Pagan had come
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:110845:109"/>
to be converted among us, he would have found as much difference in the outward ceremony and preaching of the Word, as there is between our Tenets and theirs: Outward ſhew and oſtentation had almoſt worm'd out the Subſtance of Religion. But this Cockatrice (thanks to Heaven) was cruſht in the Shell; this prodigious birth prov'd abortive, almoſt as ſoon confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as conceived. Had we ſuffered thoſe Birds of prey to have been fledge (for they were but pin-feathered) it might have been ſaid in our Proverb, that <hi>we brought up Birds to pick out our own eyes.</hi> But they were all ſoon got by Lowbelling; theſe ſilly Wood-cocks were enſnared in a Gin laid by the Royal Party. Well may <hi>Albion</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge St <hi>George</hi> her Patron, ſince we have a Trinity of them to protect us; one St <hi>George,</hi> and a brace of Sir <hi>Georges.</hi> This Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee-Conventicle of <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> was ſoon crackt and diſſolved; which hapned very ſucceſsfully, for elſe the whole Nation had ſoon come to its diſſolution. If ever there was a Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> ſure it was here then; for what could be ſaid of <hi>England</hi> more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than that it was a Land of Confuſion? Now the Anabaptiſts ſtrutted it <hi>en cuerpo;</hi> they domineered as if they had been ſole
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:110845:110"/>
Maſters of the Univerſe: And had liberty to broach their damnable and erroneous opinions in all places without controule: <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour,</hi> that part of the Commandment they allowed; and <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth thou ſhalt teach,</hi> that was their own addition; at work all the week, and a preaching on Sundaies. Surely the leaven of theſe Phariſees muſt be very ſtrong, that can work a Cobler out of the Stall into the Pulpit; where you might ſee him thumb the Bible with his maſſey fiſt, and begins to pitch on a portion of Scripture, though he begin at the wrong end of the Book; and then like a Fugitive, runs away from the Text (and how can he do otherwiſe? for he is beſide the Laſt.) <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> was an ancient Proverb; but they neglected all antiquity ſo much, that they pulled down all Churches whoſe outſide pronounced them ancient, and crept in holes and corners; which is enough to evince that they can never be regiſtred <hi>inter Angelos,</hi> who were found ſo often <hi>in Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi> but their deeds of darkneſs required ſuch dark corners, who if they had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Light, had ſoon manifeſted their imbecility and villany: But now we may in the Juglers Dialect ſay, <hi>Preſto!

                     <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Legion of Hobgoblins are vaniſhed; <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> routed his Forces, and ſecured his Perſon; where now in the Tower he hath ſo much liberty (though confined) as to ſing a <hi>Palinode</hi> for his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt miſdemeanors, if he have but the grace to do ſo: his helliſh crew may wait for his deliverance by an Angel, as long as the Turks did for the Reſurrection of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and find themſelves at length mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably deluded. All which may afford them matter of repentance, if they have but the knowledge to make a ſpiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſo gracious an opportunity. But as their reign was ſhort and of ſmall continuance, ſo will we be, ſuiting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the matter diſcourſed on, and come to the third ſort of this new-fangled Government, which will take up the laſt Chapter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <head>Of the Rumpdom.</head>
                  <p>THe Subject of this diſcourſe being concerning the Rump, we thought fit to place it in the Buttock of our Book, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:110845:111"/>
ſo we may come to an end by diſcourſing of an End, a Fag-end of Parliament, the Rump. It is credibly reported, that noble <hi>Brown</hi> was their Godfather, and beſtowed this name upon theſe Arſe-worms; which proves him to be as good a <hi>Nomenclator</hi> as <hi>Adam,</hi> who gave names according to the nature of the Beaſts that came before him; and ſo did he; which was, and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be a brand upon them (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Vote that paſt in the Houſe for a fifty pound forfeiture on every perſon that ſhould call them by that name) and their poſterity, ſo long as the Sun and Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures. Had he ſearched all the Dictionaries that ever were extant, he could never have found out a term more ſuitable for them. Had theſe beaſts been to enter the Ark, it would have puzzled <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf to have ſuited them into pairs.</p>
                  <p>This Rump was made up of a Rabble of rude, illiterate, rebellious fellows; a heap or cluſter of Mechanicks; that intended to reduce the Nation to as much ſlavery and ſervility, as they themſelves were born to. And firſt of all, let us nip <hi>Heſilrig;</hi> that wide-mouth'd fellow, that could ſwallow down Church and Biſhops Lands without any ſcruple or conſcience: ſo furious a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:110845:111"/>
that he was able to ſet a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in combuſtion: One, that would have made a Bonefire of the City, ſo that he might but have warm'd his hands thereby, rather than fail. So horrible a Mammoniſt, that he was reſolved to cram his Coffers, though he ſtarved his Conſcience: ſo that <hi>Lord have mercy upon rich Sir A. Heſilrig a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> might have been the ſum of his Letany.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Desborow,</hi> that bloudy beef-brain'd wretch falls under our deſcription next; who was a State <hi>Hay-gee-ho,</hi> or Carter; and never ſhall come to the honour to be Waggoner to <hi>Charles his Wain;</hi> who ſtill thought, when he ſate in the Parliament, that he was whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Country Teem; and therefore alwaies endeavoured to ride the Citizens, and make Aſſes of them. But indeed, to ſpeak truth, we cannot much blame the Man; for he was ever ſo much uſed to the Whip, that he muſt ſtill be laſhing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came. Yet one would have thought he might have ſpit in his hand and took better hold; for now his Whip may prove like a Rod for his own Breech: But no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, every School-boy could have told him, that the Rump uſed to pay for all faults; And he might have remembred that we have a Proverb runs thus, <hi>The Pot goes not ſo</hi>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:110845:112"/>
                     <hi>often to the water, but it comes broke home at laſt;</hi> which no doubt he will ſoon be made ſenſible of. But I am weary with whiſtling to this Brawny Boor.</p>
                  <p>Enter <hi>Scot:</hi> his very name implies trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; <hi>As treacherous as a Scot,</hi> is old, though true; and may be appliable to him: for they are as true Types one of the other, as the Dragon of the Devil. A bitter enemy to Kingſhip he was, and one that had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to affirm publikely (ſo report in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me) that he was one of the chiefeſt that ſate in the Higheſt Court of Injuſtice for the executing of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt; and were it to do again, he would be as ready upon that deſign as ever. Sure he was ſome kin to a Tinker, he proves himſelf ſuch a man of metal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Surge Harry Martin;</hi> ſhew thy ſmock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: well might he be a Rumper, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted ſo much in the Tail. A lewd diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fellow; fitter to walk before a party of Whores, than to lead up a Regiment of Horſe. This is one of that ſanctified Crew, that would procure any buſineſs to be done, if a female, from whom he might but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a kindneſs, put up the Petition. But he was once handſomly fitted by a handſome Girl; which action made the name of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:110845:112"/>
firſt known in <hi>England:</hi> His luſtful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, though unaccompliſhed, coſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds in ſawce; only they were ſo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to beſtow a dinner of him, inviting ſome other of the Members of this mock-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only to divulge the frollick. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, <hi>Harry,</hi> take this advice as from a friend, Beware of all ſuch coſtly petitions, if ever it be thy hap to prefer any more.</p>
                  <p>But to dwell upon particulars thus, would require a Volume: I muſt haſten, fince I am come to the end. Thus did <hi>Nol</hi> and the Rump play at Noſe in a—with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intending (as it is thought) to ſtink the People out of their dominions, and to remain with their Confederates Lords of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> (As for the Rumpers, they provided a Scavenger) to ſweep <hi>London-</hi>ſtreets; and he hath ſwept them away, and made the houſe clean for more deſerving Perſons. I wonder what benefit did ever accrew to the Nation by their Acts and Ordinances; or when did they ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, but, Tinker-wiſe, in mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one hole they made three? All their conſultations tended only to their own preferment. A knot of gnawing Vermine, that fed upon the fat of the Land; A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Book-worms, who, becauſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:110845:113"/>
themſelves, were reſolved to deſtroy all Learning, and implunge the People into an Abyſs of Brutiſhneſs and Barbariſm: and make them ſubſcribe to, and approve of whatſoever their dunghil ſpirits promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to. But I muſt draw to a period. This New-fangled Model you have under the notion of <hi>Modern Policy</hi> (though it is a favour to call it ſo) for <hi>Rebellion</hi> it ſhould be; but I was unwilling to front my Page with ſo formidable a Title. For the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been too too long ſenſible of the heavy effects of Rebellion; which have lighted ſomewhat hard upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The latter part of this Piece, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, differs from the former, as much as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> from <hi>Democritus;</hi> yet it is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I preſume, (if I may be thought a ſufficient Apothecary) to put a ſcruple of mirth into a doſe of ſeriouſneſs; wherefore I ſhall conclude with what I ever made my Motto,
