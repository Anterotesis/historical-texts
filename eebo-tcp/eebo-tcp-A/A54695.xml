            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And therefore, if as the Law hath often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the Kings Charters are void, and not pleadable by Law, when they are repugnant to the Laws, Acts of Parliament, Maxims, and reasonable Customs of the Realm, that it is not in the Kings power by his Charter or last Will and Testament, to grant away the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to another Prince, or Potentate, as it was resolved in the Case of the supposed grant of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> to <hi>William Duke of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and that grant of King <hi>John</hi> to the Pope, to hold <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> of him, and that notwithstanding the grant made by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, to <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> of the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Chester, tenendum per gladium,</hi> and <hi>ita libere,</hi> as the King himself did hold <hi>England,</hi> the Earldom of <hi>Chester,</hi> was holden of the King, that the grant of King <hi>H.</hi> 2. to the Monks of St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> that the Prior &amp; the Monks should be as free in their Church,<note n="(o)" place="margin">13 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</note> as the King was in his Crown, was adjudged to be void, for that the Prior, and the Monks were but Subjects, and that by the Law, the King may <hi>no more denude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his Royal Superiority over his Subjects, then his Subjects</hi> can renounce or avoid their subjection to their King, and the reason why such or the like grants of the King by his Charter are void, is not in regard it was

            <p>And therefore the King cannot saith <hi>Dier</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease or grant a Tenure <hi>in Capite</hi> to any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Dier</hi> 44. when King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> granted to the <hi>Black Prince</hi> his Son the grant of the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> all Wards, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and Reliefs, <hi>non obstante,</hi> the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, it was adjudged that the Prince could not seise a Ward which held of the Kings Ward,<note n="(p)" place="margin">43. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssise plit.</hi> 1.</note> because it belonged to the King by his Prerogative.</p>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63030:135"/>
can no more make an Act to confirme that which should not be done or granted, then his own grant or Charter could have done, or than if he and the House of Commons only had made an Act; As it appeareth by the Ordinance which the Lords <hi>Ordainers,</hi> so from thence called, did obtain from <hi>Edward</hi> 2. whereby he delegated much of his Regal Authority unto them, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards complained of in Parliament, made void, and the Authors or Lords Ordainers punished; for it hath been clearly asserted by eminent and learned Judges and Sages of the Law, as the Lord cheif Justice <hi>Hobart,</hi> Sr. <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Jonh Davis,</hi> Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General to King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Superlative power of Parliaments above all but the King, is in some things for restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it cannot enact things against Right Reason, or common Right, or against the Lawes of God or Nature, that a man shall be Judge in his own Case, as that the King shall have no Subsidies whereby to defend himself and his people, that Children shall not obey their Parents, and the like.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And when a Parliament is called by the Kings Writ to preserve his Kingdom, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> so little intends that any future Parliament should alter or take away any
