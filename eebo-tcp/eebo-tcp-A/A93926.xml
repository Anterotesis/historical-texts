         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of one of the moſt ſaddeſt Stories
that hath been related in this latter age,
in which you have theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, A true Character of <hi>T. W.</hi> late
Miniſter of <hi>Langley Buriall,</hi> his life and
actions, according to his own Confeſſions, Letters and
Accuſations of his own dear fellow-creatures, whilſt he
continued Ranting upon the publique Stage of <hi>Wilts,</hi> with
the proceedings of the Juſtices againſt him the ſaid
<hi>Webb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou haſt laid before thee a Catalogue of
Parſon <hi>Webbs</hi> moſt notorious untruths diſperſed in his <hi>Maſs
of malice</hi> againſt his Judge, the Juſtices of Peace, and his
accuſers and proſecutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118361:4"/>
Thirdly, Thou haſt divers of thoſe untruths guarded
with replies of truth tending to clear up the innocency of
the moſt falſly accuſed <hi>E. S.</hi> from thoſe fierce, foul and
hell-invented aſperſions laid to his charge by the malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
mock-Parſon <hi>T. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Narrative aforeſaid is now made publique,
Firſt, To inform the world upon what grounds <hi>Tho. Webb</hi>
was proſecuted and tried for his life in the County of
<hi>Wilts;</hi> and wherefore he was ejected the Parſonage of
<hi>L. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To give a true Character of the moſt delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Parſon <hi>T. W.</hi> that others be not deceived by him, as
many hundreds in <hi>Wilts</hi> have been, many of whom are
bound to curſe the day that ever they ſaw his fawning face,
or heard his deceitfull tongue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To clear up the innocency of thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to make it manifeſt that their proceedings againſt
the ſaid <hi>T. W.</hi> were neither unjuſt, illegall, nor malicious,
as the Author of the <hi>Maſs of malice</hi> and his Ranting gang
give out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To lay open the weakneſſe, wickedneſſe and
vanity of the Ranting principle and practice, that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may be juſtified of her children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the mouth
of ungodlineſſe ſtopped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude with the Pſalmiſt,</hi> Bleſſed is the man that
maketh the Lord his truſt, and reſpecteth not the proud, nor
ſuch as turn aſide to lies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Thou art deſired to take notice of two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
for the better underſtanding of the Author, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Narrative.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is not his intention in any wiſe to caſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

of the Goſpel, for ſuch he accounts <hi>worthy of double
honour,</hi> according to that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. whom to deſpiſe,
is to deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe meſſengers they are, ſent
out to proclaim the grace and love of God to ſinners, that
<hi>they may be turned from darkneſs to light, from the power of
Satan to God;</hi> whoſe number the Lord increaſe for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his great Name.</p>
            <p>But prophane, ignorant and ſcandalous Miniſters, and
ſuch as take upon them the work of publique Miniſters and
Preachers, when never ſent of the Lord, nor allowed or
approved of men, nor any way gifted and qualified for ſo
glorious a work, whoſe light is but darkneſſe, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
is in the fleſh, whoſe God is their belly, who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their ſhame, who minde earthly things: Amongſt
which number you ſhall finde the painted ſepulchre, and
wandering ſtarre <hi>T. W.</hi> with his moſt beſotted faction and
adherents: Theſe are the mock-Parſons and Prieſts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and intended in the Narrative, and none other; and
who in their beſt eſtate make but a fair ſhew in the fleſh, to
accompliſh their wicked and moſt pernicious ends, which
when obtained, their abominations appear to the great
ſcandal of Religion, and the righteous waies and people
of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond particular is to let the Reader know that the
ſaid Narrative is the more dark and hard to be underſtood,
becauſe the names of many perſons, principall actors in
the <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Rant, and others deluded and abuſed by them,
are at this time paſt over in ſilence, and not made publique,
and that for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Many of them ſeem to repent of their folly and
madneſſe; and if their repentance prove true (and not
like that of <hi>T. W.</hi>) their names ſhall be concealed for ever
by this Author, otherwiſe they may appear with their
actions in due time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:118361:5"/>
Secondly, Some of them have been but as weak inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the hands of the mighty Ranters, and therefore
wholly paſt over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some of them have promiſed to publiſh to
the world the <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Rant more perfectly then the
Author, and therefore at preſent their names are left
out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some being in great eſteem as yet amongſt
the godly people, the Author was unwilling to publiſh
thoſe words and papers which he received from others of
the Ranting crue, concealing them in hopes that they will
acquit themſelves like men; and withall knowing that
the Ranters, eſpecially <hi>T. W.</hi> and his fellows, are like
to the <hi>Cretians,</hi> who <hi>are alwaies liars, evil beaſts, ſlow bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:
But they ſhall proceed no further, for their folly ſhall be

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anifeſt it is that the Accuſer of the Brethren, the old
Serpent, the Lier from the beginning, could never have
acted ſo much miſchief in the world, if he had alwaies
appeared in his own Shape: wherefore that he may
the better accompliſh his ends, he preſents himſelf
oftentimes in the ſhape of an Angel of Light, and ſo he teacheth all
his angels or miniſters to appear: So the falſe prophets of old, the
deceivers of this age, and all hypocrites appear in Sheeps cloathing,
with a form of godlineſſe, with the Word of the Lord in their
mouths; and although theſe perſons know nothing as they ought
to know, yet they aſſume all knowledge to themſelves: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they are poſſeſſed by an unclean ſpirit, yet ſometime they cry
up a clean converſation; and all this is becauſe they would the more
eaſily accompliſh their corrupt intereſts, beguile unſtable ſouls, and
lead captive ſilly profeſſors. Nay many of theſe are ſo much given
up to beleeve lies, to deceive, and be deceived, that they are become
pure in their own di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s: And as the man that would tell a lie ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that at laſt he beleeved it to be a truth, ſo theſe men being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of evil, beleeve themſelves and their curſed waies to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that from a curſed principle which they hold, (<hi>viz.) There
is nothing ſin but what a man thinks to be ſo:</hi> This the wiſe man ſpeaks
of, <hi>Prov. 30. 11. There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
and yet is not waſhed from their filthineſſe.</hi> A right character of our
<hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Ranters, who ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity, ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves in their own deceivings, whilſt they beguile unſtable
ſouls, and ly in wait to deceive the ignorant. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe painted Sepulchres are diſcovered by truth and time,
which maketh manifeſt, and it will appear that whilſt they aſſume
all knowledge to themſelves, and profeſſe themſelves wiſe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fools, and this is the great work of our bleſſed Saviour, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118361:6"/>
cover and deſtroy the works of the devil, to take away the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
painting and falſe covering caſt upon foul and unclean hearts,
and to lay them open to publique view: and certainly Jeſus Chriſt
will firſt or laſt bring every hidden work to light, the pureſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
muſt be diſcovered, as well as the prophane perſon: and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
is made divers waies.</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes by the terrible pangs of a guilty and accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
haſtening and hurrying the ſoul towards deſperation: in this
condition many times the moſt ſecret and hidden works of darkneſs
are brought to light; and now men vomit up their own ſhame and
confeſſe with horror and aſtoniſhment of ſpirit, their former curſed
and abominable waies and actions.</p>
            <p>2. Sometimes by the falling out of thoſe who have been brethren
and co-partners in iniquity; this way many theeves are brought to
the Gallows, and unclean perſons to Juſtice: And to the honour of
God, and to his praiſe be it recorded for ever; The Ranters were
building their <hi>Babel</hi> of Prophaneneſſe and Community in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi>
but were conſtrained to pluck it down with their own hands, they
laying open each others wickedneſſe, having each other before the
Magiſtrate, and accuſing each other in the day of their fury and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
confuſions, as this Narrative will demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes hypocrites and diſſemblers to regain their loſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
by a fained repentance, lay open the wickedneſſe, madneſſe and
folly of their own hearts and waies, and confeſſe their moſt ſecret
and boſome luſts, and hidden corruptions, with promiſes of a new
life, and never more to turn to folly; yet having eyes full of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and that cannot ceaſe from ſin; they return with the Dog to
the vomit, and with the Sow that was waſhed to the former wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the mire: notwithſtanding with the whore mentioned,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 30. they wipe their mouths and ſay, they <hi>have done no wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe.</hi>
Theſe can ſometimes ſpeak purely, yet live filthily: They
plead liberty, <hi>yet are the ſervants of ſin.</hi> Theſe are ſelf-juſtitiaries,
ſelf-ſeekers, ſuch as ſacrifice to their own nets; lovers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their own deluded followers: Deſpiſers of thoſe that are
good, or do any waies proteſt againſt their witleſſe, worthleſſe
whimſeys and practiſes; yet through the juſt judgement of the Lord,
theſe deluders, ſeducers and deceivers, are oftentimes brought to
light, and are made (mauger their hearts) to demonſtrate what they
are in reality.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118361:6"/>
And what diſcovery the Ranting crew, even the moſt eminent
of them have made of themſelves and of each other, the enſuing
narrative will ſufficiently demonſtrate, in which you have little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their own Confeſſions, Letters and Accuſations of each other,
and that will ſufficiently declare that their deſtruction and ruine is
of themſelves, and not from the Magiſtrate, as they moſt untruly
give out, with a world of other notorious lies and ſcandals; (the
fitteſt imployment of ſuch a generation of people) which they
heap upon all that diſown their curſed principles and laſcivious
waies.</p>

late of <hi>Langley Buriall</hi> within the ſaid County; who came as an
Angel of Light into thoſe parts, with a great form of godlineſſe, in
ſheeps cloathing; whereby he gained with eaſe the affections of
many, not only hypocrites, but ſincere hearted Chriſtians, who took
him to be as he only ſeemed to be: As new things, ſo new or ſtrange
perſons affect much: So new brooms ſweep clean; this man ſeems
to be of a blameleſſe life and converſation: and being furniſhed
with cunning and expreſſion, makes uſe of it to his beſt advantage,
and ſo rouls up and down,<note place="margin">

aforeſaid; and having obtained the parſonage there, he preached
and practiſed for ſome ſhort ſpace, that none could ſpy out his
wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>This young Stripling, having formerly made himſelf a Preacher,
forſaking his lawfull Calling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth tithes.</note> becomes a Pariſh Prieſt or Parſon;
and being ſetled to his content, and obtaining a Gleab worth 70<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>

the good will of divers of the moſt ignorant pariſhioners, and
others lookt upon him as a conſciencious man, not knowing what

            <p>Not long after his ſettlement he buries his ſecond wife at <hi>Langley</hi>

ſaid <hi>Thomas Webbe</hi> became ſo far in love with a certain Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(notwithſtanding her husband was then and there living)
inſomuch that he engageth himſelf to be a faithfull friend and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118361:7"/>
ſervant unto her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> makes himſelf ſure to another mans wife. <hi>T. W.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits adultery by his own confeſſion.</note> not to marry with, or make uſe of any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
beſides her ſelf; and thereupon he had (as he ſaith) divers
times carnal knowledge of, and fellowſhip with her.</p>
            <p>But as he ſaid conſcience fled in his face, and would not ſuffer him
to continue this vile courſe: But its rather thought one woman was
not ſufficient to ſatisfie his brutiſh luſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore in a ſhort time he marries a modeſt ſober young
woman,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his third wife.</note> without the conſent and to the great grief of her friends;
whereupon a great difference grows between the two former luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
lovers; the Parſon is charged with perfidiouſneſſe and breach
of promiſe, but he being grown a cunning Pariſh Prieſt, hath a ſalve
ready to cure this ſore, gives ſatisfaction by a new Engagement;
which made good that ſaying of his, That <hi>there's no Heaven but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nor no hell ſave Marriage:</hi> So that this late Marriage prevents
not the rage of luſt in either. But notwithſtanding that ſo many
times a week are ſet apart for the ſatisfying of the fleſh. And now
any reaſonable creature would think that the former Marriage, and
the late agreement would have contented both parties. But the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
(in wickedneſſe) is not yet near enough; And therefore about
<hi>March</hi> 1650. two houſes being too many, and at too great a diſtance
for ſuch choice lovers: Both families are united in one, and <hi>Thomas
Webbe</hi> removes, the former diſtance being almoſt a ſlight ſhot, was
too farre to ſtrike whileſt the iron is hot; neither could wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
be acted ſo covertly, nor kept ſo cloſely in many meetings,
(and it was not yet time to profeſſe their principles publiquely to
the world.) Here modeſty commands the Author in ſilence to paſs
over many particulars of uncleanneſſe confeſſed by the ſaid <hi>Thomas
Webbe</hi> in the time of his pretended Repentance and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Well, now the famous families are united, and the uniters won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
well pleaſed, and none diſpleaſed. The Patron and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
wife rejoice, being in hopes to enjoy each others love more
conſtantly then formerly: But the devout Parſon and his co-partner
in wickedneſſe, having brought their Swine to ſo fair a market, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to eat no ſuch fleſh; nor to be ſo prophane or ſilly as to delight
themſelves with lawfull things; leaving that to thoſe that know
not their liberty; and to nice and weak-ſighted Phariſees (as they
term thoſe that dare not, will not, cannot, run with them into the
ſame exceſſe of Riot) And let thoſe deluded ſouls feed their fancies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118361:7"/>
with vain hopes or empty husks as long as they pleaſe, all's one to
theſe endeared lovers, who have attained to the height of humane
ſociety, and Chriſtian (<hi>alias</hi> diabolicall) liberty, and to ſo much
perfection as to know their fellow-creatures from other cattell. 'Tis
not for ſervants to pry into their Maſters nor Miſtriſſes ſecrets, nor
to meddle with their meat. Mixt Governours of a mixt family ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the higheſt knowledge and deepeſt underſtanding, are fitteſt to
bear Rule, and to rule the reſt: Wherefore no pitty nor praiſe ſhall
attend the forlorn hope of the P. and Parſons wife, who are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſtand as Ciphers, or at beſt as ſervants, to ſtand ſtill or wait,
whilſt thoſe who are more ſpiritually wicked, give up themſelves to
chambring and wantonneſs.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Thomas Webbe</hi> being a Parſon of the laſt Edition, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
undertaken a great charge, laies about him how to manage all
his affairs, as becomes a man of ſo excellent parts and calling, and
hold out to the end; which that he may be able to do, and come off
with credit, the ſweet draughts of an Independent heat, the moſt
coroborating cordials, the fatteſt morſels, and the moſt delicate
fare is provided for his ſweet tooth (which never goes alone) and
good reaſon, for hereby he is made able to give content to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Creature, and to anſwer all ſcruples that might ariſe againſt him
from or by means of any pretended relation, or formall union, ſuch as
Ranters term marriage to be.</p>
            <p>For you are to underſtand that ere a long time is paſt over, even
before this pious (or rather impious) Pariſh Prieſt, had taken his
fill of luſt; although the Gentlewomans husband remains conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet the Parſons wife being more ſenſible, begins to grumble,
and grows paſſionate, and manifeſts much trouble; fearing leaſt her
husband <hi>Thomas Webbe</hi> (notwithſtanding his ſeeming ſanctity)
would prove an unclean Parſon. Hereupon the ſlipſhood Prieſt is
put to his trumps; yet he having taken ſo many degrees in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
reſolves to anſwer and ſilence this caſe of conſcience alſo; and
therefore ſummons all his wits together, and when he findes them
all too ſhallow, he cals to his councell his fellow-creature, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of better underſtanding, and of riper wit then himſelf (two
heads being better then one) they make up and contrive a ſilencing
argument to ſatisfie and content this complaining Spirit of the poor
woman.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a cunning and devilliſh plot is contrived, for they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118361:8"/>
action to be more prevalent then argument, to make her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
her liberty and the Ranters true doctrine.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the firſt place the Parſons wife is inſtructed in
the lawfulneſſe of making uſe of any other man (ſetting relation
aſide) whom ſhe could moſt affect: And further ſhe is taught that
God hath not tied up mankinde from thoſe injoyments which are
left free to the beaſts of the field, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this doctrine ariſe many uſes, but the uſe which is inſiſted
upon is an uſe of examination; the Parſons wife is ſtrictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Webbs</hi> fellow Creature, Whom ſhe loved beſt, or whom ſhe
could love moſt beſides her husband? The woman being preſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
upon this point, and being (as is ſuppoſed) ignorant of
the depths of Satan, and not knowing that there was a hook under
the Bait, confeſſeth, that next to her husband ſhe could moſt affect
ſuch a man, naming a luſty young man, who lived not far from
<hi>Langley,</hi> and one who made often reſort thither, and was in great
eſteem with the fellow-Creatures, and therefore as right as a gun
(and as pat to the purpoſe as might be) to accompliſh the deſign in
hand, which was to cure the rage of jealouſie in one, and to ſet two
fellow-Creatures at the more liberty and freedom; and good reaſon
that one womans tongue ſhould be ſilent, whilſt two conſciences
were rockt aſleep in the cradle of luſt made after the Ranting
mode.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> a kinde of Pander to his own wife.</note> There is a time and place appointed. The time is
whilſt <hi>Thomas Webbe</hi> is Preaching in the publique Congregation,
and therefore moſt likely to be on the Lords day: and the place is
near the Congregation. At this time and in this place, by the great
induſtry and contrivance of <hi>Webbe</hi> and his fellow Creatures, the
young man aforeſaid, and the Parſons wife meet, where no time is
to be loſt, and therefore whilſt <hi>Webbe</hi> is Preaching in the Church,
others of his fellow Creatures, whom he had taught to live above
Ordinances, are practiſing their higher principles at home; and to
that purpoſe a ſumptuous bed is perfumed and well warmed (to
prevent danger) and the young man with the Parſons wife, are
brought into the ſaid bed, and the backwardneſſe of the woman is
ſpurred forward by the ſubtile perſwaſions of the fellow Creatures;
and her modeſty overpowred by the immodeſty of the others, ſo
that ere the preachment is done in the Church, the practice is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in the houſe, and in bed theſe perſons are laid, and then the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118361:8"/>
Parſon is ſent for by his fellow Creatures, who haſtily and chier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
comes into the ſaid chamber, where he perceives (as he had
before plotted) his wife in bed with the young man; at which
ſight <hi>Webbe</hi> (as one tranſported) in ſtead of a ſharp reproof or other
diſlike, brings out of his Prieſtly budget, this reverend grave ſalute;
<hi>Well ſaid T,</hi> (ſaith he, naming the young man) <hi>is this your liberty?
well done wife, well done, pray God bleſſe you together,</hi> or to that effect:
and ſo departed the chamber, having his mouth filled with laughter,
and his heart with confidence, that he had laid his wifes tongue as
ſtill as his own conſcience: And though (thinks he) I am with
my ſweet and lovely Miſtreſs, and fellow Creatures early and late,
night and day, taking my fill in dalliance and fleſhly delight, yet my
wife cannot clamour; if ſhe be jealous, yet ſhe muſt ſay nothing,
leaſt I caſt this in her diſh: Oh unheard of wickedneſſe! Oh pretty
prophane Preacher! Art thou he that liveſt in the Spirit? that haſt
attained to a higher light? that art raiſed up againſt a time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
to help forward the work? Art thou more wiſe, more
holy, more knowing then the Biſhops, and the Epiſcopal Preachers?
Then the Presbyterian and Independent Miniſters, or rather, art thou
not altogether notwithſtanding like a deceitfull Idol? Thou art guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with godlineſſe I ſay: Art thou not altogether in the fleſh? Is
not the light that is in thee darkneſſe? Art thou not raiſed up of the
devil to bring an evil report upon the work of Reformation? Do
not the Epiſcopalians hate thy waies in wickedneſſe? Do not the
Presbyterians hear of thy fame, or rather infamy, and harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

            <p>But to go on, leaving for a time this L. Parſon with his female
fellow Creatures, as full of ſecurity and content, as of luſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.
The Reader is to take another relation along with him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> his man wife diſcover'd.</note>
that ſo he may know this goodly Preacher. Wherefore note that
<hi>Webbs</hi> moſt principall favourite, and greateſt choiceſt aſſociate in

himſelf, of whom a ſtranger cannot but ſay, or at leaſt think, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118361:9"/>
butter would not melt in his mouth (as we uſe to ſay) yet here
you will perceive, as the Proverb is, <hi>The ſtill Sow eats all the draught.</hi>
This man with his Cob-webb ſeeming ſobriety, and unclean inſide,
is taken by <hi>Tho. Webbe,</hi> as men uſe to take their wives, For better
for worſe: So I ſay, this man is honoured with the title of <hi>Webbs</hi>
wife, for ſo he cals him, My wife <hi>O;</hi> and <hi>O</hi> owns <hi>Webb</hi> for a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
and now where ever they come, 'tis my wife <hi>O,</hi> and my

which to prophane hearts is an in-let to luſt: but whether ever he
plaied any helliſh tune with his Organ or Church muſick yea or no,
is not yet diſcovered: But this is diſcovered, that both the man and
the man-wife were in other things brethren in iniquity, and have
brought more ſhame upon the profeſſors of the Goſpel, then all the
hypocrites and whore mongers of this later age.</p>
            <p>This <hi>J. O.</hi> is of an honeſt Stock and Parentage and lived in his

with, and bids farwell to his naturall affection (the firſt ſtep towards
the perfection of Ranters) he forſakes his own lawfull wife, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

a Companion and Traveller, a light Maid forſooth, being his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

in his own Country was totally extinct. And the better to do this,
<hi>Webbe</hi> makes him a Preacher before he goeth; for <hi>Webbe</hi> is moſt

go: <hi>O.</hi> appears there like a great new light, though no bigger then
a farthing candel, grows into eſteem with men of quality, and with
the good people in thoſe parts becomes a moſt ſingular Preacher
there: and gains a living or ſome other ſtipend for his ſaid Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but long he continues not there, ere all the fat fals into the
fire, and the two Lovers fall at variance; and ſo through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118361:9"/>
judgement of God, the Travellers return, the woman to her
Parents, and <hi>O</hi> to his Wife and family, crying ſhame on his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
progreſſe, and pretending to the Authour great ſorrow; and
hath promiſed to lay open the pernitious waies of the Ranting
crew. Wherefore no more of this, but to conclude this ſad ſtory
with theſe Queries.</p>
            <p>1. Whether <hi>J. O.</hi> aforeſaid being an ingenuous young man, was
not a fit piece of the Creation, to be a wife for <hi>T. Webbe</hi> the
Parſon?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the ſaid <hi>Webbe</hi> be not a man of a thouſand to make a
Pariſh Parſon, and publique Preacher in this time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</p>
            <p>3. Whether all the godly people in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> ought not to admire
the ſingular parts and gifts of this famous non-ſuch Parſon, as the
happineſs of ſuch as injoy him?</p>
            <p>4. Whether they ought not to be recommended amongſt thoſe
that are eminent lovers of Liberty and Chriſtianity, that ſubſcribe
a Certificate of <hi>Webbs</hi> preachings and actings, to help him to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the future in a ſtrange place?</p>
            <p>But now to return and review this famous mock-Parſon, with his
female fellow-Creatures, you may finde him enjoying his liberty
with all quietneſſe and content, and for a time without check or
controul ſwimming down the ſtream of luſt. Yet the hand of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
is pleaſed ſometimes to fall upon, and to affrighten, even thoſe
that are lulled aſleep in all carnall ſecurity, and become ſenſleſſe in
their luſts; and ſo it happens to the unhappy Parſon, who thought
erſt while that he had for ever ſilenced his wives tongue, and his
own conſcience, but now findes himſelf deluded: what ever his
conſcience doth, yet his wife grumbles afreſh, and begins to look
ſad upon the buſineſſe, and to take to heart her husbands familiarity
with his fellow-Creatures; and ſo much is the poor woman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with their doings, that ſhe ſeems willing to chuſe death at
any hand, rather then her husband ſhould continue in the tents of
wickedneſſe: whereupon <hi>Webbe</hi> is adviſed to have a care of his wife,
and to remove her from the aforementioned family, otherwiſe evil
would come of it. Well, the Parſon ſeeing no other remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
himſelf for a journey, and takes his wife with him; a great
kindneſſe, that a man of his principle could ſo far humble himſelf
and deny himſelf, as to leave for a while his fellow Creature, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118361:10"/>
cleave to his wife, but <hi>Patience perforce is a medicine for a mad Dog.</hi>
the Cynicall Parſon is neceſſitated hereunto, for fear of, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a worſe inconvenience: But it's not long ere <hi>Webbe</hi> returns
in hopes to be accounted a white boy, as formerly, and to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as in times of Yore;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>T. W.</hi> fals at variance with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs <hi>M. W.</hi>
               </note> but he is deceived in his expectation: He
is to give an account of his idle journey, of his pretended kindneſſe
to a ſimple thing call'd a Wife; of going out and returning in, as if
he were at his own diſpoſe; and ſo high are theſe miſdemeanours
ſtretch; that the ſilly Parſon is at his wits end; for being an Engliſh
man (and more a Parſon) he goes better led then drove; he anſwers
his fellow Creature ſomewhat ſutable to her furious ſpirit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
more love to his wife (contrary to his former promiſe or the
rule of Ranting) which was crime enough: but 'tis an ill winde
blows no body good, the poor woman is like to enjoy better times
then formerly, whilſt on the other ſide the fellow Creature acts the
part of jealouſie even to diſtraction, pretending ſhe would be her
own executioner, and lay violent hands on her ſelf: Yet ſtill the
breach grows wider, and the difference greater; that God who ſets
bounds to the raging ſea, ſets bounds alſo to the raging luſts of
wicked perſons. The pitifull Parſon is in a peck of troubles; whilſt
things are thus disjointed, he well knew he was the common table
talk of the Country, that the godly people grieved for him and
were aſhamed of him, that the prophane made him their ſcorn and
reproach, and with the ſame wounded through his ſides. All that
appeared for Religion or Righteouſneſſe in thoſe parts; therefore
now the man reſolves upon another way, and though his fellow
Creature cauſeth the P. to break the Parſons head, yet afterwards
ſhe brings him a plaiſter, in hopes to reclaim him; yet he reſolves
to ſet up his flag of defiance againſt his own dear fellow-Creature:
[<hi>Ranters are ſeldom long true to themſelves or principles:</hi>] neither
her ſtrikings or ſtroakings, nor frowns, nor flatteries, nor threats,
nor fawnings, ſhall move him to hearken to her again: So that the
houſe is ſo foul, and the much ſtirring hath cauſed ſo great a ſtink,
that the houſholders muſt part, P. <hi>W.</hi> to his Parſonage, and the reſt,
<hi>Gent. as you were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the mock-Parſon bethinks himſelf how to regain his loſt
Credit with the good people, and ſuch as are enemies to the Ranting
way; and to that purpoſe pretends a ſight and ſenſe of his ſin; cries
out alſo upon the lewdneſſe of his fellow-Creature. She alſo ringing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118361:10"/>
a <hi>Langley</hi> peal of <hi>Webbs</hi> wickedneſſe and uncleanneſſe, both which
follow in order briefly.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of a man ſeems to poſſeſſe the hatefull hearts of the late
luſtfull lovers; and as great is the preſent hate, as the former love,
ſo that the Magiſtrates are complained to, and called upon to hear
the buſineſſe; whereupon a day and place is appointed, where two of

poor <hi>Tho. Webbe,</hi> which his fall it is true is exceeding great; and by

that I am made able to ſlight them, and to be very careleſſe of them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I ſhall do what in me lies to defend my ſelf from them: And in order
thereunto, whilſt I am at <hi>London,</hi> I ſhall adviſe with ſome friend about
it, and ſo if our wiſe God ſo order it, I ſhall return and appear before
you at the time appointed, which is this day fortnight, as I underſtand,
humbly thanking you that you would grant a longer time, and withall I
humbly intreat you to ſtand my friend as to let nothing be acted againſt
me in my abſence. I know the way of an unſatiable woman is to ruine
and to have the life of one whom they cannot mold to their Luſts. And
for my part, if ſhe doth ruine me, as that is her intentions, I ſhall glory in
for greater would my miſery have been, if I ſhould have continued in
the waies of her uncleanneſſe. O, <hi>dear Sir,</hi> it's impoſſible almoſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the many temptations ſhe hath followed me withall, and the many
deviſes ſhe hath uſed ever ſince the difference, to bring me over to her
ſelf again: But O let me be accurſed, and O that the earth might ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118361:13"/>
me up alive, rather then I ſhould hearken to her again. <hi>Dear Sir,</hi>
Your neighbour <hi>Uncles</hi> doth me much wrong, and I am forced to write
in an unuſual manner to him: I beſeech you to deſire him to deſiſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
giving out ſuch ſcandalous and falſe things againſt me as he doth:
I know he cannot but ſee into the malicious proceedings that are againſt
me, as by his own words to me he did acknowledge; yet with them he takes
parties, and he and his ſon in law <hi>Crook</hi> doth very much wrong and
abuſe me, whereas if they loved the Goſpel which they would profeſſe,
they would be ſilent. Therefore I beſeech you, though not for my ſake,
yet for the Goſpels ſake deſire him to forbear: and truly in equity, though
my foot hath ſlipped and I have ſinned againſt God, yet none ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
me, and ſpeak reproachfully of me, eſpecially ſuch who would be
thought profeſſors of the Gospel, and ſo much the more that God hath
touched my heart and made it very ſenſible of its ſin. Thus <hi>dear Sir,</hi> in
faithfulneſſe and truth I have made you acquainted with my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
the truth of which I hope God will make good by my life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;

towards <hi>London,</hi> for that my father lieth very ſick and weak, and to
ſee him will be great ſatisfaction to me. As touching the buſineſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
before your Worſhips, when you and others have had a full and
clear hearing of it, and that the tales of both are heard, it will appear
to proceed from the height of malice, and that its but the fruit of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
womans malice: For the queſtion is thus to be ſtated, and the
buſineſſe is thus to be conſidered (<hi>viz.</hi>) There hath been a great famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
and friendſhip between Miſtreſs <hi>White</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> till it was within
this three or four moneths, in which time we have both committed a
great evil, of which it pleaſed God to make me ſenſible; whereupon I
began to forſake, and my ſpirit grew much troubled, and estranged my
ſelf from Miſtreſs <hi>White;</hi> which ſhe perceiving, and having attempted
allwaies and means to keep me, but finding all to be in vain, ſhe now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in this way againſt me; the truth of which our wiſe and al-knowing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118361:14"/>
God knows, and which all impartial and unbiaſſed judgements cannot
but ſee: for were there truth in what they ſay, which there is not, yet
for as much as they have for a long time concealed it; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none was ſo great and ſo much in her favour as I was, ſo long as
God gave me over to be one with her in iniquity, it appear to be but
malice: Much more might be ſaid to prove that it proceeds to be from
malice; they in telling their own tale bewray themſelves, as witneſſe
M. <hi>White,</hi> who what he ſwore to the Jurors, as the Jurors will teſtify
upon oath, when called thereto, he denied before you; nay though <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
was by him, and did juſtifie before him. A fuller relation of the
whole buſineſſe between Miſtreſs <hi>White</hi> and <hi>I,</hi> ye ſhall hear upon the
day appointed, wherein I ſhall anſwer for my ſelf, and which I have
provided to paſſe through the preſſe into the publique. And if it be the
will of God, that through the malice of a ſtrange woman I muſt ſuffer,
I dare not question my God for it, it is the juſt wages of ſin. O that
vile thing that hath been committed between us, and that it will be
made very good to me; for I bleſſe my God for it, who hath delivered
my poor ſoul out of her hands, for greater would have been my wo and
miſery, if I ſhould have continued and have gone on with her in our evil
courſes, then now ſhe can make me by all her falſe and malicious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
againſt me; and therefore rejoyce that God hath called me home, and
not ſuffered me to go on in the waies of ſin continually, which makes me
very much to ſlight and to be careleſſe of what ever ſhe can do againſt
me; and I much rejoyce in my preſent ſufferings, being fully aſſured,
and it's that which I can teſtifie to the whole world, that my preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are becauſe I will no longer ſerve the filthy luſts and deſires of the
fleſh, and this is no new and ſtrange thing, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks often of it,
By the means of a whoriſh woman <hi>A man is brought to a piece of bread,</hi>
and the adultreſſe ſeeks for the precious life. Well, I had rather die
through her malice, then in her wickedneſſe; and I bleſſe my God for it,
I ſpeak it unfainedly, that I had rather beg my bread from door to door,
and end my daies in ſorrow, then to ſit down with her, and ſerve the luſts
and deſires of the fleſh as I have done: and ſo the will of my God be done,
and according to the time appointed, I hope I ſhall be come down from
<hi>London,</hi> and ſhall wait upon your worſhips. This accompt I thought
good to give you, that ſo it ſhould not be thought by any, that I had
withdrawn my ſelf out of fear, and for being guilty, a thing which my
very adverſaries will be very ready to give out: No, I bleſs my God
for it, that as to thoſe things which they charge me withall, I am free

from them all, my enemies themſelves being judges, if they will speak
but the truth: However the Lord will judge between us, and to his
judgement I refer my ſelf, and am no waies afraid what they can do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me: Now I ſhall rejoyce, for I account it's better to ſuffer by ſin, and
forſaking the way of uncleanneſſe, then it is to ſuffer in ſin and in the
way of uncleanneſſe. O bepity that woman, for there is a moſt fearfull
coming of the Lords vengeance and judgement upon her. Gent. I am</p>

to ſingle perſons or to perſons in private; but his zeal carrieth
him farther even into the pulpit, where in the face of the whole
Congregation at <hi>Langley</hi> aforeſaid he Preached upon that Text
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118361:15"/>
mentioned, <hi>Proverbs 6. 26. For by means of a whoriſh woman a man is
brought to a morcell of bread, and the adultereſs ſeeketh for the precious
life.</hi> From whence he admoniſhed his Auditory to beware of ſuch
perſons; telling them that <hi>Solomon</hi> was experienced that the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
woman tended to the ruine of all thoſe that followed them,
and likewiſe (though he was no <hi>Solomon</hi>) yet he brought in his own
experience; and by that alſo urged the Pariſhioners not to follow the
way of uncleanneſſe with ſuch, as he had done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the view of the aforeſaid Humiliation, Confeſſions and
Letters, being acted to the very life (by this Jugling Parſon) many
were in expectation of a great change, and began to think he was
real, and ſo truly ſenſible and ſorrowfull for his evil and unclean life,
and therefore he was received again into favour amongſt many good
people, who exceedingly rejoyced in his returning, who were but
lately grieving for his Ranting and wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Neither can his ſeeming repentance be parallel'd by any Converts,
though ſincerely returning home to God, eſpecially in the former
part and outward appearances: But as <hi>the joy of the hypocrite is ſhort,</hi>
ſo the repenting of wicked and unclean hearts, is but as the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of thorns under the pot; as lightning fils the room with light,
but ſuddenly leaves it as dark as formerly; or as the morning dew
dried up with the riſing ſun; or as the early ſummer-fruit is ſoon ripe
and ſoon rotten; ſo is the repenting noiſe of the Ranting Parſon,
whoſe crackling is extinguiſht with the fire of luſt; the lightning
leaves the room of his prophane heart, and darkneſs keeps poſſeſſion
there; the dew is dried up through the riſing up of L. flames; and
Rottenneſſe ſeaſeth the early fruit of his ſeeming repentance. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſaith truly, <hi>Pro. 27. 8. As a bird wandereth from her nest, ſo is a
man that wandereth from his place,</hi> &amp;c. Was not this man as a ſilly
bird to wander from his place? from his lawfull calling? from the
wife of his boſome? from his pretended purity, to lay the egs of his
filthineſſe in other birds neſts? But becauſe he could act any part on
the devils ſtage; he imitates the Cuckoe alſo, the better to increaſe
a generation of a more pure ſtrain then are produced by lawfull
marriage.</p>
               <p>And then ſee how farre he wanders in a counterfeit repentance:
one would have thought his own tongue had raiſed ſo many Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
againſt his own ſelf, that it was altogether unpoſſible for him
any more to return again into his wonted folly or way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118361:15"/>
or to have familiarity with his fellow-creature any more for
ever.</p>
               <p>But it hath been the uſuall practice of theſe vain perſons to give
the moſt curſed titles to each other, that ever the world practiſed,
or the devil invented, as Toad, Toads brood, Toads Spane, Witch,
Devils brood, and ſuch like, with moſt horrible curſing each other,
like mad Bedlams or Devils incarnate. See <hi>Salmons</hi> Letter before
recited to <hi>Webb,</hi> and yet they love each other intirely; ſcorning
and jearing all that are not of their own Sect; their prophane lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

But to proceed with all poſſible brevity; The reconciliation is
upon ſuch ſure grounds between the fellow-creatures that it holds
to this day; yet the counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand; deſtruction
ſhall ariſe to evil doers from among themſelves.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Reader is deſired to take notice that when
<hi>Thomas Webbs</hi> family was united with Miſtreſs <hi>W.</hi> there being
houſeroom enough; another of the ſame gang is taken with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and there retained as a convenient inmate: for the fellow-creatures
were acquainted with the old ſaying of Cheaters, when
they have enticed young travellers into their company, <hi>The more
the merrier.</hi> Now you muſt note that this man (<hi>William Lewis</hi> by
name) was lately become a very great enemy to M. <hi>Stokes,</hi> who
had formerly oppoſed him in his Ranting principles: For the firſt
that ever manifeſted thoſe principles publiquely to M. <hi>Stokes,</hi> was

               </p>
               <p>And ſo they continue great friends for a good ſpace; but when

                     <hi>T. W.</hi> ſeeks the ruine of his own fellow-creatures.</note> this <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>
and his wife aſſiſt Miſtreſs <hi>W.</hi> and chargeth the Parſon, as you may
ſee formerly expreſſed; wherefore the Parſon reſolves to call them
to an accompt for taking parties with the weaker veſſell againſt the
mighty male Ranter.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lewis</hi> being now jealous of this new friendſhip, is become
a ſtrict obſerver of the waies of Parſon <hi>Webbe,</hi> and diſlikes with his
private approaches through bye waies, and his long abode made
upon his friendly viſits early and late; he now begins to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
opinion of his Landlady, and thinks her as lewd as her fellow-creature:
Hereupon <hi>Lewis</hi> diſcovers his minde to his own wife,
ſhe thereupon-declares to her husband, what ſhe both heard and
ſaw.</p>
               <p>Now the rage that was formerly in <hi>Tho. Webbe</hi> the Parſon againſt
his fellow-creature, who likewiſe hers againſt him, unite againſt
<hi>Lewis</hi> and his wife, and for telling tales out of ſchool, are threatned
to be ſoundly whipt. Fear now poſſeſſeth the wofull hearts of
<hi>Lewis</hi> and his wife. Miſtreſs <hi>W.</hi> takes with others a journey to

               <p>Wherefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> demands of them why they trouble him
about ſuch complaints? why at that time of the night? why they
did not rather get the aſſiſtance of ſome of their friends to reconcile
them? or if not, wiſht them to repair to ſome other Juſtice of the
Peace.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>William Lewis</hi> anſwers, Sir, although there have been
ſome former difference between us in matters of opinion, yet I take
you to be a juſt man, and that you will do Juſtice impartially, which
is that we deſire: He ſaid, we came this late, becauſe, it was but
even now that Miſtreſs <hi>W.</hi> and her company came home with <hi>I. M.</hi>
a moſt wicked and prophane man; and that he was brought on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to do his wife or himſelf a miſchief, and had given out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſpeeches ſo ſoon as he was alighted from his horſe, the woman
in the mean time ſeeming to be wonderfully affrighted.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> asked her how they fell at variance: the woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
that ſhe had diſcovered ſome lewd actions of <hi>Thomas Webb</hi> and
Mrs. <hi>W.</hi> which was come to their ears again, and therefore they have
threatned and ſworn to be revenged upon me and my husband; ſo
that I dare not return home any more without danger of life, and
therefore I deſire ſurety of the peace to be granted againſt them.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> replied again, Surely I doubt 'tis not fear brought you
hither, but rather revenge; for I underſtand you were arreſted at
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Whites</hi> ſuit the other day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Lewis</hi> confeſſed he was arreſted, but the cauſe of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
was but a beginning of that revenge which the Parſon and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118361:17"/>
                  <hi>W.</hi> had threatned againſt them, becauſe they diſliked their
wickedneſs. She ſaid further, ſhe would not for a world go ſuch a
way to work as to ſeek revenge, but ſhe could take her oath that
ſhe was afraid of her life.</p>
               <p>When nothing would ſerve to ſilence the parties, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
her (with admonition not to ſwear falſly) the Oath, which
ſhe takes, and thereupon grants her a Warrant of the peace againſt
the ſaid Parſon <hi>Webb,</hi> Miſtreſs <hi>W. I. M.</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Warrant was perfected, theſe perſons make a full rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> of all paſſages at <hi>Langley</hi> between the fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and particularly <hi>William Lewis</hi> acquainted him with the foul
act of <hi>Webbs</hi> being taken in the act of adultery with Mrs. <hi>W.</hi> a little
after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> laſt paſt, and this complaint to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> was <hi>Nov.</hi>
23. 1650.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Lewis</hi> cals his wife, and ſhe makes good the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and tenders to ſwear it; divers queſtions M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> put to her
tending to weaken, if not ſtifle the Information: but ſhe ſtands bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the juſtification of it, with a world of other moſt horrible and
hatefull crimes and practices of theirs, not to be named.</p>
               <p>Two queſtions M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> deſires them to ſatisfie him in; one is
Why the fact was concealed till now? The ſecond was, Whether
ever they took <hi>M. W.</hi> to be a good woman? To the firſt query the
anſwer falls in from the womans own mouth; afterwards to the
ſecond he anſwers, that they lookt upon <hi>M W.</hi> to be a godly, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and as wiſe a woman as any in the Country, till of late they
had found to the contrary; but <hi>Webb</hi> had diſcovered himſelf to be
a leacherous knave long ago.</p>
               <p>Well, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> takes the womans Information, but not upon
Oath, and ſo made no further proceedings upon it, thinking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the woman might be (as Ranters uſually are) of another mind
another day.</p>
               <p>But they continue the ſame tune from day to day; <hi>W. L.</hi> follows
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> for a proſecution; M. <hi>Stokes</hi> acquaints two of his fellow-Juſtices
with it, and a day is appointed for a hearing of the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Well, in the mean time the Warrant of the peace is ſerved on
<hi>M. W.</hi> and <hi>Thomas Webbe,</hi> and they alſo meet on the 25. of <hi>Novem.</hi>
before M. <hi>Stokes; M. W.</hi> gives ſureties to keep the Peace; <hi>Webbs</hi>
credit is ſo much cract, that he muſt needs pretend that he will go
to Goal; yet rather then he ſhould go alone, and be in Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

without a fellow-creature, <hi>M. W.</hi> (ſuch is the tender love and pity
of the woman to the Parſon) moves her husband to ſtand for one
of <hi>Webbs</hi> ſureties; but ſome having more wit then ſome, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and pleaded an ingagement to the contrary; at which the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Gentlewoman ſeems angry: And anon M. <hi>W.</hi> and his wife
mount on horſeback, and are returning home; but before they had
rode a flightſhot from the place, <hi>M W</hi> (findes better arguments
on horſeback then afoot) prevails with her husband to become a
ſurety for the Parſon (what will not love do?) So M. <hi>W.</hi> and his
horſe face about, and he brings his wife with him for a witneſſe
that he himſelf (with another Gentleman) was ſurety for <hi>Tom.
Webbe,</hi> that he ſhould not go to Goal, nor ſtay at home to break the
publique peace; ſo away they went: And for as much as <hi>William
Lewis</hi> had expreſſed himſelf to be in a great fear of M. <hi>W.</hi> life, by
the fellow-creatures, they ſent M. <hi>White</hi> to another Juſtice of
Peace, where he ſwears that he ſtandeth in fear leſt <hi>W. Lewis, Edith</hi>
his wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will take away his life, hurt and main his body, or
burn his houſes: Whereupon he obtains a Warrant, and binds them
to the Peace: withall, the better to effect the buſineſſe, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the
deſign of the fellow-creatures, he procures a Warrant to ſearch for
ſtoln goods; by which means they ſearch <hi>Lewis</hi> his part of the
houſe, and pretend they finde goods of M. <hi>W.</hi> there: So they arreſt
<hi>Lewis</hi> as a felone, and hale him and his wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Juſtice,
where whilſt their <hi>Mittimus</hi> is making, and M. <hi>White</hi> binding over
to proſecute, Parſon <hi>Webb</hi> and his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are imployed in getting
<hi>Lewis</hi> his poſſeſſion; ſo they are turned out of doors, and their goods

               <p>By what is paſt you may perceive what a ſpirit of giddineſſe had
poſſeſſed the primeſt actors upon the Ranting ſtage. The Idolators
of old having worſhipped their Idol God, through the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God Almighty, fell out among themſelves, and ſheathed
each others ſword in their brothers bowels: So theſe having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
folly, act the part of madneſſe and enraged fury, and reſolve
never to quit the ſtage till they have devoured each other, and then
the longeſt liver take all. Lord how true is thy word, <hi>Though hand
joyn in hand, iniquity ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</hi> 'Twas wonderfull to
ſee the love of the fellow-creatures, but the other day what a union
there was among theſe perſons, and others of the ſame kidney, not
yet named, united in family, living under one roof; united in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
united in practice, united in all things becoming fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and lovers of community; yet now like ſimple children,
which for a time delight in each other, and laugh and play friendly
together; but anon, fall out and fight with each other, or rather like
drunkards, which for a while love each other intirely, praiſe each
other to the skies, and deſpiſe all that are not as themſelves, pot-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;
yet afterwards having added drunkenneſſe to thirſt, fall
to boxes and blows amongſt themſelves, wounding and tearing
each other to pieces: ſuch was the behaviour of theſe who were
drunk with folly and frenzy in the time of their Ranting Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walle.</p>
               <p>You may perceive all the diſcovery made by the actors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and very remarkable it is that their own councels and their
own tongues brought their horrid wickedneſſe to light, loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
that publiquely, which before was but privately ſuſpected
and whiſpered. Remarkable alſo it is that hitherto none proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to this day that were not of their own party; except one
warrant granted againſt the fellow-creatures, at the requeſt of one
<hi>S. V.</hi> about <hi>Auguſt</hi> before; to whom one of the faction and councell
diſcovered their wicked waies and practices; but the buſineſſe being
upon the ſtage, the diſcoverer ſhrunk in the wetting, only manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
that birds of a feather muſt hang together; otherwiſe not a man
moved towards their publique proſecution, or any way ſought their
diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Neither need any man act that way, ſeeing the parties concerned
had entered upon the work, as if they had taken it to task.</p>

1. So you have ſeen the breach, firſt made between the moſt choice
fellow-creatures, after the higheſt expreſſions of love and L.</p>
               <p>2. You have ſeen the breach made up again by the learned Parſon
(in wickedneſſe) <hi>alias</hi> mock Parſon.</p>
               <p>3. You have ſeen the ſaid Parſon, Firſt, in his ſeeming ſobriety.

ſent by the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>Mary White</hi> to <hi>Chippenham</hi> upon a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

haſte from thence, then ſhe uſually did at other times; ſhe went
into that part of the houſe wherein the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>White</hi> lived, and
finding no body in any of the lower rooms, ſhe went up ſtairs, and
a chamber-door near the ſtair-head being open, ſhe ſtept into the
ſaid chamber, and there ſaw the ſaid <hi>Thomas Webbe</hi> lying upon the
body of the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>Mary White,</hi> and being in the very act of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118361:20"/>
adultery with her, upon the bed there: And further ſhe this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant
ſaith, that there was in the ſame room at the ſame time one
<hi>John Morrice</hi> a ſouldier of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who haſtily came to the ſaid
chamber-door to put back her this Informant; he ſuppoſing (as ſhe
conceived) that ſhe had been M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Henry White</hi> aforeſaid, husband
of the ſaid <hi>Mary:</hi> but ſhe being in the chamber before he could ſhut

told her own brother <hi>Thomas Riley</hi> of <hi>Calve</hi> of it, the next day after
it was done; and that ſhe durſt not acquaint any other with it, for
that ſhe lived under the ſame roof with the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>White,</hi> and
did not know what injury they might have done her, if ſhe ſhould

                  <hi>Henry White</hi> to fetch him
four mornings in a week out of his bed, of purpoſe to ly with her; &amp;
that ſhe had formerly told him, that the childe where with ſhe then
went, was his, and that he begot it on her on S. <hi>Stevens</hi> his day at
night laſt paſt; and that her ſervant <hi>Elizabeth Briſcow</hi> was as good
as her ſelf, for that ſhe lay with <hi>John Morris</hi> and young <hi>Organ</hi> of

Miſtreſs <hi>Webbe,</hi> being the husband and wife of the ſaid Miſtreſs
<hi>White</hi> and M. <hi>Webbe,</hi> and that he conceived them to be both naught;
and further ſaith, that this quarrell continued between the ſaid M.
<hi>Webb</hi> and Miſtreſs <hi>White,</hi> untill the ſaid Miſtreſs <hi>White</hi> was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the childe wherewith ſhe then went, and it grew to that
height, that there were above twenty ſuits in Law depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Henry White</hi> aforeſaid, and the ſaid M. <hi>Webb,</hi> and that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after Miſtreſs <hi>White</hi> was brought to bed, and indifferently well
recovered of her childe birth, the aforeſaid <hi>Elizabeth Briſcow</hi> told
him this Informant, that her Miſtreſs had a great deſire to ſpeak
with M. <hi>Webb,</hi> and had appointed her to bring him unto her:
Whereupon this Informant remembring what had formerly paſſed
betwixt them, and fearing that they would grow as familiar again,
as they had been before; did the more ſtrictly obſerve their doings,
and the Thurſday following being the next Thurſday after <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
laſt paſt, he ſaw the ſaid M <hi>Webb</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Iohn Morris</hi>

be murther or ſome other miſchief follow it; and did thereupon turn

his wife told him, that the ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> and <hi>Morris</hi> were the greateſt

And this Informant further ſaith, that the morrow after being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday

preached there that day? to which ſhe replied, that the ſaid <hi>Morris</hi>
intended to have preached, but ſhe would not let him, and that ſhe

proceeded againſt till after Preſentment or Indictment at Aſſiſes or
Seſſions, and the verdict of twelve men is to be the leading card to
ſentence, or any other proceedings upon this new Law.</p>
               <p>2. That no Juſtice of Peace or other Officer is to impriſon or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

to ſend them to Goal though offending againſt the ſaid Act, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

no other proceedings are to be then upon Indictment; wherefore
(ſaith he) the Parliament would be glad to be rid of them ſo.</p>
               <p>5. That old Laws are not a rule for Juſtices to walk by in their
proceeding againſt offenders as are made ſo by modern and late

               <p>6. That Judge <hi>Nicholas</hi> can give no councel upon this Act more
then another man; for firſt, it is a new Law, and he is as young a

               <p>The requeſt of the arch-Parſon made known by M. <hi>Bayliff,</hi> was,
that he was exceedingly wearied and tired out with Miſtreſs <hi>Whites</hi>
company in Goal, that ſhe by her flatteries and frowns ſtill indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to keep him in his evil and unclean courſes with her, whoſe
provocations and temptations gave him no reſt; and therefore he
humbly deſires to be removed into any other priſon out of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
where he might be at reſt, and then he would publiſh to the
people of God the whole buſineſſe in truth and in Print (concerning
his unclean life with the ſaid Gentlewoman) which now he could
not perform, becauſe of her preſence with him; nay he could not
now, ſuch was his condition, ſo much as write or ſpeak a word

her breaſts, which was his work amongſt others (after one Puppy
had loſt his life by often ſucking) or merry and frolick with her,
according to the accuſtomed manner; and beſides ſaid, that ſhe
left her own husband and came and lay upon <hi>Webbs</hi> bed and body,
this relator being then in bed with the ſaid <hi>Webb,</hi> and there with

over M. <hi>B.</hi> whilſt at once the amorous Parſon and his Giglets made
a jear of the Meſſenger, the meſſage, and he to whom it was ſent,
as afterwards was manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Yet you ſee the inconſiderate Parſon <hi>Webb</hi> ſeems to practice a
penſive mans part, after all his audacious and malepert carriage and
demeanor before remembred. Notwithſtanding this repentance
alſo haſtily proves abortive, and the Parſon faceth about to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creature,

to M. <hi>Bayliff,</hi> in anſwer to one of his formerly ſent to perſwade her
to ſhew kindneſſe and reſpect towards Parſon <hi>Webbs</hi> wife, who
was gone to viſit her husband in Goal; for it was feared, it ſeems,

               <p>The aforeſaid Letter is inſerted to ſhew the Reader that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Parſon did but meerly diſſemble, whilſt he ſought a divorce from

how great the union is; ſo that now M. <hi>Stokes</hi> is no more troubled
with Letters or Meſſages, nor hears no more of the Lovers untill the
Aſſiſes.</p>
               <p>Not to trouble the Reader with the deportment of the fellow-creatures
in Goal,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>T. W.</hi> his delivera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and return from Goal.</note> nor what unworthy deſign <hi>Webbe</hi> puts in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to ſave his Neck; nor to mention any thing concerning the
Witneſſe produced on his behalf at the Triall, all which requires a
Volume: but the Author forbears theſe particulars: being tender
of the good Names of ſome, who at preſent ſeem to repent for what
they have acted in relation to the deceiptfull mock-Parſon.</p>
               <p>As for the Triall it ſelf, the Author will paſſe over that alſo in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
becauſe all things acted there were in the face of the whole
Country, wherefore the impudent mock-Parſon at the Triall needs
no diſcovery, it's ſo famouſly known in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> The grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
findes the Bill of Indictment, the Jury for life and death finde
him not guilty, whereupon he is freed: And ſurely now any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
man would have thought he would have given glory to God,
turned over a new leaf, and left off his Ranting way: This was
expected from him, becauſe of his Goal-repentance not long before;
but in ſtead hereof he continues the ſame pace as before, nay he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more proud, imperious and impudent then ever. After he
had kept holy-day with the Ranting gang in <hi>Sarum,</hi> he returns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Parſonage, but the fartheſt way about, to viſit the fellow-creatures:
Wherefore M. <hi>W.</hi> being ſent home the neareſt way, <hi>Webb</hi>
with Miſtreſs <hi>W.</hi> and his own wife, with others, returns by the way
of <hi>Warminſter;</hi> in which progreſſe, ſuch was the demeanor of the
Libertine Parſon, lately delivered out of the hand of Juſtice, but
ſtill faſt in the devils clutches, that he publiquely owns his relation
to his fellow-creatures, to be above and more binding to him then
his relation to his own wife, which was but formall, but the other
was real. Upon this, with other his moſt impudent carriage, the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118361:27"/>
Parſons wife (poor woman) expecting better things, as the fruit
of his ſufferings; but now ſeeing her hopes to fail, ſhe fals into a
labirinth of miſery and heart-diſtreſs, and preſently in the ſame
room earneſtly deſired M. <hi>F. Bayliff</hi> (then in company, who was
one of <hi>Webbs</hi> witneſſes at the Triall) that he would run her through
with his ſword, for ſhe was no longer able to bear as ſhe had done.
Not to trouble the Reader with all paſſages in the Parſons return
from his Chappell at <hi>Fiſherton,</hi> to the Pariſh Church of <hi>Langley;</hi>
you ſhall only know that at <hi>Bradford</hi> the Sack went merrily down
the Witneſſes throats, and the reſt of the fellow-creatures, who
well deſerved it: But amidſt their Cups they quaff about this health,
<hi>Here is a health to the Star that now is in the Eclipſe, but hereafter
ſhall ſhine in perfect glory;</hi> which the Relator thus interprets, The
Star in Eclipſe is Miſtreſs <hi>White,</hi> who though now deſpiſed becauſe
of the peoples ignorance of true liberty, yet hereafter, when it
ſhould be known, ſhe ſhould ſhine in perfect glory (<hi>viz.</hi>) be had in
high accompt and eſteem.</p>
               <p>Well, at length home the fellow-creatures come, divers are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
that the mock-Parſon will ſurely now become a new man,
at leaſt in apperance; but he reforms like a Parſons Ape, the clean
contrary way, he ſwaggereth it out moſt bravely with his proud
looks, poudered pate, and prating tongue; he breaths out no leſſe
then ruine and deſtruction againſt all oppoſers, amongſt which
M. <hi>Stokes</hi> muſt have a large ſhare, he ſhall no longer continue in the
Commiſſion of the Peace (a great revenge) becauſe he acts ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
and unjuſtly, as to proſecute the Law againſt the honeſt
party, and makes no difference between common whoremongers,
and Maſters of Art, <hi>alias</hi> mock-Parſons and Prieſts Apes (a ſad caſe.)
Well all the influence of this honeſt party is withdrawn, which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
M. <hi>Stokes</hi> into the ſadle, therefore he muſt needs fall; and the
propheticall Parſon foretels ſtrange things to come, and fortunes to
befall divers perſons, which will all be fulfilled the next black mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
And after a while the Parſon takes a journey to <hi>London,</hi> and
appears before the Committee of Plundered Miniſters (who ſo bold
as blinde <hi>Byard!</hi>) in hopes to continue Parſon of <hi>Langley</hi> by that
power which he deſpiſed, the better to out-brave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

for he well knew though he had narrowly eſcaped the Halter,
yet he appeared in an unclean and moſt ugly ſhape to all tender ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118361:27"/>
And at length about <hi>May</hi> 1651. he ſends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes,</hi> under
his own hand writing, the Copy of an Order from the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,

                  <hi>Stokes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
accordingly, and withall promiſed the mock-Parſon to
make good the charge himſelf againſt him, which when his grace
underſtood, he ſtartles not a little, and at length ſcribles back an
invective Letter to M. <hi>Stokes,</hi> acquainting him alſo that his time
would not now permit to have the buſineſſe heard, for he muſt wait
upon his wife (a kinde Parſon) to <hi>Batly,</hi> which proved a ſhift,
whereupon M. <hi>Stokes</hi> gives this reply to the P.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Though you ſnarl at creatures, and like a mad man ſtrike at
thoſe that are next you, yet when you ſhall be delivered from your frenzy,
you will ſay, <hi>It was the iniquity of your heels that compaſſed you
about,</hi> and not malice in your Oppoſers: You might have enjoyed your
being at <hi>Langley</hi> long enough with the love and liking of all that fear
God or love the Nation, had you been true to your ſelf or friends; your
diſſembled Repentance had once almoſt re-inthroned you in the hearts of
honeſt men, had not your revolting and revellings tumbled you down
from thence. When you appeared in ſheeps clothing, who harmed you,
who moleſted you, who advanced themſelves above you? When you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in another ſhape, who did not pity you and pray for you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
your return, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had you learned the doctrine of ſelf-denial but
half ſo perfectly as that of ſelf-juſtification, certainly your preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
had been ſuch as now you fain it to be. But why do you boaſt your
ſelf in your own deceivings? your great ſwelling words of vanity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten
none ſave fools or women. You do well to ſtudy the Law, but
I wiſh your underſtanding therein prove not abortive, like your Goſpel
knowledge. But howſoever you need not fear, the times are ſo peaceable,
theeves cannot, and ſo good honeſt men will not rob you of any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
due to you: The whole body of Articles you may meet withall,
with the Committee of Plundred Miniſters, or have a Copy here
when my Clerk is at leaſure. You can appoint and wave meetings at
your pleaſure, you can both juggle and play fair at the ſame game, 'tis
no matter into what ſhape you lick your ſelf, ſo long as you like your ſelf.

               <head>Articles of Prophaneneſſe and Scandall againſt Thomas Webb
the pretended Rector of the Perſonage of Langley
Burhill in the County of Wilts.</head>
               <p>1. THe ſaid <hi>Thomas Webb</hi> never had any legall Order for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency
there, but by the help and favour of his pretended
Patroneſſe Miſtreſs <hi>Mary White,</hi> and ſome other Pariſhoners of the
ſame Pariſh upon his promiſe unto them of <hi>non</hi>-taking Tithes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Parſonage, uſurping the place of an Incumbent there,
contrary to the Orders made by the Honourable Committee for Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Miniſters, and the Committee of this County.</p>
               <p>2. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged to be an Adulterous perſon, and
to have committed the deteſtable ſin of uncl-anneſſe with divers
women (beſides his pretended Patroneſſe Miſtreſs <hi>Mary White</hi>) and
hath confeſſed the ſame, and gloried therein, and affirmed he could
lye with any woman ſave his own Mother.</p>
               <p>3. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged to have affirmed in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Conjurer, and that Chriſt was a deceiver of
the People.</p>
               <p>4. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged to have affirmed, that Preaching
and lying are both alike to him.</p>
               <p>5. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged to have tearmed his hearers fools
for coming to gape on him, whilſt he told them lies.</p>
               <p>6. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged to have drank to the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Parliament, and to have tearmed them Rogues and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
withall ſaying, that if he were (by thoſe that heard him) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
for any of the afore-mentioned crimes, he would for ſwear the
ſame.</p>
               <p>7. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> hath in an high nature ſcandalized and abuſed
Judge <hi>Nicholas, George Ivy, Edward Stokes</hi> and <hi>William Shute</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and other the Juſtices of the Peace for this County, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
their duties, both in Law and Conſcience, according to the
truſt repoſed in them.</p>
               <p>8. The ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> hath done much waſte, and made great ſpoil
and deſtruction upon the Gleab lands of the Rectory of <hi>Langley
Burhill</hi> aforeſaid, by cutting down, and ſelling at very low rates,
a great part of the Wood and Trees late growing and being upon
the ſame, which were before his coming thither much ſtored, and
better repleniſhed with Wood then any Parſonage in thoſe parts;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118361:29"/>
beſides alſo he hath let fallen, pulled down to the ground, and ſold
away part of the houſing belonging to the Parſonage-houſe
there.</p>
               <p>9. The-ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> ſtands charged by the moſt knowing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in his own Pariſh, to have Preached falſe and unprofitable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>WHereas we have received two ſeveral Orders from the
Committee of Plundered Miniſters (purporting certain

               <p>3. That in ſome part of the Charge the Examiners themſelves

neither copy of Orders nor charge, but I was forc't (though not

               <p>Theſe and other grounds are my Exceptions built upon, which

that he had no Order from any Authority to poſſeſſe himſelf of the

but that he did Officiate there by the conſent and approbation of
ſome of the Pariſhioners of <hi>Langley</hi> aforeſaid. And this Deponent
further ſaith, That he did thereupon ſhortly afterwards ſearch in the
Office of the Committee for Plundered Miniſters, to finde whether
the ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

to perſwade this Deponent to diſſert the ſaid ſervice, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his affection from the Parliament, uſed amongſt other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
theſe words following, That the Parliament was unjuſt,
and dealt unjuſtly in gathering too much monies, and imploying
the ſame to their own private uſes, and not for the publick; and that
if he and others might have liberty, they would prove it, or ſpoke
words to the like effect: And at one other time the ſaid M. <hi>Webb</hi>
told this Deponent, That God would appear for and on the behalf
of the Cavaliers once more.</p>
               <p>To the eight Article this Deponent ſaith,<note place="margin">8.</note> That when the ſaid
M. <hi>Webb</hi> came and entred into the Rectory or Parſonage of <hi>Langley</hi>
aforeſaid, the Glebe-land thereunto belonging, was very well ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and repleniſhed with Timber-trees, and other Underwood, and
that ſince that time the ſaid M. <hi>Webb</hi> hath cut down, burnt and ſold,
all or the greateſt part of the ſame Trees and Underwood; and hath
alſo pulled down two ſubſtantiall out-houſes belonging to the ſaid
Rectory or Parſonage-houſe, and ſold away the materials thereof.
And this Deponent further ſaith, That the ſaid M. <hi>Webb</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by a Warrant, which came under the hands of <hi>Edward Stokes</hi>
Eſq. being both a Committee man and a Juſtice of the Peace of the

               <p>To the ninth Article this Deponent ſaith,<note place="margin">9.</note> That the Lords-day
ſeven-night before the ſaid M. <hi>Webb</hi> was committed to Priſon as
aforeſaid, he heard the ſaid M. <hi>Webb</hi> deliver in his morning-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
on that day in the Pariſh-Church of <hi>Langley</hi> aforeſaid, to his
Auditors then and there aſſembled, That he was no Miniſter of God,
and wiſht them not to look upon him as a Miniſter, for that (ſaid he)
God had put an end to all Miniſters and Miniſtrations, and at the
ſame time perſwaded the people not to conform themſelves to any
viſible Miniſtrations, either for Church or ſtate (meaning thereby,
as this Deponent conceiveth) that they ſhould not obey any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall

informed the people, That God requires no obedience to any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-commands.

I ſhould hearken unto her any more! Notwithſtanding all which

1651. by the Honourable Committee of Plundered Miniſters, where
the ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> appeared in his own defence, being armed <hi>cap a pe,</hi>
with his wonted ſilly ſelf-confidence, impudence and ignorance,
who, notwithſtanding though he had over-ſtood his Market, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to examine or croſſe-examine Witneſſes in the Country; yet
now propounds to the Committee of Examination, as aforeſaid,
only he deſires two other Juſtices of Peace to be joyned with thoſe
whom he termed his adverſaries, with ſuch like frothy conceits, as
vain as himſelf; but they hold no water, the mock-Parſon is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to his priſtine purity (<hi>viz.</hi>) a Prieſt without a Parſonage, which
act of Juſtice operates much upon the Parſons foul ſtomack, and
therefore though the Parſonage be evacuated, yet the dregs remain,
which are brought up and diſgorged at ſeverall times, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The unſavory ſalt was no ſooner caſt to the dunghill, but
the ejected <hi>quondam</hi> Parſon lays about him, and ſeeing his tongue
was too ſhort to tell of his misfortunes, and to beſpatter his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
he betakes himſelf to his Pen, and writes his black Parſon-like
Epiſtles to the honeſt, <hi>alias</hi> Ranting Party, acquainting them
what had fallen out, and then rails, Parſon-wiſe, againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes,</hi>
giving him ſuch titles as can belong to none ſave mock-Parſons, and
withall promiſeth his fellow-creatures to write a book and publiſh
it againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> and others, and then ſets down ſuch particulars
as he intended to Print againſt M. <hi>Stokes,</hi> which he hath with ſome
alteration performed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He abuſeth the Honourable Committee of Plundred
Miniſters, taxing them with injuſtice, and tels his friends that he
will indeavour to turn the ſtream, aſſuring them that if not this, yet
another Repreſentative will do it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He makes them believe he is very near a very good ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
in another place, and preſſeth them to gain him (with ſpeed)
a Certificate from the honeſt party.</p>
               <p>So after this <hi>non</hi>-ſuch Parſon had a while lain his wits a ſoaking
in the ſtinking puddle of envy and Revenge, and bent his tongue
like bows for lies, he compoſeth a certain ill-ſhapen Libell, as full

The firſt whereof is to inform the world, That <hi>Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Webb</hi> is a
man of excellent parts, and full of piety, an enemy to uncleanneſſe,
to blaſphemy, to Parſonages, to Tithes, and whores, a man of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſpirit, of ſound judgement, of great temperance, and a ſufferer
for righteouſneſſe ſake.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That all thoſe that did not flatter him in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and unclean waies, or did in any thing diſlike his Rantings and
counterfeit repentings, were unjuſt, cruell, tyrannicall, malitious,
and bloudy minded men; and amongſt the reſt M. <hi>Stokes</hi> (being

the worſt of men, he is now a blaſphemer of the higheſt
rank, a deceiver, and what not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>upon theſe two legs the Libell comes into the world, the father
whom it reſembles gives it a name, and the witneſſes names being
in number a hundred and four, are faſtened to a ſilly certificate, to

               <head>The Name or Title is
A Maſse of malice againſt Tho. Webb late Minister of

               <p>IN the Title you may note that this Parſon hath often times in

writes himſelf, Late Miniſter of <hi>Langley B.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Whilſt he was poſſeſt of a Parſonage, he ſaid there were

               </p>
               <p>He ſaith of his work, It's a true relation, which indeed is moſt
untrue, as alſo are thoſe ſix ſeverall Heads attending the relation
(though they all walk upon two legs, as before mentioned) as in the
catalogue afterwards will appear.</p>
               <p>Then he moſt prophanely abuſeth two ſeveral Texts of Scripture,
applying that which is true in <hi>David</hi> the Type, or Chriſt the Anti-type,
unto his unclean and moſt graceleſs ſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Pſalm 35. 11. Falſe witneſſes did ariſe up, they laid to my
charge things that I knew not.</hi> He hath been charged to be a whore-maſter,
and he hath acknowledged himſelf ſo to be (ſee his Letters

charge things I knew not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Scripture to ſupport the Maſſe of malice and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
is</hi> Pſalm 38. 20. They alſo that render evil for good are mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
becauſe I follow the thing that good is.</p>
               <p>It ſeems all thoſe that diſliked <hi>Webbs</hi> wicked waies are ſuch as
<hi>render evil for good;</hi> he juſtifies his own actions, and by a Scripture
phraſe, ſaith they are good, and he follows the thing that good is:
Surely the thing that the Parſon follows is not good, unleſſe Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Revellings, Whorings and counterfeit Repentings be good;
theſe he hath followed to the heels, as the relation makes manifeſt:
But it ſeems theſe are good, and ſo followed by <hi>T. W.</hi> late Miniſter
of <hi>Langley B.</hi> and ſuch as diſlike him are his adverſaries, and render
evil for good. But let the mock-Parſon alone to condemn all others,
and trumpet out his own praiſes, ſaying, <hi>Stand further off, I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

               <p>The Certificate in the front of the <hi>Maſſe of malice</hi> being ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
frivolous, and untrue, needs no more but the bare reading
over by the Ingenuous man, the thing it ſelf being but the brainleſſe
birth of a broad-brim'd profeſſor, who when he ſhaped it to his
own liking, dealt with it as counterfeit cripples with their ſelf-made
ſores (<hi>viz.</hi>) lye in the high wayes and publike places to move pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the paſſengers to gain relief: So the profeſſor aforeſaid repairs
with his ſcabbed Certificate into the high-waies, Markets and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
where after much beggery and baſeneſſe, above one hundred
names are ſubſcribed; the pretence is to gain the Parſon another
place: however, the ſubſcribers, ſome of them ſchool-boys, deboiſt,
ſwearers, covetous earthworms, drunken companions, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
names, to fill up the number, ſome Ranting profeſſors with
about three or four plain-hearted men, brought in through deceipt,
whoſe names paſſe like Jackdaws among the Rooks; and ſome
there were that ſet their names in the rear, becauſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>So much for the Title and Certificate: For the Maſſe it ſelf the

               <p>Moreover he confeſſeth that he hath privatly and publiquely jear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe that Preach and Pray, and Profeſſe to, for to gain good
names, fat Parſonages, and handſome women for wives and whores,
that makes merchandiſe of the word of God, that <hi>ſerve not the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt but their own belly;</hi> and this <hi>Tho. Webb</hi> knows, whoſe

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> M. <hi>Stokes</hi> (who before the Lord acknowledgeth that he is leſſe

accompt and high eſteem of all Gods Ordinances, of all true

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118361:39"/>
two years ago, and lying (liars had need of good memories)
in the blew Bores-head in King-ſtreet, the morning we were to
come out of town, M. <hi>Stokes</hi> fell down upon his knees to a mock-prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> M. <hi>Stokes</hi> affirms that to his beſt remembrance he was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

that about four years ſince he was in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with the ſaid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
There is a ſign of a blew Bores-head in Kingſtreet, at which
houſe all the parties lay, but ſurely the Bores-head is neither ſo large
nor ſo hollow as to lodge three perſons within its own bulk; yet the
Parſon affirms we were all being in <hi>London,</hi> and lying at the blew
Bores-head in Kingſtreet.</p>
               <p>As for the mock prayer, M. <hi>Stokes</hi> underſtands not what the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
means, yet when he ſhall print a right time, and alſo a Copy of
the mock-prayer, M. <hi>Stokes</hi> will be ſo ingenuous to confeſſe his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and miſcarriages in publique worſhip; yet that either then, or
at any other time any thought, word or action paſſed M. <hi>Stokes</hi> with
an intent to make a mock of that holy Ordinance of prayer, or any
other publick worſhip, is the higheſt untruth and ſcandall as ever
Satan by any of his inſtruments (whether ſpirituall) or lay Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
charged upon any creature that expected ſalvation by Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Stokes</hi> knoweth that all prayer not acted by faith, is mock-prayer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and he believes that the ſaying of <hi>David</hi> is true, (<hi>viz.) If
I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer:</hi> To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ones ſelf in the practice of any known ſin, and to come before
the Lord in daily prayer, is mock-prayer.</p>
               <p>It's much to be feared that the Libertine Parſon <hi>Webb</hi> is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with mock-prayer. <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. He hath both Preached and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Prayed to get and keep a Parſonage. 2. By his own confeſſion he
lived in the vile ſin of uncleanneſſe a long time together, and yet in
that time conſtantly Preached and prayed in the publique Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Quere,</hi> Whether thoſe prayers were not mock-prayers?
3. He hath confeſſed that he hath not had the aſſiſtance of the Spirit,
as in former times, and yet he kept his appointed howers of prayer
in the publique Congregation; <hi>Q.</hi> Were not theſe mock-prayers?
yet all theſe are left out, and one pretended mock-prayer by a mock-Parſon
in his <hi>Maſſe of malice</hi> faſtened upon M. <hi>Stokes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yet the Parſon ſaith not that M. <hi>Stokes</hi> made a mock-prayer, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

fell down on his knees to a mock-prayer; ſo whether he means the

               <p>Yet M. <hi>Stokes</hi> is beholding to the Chriſtian moel-Parſon, not for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>

If he had ſaid That he had never heard the like in his life, or never

               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Stokes</hi> affirms that the doctrines as they are now ſet down in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the <hi>Maſſe of malice,</hi> (as Chriſtian Watchfulneſſe and imitation of
the divine life) are excellent doctrines moſt profitable to beleevers:
but neither the one nor the other were ever preached by Parſon
<hi>Webb</hi> in M. <hi>Stokes</hi> his hearing, and diſliked of by him, neither did
the Parſon ever Preach upon that Scripture, as M. <hi>Stokes</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth.</p>

Sermon, without any life, power, or appearance of the ſpirit
of God, ſhewing the Auditory how much and how often they
ſhould eat and drink; when he ought rather to ſhew that that
which enters into the body defileth not, but that from the heart
proceeds murthers, adulteries and the like, and to have indeavoured
to have made clean the inſide of the cup and platter, for till the
heart be cleanſed and purified through the preſence of the Spirit of
Chriſt, there can be no Chriſtian watchfulneſſe, nor imitation of a
divine life: Theſe with all obſervations of meats and drinks periſh
with the uſing, and are bodily exerciſes which profit little; and
this way of preaching by <hi>Tho. Webb</hi> was friendly reproved by M.
<hi>Stokes,</hi> who then ſeemed to take it well, and a little after confeſt
to M. <hi>Stokes</hi> that he had not the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God in his
preaching, as formerly, but now this reproof is become a crime

               <p>But this Parſon conceals all M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes</hi> his errors and miſcarriages,
as he ſaith, till now, that is, till he brought forth that worthy work,

errors, that he indeavours to faſten upon him many moſt notorious
untruths of his own deviſing and invention.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If M. <hi>Stokes</hi> had not been a lover of good works, and the Parſon
an enemy thereunto, both parties had continued lovers and friends

               <p>In the next place the famous Parſon in the 56. <hi>page</hi> of his <hi>Maſſe

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> M. <hi>Stokes</hi> beleeves the <hi>male</hi>-contented Parſon to be a man of a

why he behaves himſelf like a Preacher, that having ended his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with his hour-glaſſe, ſaith, I might inſiſt upon theſe and theſe
particulars, when poor ſoul he hath not a word to ſay more; ſo
this man at firſt mentions many acts of blaſphemy, inſiſts upon one,

failed in raiſing ſo famous a ſtructure as the <hi>Maſſe of malice?</hi>

any thing concerning him, nor for creating blaſphemies, or
other crimes in a <hi>Maſſe of malice</hi> to lay upon him; he well knows
that the Parſon and all the fellow-creatures are acted by a power
irreſiſtible, which makes them to ſay and ſwear any thing againſt
thoſe that hate their Ranting practices and blaſphemous unclean
waies: yet M. <hi>Stokes</hi> cannot own Parſon <hi>Webbs</hi> baſe born brats, but
muſt leave them to their ghoſtly father, who is moſt pure in his

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> M. <hi>Stokes</hi> (though a great ſinner before the Lord) challengeth
Parſon <hi>Tho, Webb</hi> and all others of his invenomed generation, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures,
male and female; whether Ranters in judgement
or practice, or both; to invent, ſay, ſwear, write, print, publiſh,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118361:42"/>
whatſoever they know, think or can imagine againſt him, which
may tend to his diſhonour or diſgrace; for he is reſolved to defie
the devil and all his works; knowing that it is God that juſtifies,
and therefore accounts it his greateſt honour to be evil ſpoken of
by that generation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in the ſame 56. <hi>page</hi> he ſaith, what I have aſſerted
is enough, and is no more then what is truth in every particular
of it.</p>
               <p>Who ſeeth not that <hi>Tho. Webb</hi> is ſatisfied with his <hi>Maſſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and that one of many acts of blaſphemy is enough to record at
this time? What I have aſſerted ſaith he, is enough to diſcover what
the man is: So that the Reader is to take it for granted, that the
Parſon is very ſparing and loth to ſpeak his whole knowledge; yet
fearing his aſſertion will not be beleeved, he ſaith, 'tis all true: So
that you muſt underſtand that the Parſons doings are all righteous,
and his ſayings all true, ſo that his word muſt paſſe without check
or doubt. All Parſon <hi>Webbs</hi> ſcandals and ſelf-intended blaſphemies,
reviling cenſures and reproaches are all true, you are not to queſtion
them, becauſe <hi>Thomas Webb</hi> is Author of them, which M. <hi>Stokes</hi>
knoweth to be true.</p>
               <p>But to faſten a belief in his Reader, he is fain to uſe all his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
underſtanding at once; for, thinks the reverend Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
if this be not believed againſt M <hi>Stokes,</hi> all my labour is vain,
and my <hi>Maſſe of malice</hi> will not be regarded nor had in eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe that are adverſe to the Ranting rout; and therefore
having wip't his beard, and ſet his countenance, he devoutly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely
imitates the whores and bauds, when they act the part of
grave Matrons and honeſt women: or deceiptfull Shopkeepers,
who with a <hi>truly</hi> put off their Tarniſht wares; ſo the hypocriticall
Parſon, to make men believe his lies, ſaith, To imprecate and make
proteſtations is not my uſuall manner of ſpeaking; for truly, ſaith he,
I approve not of any ſuch thing, but according to my manner of
ſpeaking, which is as I am taught by the Scripture, <hi>Yea, yea; Nay,
nay;</hi> in very truth all theſe things are true.</p>
               <p>So that you may believe him, for all his untruths are uttered by
Divine right by the excellent Parſon, and faſtened in a Scripture
phraſe upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes,</hi> who doubts not but the Parſon can prove
the legality of his uncleanneſſe and blaſphemous waies by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
he can gain Parſonages, Marry, Baptize and Bury perſons,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118361:43"/>
live diſorderly in his Whoring, Ranting, reproaching and reviling
at any who pleaſe him not; and confirm himſelf and his deluded

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> You may ſee his manner of ſpeaking in his letters before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
that he loves neither imprecations nor proteſtations; but
withall you will conclude, that he that cannot ſpeak truth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
nor well of his fellow-creatures, can much leſſe ſpeak well of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Stokes,</hi> though as he pretends he makes conſcience of a manner
of ſpeaking which he hath learned in Scripture. So Satan and all
his falſe prophets ſet forth their untruths in a Scripture language,
not out of love to truth or Scripture, but to obtain their own cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ends (<hi>viz</hi>) ruine to the ſouls, bodies or good names of thoſe
that fear the Lord, and hate their hypocriticall and laſcivious waies,
otherwiſe this Parſon would have learnt and practiſed other leſſons

               </p>
               <p>But the Parſon proceeds in his charitable way of concealment,
of M. <hi>Stokes</hi> his errors or blaſphemies, but yet makes them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,

which is but ſmall: That he hath ſpent and loſt much in the time

yet never ſought any place of advantage or profit in the Nation,

let ſuch a man ſtand forth and make the challenge, and M. <hi>Stokes</hi> will
be his bond-man for ever.</p>
               <p>But the Pariſh-Parſon, as lawleſſe as a Pariſh-Bull may bellow

               <p>And therefore in the next place he tells the Reader that M. <hi>Stokes</hi>
iſſues out his Warrants for the raiſing of him money to buy Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets

that none but Ranters have the boldneſſe or impudence to affirm,
or weakneſſe to believe: All the Commiſſioners in the whole

               <p>Theſe are the moſt principall calumnies and foul aſperſions that

theſe particulars: 1. If M. <hi>Stokes</hi> were guilty of ſuch foul
crimes, How comes it to paſſe that <hi>Webb</hi> in all his angry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull

of them.</p>
               <p>

his abominations to M. <hi>Stokes;</hi> its as clear as the ſun, that he then

the <hi>Maſſe of malice,</hi> the letters being of a later date then theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

                  <hi>I</hi> Ever took you to be a cordiall and a true friend to the Saints and

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:118361:45"/>
So M. <hi>Stokes</hi> is acquitted by his accuſer before the accuſation
received any being.</p>
               <p>Let it be conſidered, whether <hi>Webb</hi> had not better thoughts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
M. <hi>Stokes</hi> but a very little time before his triall; for about the time
Lieutenant Gen. <hi>Ludlow</hi> went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Webb</hi> being
then in Goal, drew with his own hand a Petition to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that <hi>Edw. Stokes</hi> Eſq. might command the Regiment of
Horſe for <hi>Wilts,</hi> in the place and abſence of Col. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and
this Petition he promoted by his Agents then at liberty, untill M.
<hi>Stokes</hi> himſelf put a period to that deſign. <hi>Quaere,</hi> Whether then
he took M. <hi>Stokes</hi> to be the man as now he hath printed him to be
in his <hi>Maſſe of malice.</hi> Yet the crimes charged are of a far elder date
by his own accompt.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this M. <hi>Stokes</hi> is acquitted in his own conſcience,
which is better to him then 10000 witneſſes, and therefore can
boldly ſay, <hi>Who art thou that condemneſt? it is God that juſtifies,</hi>
who will clear up the innocency of his ſervants, and finde out (to
their ſhame) all ſuch as make lies their refuge, and become falſe
accuſers of others, as the ridiculous Author of the <hi>Maſſe of malice</hi>
hath done; who having made himſelf drunk with the much bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Ranting cup, behaves himſelf like a mad Bedlam, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thoſe that are next him. In his repentings you have ſeen him
ſtriking and wounding his own dear fellow-creatures, charging
them through and through, with malice and wickedneſſe. And
ſo ſoon as he is reconciled to them, he Raves and Rants like a moſt
furious frantick, againſt all other that could not dandle or flatter
him in his wicked and unclean waies; So that the Parliament
it ſelf, the Committee of Plundred Miniſters, the Judge, and the
Juſtices of Peace for the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> amongſt which M. <hi>Stokes</hi>
acknowledgeth he is not worthy to be named; theſe are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>Webbs Maſſe of malice,</hi> and are more or leſſe abuſed by the
filthy Libell ſo called.</p>
               <p>And well may the mock-Parſon charge M. <hi>Stokes</hi> with blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
in his <hi>Maſſe of malice,</hi> being himſelf a blaſphemer upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Record; All delinquents delight to faſten their own titles
and actions upon the moſt innocent perſons; ſo the delinquent
Parſon having been diſcovered and convicted to be a blaſphemer,
he gives away his own title, and imputes his own abhorred actions
to M. <hi>Stokes.</hi>

That the ſaid Parſon is a blaſphemer himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>T. W.</hi> his blaſphemy upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> you ſhall finde upon
diligent inquiry, that he ſtood charged about the year 1644. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the then houſe of Lords, to be a Blaſphemer, one that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
many blaſphemous principles to the people; whereupon
he was by the ſaid Houſe committed, and ſtood ſo for ſome time;
yet afterwards he pretended a repentance of thoſe errors, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a form of Recantation with his own hand, and afterwards
gave thanks to a Miniſter of the Aſſembly, for being a means to
draw him off from thoſe errors; and bleſſed God for his mercies
to him, for he was in the ready way (as he ſaid) to Atheiſm, and
many of his companions in thoſe opinions were turned Atheiſts.
Notwithſtanding all this he both preached and practiſed as before,
holding forth many things againſt the glory and truth of Jeſus
Chriſt and Scripture; and not long after came into <hi>Wilts,</hi> as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into an Angel of Light, upon which ſtage he hath acted the

                  <hi>Webb</hi> the Author of the <hi>Maſſe of
malice,</hi> is this, he comes lately (<hi>viz</hi>) about <hi>March</hi> laſt into
<hi>Wilts,</hi> to viſit the honeſt party, and diſperſe his malitious Maſſe.
Well, he viſits his friends, and amongſt the reſt (to colour the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe)
he gives his poor wife a viſit, only by way of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but durſt neither to ſtay with her, nor in any wiſe to keep
her company, as men uſually do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but haſtens away to viſit
his man-wife <hi>J. O.</hi> and others; ſo to <hi>Langley</hi> he comes, where he
was received with all alacrity amongſt his honeſt party, where
divers met, to whom he declared that he lately Preached upon
that Text, <hi>The ſpiritual man is mad,</hi> and now reſolved to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
no more (<hi>viz.</hi>) never to receive Parſonage, nor Preach more,
nor yet to conceal his principles from the world, as he had done:
But being asked by one, what he would do if his Miſtreſs ſhould
caſt him off; ſaid, that he ſhould be the moſt miſerable man living,
and thought he ſhould make away with himſelf. So to put it out of
doubt that he would diſſemble his principles no more, he takes the
childe, which he ſaid he begot on the body of another mans wife,
(yet never went to ſee his own childe born in lawfull Matrimony,
though he rode by the houſe where it was kept by the mothers
friends;) and himſelf became a convoy, riding by the Waggon in
which the childe was carried through the Country towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and for part of the way afterwards, ſends back the party that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118361:46"/>
did attend it, and himſelf plaies the part of (not only a loving fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but) a nurſe, till it met the mother and her husband, where
the joy was compleated: And this the impudent mock-Parſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as if he had done it in the height of contempt againſt both
Religion and Magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>So I have done with the mock-Parſon and his <hi>Maſſe of malice:</hi>
Many things I have omitted, becauſe I would not be over-tedious,
and the Narration being of too great a bulk already, I forbear to
add. If in any particulars I ſeem to offend, let it be thy glory,
courteous Reader, to paſſe it by. I was forc't to the work which
I never ſought after, nor do not delight in; yet what I have done,
I have done it publiquely and truly, that truth may be manifeſt, and
falſhood diſcovered, that the righteous waies and people of God
may be juſtified, and the wicked waies and works of ungodly
men may be condemned. Wherefore, as I wiſh all that reſpect the
health of their bodies, to take heed of Empericks and Mounte-banks;
ſo I adviſe all that reſpect the health of their ſouls, and peace
of their ſpirits to take heed of mock Parſons, and counterfeit
Preachers, who though they appear in ſheeps cloathing, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
are ravening wolves; I mean ſuch as make themſelves
Preachers and Pariſh-Parſons to gain Parſonages or filthy lucre
for their Preaching; amongſt which number you may finde <hi>T. W.</hi>
From whom, that God may deliver thee, and all that fear his great
Name within the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> is the daily prayer
of this Author.</p>
