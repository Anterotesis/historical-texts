         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

word of the Lord was
truely preached, was
redde and hearde in euery towne, in
euery churche, in euery vyllage, yea
almoste in euery honest mans house:
alas nowe is it exiled &amp; banished out
of the whole Realme. Of late whoo
was not glad to be taken for a louer
of Goddes worde, for a reader, for a
redy hearer, and for a learner of the
same: &amp; now (alas) who dare beare
any open cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance toward it, but
such as are content in Christes cause
&amp; for his wordes sake to stand to the
daunger &amp; losse of all that they haue?</p>
                  <p>Of late there was to be founde of
euery age, of euery degree and kynd
of people, that gaue their dilygence
to learne as they coulde out of gods
woorde, the articles of the christian
fayth, the commaundmentes of god
<pb facs="tcp:11097:3"/>
and the lords prayer. The babes and
younge chyldren were taughte these
things of their parents, of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
&amp; wekely of their curates in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
churche: &amp; the aged folke why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
had ben brought vp in blindenes
and in ignoraunce of those thynges
whyche euery christian is bounde to
knowe, when otherwyse they coulde
not, yet they lerned the same by often
hearyng their chyldren and seruants
repeating the same: But now, alas,
and alas again, the false prophets of
Antechrist which are past all shame,
do openly preach in pulpets vnto the
people of God that the cat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>chisme is
to be counted heresy: whereby theyr
olde blindenesse is broughte home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne:
for the aged are afrayd of the
higher powers, and the youthe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed
&amp; ashamed euen of that which
they haue lerned, though it be Gods
worde and dare no more meddle.</p>
                  <p>Of late in euerye congregation
throughout all England was made
prayer &amp; peticion vnto God to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from the tyrannye of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb facs="tcp:11097:3"/>
of Rome and all his detestable
enormities: from all false doctryne
and heresie: And now alas, Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hath perswaded Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by his fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
and crafte to reuoke her old god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayer, to recant the same, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
the fearefull wrath and indyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of god vpon her owne pate.</p>
                  <p>Of late by straite lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces,
with the consent of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and commonaltie, and ful agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and counsaile of the prelates &amp;
clergie, was banished hence the beast
of Babylon, with lawes, I say, and
with othes and al meanes that then
coulde be deuysed for so godly a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But now alas, all these lawes
are troden vnder foote: the nobles,
the commonaltie, the prelates &amp; clar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie
are quite chaunged and all those
othes though they were herein made
in iudgement, iustice and truth, and
the matter neuer so good, dothe no
more holde then a bond of rushes, or
of a barley strawe, nor publyke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
no more fearethe them then a
shadowe vppon the wall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11097:4"/>
Of late it was agreed in England
of all handes, accordinge to Paules
doctrine and Chrystes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as Paule saythe playne, that
nothinge oughte to be doone in the
church in the publike congregation,
but in that tongue which the congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation
coulde vnderstande, that all
might be edified therby, wheather it
were common praier, administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or any other thinge
belonging to the publike mynisterie
of gods holy and wholsome woorde:
but alas all is turned vpsidedowne.
Paules doctrine is put aparte: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
commaundemente is not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
for nothing is hearde common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Churche but in a straunge
tongue that the people doth nothing
vnderstande.</p>
                  <p>Of late all men and women were
taught after Christs doctrine to pray
in that tongue which they could vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that they might pray with
harte, that whiche they shuld speake
with their tongue: Nowe, alas, the
vnlearned people is brought in that
<pb facs="tcp:11097:4"/>
blyndenesse agayne, to thyncke that
they praye, when they speake wyth
their tongue, they can not tel what,
nor wherof: their harte is nothynge
myndefull at all, for that it can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
neuer a whyt therof.</p>
                  <p>Of late the lordes supper was due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ministred and taughte to be made
common to all that were true Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
with thankes geuing and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
forthe of the Lordes death and
passion, vntil his returninge agayne
to iudge bothe quicke and deadde:
But nowe alas, the Lordes table is
quyte ouerthrowen, and that whych
ought to be common to all godly, is
made priuate to a few vngodly, with
out any kinde of thankesgeuinge, or
any settinge forth of the lords death
at all, that the people is able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande.</p>
                  <p>Of late all that were endued with
the light and grace of vnderstanding
of goddes holye mysteries, did blesse
god which had broughte them out of
that horrible blyndenesse and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
whereby in tymes paste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
<pb facs="tcp:11097:5"/>
seduced by Satans subteltyes,
they beleued that the sacrament was
not the sacrament, but the thynge it
selfe, whereof it is a sacramente:
that the creature was the creatour,
and that the thynge whiche hathe
neyther lyfe nor sense (alas suche
was the horryble blyndenes) was
the Lorde hym selfe, whiche made
the eye to see, and hath gyuen al sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
and vnderstandynge vnto man.
But nowe alas, Englande is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
agayn lyke a dogge to her owne
vomyt and spuynge, and is in worse
case then euer she was: for it had ben
better neuer to haue knowen the tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the
then to forsake the truth once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
and knowen. And nowe, not
onely that light is turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and goddes grace is receyued in
vayne, but also lawes of deathe are
made by hyghe court of parliamente
masterfully to maineteine by sworde
fyer and al kind of violence that hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouse
Idolatry wherin that adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the lyueles and dum
creature, whiche is onely dew vnto
<pb facs="tcp:11097:5"/>
the euerlyuynge God: yea they faye
they can and do make of bread bothe
man and god by theyr transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ation.
O wicked inuention, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans
owne broode.</p>
                  <p>Of late was the Lordes cuppe at
his table distributed according to his
owne comaundement by his expresse
wordes in his gospell as well to the
laytie as to the clergie, which order
Christes churche obserued soo manye
hundreth yeres after (as al the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ecclesiasticall wryters do testy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie)
without contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any one
of them that can be shewid vnto this
day. But nowe, alas, not onely the
lordes commaundemente is broken,
his cuppe is denied to his seruantes,
to whom he commaunded it shuld be
distributed, but also with the same is
set vppe a new blasphemous kynd of
sacrifyce, to satisfye &amp; paie the pryce
of synnes, bothe of the deade and of
the quicke, to the great and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
contumely of Christ our sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
his death &amp; passion, whiche was
and is the one onely sufficient and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastinge
<pb facs="tcp:11097:6"/>
auaylable sacrifice satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie
for al the electes of god, from
Adam the fyrst, to the laste that shal
be borne in the ende of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>Of late that commaundemente of
god, thou shalt not make to thy selfe
any grauen ymage, nor any simily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or lykenes of any thyng in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
aboue, or in earth beneath, or in
the water vnder the earth, thou shalt
not bowe down to them nor worship
them: this comaundment of God (I
say) was grauen almost euery where
in churches, was learned of euery bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
bothe younge and olde: whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Images that prouoked the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and ignorant people vnto idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(as the wise man saith) were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the churches, and straytly
forbidden that none should any wher
eyther bowe downe to them or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
them: But now alas goddes
holy woorde is blotted and rased out
of churches, and stockes and stones
are set vppe in the place therof. God
commaunded his woorde so to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that it mighte be had in conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb facs="tcp:11097:6"/>
remembrance at all times and
in euery place: and on the otherside
he forbad ymages and idoles so to be
eyther made or set in any place wher
any shoulde bowe or worshyp them:
But now alas, that which god com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
is not passed vpon, and that
whiche he forbyddeth is masterfully
mainteined by falshed and craft, and
wickedly vpholden.</p>
                  <p>Of late al ministers that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the publike office and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of goddes holy word, in their
admission made a solempne professy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before the congregation that they
shoulde teach the people nothinge as
doctrine necessarie to attaine eternal
saluation, but that which is goddes
owne holy woorde or may be thereof
grounded without any doubt: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
vanished and melted away of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

vnto them the truth of Gods worde,
and declared vnto them Chryste out
of the lawe of Moyses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
from mornynge to nyghte all

woulde not beleue, well (sayde he)
spake the holi ghost vnto our fathers
sayinge, go vnto this people and tel
them ye shall heare with your eares
and not vnderstande, and seinge you
shall beholde, and not se the thynge,

they shoulde not see, nor heare wyth
theyr eares, nor vnderstande wyth
their harts, that they might return,
and I shoulde heale theym, sayth the
lorde God. Alas England alas that

benefites wyth vnthankful heartes.
For it was greate pitie &amp; a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thinge to haue sene in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the people so lothsomly &amp; so vnre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligiously
to come to the holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
&amp; to receaue it accordingly, and to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers and other diuine
seruice, which were according to the
true veyne of gods holy worde, in al
poyntes so godly and holesomely set
forthe, in comparison of that blynde
zeale and vndiscrete deuotion which
they had afore times to those things
whereof they vnderstode neuer one
<pb facs="tcp:11097:15"/>
whyt nor could be edifyed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any
thing at all. And again as for almes
dedes which ar taught in gods word
(wherby we are certayne that god is
pleased with them, and doth and wil
require such at our hands, which are
a parte of true religion as S. Iames
sayth, and suche as he sayth himselfe
he setteth more by then by sacryfice,
as to prouyde for the fatherlesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
and orphanes, for the lame, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and impotent poore nedy folke,
and to make publyke prouision that
the pouertye that myghte laboure,
should haue wherwith to labour vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and so be kepte from shamefull
beggery and stealing) in these works
I say, how wayward were many, in
comparison (I meane) of that greate
prodigalitie, whereby in times paste
they spared not to spende vpon flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryng
fryers, false pardoners, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and gilding of stockes &amp; stones,
to be set vp and honored in churches
plainly against gods worde. And yet
bicause no place is to be defrauded of
their iust commendacion, London I
<pb facs="tcp:11097:16"/>
must confesse that such godly works
in sir Dobs knight then lord Maior
his yere, began maruelious wel, the
Lorde graunt the same maye so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
perseuer, continue, yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to the comforte &amp; reliefe of the
nedy and helplesse, that was so god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
begon. Amen.</p>
                  <p>All these thynges doe mynyster
matter of more mournynge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waling
the miserable state that now
is, for by this it maye be perceayued
howe well Englande hath deserued
this iust plague of God.</p>
                  <p>And also it is greatly to be feared,
that those good thynges whatsoeuer
they were that had their beginnynge
in the time when Goddes word was
frely preached, nowe with the exyle
and banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same, they wil
departe agayne.</p>
                  <p>But to returne agayne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of thys myserable state of
Christes church in Englande, and to
leaue farder and more exquisite sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the causes therof vnto gods
secret and vnserchable iudgements,
<pb facs="tcp:11097:16"/>
lette vs see what is beste nowe to be
done for Chrystes lyttle selye flocke.
This is one <hi>Maxime</hi> and princyple
in Christes law: he that denieth me
before men, him shall Christ deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his father and al his aungels of
heauen. And therfore euery one that
loketh to haue by Christ our sauiour
euerlasting life, let him prepare him
selfe so, that he denye not his master
Christ, or els he is but a caste away
and a wretch, howesoeuer he be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or taken here in the worlde.</p>
                  <p>Nowe then seinge the doctrine of
antechriste is retourned agayne into
this realme, and the higher powers
(alas) are so deceaued and bewitched
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are perswaded it to be truth,
and Christes true doctrin to be error
and heresie, and the old lawes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techrist
are allowed to returne wyth
the power of their Father agayne,
what can be hereafter loked for by
reason to the man of God and trewe
christian abiding in this realme, but
extreame violence of deathe or els to
deny his master. I graunt the harte
<pb facs="tcp:11097:17"/>
of prynces are in Gods handes, and
whether soeuer he will he can make
them to bowe, and also that christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
princes in old time vsed a more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
kinde of punishment, euen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which were heritikes in dede, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation
and depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of theyr
rowmes and offices, exile and banish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente
out of their dominions &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
and also (as it is red) the true
bishops of christes church were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
intercessours for the heretikes
vnto princes that they would not kil
them, as is red of S. Augustine. But
as yet Antechristes kyngedome was
not so erected at that time, nor is now
accustomed to order theym that wyll
not fal downe and worship the beast
and hys image, but (euen as all the
worlde knoweth) after the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that both Iohn and Daniel hath
prophesied before, that is by violence
of death, and Daniell declareth far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the kynde of death accustomably
should be by sworde, fier, and impry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment.
Therefore if thou O man
of God, doe purpose to abide in thys
<pb facs="tcp:11097:17"/>
realme, prepare and arme thy self to
die, for, bothe by antechristes accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
lawes, and these prophecies,
ther is no apparance or likelyhode of
any other thinge, excepte thou wylte
deny thy master Christ, which is the
losse at the laste both of body &amp; soule
vnto euerlastinge death. Therefore
my good brother or syster in Chryste
whatsoeuer thou be, to thee that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st
and mayest so do, that counsel that I
thinke is the best sauegarde for thee,
both for thy bodi, and most suerty for
thy soules helth, is that which I shal
shew thee herafter. But first I warn
thee to vnderstande me to speake to
him or her which be not in captiuity
or called already for to confesse christ,
but is at liberty abrode. My counsell
I say therfore is this, to flie from the
plague and to get thee hense. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not only the subtelties of satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and howe he is able to deceiue by his
false perswasions, if it were possible,
euen the chosen of God, and also the
greate frailty whiche is often tymes
more in a man then he doth know in
<pb facs="tcp:11097:18"/>
himselfe, which in the time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
then wyll vtter it selfe: I doe
not only consider these thyngs I say,
but that our master christ whose life
was and is a perfect rule of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
mannes life, that he himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
oftentimes the fury and mad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
of the Iewes by departing from
the countrye or place.</p>
                  <p>Paule like wise when he was sought
in Damasco, and the gates of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
were layde in wayte for hym, he
was conueyed by night, let down in
a basket oute at a windowe ouer the
wall, and Helias the prophet fledde
the persecution of wycked Iesabell.
And Christ our Sauiour saith in the
Gospell, when they persecute you in
one citie flie vnto another: and so did
many good greate learned and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouse
men of god, which were great
&amp; stoute cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions neuerthelesse, and
stoute confessors and mainteyners of
Christ and his truth in due time and
place. Of such was the greate clarke
<hi>Athanasius.</hi> But this is so playne to be
lawfull by gods word &amp; examples of
<pb facs="tcp:11097:18"/>
holy men, that I nede not to stand in
it. Hauing this for my grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I saye
to thee O man of god this semeth to
me to be the most sure waye for thy
sauegard, to depart and flie far from
the plague, &amp; that swiftly also: for tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
before god, I thinck that the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
that Daniel prophecied of
so long before, is now set vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place. For al antechrists doctrine,
lawes, rytes &amp; religion, contrary to
Christe and to the true seruynge and
worshypping of god, I vnderstande
to be that abhomination: therefore
now is the time in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for those
words of Christ: <hi>Tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c, inquit, qui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>udaea
runt fugiant ad montes.</hi> Then, saith he,
marke this christes (then) for truly I
am perswaded and I trust by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of god, that this then, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
Then, saith Chryst, they that be
in Iewry let them flie into the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes,
&amp; he that is on the house top
let him not come down to take away
any thynge out of his house, and he
that is abrode in the fielde, let hym
not returne to take his clothes. Wo
<pb facs="tcp:11097:19"/>
be to the great bellied women and to
them that geue sucke, but pray saith
Christ, that your flight be not in win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
nor on the sabboth daye. These
wordes of Christ are mistical, &amp; there
fore haue nede of interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all those to be in Iewryspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
which truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse one true
liuinge god, and the whole trueth of
hys worde after the doctryne of the
gospel of Christ. Such are they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
here chryst biddeth in the time of the
reygne of Antechrystes abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to flie vnto the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains, which
signifieth places of safegarde, and all
such thinges whych are able to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plague. That he biddeth him
that is on the house top not to come
downe, nor him that is in the fyelde
not to returne to take with him hys
clothes, he meaneth that they should
spede them to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaye betime,
least in their tarying &amp; trifling about
worldly prouision, thei be trapped in
the snare, or euer they be aware and
caughte by the backe, and for gayne
of small worldly thinges endaunger
<pb facs="tcp:11097:19"/>
and cast them selues in to greate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles
of more weighty matter. And
where he sayth wo to the greate bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
women, and to theim that geue
sucke: women great with childe, and
nigh to their lying downe, and to be
brought to bedde are not able to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
nor also those women which are
brought to bedde, &amp; now geueth their
babes sucke: by these therefore christ
spiritually vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth al such to be
in extreme danger (which this word
wo signifieth) all suche I saye, as are
soo letted by any maner of meanes,
that they no wayes be able to fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the plague. That which christ saith,
praye that your flight be not in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor on the sabboth day: In wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the common course of the yeare
teacheth vs that the wayes be foule,
and therefore it is a harde thing then
to take a far iourney for manye inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
and daungers of the wayes
in that time of the yeare: and on the
sabboth daye it was not lawefull to
iorney but a little way. Now Christ
therefore meaninge that we shoulde
<pb facs="tcp:11097:20"/>
haue nede both to spede our iourney
quicklye, whiche can not be doone in
winter for the incommodities of the
wayes, and also to go far, which can
not be done on the Sabboth daye: he
biddeth vs therefore praye that oure
flight be not in winter nor on the sab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>both
daye, that is, to praye that we
may flie in time, and also far enough
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daunger of the plague. Now
the causes why we shoulde flie, folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place of s. Mathewes
gospel,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> which I now passe ouer: thou
maiest reade them there.</p>
                  <p>And in the 18. chapter of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
the aungell is sayde to haue
cryed myghtely wyth a loude voyce,
flye my people out of Babylon leaste
you be infected with her faultes and
so be made partners of her plagues:
for her offences and synnes are gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
so great that they swell and are
come vnto the heauen: certainly the
time doth approch and the lordes day
is at hande. Heare, I besech you, also
holye Paule, that blessed apostle: he
plainly forbiddeth vs <hi>ducere iugum cum

our selues wyth the vnfaithfull, for
what felowship can ther be (saith he)
of righteousnes wyth vnrighteouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note>
what company hath light with

how doth the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of god agre with

of the liuing god: as god hath said, I

wherfore depart from amongest

the lorde, &amp; touch no vncleane thinge
and I wyl receaue you and be to you

                  <p>This counsel to depart the realme,

in Christes cause to spend a mannes
life, is beste of all, and of most perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to flie it may seme to smell
of cowardnes. In many things, that
which is best for one at some times,
is not best for all at all times, and it
is not most perfection nor meete for a

go. I wyll not make here a discourse
in thys matter what myghte here be

                  <p>This is my minde whych I would
thou shouldest knowe, o man of god,
as I would wishe and I doe praye to

nor relente one ynche, or gyue backe
what soeuer shall befall, but stande
to their tackle, and styrke by it euen

likewise I dare not wishe nor cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel

it is not lawful so to doe so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man of

                  <p>Doth not Paule commaund to the

Chrystian soule: As you haue in

that you may be sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified. And I prai
thee good brother, what doest thou
thinke is, to beare the marcke of the
beaste in the forhead and in the hand
that s. Iohn speaketh of? I know we
ought warely to speake of gods mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
which he shewed by the spirit
of prophecying to his seruant Iohn,
yet to reade theym wyth reuerence,
<pb facs="tcp:11097:26"/>
and to praye for the vnderstandynge
of the same so much as god knoweth
is necessary for our time to knowe, I
thinke it necessary and good. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what I suppose is to beare the
beastes marke, I wyll tell thee, and
commit the iudgement of mine inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pretation,
as in all other thinges, to
the spirituall man. I suppose he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the beast of Babilons marke in
his forhead, which is not ashamed of
the beastes waies, but wyll professe
them openly to set forthe hys master
the beaste <hi>Abaddon,</hi>

beareth his marke in his hands that
wil and doeth practise the workes of
the beaste with his power and hand.
And likewyse I will not lette to tell
thee, what I thincke to be sygned in
the forhead for the seruants of God,
whereof Iohn also speaketh, recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp many thousandes so to haue

of the crosse, and to lament and
mourne for the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techryste,
I suppose is to be sygned
wyth <hi>Tau</hi> whereof Ezechiell the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
doeth speake. Thus I suppose
these prophecies are spiritually to be
vnderstanded, and to looke for other
corporall markes to be sene in mens
forheads or in their handes, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Iohn, but I vnderstande him so
to be called not for that he shalbe ani

for his cruelty and beastly maners is

                  <p>The carnal Iewes knewe ther was

all so grosely &amp; so carnally, that they
neyther knewe Helias nor Messias

should come not in person but in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is, one which should be indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
with the spirit and giftes of grace
of Helias, which was in deede Iohn

which vnto the faithful childe of god
and to the true Christyan, is able to
counteruaile al these, yea and to way
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe. Christ our sauiour saithe
in Luke: if any come to me and doe

and wil not in his cause forsake

And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place he declareth

I nede here to rehearse no more.</p>
                  <p>The latter reason &amp; obiection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

includeth a necessitie which after the

This may be obiected of some. Alas

But sir, alas, I am an impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man,
an aged man, a sycke manne, a lame

and a lame wife, which all lyueth by
my labour and by my prouision, if I
leaue them, they shall sterue, &amp; I am
not able to cary them with me, suche
is my state. Alas sir what shall I do?
And these causes may chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to some
men of god, whereby either it shalbe
for them vtterly impossible to depart
the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, or els in departing, they
shal be inforced to forsake such in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
necessities of whom both god
and nature hath commytted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to be geuen? O lamentable state, O
sorowefull harte that neither can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
and without extreame danger
and peryll is not able to tarye styll.
And these are they whom our sauior

w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> them, which in his cause haue ben

<pb facs="tcp:11097:33"/>
that is <hi>Athanasius</hi> the great clerke

                  </p>
                  <p>But for all these examples both of
holy scripture and of other histories,
I feare mee the weake man of God
incombred with the frailty and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the fleshe, wil haue now and
then suche thoughtes and guawmes
(as they cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to run ouer his hart,
and to thynke thus: all theis thinges
which are rehersed oute of the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I beleue to be true, &amp; of the rest
truly I do thinke wel, and can beleue
them also to be true, but all these we
must nedes grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were special mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of god, whych now in our dayes
are ceased we se, &amp; to require them at
gods handes, were it not to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt god?</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11097:33"/>
were great wonderful works of god,
and we haue not sene many of suche
miracles in our time, eyther for that
our sight is not cleare (for truly God
worketh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his, his part in all times)
orels bicause we haue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like faith
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for whose cause God wrought
such thinges: or bicause after that he
had set forth the truth of his doctrine
by suche miracles then sufficientlye,
the tyme of so manye myracles to be
done was expired withall. Which of
theis is the moste speciall cause of all
others, or whether there be anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there,
God knoweth: I leaue that to
God. But knowe thou this my wel-beloued
in God, that Gods hande is
as strong as euer it was, he maye do
what his gracyous plesure is, and he
is as good and gracious as euer he
was. Man chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth as the garment
doth, but god our heauenly father is
euen the same now that he was, and
shalbe for euermore.</p>
                  <p>The world without doubt (this I
do beleue, &amp; therfore I saye) draweth
towardes an end, and in al ages god
<pb facs="tcp:11097:34"/>
hath had his owne maner, after hys
secrete and vnsearchable wisdome to
vse his elect, somtimes to deliuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and to kepe them safe, and somtimes
to suffer theym to drinke of Christes
cup, that is to fele the smarte, and to
fele of the whyp.</p>
                  <p>And though the fleshe smarteth at
the one, and feeleth ease in the other:
is glad of the one, and sore vexed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other: yet the lord is al one, towards
them in both, and loueth theym no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
when he sufferethe theym to be
beaten, yea and to be put to bodelye
death, then when he woorketh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deres
for their maruelous deliuery.</p>
                  <p>Nay rather he doth more for them
when in anguish of the torments he
standeth by them &amp; strenghneth them
iu their faith, to suffer in the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the truethe and his faithe, the
bitter panges of death, then when he
openeth the prison doore and letteth
them go lose: for here he doth but res<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pit
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an other time, and leaueth
them in daunger to fall in like peryl
agayne: and there be maketh theym
<pb facs="tcp:11097:34"/>
Perfect, to be without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, payne,
or peril after that for euer more. But
this his loue towardes theym, howe
soeuer the world doth iudge of it, is
all one, both when he deliuereth and
when he suffereth theym to be put to
death. He loued as wel Peter &amp; Paul
when, after thei had (according to his
blessed wil, pleasure and prouidence)
finished their courses, and done their
seruices appointed them by him here
in preaching of his Gospell, the one
was beheaded, and thother was ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
or crucified of the cruell tyraunte
Nero, as the Ecclesiasticall historye
saythe: as when he sent the Aungell
to bring Peter out of prison, and for

of the prison to flie wide open, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <p>Thinkest thou O thou man of god,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L be it, my derly beloued
syster in Chryste, that as
yet we dyd neuer see one
an other personally to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
knowledge, yet by the
vertuous reporte, that I haue heard
of you, and also by the large louynge
token that I haue receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you,
my thinke that I doe euen presently
see you, &amp; beholde your person, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
walkinge in the feare and loue
of god, ioying and reioycing with you
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite as though we were swet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
talkynge together of Christes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
The lorde god do I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sech
in the bowels and bloude of our
lorde and sauyour Iesus Christ, that
he will strengthen vs both, wyth hys
holy and mighty spirit, that we may
constantly continue in the confession
<pb facs="tcp:11097:43"/>
of his truth vnto the ende: that lyke
as we nowe see one another present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in spirite, we may also see one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
personally in the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, and his holye aungels.
where vndoutedly, we shal know one
an others personage, to oure greate
ioy, felicity, and endles comfort. And
now therfore deare sister K. be strong
in the Lord our god, for doubtles the
time of trial is at hande: a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
with cruell murtherynge of
gods deare sainctes is like to be very
shortly in this wofull wicked realme
of England. Therfore dere sister, for
the loue of God, prepare you to the
crosse with all diligence, and make
your selfe ready to die with Chryste,
that you may also liue with hym for
euer. There is no remedy, if you wil
be Christes disciple, you muste nedes
take vp your crosse, and follow him,
for the disciple must not loke to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his master, nor the seruaunt to
be better intreated, then his lord. Yf
we were of the world (good sister) no
doubt the worlde would loue vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11097:43"/>
But for as much as Christ hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
vs out of the world to serue God
in spirite and veritye, let vs be well
assured the worlde will hate vs &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secute
vs, as it hath done our lorde &amp;
master Chryste. But yet let vs be of
good chere, for Christ hath ouercome
the worlde. The payne is but shorte
that we can fele here, but the plesure
is perpetuall that we shall feele els
where. Let vs set before vs the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Christe, which abode the crosse
and despised the shame, in respect of
the ioy that was set before him: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
so let vs consider, for whose sake wee
suffer, whose cause we defend, &amp; what
glorious reward we shal haue at the
day of our victory, and then doubtles
the consolation of these thinges will
make sweete all our sufferinges, and
sone swallow vp al the sorowes that
we are sowsed in for Goddes sake. I
could recite diuers texts of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to confirme this poynt. But I
nede not, for I am well assured that
you do know them most perfectly all
ready. The lorde geue you strength &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:11097:44"/>
assiste you with his holy spirite, that
you maye continuallye walcke in all
points accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to your godly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And then shall you not doe as
the moste parte of our Gospellers doe
nowe a dayes, the more is the pitie.
There are a greate manye in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
that doe perfectly knowe, that
the idolatrous masse is abhominable,
diuelyshe and detestable in the sighte
of God. And yet, alas they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde
to pollute and defyle theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whych ought to be the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of
the holy ghost, with being present at
it, so synning agaynst God and their
owne conscience. But dere syster K.
doe you flie from it, both in body and
soule, as you would flie from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diuell himselfe. Drinke not of the
whore of Babylons cup by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
for it will infecte the body &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the soule. Be not partakers of her
sinnes (saith the aungell) least you be
partakers of the plagues, that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shalbe powred vpon her. O what
an araye is this? that so manye that
knowe gods truth, will nowe tourne
<pb facs="tcp:11097:44"/>
agayne and defyle them selues in the
filthy puddle of antichristes stinking
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They go about to saue theyr
liues with their double dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but doubtles, they shall lose euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life by it, if they do not repente
in time and turne vnto the lord. But
deare sister, my truste is, that you doe
vtterly abhorre the comminge to any
such thinge. I hope that you wil not
by anye meanes turne backe into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypte
nowe, but that you wil boldly
venter through the wildernes of tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

into the lande that floweth wyth all
kinde of heauenly pleasures &amp; ioyfull
delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and possesse the same for
euer. Let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, howe that euery
one of vs doth owe vnto god a death
by nature, and howe sone the Lorde
will require it of vs, we knowe not.
O howe happy are we then, if god of
his goodnesse appoint vs to paye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

and Gospelles sake, and so makynge

that you maye (and I trust dailye do)

whither he is also ascended for your

left with you in pledge his pure and

the same, wherwith I am right suer
we are bothe sealed vnto the daye of

our spirit, that we are the true adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

with Christ that blessed is your hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

Ah deare sister, these be the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
dayes, in which Christ did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecye,
and Paule, and Peter also,
that manye false Prophetes shoulde
appeare, &amp; bring in damnable sectes,
euen deniyng the lorde that boughte
them, as these diuelishe Arrians do,
in denying Iesus Christ to be the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
son of God, of one substance and
equal with the father. But my deare
hart in the lord be of good chere. For
though this tyme of darkenes, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so daungerous to the cage of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
and hatefull birdes, that can not
abide the light, that is to say, the

no lust to beleue the truth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God hath sent them stronge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
to beleue lyes: yet the sure
grounde of Ged, remayneth still, and
<pb facs="tcp:11097:49"/>
hath his seale, which is the spirite of
trueth: The lord knoweth them that
are his, and hath committed them vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
Christe his keping, who will lose
nothinge of that whiche his father
hath geuen hym, but will raise it vp
at the last day. yea for his chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sake,
the Lorde hath saide, these sorowful
dayes shalbe shortned, of which most
happy number, whose names are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
in the booke of life, my firme
faith is, that you are one, as by your
stedfast faith, and fruits of the same,
it doth appeare. And wheras you say
that my simple letters haue bene a
stay and comfort to you, I am moste
glad therof, &amp; do most hartely prayse
God therfore: that God of his greate
mercy will vse me poore miser of the

to doe good to anye one of hys deare

to bring God a great deale into your

godly vsury, according to the sainge
of the wise man: He that hath pitye

recompence your pitiful hert, which

that God requireth of you, is, that
you be fullye perswaded, that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

hath (as it ought to haue done) swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp all the vaine loue of the

and liuely seling of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that were wont to make the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

commaundementes, to goe to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols

&amp;c. But god forbid you should be
so ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, after so many instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
in so great &amp; weightye a matter. For
surely the vnknowen sicknes is most
daungerous euermore, as experience
teacheth. But I verily thinke, at the
least wise I hope, that youre knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is so great in these things, that
the daunger in being partaker with
the wicked, is not hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your eyes.
<pb facs="tcp:11097:54"/>
Therfore your fault is so muche the
greater, &amp; the sorer punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is due
for the same. But my vndoubted
trust is, that almighty God our most
deare louinge father, wyll not leaue
you in your weaknesse, but wil rayse
you vp agayne, by true and earnest
repentance, and geue you such grace
and strength of his spirit, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
you shalbe so far from cominge
to anye of theyr abhominable super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
that you shall be able well to
persuade this bearer, and many other
the sainctes of God from the same. I
knowe deare harte that thys thinge
which I requier of you, wil bryng a
great crosse vnto you, as well at the
handes of your husband, as of many
other your worldly frendes and foes.
But let not that discourage you any
thing at all, syth you are one of the
chosen children of God, to whom hys
crosse doth specially belonge. Let not
tribulation for righteousnesse sake,
seme a straunge thing vnto you: but
rather reioyce and be glad, that God
will vouche you worthye of so great
<pb facs="tcp:11097:54"/>
dignity. For trulye it is the greatest
honor, that God can bringe his elect
vnto in this mortall life: I meane to
make them his witnesses to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world,
and to make them worthye to suffer
for his sake, which thinge is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the highest Angell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
albeit I beleue they wolde more
reioyce thereof, then in all the glorye
they haue. Oh whye are we then so
loth to come to this great promotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
seing it is the verye ordinance of god
vppon all his deare chyldren, as
S. Paule affirmeth, saying: To you
it is geuen not only that you should
beleue in Iesus Christ, but also that
you should suffer for his sake. Again
he saith: all that will liue godlye in
Christ Iesu, must suffer persecution.
Oh what cause haue we to reioice, if
it please God, by suffringes to make
vs some thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of our swete Christ, who fyrste
suffred for vs, and afterward entred

world nothing so much to reioice in,
as that we are made meete to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

vs, but also that we shall reign with
Christe, and bee glorifyed together
with him, who hathe testified with
his owne mouth, that they be blessed
which suffer persecution for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
sake, for theirs (saieth he) is
the kingedome of heauen: into the
which we must also enter by manye

that endureth to thend.<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> Be faithfull
vnto death (saith the holy ghoste) &amp; I

But what mean I to make so long a

who knoweth al these things as wel

and suffering for the truth.
As for al other things, I know you
are vnspotted, praised be god for you.
Oh that you durste pledge me of the

<pb facs="tcp:11097:55"/>
the lord of our glory hath not refused
himself to drinke before vs, and hath
left vs an example to folow his fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps,
that he might crowne vs wyth

and presseth downe sore our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
that it is needful for vs to be

our helpe, and therfore we wyll not
feare what man maye do vnto vs, for
he is but fleshe, and his breath is in
hys nostrels: but the strengthe of the
lord, and the power of his word endu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth
for euer: vnto the whyche let vs
<pb facs="tcp:11097:56"/>
stedfastly trust, &amp; then shal we not be
confounded. My deare frend &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sister K. thynke no vnkyndnes in
me, that I write thus boldlye vnto
you: for verily it is of pure loue and
a true hart that I beare vnto you, as
I am most depely bound, yea double
and treble. I haue plentifully reaped
your temporal things, god reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence
you for it. And ought not I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much
more to sow vnto you some of those
spyritual thinges, wherewyth God
hath blessed me? yes truly: and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge
woe and damnation were
most due and suer vnto me, if I did it
not. God for his christes sake, forgeue
me my great neglygence in thys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
towardes you, and al the rest of
hys deare children, whome I loue
in the lord, as mine owne soule, and
thanke God most hartelye, that you
do me likewyse, whych am most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the same. God geue me the
spirite of prayer, that I maye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
supply some part of my duty to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes
you: for verily I am farre in
your debt, and so am like to die. But
<pb facs="tcp:11097:57"/>
my suer trust is, that my good God,
for whose sake I lose lyfe and goods,
and al earthly commodityes, wyl a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
recompence you wyth his
blessyng, both spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and in the ende bringe you vnto
me, in the place of perpetual ioy and
quietnes, where we shal rest from al
our labors, and remaine together for
euermore. There shall we most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
know one another personally:
thoughe in thys lyfe we are not like
to doe so, for I am alredy proclaimed
heretike at Paules crosse, I prayse
god most hartily for it. For nowe I
know I shal shortly be with him, for
whose sake I am so called: and shalbe

I thanke him for his paines. For he
hath geuen me good warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my selfe ready against the daye
of slaughter: whiche time is not yet
in their handes, for all their bragges
and proud bostinges, but in the good
wil &amp; determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my most deare
God, and louinge father. And right
<pb facs="tcp:11097:57"/>
suer I am, that they (I meane my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies)
and if al the diuels in hell do
helpe theym, can not shorten my life
one minute of an howre, otherwyse
then GOD hath appoynted, for his
glory and my eternal profit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vpon him wil I cast all my care,
&amp; be careles, according to my name,
in spite of theym all, and tell them I
will, when I come before them, that
God doth laughe al their doinges to
scorne, and shortlye wyll bringe all
their counselles to naught, to their
owne vtter confusion, if they be not
conuerted. For whiche thing let vs
praye to him, whiche onelye is able
to doe it, and wyl, when he seeth hys
good time and pleasure. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane

vs hys peace and pacience, with plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiful
consolation and ioye in the holy
ghost: who gouerne, guyds, lead and

yet once agayne I commit you vnto
Goddes moste mercyfull defence,
who euer haue you, and all youres,
in hys blessed keping. The blessinge
